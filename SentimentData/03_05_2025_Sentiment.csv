The targets include Gazprom, the massive state-owned energy company, and several other major organizations tied to natural resources and finance. Officials involved in the matter did not disclose any more names. Trump hasn’t signed the sanctions yet, but every piece is ready and waiting. One US official said plainly, “It’s totally his call.” Another added that the National Security Council is coordinating the rollout of “more punitive actions.” Trump has been growing frustrated with Putin after repeated attempts to get him to the table have failed. At first, Trump echoed Moscow’s points during the early stages of his private phone calls with Putin. Now he’s running out of patience. Trump presses harder after Putin rejects peace talks James Hewitt, spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Trump is still focused on a full and comprehensive ceasefire. Hewitt refused to say anything about current discussions behind closed doors. If Trump does approve this new sanctions package, it’ll follow the US-Ukraine minerals deal he signed on Wednesday, which was meant to be part of the peace framework. That agreement was pushed hard by Trump to show he’s taking a strong line, even as Putin ignores calls for negotiation. Since the 2022 invasion, the US and its allies have added sanctions over and over. But the Kremlin always finds ways around them. Moscow keeps making money, keeps buying weapons, and the war drags on. That’s why this new set of penalties targets Russia’s lifelines directly. Kurt Volker, who once served as Trump’s envoy to NATO and also handled Ukraine negotiations during his first term, said, “Trump has been bending over backwards to give Putin every opportunity to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to have a ceasefire and an end to the war,’ and Putin keeps rejecting him.” Volker added, “This is the next phase of putting some pressure on Russia. Putin has been escalating.” Trump, meanwhile, “has got the US and Ukraine now in alignment calling for an immediate and full ceasefire, and Putin is now the outlier.” Witkoff meets Putin again as Moscow keeps launching attacks Since returning to the Oval Office in January, Trump has been moving pieces around to try to make the Kremlin play ball. One of the biggest moves was shutting down the Justice Department task force that used to chase down sanctions violators and Russian oligarchs. He’s also made some public comments that support Russia, blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the war and calling him a “dictator.” None of those gestures worked. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special peace envoy, has taken it further. He’s been promoting a peace deal that would give four Ukrainian regions to Moscow. He’s now met Putin four times, including a visit just last week. But three days after that, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, repeated Putin’s maximum demands, and more attacks followed. Missile and drone strikes slammed into Ukrainian cities again, killing more civilians. Back in March, Reuters reported that US officials had a sanctions relief plan on the table—ready to give Russia a break if it came to the negotiating table. But that plan is dead for now. Trump’s mood has changed. Last Saturday, he met Zelenskiy in Vatican City for what both sides called a “very productive” meeting. One day later, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was “strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions and Tariffs on Russia” and said they’d stay in place until there’s a full ceasefire and a final deal. Volker also pointed out that Russia is still making serious money off oil and gas sales to India and China. He said the US could go further by using secondary sanctions, a tactic where a country punishes another country for doing business with a third one. In this case, that would mean punishing countries that keep buying from Russia. Volker said it would be “very significant” if Trump pulled that trigger.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on the other hand has successfully increased its presale raise to $7.3 million by selling 430 million tokens to 9,200 holders. Analysts have identified these cryptocurrencies because they should be considered underpriced assets among the shifting dynamics of the crypto market. The market drive of Dogecoin through memes differs from Mutuum Finance’s organized DeFi strategy though they offer distinct prospective outcomes. The reason behind investor excitement about these tokens will be examined herein for their potential discovery space. Dogecoin’s Resurgent Rally Dogecoin benefits from fresh positive energy spreading throughout its market. The cryptocurrency market response has been highly positive as Dogecoin reached $0.1828 while analysts expect this asset to climb to $1.25 by 2025. Two bullish patterns emerge from the 5-day candlestick chart which strengthens $0.1316 as a solid support level. However, the $0.20 resistance looms large. Several market conditions must be present for Dogecoin to surpass the $0.20 resistance level because market and Bitcoin price performance heavily influence its success. Dogecoin achieved significant price gains during its history but its dependence on public excitement and market moods creates uncertainty for its prolonged existence. Market participants keep their attention on Dogecoin because of its affordable starting value although they remain cautious about the price fluctuations. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) experiences rapid expansion during phase 4 of its 11-phase presale by trading at a price of $0.025. With the ongoing momentum in Mutuum Finance presale the platform has secured $7.3 million worth of investment from 9,200 participating stakeholders. Phase 5 of the presale introduces price hikes to $0.03 which will generate a 20% profit for existing phase 4 investors nearing full capacity. The tokenomics design of Mutuum Finance guarantees investors will profit by 140% during the $0.06 listing price while analysts predict the price should hit $2.50 for a total 9,900% return. Through its buy-and-distribute model Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself in DeFi while awarding substantial returns to its first members. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as a decentralized lending platform whose operations support this platform. MtETH tokens grant users who deposit assets with ETH the opportunity to earn interest accrual through time. Users obtain funding through supplying assets which exceed collateral requirements for maintaining system safety. The revenue generated by Mutuum Finance buys tokens which are used to pay rewards to stakers thus sustaining continuous market purchase demand. Mutuum Finance recently introduced a platform display that presents the 50 most dominant token holders who will obtain additional rewards when they preserve their standing thus encouraging potential investors to compete. The team will reveal smart contract audit results from Certik at social channels to build trust among investors. Seizing Undervalued Opportunities The crypto market shows diverse potential through the tokens Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Speculators aim for Dogecoin due to its low valuation and price spikes but reaching the target price of $1.25 depends on market dynamics. The ongoing phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance brings investors the opportunity to enter the DeFi space through a carefully calculated investment method that provides first launch returns of 140% followed by launch-value estimates reaching 9,900%. Investors need to hurry because the exclusive opportunity to purchase MUTM at $0.025 before phase 5 launches.

The Israeli trading platform had hit the brakes on its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) in April due to market chaos caused by Donald Trump’s new tariff policy. However, the trading and investment platform is ready to move forward with its plans, now that global macroeconomics and market conditions are improving. eToro Delays IPO Due to Market Uncertainty eToro wanted to go public in late March and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to start the process. Other big companies like JPMorgan, Binance, and Gemini are also planning to go public. However, President Trump announced new tariffs shortly after, which made the markets unstable, causing eToro to halt its plans. At the same time, other companies were also putting IPO plans on hold due to market worries. Now that the markets are calming down, and stocks like Robinhood have increased by more than 16% in the past month, eToro feels it is a better time to start its plans. The company says it may go public as soon as next week. eToro Sees Stronger Financial Results in 2024 Founded in 2007, eToro allows users to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies and copy the portfolios of successful investors. The company had planned to go public through a SPAC deal with a value of $10.4 billion, but that plan failed. This time, eToro’s business results are much better. In 2024, it earned $931 million in commissions and $192 million in profit. This is a big improvement from 2023, when it earned $639 million in commissions and only $15.3 million in profit. Details of the eToro’s IPO Offering and Overall Market Outlook eToro revealed that the IPO will be backed by major banks, including Goldman Sachs , Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup. The investment platform plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The company aims to raise its valuation above the $3.5 billion it achieved in 2023 . This funding round was backed by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and ION Group. eToro recently agreed to pay the SEC a $1.5 million fine and limit some of its crypto services in the U.S. to settle charges for offering brokerage services without a license. eToro believes the improved overall crypto market is a good sign to proceed with its IPO plans. Bitcoin (BTC) ‘s market price is now almost $100,000, which has renewed investors’ interest. Many believe crypto rules will be more relaxed with President Trump in office.

Polkadot (DOT) shows a cautious setup, facing repeated rejection near the $4.50 mark, which keeps many watchers uncertain. TRON hasn’t brought much movement either, staying locked around $0.25 for several months, with slow accumulation and no clear direction emerging. This trend echoes across several charts, where momentum tends to weaken just when it’s most needed. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out, offering a rare price of $0.0019 and a possible 2,531% gain for those entering now. While other projects hesitate, this leading decentralized platform is gaining traction as it gears up to reveal a major update tied to 10 planned exchange listings. With $222.5 million already raised, its next step appears just around the corner. Polkadot Price Remains Stuck Under $4.50 Polkadot (DOT) has had difficulty breaking through the $4.50 resistance level over the past several weeks. Following a brief uptick earlier in the month, DOT retraced to $4.09, struggling to regain upward momentum. Current market data shows DOT hovering around $4.25, with little trading volume to drive price action further. Analysts note a lack of strong catalysts or developments within the Polkadot ecosystem that could shift market sentiment in the short term. Despite its robust interoperability framework, DOT is failing to spark significant interest from the broader crypto community at present. Unless there is a major shift in development activity or partnership news, Polkadot may continue to trend sideways, constrained by persistent sell pressure just above the $4.50 mark. TRON Price Holds Steady Near $0.25 TRON (TRX) has remained in a tight price range near the $0.25 level for the past few months. Despite moments of accumulation and brief upward movement, TRX has not been able to decisively break out. The token faces continued resistance near its current levels, while the absence of large-scale updates or ecosystem shifts limits the potential for significant upward movement. Although TRON maintains a solid presence through its stablecoin infrastructure and DeFi integrations, traders appear to be waiting for a more definitive signal. The price continues to be capped by a nearby supply zone, leading to sideways action as market participants remain cautious. Without new growth triggers, TRON is likely to continue trading flat in the near term. BlockDAG Gears Up for Exchange Listings BlockDAG has officially hinted at a significant update tied to its upcoming exchange listing announcement, marking a major milestone on its path toward market entry. Speculation is swirling that this update will unveil details about 10 centralized exchange listings, expected to take place in the near future. This announcement marks the closing stages before BDAG hits public trading. All signs suggest that BlockDAG is fully prepared for this next chapter. With expectations mounting around these exchange confirmations, buyer activity is rising sharply. Currently, the coin is available for a limited time at a special price of $0.0019, down from its earlier $0.0248. This offer ends on May 13. The upcoming Batch 28 will be priced at $0.0262. This pricing tier offers a remarkable 2,520% return for those stepping in now, as BDAG prepares to launch on exchanges at $0.05. Such a return is uncommon, especially for a leading decentralized project that has already secured over $224 million in funding, moved over 19.6 billion BDAG coins, and generated over $6.9 million in miner sales, with a total of 17,232 miners sold. Interest in BlockDAG continues to grow. Rather than fading, this final stage is pulling in new attention as buyers start to realize what lies ahead. The exchange announcement is expected to narrow the gap between presale access and market trading, setting BlockDAG on a fast track toward broader adoption. Few projects earn recognition as standout crypto leaders before entering open markets, yet BlockDAG has managed to do exactly that. The $0.0019 price is scheduled to end on May 13, and with that, the opportunity to be early will close. From there, BlockDAG moves into its defining role as a next-gen decentralized platform. Market Outlook: BlockDAG Outpaces DOT and TRX While Polkadot and TRON continue their sideways movement, BlockDAG is setting a different pace. Its sharp rise in presale earnings and miner adoption signals broader traction across retail buyers and Web3 users. Unlike DOT and TRX, which are bound by resistance zones and limited news, BlockDAG is actively rolling out features, expanding its ecosystem, and preparing for major exchange launches. This divergence in activity is creating a shift in sentiment. For now, BlockDAG stands out as the project with the most immediate potential for movement, both in price and platform utility.

According to a new report by CNBC, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer is looking to launch a new crypto asset pegged to the US dollar by the end of the year as its chief executive continues to influence national crypto policies. News of the new stablecoins was confirmed by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino in an interview with CNBC. According to Ardoino, Tether – which is headquartered in El Salvador – is attempting to rebrand itself as being cooperative with law enforcement, as it was previously known as the “go-to” crypto for criminal activity. The report says that Ardoino may have helped shape key legislation, such as the GENIUS Act – a bill that aims to give clear guidelines for stablecoins – and added provisions for Tether to help law enforcement. As stated by Ardoino, according to CNBC, “There is no company… even in the traditional financial system, that has such a breadth of collaboration with law enforcement. We are always trying to do better and more to block criminal activity… we have much better tools than the traditional financial system and we’re proving that every day.” The CEO goes on to address Tether’s reserve assets, a point of contention for the firm in the past, as it agreed to pay $18.5 million to New York in 2021 after it was alleged that it lied about its reserves. “We are very close to having $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries in our reserves. We have $7 billion in excess equity within the company’s capital. That is really unprecedented and I wish financial institutions in the traditional financial system would at least try to copy us to provide better products for their consumers.” Tether, which now regularly publishes attestation statements, holds about $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries managed by the financial giant Cantor Fitzgerald, according to its latest report.

Lummis further alleged that large-scale adoption of Bitcoin would be “transformative” and put “the everyday worker all over the world in control of their money.” “As Bitcoin comes into more usage, its use makes the whole system more secure, more robust, and more capable of serving our needs all over the world,” she added. “We should be the global leader with this fantastic, new ledger-based asset that is in a digital format.” The U.S. Head Towards A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proponents of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve widely believe that it would position the U.S. as a technologically forward-looking global power while acting as a hedge against traditional financial concerns. Trump largely campaigned on enacting a crypto-friendly regulatory framework , promising to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” In March, Trump signed an executive order mandating the development of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile. “I am very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry,” he said. “Our country must be the leader in the field.” As of Friday afternoon, Bitcoin continued to experience a slight surge in value, hovering around $97,000.

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23 , roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token. “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News. Despite Lummis’ reported “pause” over the president’s actions, on May 2, she posted a video to X of herself speaking on the Senate floor, saying she was “particularly pleased” by Trump’s support of legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve in the United States. The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide, or BITCOIN, Act would seemingly codify Trump’s executive order to create a national crypto reserve. Related: House Democrats want ethics probe on Trump over crypto projects The launch of the TRUMP coin on Jan. 17 was met with outrage from many lawmakers and figures in the crypto industry, who pointed to potential conflicts of interest and implications of allowing foreign actors to channel funds directly to Trump. The criticism continued after Trump announced that a group of the top memecoin holders would have the opportunity to apply for a White House tour and dinner. “Trump once claimed he is so rich he cannot be bought,” said Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. “But his obsession with money means he apparently can be bought for a meme.” Calls for impeachment over ties to crypto Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, called for Trump’s impeachment during an April 25 town hall, claiming the memecoin dinner represented “selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him.” During his first term, Trump was impeached twice in the House of Representatives but acquitted after the Senate votes fell short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction. At the time of publication, it was unclear who, if any, of the memecoin holders would attend the May 22 dinner with Trump. Usernames from the TRUMP leaderboard have led to speculation that staunch supporters like Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be among the attendees. As of May 2, neither the individuals nor the companies have made any formal announcements.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low. Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs). Some of the disappointment among traders can be attributed to the ongoing global tariff dispute , which is beginning to affect macroeconomic data. Bitcoin traders are concerned that, despite growing interest from institutional investors, fears of an economic recession could limit price performance. This concern reduces the likelihood of BTC reaching $110,000 or higher in 2025. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch The annualized premium for Bitcoin’s two-month futures has remained between 6% and 7% over the past week, staying within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. Compared to January, when Bitcoin was trading near $95,000 and the futures premium was above 10%, traders’ sentiment has weakened. This data suggests there is less optimism, or at least less conviction, in further price gains toward $100,000 and above. Gold’s performance outshone Bitcoin’s modest gains Some market participants point to gold’s 20% rally, from $2,680 to $3,220, as a source of concern. Although Bitcoin recently surpassed silver’s $1.8 trillion market capitalization to become the seventh largest global tradable asset, gold’s surge to a massive $21.7 trillion valuation has overshadowed this achievement. Investors worry that Bitcoin’s strong correlation with the stock market has diminished the appeal of its “digital gold” narrative. Bitcoin spot US-listed ETFs daily net flows, USD. Source: CoinGlass There is also a possibility that the $3.6 billion in net inflows to US spot ETFs over the past two weeks are being driven by delta-neutral strategies. In this scenario, the flows reflect Bitcoin holders moving to listed products or using derivatives for hedging. If so, the direct impact on price would be limited, which is consistent with Bitcoin’s modest 5% gain during this period. To determine whether professional traders are comfortable with Bitcoin around $97,500, it is helpful to examine the BTC options market. Bitcoin 1-month options 25% delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch The BTC options 25% delta skew metric is currently near its lowest level since Feb. 15, indicating that whales and market makers are assigning higher odds to further upside from here. This marks a sharp reversal from three weeks ago, when put (sell) options traded at a premium. Related: Bitcoin unsure as recession looms, US-China tariff talks kick off Bitcoin derivatives’ resilience favors further BTC price gains Overall, Bitcoin derivatives indicate moderate optimism. Traders generally expect further price gains, but bulls are refraining from using leverage. Some might argue that this creates the ideal conditions for a surprise rally, especially since the retest of $74,500 on April 9 did not significantly affect BTC derivatives. The most important factor influencing Bitcoin’s performance remains the commercial relationship between the US and China. As long as the trade war continues, Bitcoin is likely to continue tracking the S&P 500 movements. While this environment may prevent Bitcoin from reaching a new all-time high in the near term, BTC derivatives are currently leaning slightly in favor of the bulls.

After jumping by over 15% in the past two weeks and stabilizing firmly above $94,000, most analysts, including Crypto Caesar , believe Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to hit new all-time highs. Despite these projections, investors are more focused on altcoins that are likely to take advantage of Bitcoin’s rebound in May. Among the top picks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out particularly due to its unique positioning as a presale AI altcoin that has raised over $2 million in just a few weeks. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Ranks As The Best Altcoin Play As Bitcoin (BTC) Rebounds Higher In anticipation of Bitcoin’s (BTC) steady ascent to $100,000, savvy investors are continually stocking up on the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token, and it’s not surprising. This new Matt Furie-inspired meme coin boasts even greater potential than the Pepe coin, poised to potentially dominate the AI crypto market upon its launch. Riding the coattails of AI technology, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has been able to blend humor with advanced tech, allowing holders to earn with its in-house utilities like its Meme-o-Matic and Floppy X . With both components supporting the creation of memes and video contents for sale, this SolidProof-approved altcoin sold out its private presale round in less than a day, raising nearly $1 million. Why FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Path To Mainstream Explosion Is Inevitable Thanks to a glowing review by popular YouTuber Nass Crypto, who described it as an AI altcoin gem with massive upside potential, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is already capturing significant attention. However, here are a few more reasons why this altcoin is bound for inevitable success: Real-Time Reaction to News & Trends: FloppyX bots instantly react to breaking events (crypto, sports, memes), guaranteeing hyper-relevant, viral content that drives engagement and visibility. Passive Income Through Holder Rewards (1% Redistribution): Investors earn simply by holding, which fosters long-term loyalty and encourages them to hold rather than sell. NFT & Staking Ecosystem Integration: Floppy-themed NFTs and staking options improve the ecosystem by adding utility, gamification, and additional income streams. Whale Accumulation Hints At Possible Breakout For Pi Network (PI) While the Pi Network’s (PI) recent pump was short-lived, optimism is peaking, as CoinGecko indicates a whopping 88% of bullish votes from 3.9 million users. For the record, Pi Network (PI) has experienced a 19% decline in trading volume, accompanied by a 15% month-long price decrease. Despite the current slump, Pi Network (PI) has seen a major vote of confidence, with the top Pi wallet recently accumulating over 50 million PI tokens. This significant whale activity signals strong trust and renewed optimism for Pi Network’s (PI) long-term potential. Now trading in a week-to-date range of $0.5741 to $0.6699, investors are closely watching Pi Network (PI), especially as Bitcoin (BTC) is turning the tide positively. Movement (MOVE) Price Volatility Demands Caution Since Movement Labs launched its beta mainnet and the Movement (MOVE) token in December 2024, which reached an all-time high (ATH) of $1.45, speculation has been brewing about its possible comeback. This speculation is driven by Movement’s (MOVE) inventive MoveVM technology and its ability to deliver high-speed transactions as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Despite ongoing losses, Movement’s (MOVE) DeFi Spring initiative —supported by a 250 million Movement (MOVE) token incentive—is setting the stage for a potential bullish reversal. Moreso, as Bitcoin (BTC) slowly gains, Movement (MOVE) could benefit from this positivity. Make The Smart Move Now! Stocking up on the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token while Bitcoin (BTC) is slowly pacing up could be the best crypto move this year. Although Pi Network (PI) and Movement (MOVE) also show potential, this new altcoin holds more intrinsic value. Aside from its inherent potential for widespread adoption and growth due to its 1% burn rate deflationary tokenomics and wildlife conservation efforts, which appeal to socially conscious investors, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is currently offering an 80% discount. So, hurry up and buy the token using the code FLOPPY80 !

This recent price action is particularly significant as it marks a clean breakout above a key on-chain resistance zone stretching from $93,000 to $95,000, which many analysts believe could determine whether Bitcoin’s next leg takes it into six-figure territory. Supporting this momentum is a long-term technical outlook by renowned trader Peter Brandt, who projected that Bitcoin remains on course to set new all-time highs, with a potential price peak exceeding $150,000 on his projected timeline. Peter Brandt Maps Timeline For $150,000 Bitcoin Top With Parabolic Structure Veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a weekly candlestick Bitcoin price chart on social media, highlighting a path toward $150,000 by late summer 2025. According to Brandt’s post on social media platform X, Bitcoin is currently trading below a parabolic trendline that is key to the final leg of the current bull cycle. Interestingly, this parabolic trendline has served as an upper resistance for Bitcoin’s price peaks and all-time highs since 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Last Leg-Up That Confirms A Resounding Rally To $150,000 Brandt’s chart captures a variety of classical technical formations, including multiple head and shoulders patterns, expanding triangles, and consolidation wedges. The breakout from the recent wedge pattern serves as his basis for suggesting that the bull market is structurally intact. According to his projection, the parabolic slope that Bitcoin needs to overcome currently sits around the $120,000 mark. A decisive breakout above this threshold would set the stage for a run-up to a cycle top. Brand noted that this cycle top would be between $125,000 and $150,000, and the timeline is by August or September 2025. On-Chain Indicators Reveal Pressure Points Around $93,000 To $95,000 On-chain data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that Bitcoin is currently testing the convergence of two critical resistance points: the 111-day simple moving average, which now sits at $91,300, and the short-term holder cost basis, which sits at $93,200. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Analyst Peter Brandt Says BTC Still Bearish Unless This Happens Notably, Bitcoin’s price structure has confirmed a higher high relative to a high of $94,000 in early May, effectively breaking the downtrend from early April. This suggests that the market may be shifting into a more aggressive accumulation phase. However, this region also represents a significant cluster of previously bought coins, meaning investors underwater during earlier pullbacks now find themselves near break-even. This could cause increased sell-side pressure if some traders take profit or exit at breakeven. Meanwhile, long-term holders continue to exhibit strong HOLDling behavior, with realized profits exceeding 350% for many. In fact, over 254,000 BTC have crossed the 155-day threshold since Bitcoin’s recent local bottom, indicating that a significant portion of the supply is maturing into long-term holdings. Many of these coins were acquired at prices above $95,000. Although current momentum clearly favours the bulls, the $93,000 to $95,000 range is a major battleground that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the months ahead of reaching Peter Brandt’s target of $150,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,635.

Lummis called for a pause on the offer as it raises ethical and legal complications. Trump is once again in the middle of controversy following his decision to host a dinner and tour for his top investors. On April 23, 2025, the organization behind the $TRUMP meme coin announced an exclusive dinner event at Trump’s National Golf Club. The top 220 holders of the $TRUMP meme coin were invited to have dinner with the President between April 23 and May 12. The top 25 holders of the coin would receive additional perks including a VIP reception and a special tour. The tour was originally tagged as a “White House Tour,” but that was later removed. Senator Cynthia Lummis urges moderation Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming is a pro-crypto legislator and a supporter of President Trump, and even she has expressed concerns about the ethical implications of the memecoin dinner offer. “This is my president that we’re talking about, but I am willing to say that this gives me pause,” she said . The memecoin dinner is even more controversial once the involvement of foreign entities in purchasing the $TRUMP coin is considered. The dinner could potentially violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting payments or gifts from foreign entities without congressional approval. Lummis said Wednesday in an interview that she believes Congress needs to regulate standards around the use of digital assets like meme coins. She has stated that she’s open to working with her colleagues to create clear regulations around digital assets for elected officials, including the president. “This is the Wild West, and so when I hear things like this, my reaction is, we need to legislate so there are rules,” Lummis said. “Even what may appear to be ‘cringey’ with regard to meme coins, it’s legal, and what we need to do is have a regulatory framework that makes this more clear, so we don’t have this Wild West scenario,” she added. While a few Senate Republicans questioned the ethics around Trump’s dinner for his top investors, most of the party’s members, like Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, stated that they were confident that the president would work within the boundaries of the law. Other GOP senators said they hadn’t heard about the president’s plan. The dinner invitation is controversial After the dinner announcement, the TRUMP memecoin experienced a surge in value and recorded an over 50% price increase and a $100 million value boost in related wallets. The $TRUMP meme coin’s total market cap increased to an impressive $2.7B. Despite the immediate benefits for Trump, the dinner invitation was met with criticism from various quarters. A number of lawmakers view the dinner as a potential conflict of interest and a messy fusion of politics with personal business. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, expressed her displeasure about the event, though she noted she didn’t have all of the details. “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” Murkowski told NBC News. The event is unpopular with other Senate Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and Adam Schiff of California, who even requested an ethics investigation into the dinner. “This latest action raises grave ethics and legal concerns, including the severe risk that President Trump and other officials may be engaging in ‘pay to play’ corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities, to include foreign nationals and corporate actors with vested interests in federal action, while personally enriching the President and his family,” the senators wrote in their letter. Sen. Jon Ossoff, took the criticism further, mentioning impeaching Trump over the meme coin dinner. Sen. Cory Booker stated that the meme coin sale is a “violation of the Constitution.” “Before you can even get to the point of discussing impeachment,” he said, “can we even get the United States Congress to step forward in saying this is wrong and we should investigate?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

However, they have limited intent or expertise for any sophisticated obfuscation of their financial trails. One of the biggest reasons criminal groups have resorted to using crypto is that it enables rapid, borderless payments, allowing their networks to move funds globally without the delays or risk linked to traditional banking systems. Why criminal groups are really using crypto Mexican cartels are one of the criminal groups out there increasingly taking advantage of crypto’s advantages. They have been observed using crypto to pay Chinese suppliers for fentanyl precursors, capitalizing on low transaction fees and instant transfers. Every single action not deliberately obfuscated on the blockchain is transparent and verifiable. Source: Chainalysis Many of these criminals operate on the common belief that crypto facilitates untraceable financial anonymity. It is actually a misconception, as every single action, not deliberately obfuscated, that happens on the blockchain is available to anyone with the know-how to see. Ironically, that misconception has been driving adoption, particularly among groups like cartels and wildlife traffickers who often reportedly use it without advanced privacy tools. The fact that so many of these bad actors have been using crypto in recent times proves that they are using it more because it is unrestricted by borders and simplifies financial operations for illicit activities, rather than because they think it grants anonymity. According to the report , this is why organized crime that capitalizes on crypto is often not sophisticated. Compared to state-backed cyber criminals like North Korean hackers who utilize advanced obfuscation methods like mixers or privacy coins e.g Monero, traditional organized crime groups just go about their business without covering their tracks. These criminals would often use regulated exchanges for cash-outs, an act that exposes their funds to KYC-compliant platforms. Good examples are cartel-linked launderers who move fentanyl proceeds through CEX accounts, leaving clear on-chain trails. It has also been observed that most groups stick to widely available cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or stablecoins, choosing to avoid privacy coins because of how complex they make things or limited liquidity. The major focus is always on scaling operations rather than evading detection because crypto’s borderless nature allows them to reach their global customer bases. It is actually good news for law enforcement The brazen use of crypto by organized crime groups for nefarious purposes, because they don’t try hard to hide, creates various opportunities for law enforcement. As earlier stated, virtually every action that happens on the blockchain can be traced because it acts like an immutable ledger. This means that investigators can trace transactions in real-time and map the criminal networks across borders, something that would have been almost impossible to do with traditional banking. The fact that criminals also rely on CEXs, which comply with KYC/AML regulations, can also help authorities identify and freeze assets as well as gather off-chain intelligence. A good example of this was when the Ledger co-founder was kidnapped and investigators were able to trace nearly all ransom funds and seize them. Unfortunately, while the blockchain offers avenues to track transactions, law enforcement faces challenges because of their limited blockchain expertise, as crypto is yet to go mainstream. While training can help more officers identify case overlaps, broader adoption is needed to properly capitalize on the transparency crypto offers. Mastering blockchain analysis will also encourage and aid proactive tracking, which will allow law enforcement to disrupt criminal networks before their crimes escalate. It is crucial this happens fast because criminals may eventually start employing more sophisticated techniques before crackdown efforts become coordinated enough.

The anticipated approval of spot Litecoin ETFs in the United States has sparked a sharp uptick in demand by institutional investors. The rise of Bitcoin (BTC) price above $95.5k in the past two days, has sparked a surge in altcoin speculation, led by Litecoin (LTC). The demand for risky crypto assets has helped LTC price signal bullish sentiment, in the near future, especially after consolidating in the past few years. According to the latest market data, LTC price surged over 14 percent in the last two weeks to trade about $87.38 on Friday, during the late North American session. Midterm Expectations for LTC Price In the weekly timeframe, LTC price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established in the past six years. Following the recent rebound, LTC price is well positioned to retest its all-time high above $359 in the near term. For leveraged crypto traders, placing a stop loss slightly below $62 and a midterm target of about $359 will present a loss-to-win ratio of 0.42 to 2.9. The midterm bullish sentiment for LTC price is bolstered by the fact that the altcoin has formed higher high and higher low since late 2022 to date. Fundamental Outlook for Litecoin Network The Litecoin network has experienced significant growth in the past few years, catalyzed by the rising demand from institutional investors. Several fund managers – led by CoinShares, Grayscale, and Canary Capital – are seeking to offer spot LTC ETFs in the United States, in the near future. As a result, the volume of larger transactions than $100k on the Litecoin network surged by $52.33 billion in the past seven days.

The research noted that there could be an 8.3x increase from the current stablecoin market cap of $234 billion in April 2025 to about $2 trillion by 2028. “Evolving market dynamics have the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach $2 trillion in market cap by 2028.” Big Predictions for Future Growth This projection assumes the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US, which would establish clear regulatory guidelines and drive market confidence and adoption. The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) defines “payment stablecoins” as digital assets redeemable at a fixed value, pegged to fiat, but non-yield-bearing. It also sets out reserve rules for stablecoin issuers. In early April 2, the US House Financial Services Committee passed the STABLE Act , which gives the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) the authority to approve and supervise “federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers.” Stablecoin reserve requirements could also drive large demand for short-dated U.S. Treasuries, it stated. Projections suggest stablecoin issuers could hold around $1 trillion in T-bills by 2028 if growth hits expectations. The Treasury also predicted that stablecoin transactions could rise from around $700 billion per month today to around $6 trillion per month by 2028, which is roughly 10% of global forex spot transactions. If regulatory clarity is achieved, stablecoins could become a mainstream financial instrument not just for crypto users, but for traditional finance, corporate treasury, and even sovereign liquidity management. Potential drivers of stablecoin growth. Source: US Treasury Dept For users in emerging markets, stablecoins provide direct access to US dollars without needing a US bank account, strengthening the currency’s global role, the report noted. Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook The current stablecoin market capitalization is $244.5 billion, which represents around 8% of the total crypto market cap, which is just over $3 trillion, according to Coingecko. The lion’s share of the stablecoin market is currently dominated by Tether, which has a 61% share with $149 billion USDT in circulation. Circle is second with $61 billion in USDC circulation, giving it a 25% market share, and decentralized USDS (formerly DAI) is third with 3% of the stablecoin market. PayPal has seen significant growth for its PYUSD stablecoin this year. However, it has less than 0.36% market share.

The yield represents both possible income and capital appreciation from Strategy’s investments in Bitcoin. With prices of Bitcoin still on the rise, the firm continues to make strategic buys of the digital currency. According to reports, Strategy has changed its business tactics in the last five years. What began as a business intelligence activity is now most famously associated with enormous Bitcoin holdings. The latest performance of the company indicates this strategy continues to work in 2025. $MSTR announces BTC Yield of 13.7% and BTC $ Gain of $5.8B year-to-date, doubles capital plan to $42B equity and $42B fixed income to purchase bitcoin, and increases BTC Yield target from 15% to 25% and BTC $ Gain target from $10B to $15B for 2025. https://t.co/LgeMEd6Dr5 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 1, 2025 Investment Plan Doubles To $84 Billion Strategy said that it will now invest $84 billion in purchasing additional Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. The company’s move is to invest half the funds ($42 billion) in fixed income and the remaining half ($42 billion) in fixed equity. This significant capital outlay indicates Strategy still has faith in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. The company considers Bitcoin a key component to its business model and a fundamental asset for its treasury holdings. The scale of this investment is a staggering increase on past expenditure. If implemented, it would leave Strategy an even more prominent corporate owner of Bitcoin than it is currently. Performance Targets Leap From 15% To 25% Strategy has increased its Bitcoin performance targets for the next year. The firm has been targeting a 15% return on its Bitcoin holdings but now anticipates 25%. Concurrently, the company raised its target for dollar gains from Bitcoin in 2025. The objective rose from $10 billion to $15 billion, implying Strategy anticipates the price and value of Bitcoin to appreciate considerably during the course of the year. Stock Price Surges More Than 3,000% Since 2020 Strategy’s stock price has risen dramatically since the company initially acquired Bitcoin five years ago.

Coinbase didn’t articulate a specific reason for the delisting , but the decision materialized a few weeks after Movement became embroiled in a controversy on another top crypto exchange. In late March, Binance banned and froze the assets of a market maker that operated for Movement. The layer-2 project’s native token launched via Binance’s Airdrops Portal in December, but Binance said that after MOVE was listed, the unnamed market maker sold approximately 66 million MOVE tokens on December 10th, with few buy orders. The market maker ended up netting a profit of $38 million worth of the stablecoin USDT before being offboarded last week. Movement uses Move, a programming language originally built by a consortium backed by tech giant Meta for the now-defunct Diem project. The language was then used to develop layer-1 blockchains Sui ( SUI ) and Aptos ( APT ). The MOVE token hit an all-time low of $0.185 at one point on Thursday. The 160th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $0.189 at time of writing and is down more than 23% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum (ETH) shows early signs of recovery after recent selling pressure, while XRP appears to be moving in line with broader Bitcoin trends. With several altcoins holding higher support levels, the market looks ready for fresh rallies in the coming weeks. As legacy assets like ETH and XRP attract renewed interest, early-stage projects with real innovation are also gaining traction. BlockDAG (BDAG) , in particular, is emerging as a top contender. Backed by a powerful tech stack and strong community support, BlockDAG has now raised over $224 million in its ongoing presale. Its unique architecture and consistent momentum are positioning it as one of the most promising breakout cryptos in today’s market. Ethereum (ETH) Targets $3500 as Bulls Regain Ground Ethereum (ETH) is facing tough resistance, but buyers are stepping back in after a period of selling pressure. While short-term volatility remains, analysts still expect a move toward $3500 if Ethereum can hold above key moving averages. The recent dip came from market-wide uncertainty and profit-taking following earlier gains. Now, technical signs are starting to shift. Momentum is showing signs of stabilizing, and buyers are gradually returning. Ethereum’s strong position in DeFi and NFTs continues to build long-term trust. As breakout trends develop, Ethereum’s path to $3500 could act as a major signal of strength across the altcoin market. XRP Prepares for 8% Upswing XRP is showing signs of a potential 8% move upward, closely tracking Bitcoin’s recent recovery trend. Analysts note that XRP often mirrors Bitcoin during bounce-back periods, and current charts suggest that history could repeat itself. Support levels have stayed firm, and rising trading volumes hint at growing bullish momentum. While long-term concerns around XRP’s legal status remain in play, short-term traders are focusing on technical signals. If Bitcoin continues its upward path, XRP could follow with a similar lift. For buyers looking for quick breakout plays, XRP is shaping up to be a strong candidate with calculated upside potential. BlockDAG Is Not Just Rising: It’s Leading the Future of Crypto BlockDAG is quickly becoming a standout project in the crypto space, offering real solutions to long-standing scalability problems. Unlike traditional blockchains that validate transactions one at a time, BlockDAG uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to process many transactions in parallel. This results in faster speeds and higher capacity, without compromising on decentralization. As more industries look for scalable solutions in payments, gaming, and DeFi, BlockDAG’s setup is proving to be well-timed and highly relevant. Its ongoing presale success is adding serious weight to its momentum. BlockDAG has now raised over $224 million in Batch 28, with the BDAG coin priced at just $0.0262. However, BDAG is offering a special price of $0.0019 till May 13th and is gaining viral traction. Since the start of batch 1, BDAG has seen a massive 2520% surge, and over 19.5 billion coins have already been sold. Adding to the buzz, miner sales have crossed $6.9 million, with 17,232 miners sold. Strategic tools like the “Buyer Battles” feature are also helping BlockDAG grow a strong and competitive early community. Looking ahead, BlockDAG isn’t just relying on a strong presale. The team has ambitious post-launch plans, including listings on 10 major centralized exchanges after the mainnet launches in 2025. A partnership with HackerEarth aims to bring in over 10,000 developers, expanding the ecosystem with fresh ideas and real-world use cases. By focusing on real scalability, rewarding early users, and growing a developer-friendly environment, BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than just a trending crypto. It’s building the foundation needed to power the next wave of blockchain adoption. For those seeking early access to a project with clear utility and strong momentum, BlockDAG is becoming top crypto presale that’s hard to ignore. Final Thoughts Ethereum (ETH) remains on track for a potential push toward $3500, with market bulls slowly regaining control after recent sideways movement. XRP is also showing promise, with analysts projecting an 8% rebound closely linked to Bitcoin’s momentum across the altcoin space. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to stand out. With its powerful scalability model and an impressive $224 million raised in presale, it is emerging as a serious contender in the breakout crypto space. As more buyers look beyond legacy coins for high-upside opportunities, BlockDAG’s growth story becomes harder to ignore. Its strong fundamentals and surging community interest suggest it may not just be the next big crypto, it could be the one to lead the next market cycle.

It is about how that asset performs. As buyers hunt for projects with real utility, XRP and Pepe coin both grab headlines through ETF advances and community-driven momentum. XRP builds strength with institutional backing and legal wins, while Pepe coin thrives on meme culture and viral support. Yet Unstaked’s $UNSD offers something different and tangible. Through its presale, it brings AI agents that act on behalf of users in real-time, delivering measurable on-chain results. If you are searching for the best crypto for 2025, Unstaked ’s functional, working utility makes it hard to ignore. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Tailwinds Offer Hope XRP’s recent fall to $2.07 reflects broader market stress, yet a 15% weekly gain keeps optimism alive. A wave of exchange inflows, topping 55 million XRP, signals mounting sell pressure, leading to more than $5.1 million in liquidations within a day. Even with this pressure, XRP’s deep liquidity remains a key strength, especially as U.S. spot crypto ETF conversations heat up. Teucrium’s new leveraged XRP ETF and Grayscale’s pending application, facing a May 22 SEC decision, add excitement to XRP’s outlook. A pending settlement with the SEC could speed up ETF approvals. Technically, XRP is holding above $2.00 with backup support at $1.95 and $1.64. Resistance levels sit at $2.24 and $2.38. While short-term dips remain possible, ETF momentum and legal clarity keep the XRP price prediction positive for 2025. Inside Pepe Coin’s Growing Ecosystem Pepe coin is building more than just a meme-driven hype machine. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, it uses a deflationary model that cuts supply with every transaction, creating more scarcity. A rewards system returns transaction fees to holders, making long-term ownership more appealing. Plus, it does all this without applying extra transaction taxes, keeping it simple to use. What really drives Pepe coin’s success is its strong tie to internet culture. Rooted in the famous Pepe the Frog meme, the project built a lively community across X, Telegram, and Reddit. Projects like the Pepe Academy and merchandise lines also boost community loyalty. On the technical side, its Ethereum base gives it easy access to apps, wallets, and DeFi tools. Together, the Pepe coin ecosystem shows how culture and blockchain can blend to create something unique in the digital space. $UNSD Presale Sparks Rush: Unlock Monetized AI Ownership Now Unstaked is changing what digital ownership means. With $UNSD now available in presale stage 2 for just $0.006695, early buyers are not just getting a token. They are unlocking the chance to deploy real AI agents across X and Telegram. These are not basic bots. Each AI agent works on its own, posting, engaging users, adapting in real time, and building communities 24/7 while linking all its work directly to the owner on-chain. The massive potential on offer with the network has been on display with the presale seeing more than a million in inflows in just a matter of days. More than that, these AI agents are built to earn. Owners collect $UNSD rewards based on their agent’s actual performance, thanks to the on-chain “Proof of Intelligence” system. As agents get better, their owners can earn even more. With no middlemen and full transparency, $UNSD holders are part of a growing ecosystem focused on results, not promises. At launch, $UNSD is set to reach around $0.1819, meaning the current presale price could deliver major returns. Unlike many early-stage projects that promise future plans, Unstaked gives buyers working AI agents, instant rewards, and community governance from the start. This unique blend of utility, rewards based on output, and full AI ownership puts $UNSD on the map as a top choice among the best cryptos for 2025. For traders ready to move beyond hype and into real earning systems, Unstaked offers a rare early entry into an AI-driven digital economy where users control the future. Real Utility Is the New Standard Speculation can catch attention, but real, lasting value comes from true utility and empowering users. XRP’s legal wins and ETF hopes open new doors for institutions, while Pepe Coin rides strong on meme energy and a loyal online community. Still, Unstaked stands apart by giving users active control. Instead of waiting for charts to move, $UNSD holders deploy AI agents that create on-chain value from day one. As traders hunt for the best crypto for 2025 , the ability to own and operate real digital assets may become the real difference. In the next wave, the projects that offer action over waiting will lead, and Unstaked is already delivering the tools to make that happen.

New York’s Governor and state lawmakers say they’ve agreed on a budget framework that includes $2 billion for inflation refund checks to over eight million taxpayers. The plan targets New Yorkers who filed taxes, are not claimed as dependents and earn below $150,000 annually. Eligible joint filers earning up to $150,000 will receive $400, while those earning between $150,000 and $300,000 will get $300. Single filers and heads of household earning up to $75,000 will receive $200, and those earning between $75,000 and $150,000 will get $150. No application is needed and checks will be issued automatically using recent tax filings once the budget is passed and signed into law in about a week from today. New York’s Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul says the rebates as a response to inflation-driven costs, reports News10 ABC. “I can’t stop inflation, but everyone across the state paid more because inflation drove up prices.” But the program has its critics. Democratic Assemblymember Phil Steck says such programs are gimmicks, arguing for long-term tax relief or other spending priorities.

During its current Phase 4 investors can purchase tokens for $0.025 while they stand to gain 140% when the price reaches $0.06 at listing. Upcoming phase 5 brings forward the pre-set price increase to $0.03 which requires immediate attention from potential gain seekers. This structured lending and buyback system installed within the DeFi project positions it for admission into the top-20 crypto market rankings during 2025 while setting itself apart from meme-driven tokens. The project shows strong evidence it might accomplish better performance than Shiba Inu along with Stellar. Here’s why. Robust Lending Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its market position through a combined lending operation. Lenders get added protection through borrowers who place collateral assets that surpass the value of their loans. Pool depositors who back liquidity receive annual percentage yield of up to 10% through their contributions. The platform generates interest-bearing mtTokens including mtETH for ETH participants in its system. This system fosters stability, unlike volatile meme coins. Team members have submitted smart contracts to CertiK for audit review which they intend to publicly announce through social media. This transparency bolsters trust. The declining availability of Phase 4 tokens creates an attractive environment for investors to seek reliable opportunities at Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Strategic Buyback Mechanism Many investors choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its buy-and-distribute system which draws them in. Fees from the platform buy regular MUTM tokens which are then distributed among holders of mtTokens. The constant purchasing pressure from investors prevents mass selling and helps the price keep growing. During Phase 4 when buyers purchase MUTM for $0.025 they will receive a 20% gain once Phase 5 arrives at $0.03 while achieving a 140% ROI at the $0.06 listing price. According to industry analysis Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reach $3 after its launch creating an 11.900% profit potential. The MUTM platform launched its top 50 holder dashboard to give bonus tokens as appreciation for their ranking positions. Official loyalty programs help strengthen the project because loyal users enjoy additional rewards that drive its overall upward pattern. Community-Driven Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuels intense interest by distributing $100,000 in which ten investors obtain $10,000 worth of tokens each. Participation levels rise through referral programs that give additional rewards to recruits. Users who join early staking pools and governance structures develop enhanced involvement levels because of their privileged access. The rapid sell-out in Phase 4 underscores the intense market demand for the project as over 430 million tokens have found buyers. The upcoming stablecoin from the project uses collateralization means to deliver dependable service based on the Ethereum network. The initiatives at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) develop a dynamic user base that eclipses generic utility-less tokens thereby positioning the platform for rapid expansion. Surging Toward the Top Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will supplant both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Stellar (XLM) as its ascends into the top 20 rankings. The combination between a lending model and community incentives and a buyback strategy makes this offering formidable. The $3 price prediction for 2025 underscores its potential. The near conclusion of Phase 4 token sale has opened a short period in which investors must purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025. The project’s emphasis on stability and utility provides strong reasons for becoming a superior alternative compared to speculative coin investments. People looking for high-return decentralized finance opportunities must take notice of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Review its current services because this rising investment opportunity needs your commitment.

With Bitcoin trading firmly above $60,000 and altcoins gaining traction, several projects are showing signs of major growth. What’s different this time is that real progress, not just hype, is driving investor decisions. This is opening space for both new and established names to break out based on fundamentals and technology. For those looking for a blend of early access and strong ecosystems, now is a good time to focus. Whether it’s AI-powered innovation, new exchange-traded products, or growing on-chain utility, here is a breakdown of the top crypto to buy in 2025 based on the latest updates from April. 1. Unstaked’s Presale Picks Up Speed with Strong Demand Unstaked is making a name for itself as one of the top crypto to buy in 2025, especially for those watching real-world tech and long-term returns. The platform is designed for users to deploy AI agents post-launch that will help manage communities, post content, and engage across platforms like Telegram, Discord, and X. These agents will function within Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence system, which verifies and rewards helpful activity transparently. Currently, the presale is in Stage 2 at a price of $0.006695, with a projected listing price of $0.1819. This creates an estimated return of more than 2700% for early participants. The project has already raised over $1 million in less than a week, with strong public interest and no allocations to venture capital. Unstaked’s roadmap includes future features like NFT-based upgrades and cross-platform integrations continuing into 2026. With a low barrier to entry and no coding needed to use its AI tools, it appeals to a wide range of users. For those who want a presale with active development and growing attention, Unstaked is a standout pick in the top crypto to buy in 2025. 2. XRP Gains Ground as ETFs and Futures Hit the Market XRP is making strong moves in 2025, supported by a major wave of institutional interest. Three XRP futures ETFs from ProShares are set to go live on April 30, with CME Group launching XRP futures contracts just weeks later in May. These updates are increasing access to XRP through regulated investment vehicles, which could push demand higher. XRP is trading near $2.23 and showing strong market activity, with resistance zones at $2.74 and $3.00. Inflows have increased, with over $37 million added to XRP-focused funds. As legal clarity around the asset improves, more firms are starting to engage with XRP, and its partnership with Ripple is still central to cross-border payment development. Mid-range predictions suggest a price of $5 is within reach if momentum continues. For investors interested in the top crypto to buy in 2025, especially those tracking ETFs and futures growth, XRP remains a reliable option backed by strong developments. 3. Dogecoin Builds Toward Its Next Big Move Dogecoin continues to regain strength even as Elon Musk reduces his public commentary. Although the price dipped slightly, DOGE has still gained 6.66% over the last month and is now trading near $0.179 with a market cap close to $25.6 billion. The Fear and Greed Index is holding at 65 (Greed), which shows strong market sentiment. Adding to the excitement are new “Doge dividend” incentives introduced for Tesla shareholders and early Dogecoin users. Short-term price expectations suggest DOGE could rise to $0.195 soon, with May targets between $0.22 and $0.25. For the long term, estimates suggest the coin might reach $10 by 2032 if consistent growth continues. Dogecoin stands out as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025 for those who believe in the ongoing power of online communities, upcoming payment use cases, and growing speculation around ETF potential. 4. Cardano Grows With Focus on Digital Identity Cardano is increasing its focus on practical use cases, especially through the release of Veridian, a new platform for blockchain-based digital identity. ADA is trading at about $0.694 and has seen a 6.14% gain in the past month. Its current market cap is around $25 billion. Cardano also got a policy boost after the U.S. government named it as one of the assets in a planned national crypto reserve, alongside BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP. Near-term projections expect ADA to test $0.756, with stable support seen between $0.662 and $0.838. Over a longer horizon, forecasts point to a possible rise toward $10.29 by 2031. For investors who want the top crypto to buy in 2025 based on network progress and increased adoption, Cardano is holding its place as a strong option. With expanding governance systems and ecosystem growth, ADA looks prepared for solid performance in the coming year. Final Thoughts The race to find the top crypto to buy in 2025 is picking up speed as fresh news, partnerships, and upgrades fuel movement across the market.

Large ETH holders have increased their positions, reversing a long-term downtrend in wallet concentration. On-chain data suggests growing investor confidence despite subdued trading volumes and ongoing market caution. Ethereum (ETH) continues to flow out of centralized exchanges at a significant rate. Over the past seven days alone, net outflows surpassed $380 million, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. This reduction in exchange-held ETH reflects growing investor accumulation into self-custody and could point to a tightening supply narrative that has historically preceded price rallies. ETH Accumulation Persists Despite Price Volatility Data shows Ethereum’s net flows from exchanges were consistently negative between April 24 and May 1, with a particularly large outflow recorded on April 26. This behavior suggests that investors took advantage of short-term price dips to buy and withdraw ETH into self-custody. Despite price fluctuations during the week, ETH ended the period on a positive note, climbing back above $1,840.

The current price action signals a potential shift, with volatility compressing and momentum building for a major move in either direction. After months of selling pressure and weak performance relative to Bitcoin, analysts now believe ETH is approaching a critical inflection point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy 100 Million DOGE In 24 Hours – Demand Signals Growing Confidence Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a key technical observation, highlighting the formation of a long-legged Doji candle on Ethereum’s monthly timeframe. This type of candle typically reflects intense market indecision, where both bulls and bears tested the extremes, but neither side gained clear control by the close. It’s often seen near major turning points, especially after prolonged downtrends or consolidations. If Ethereum can reclaim the $2,000 level in the coming sessions, it would confirm bullish intent and open the door to a stronger rally. On the other hand, failure to hold above $1,750 could trigger renewed downside pressure, possibly retesting deeper support zones. For now, ETH remains trapped in a tight range, but the technical setup and market structure suggest that a decisive breakout could soon define Ethereum’s path for the weeks ahead. Ethereum Key Resistance Levels Limit Upside Ethereum has been trading below the $2,000 level since late March, and this prolonged consolidation signals a market still searching for direction. Despite bouncing from local lows, ETH remains over 55% down from its December highs, reflecting the broader weakness in the altcoin market. Bulls have managed to hold the $1,800 level, but a sustained breakout above supply-heavy zones like $2,000–$2,100 is required to confirm any meaningful reversal. In the short term, Ethereum has started to build a more bullish structure, with higher lows forming across intraday charts. This suggests that bulls are gradually reclaiming control, though the pressure from sellers remains strong. Volume continues to thin out during upward moves, and without a decisive breakout, price may continue to chop sideways or revisit lower support zones near $1,700 or $1,550. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with analysts closely watching technical signals for confirmation. Pillows pointed out that ETH recently formed a long-legged Doji candle on the monthly chart—a rare formation that often signals market indecision or the beginning of a trend reversal. If this candle marks a turning point, Ethereum may be preparing for a breakout. However, until bulls reclaim key resistance, the risk of a move into lower demand zones remains very real. Related Reading: HYPE Confirms Strength With Solid Throwback Response – Bullish Reversal? ETH Price Consolidates as Bulls Eye Breakout Ethereum is currently trading at $1,830, holding firm after several days of tight consolidation between $1,750 and $1,850. This narrow range has defined recent price action, as bulls and bears remain locked in a standoff near key resistance. For bulls to maintain control and confirm a reversal structure, a decisive breakout above the $1,850 level is critical. Reclaiming the $2,000 zone would likely spark renewed buying momentum and shift short-term sentiment in favor of the upside. However, the longer ETH stays capped below resistance, the greater the risk of a breakdown. If bulls fail to push above the $1,850 level soon, selling pressure may intensify. A loss of support at $1,750 could open the door for a move back toward the $1,700 zone. Further weakness from there could drag ETH down to retest the $1,500 level, where demand previously stepped in. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Candle Reclaims Key Levels – Is $240 The Next Target? With macroeconomic uncertainty still weighing on markets and Ethereum underperforming relative to Bitcoin, traders are watching closely for a decisive move.

First, SEI finds itself at the center of legal battles tied to its troubled acquisition of Solaris Energy. Meanwhile, the MANA price rally is drawing attention after Decentraland’s token surged to its highest level in two months, prompting fresh interest from traders. However, the biggest story continues to be BlockDAG (BDAG) , which has demonstrated incredible growth during its presale. Moving from $0.001 to $0.0262 per coin, it has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The project’s presale success has been nothing short of remarkable, and with over $224 million raised and 19.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s momentum is gaining speed. With over 10 exchange listings on the horizon, some analysts predict that the next big move for BlockDAG could be a jump to $1. Its rapidly growing community and the upcoming exchange listings have many calling it the best crypto to watch in 2025. SEI Faces Legal Pressure Over Solaris Energy Deal In an unexpected twist for SEI, a class action lawsuit has been filed against the company, alleging it misled investors about the potential of its recent acquisition, Solaris Energy. The acquisition involved Mobile Energy Rentals LLC, a company that allegedly failed to establish a solid foundation in the energy leasing sector. To make matters worse, one of MER’s co-owners has a history of fraud, casting a shadow over the acquisition. The lawsuit claims that SEI overestimated the value of MER’s mobile turbine rental business and that the financial reporting was flawed. Investors who purchased SEI securities between July 9, 2024, and March 17, 2025, may be eligible to join the class action. Rosen Law Firm, which is handling the case, is encouraging affected parties to act quickly and consider taking on lead plaintiff roles, with a deadline of May 27, 2025. This unfolding situation could have significant consequences for the company’s future and could continue to shape investor sentiment as the case progresses. MANA Price Rally: Decentraland Hits Two-Month High Decentraland’s MANA token has been gaining serious momentum, jumping by over 10% in just one day. This surge pushed the token to a two-month high of $0.31, prompting many analysts to look closely at the token’s performance. The price spike comes at a time when the Metaverse is back on the radar for many crypto enthusiasts, and MANA is one of the standout players. On-balance volume indicators are also suggesting that the price hike has strong backing, as demand for the token continues to climb. The technical outlook is promising, with MANA consistently trading above its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), signaling short-term bullish momentum. A solid trendline of support is also in place, meaning buying pressure remains strong. If this pattern holds, there’s potential for MANA to push further toward $0.44, although analysts caution that downside risks could send the price down to around $0.19 if the trend falters. BlockDAG’s $224M Presale Success – Aiming for $1 Post-Listing BlockDAG’s presale success has been remarkable, drawing significant attention in the crypto space. Initially priced at $0.001, the coin has surged to $0.0262 in Batch 27, marking an incredible 2,380% increase. Over $224 million has been raised to date, and more than 19.5 billion coins have been sold. BlockDAG offers coins at $0.0019 for a limited time , further fueling demand and creating a sense of urgency among buyers. The pace of sales has quickened with each batch, reflecting increasing interest in the project. As BlockDAG prepares for its upcoming exchange listings, analysts believe these could act as a springboard for a price jump, potentially reaching $1. Plans are already in motion for BlockDAG to be listed on over 10 centralized exchanges, which will likely lead to higher visibility, increased trading volumes, and broader market access. Analysts following the project are confident that these listings could trigger another surge in price, given the project’s already impressive track record. BlockDAG’s growing community is another key factor driving its success. With over $6.9 million in miner sales and 17,232 crypto miners sold, the project has built strong engagement from its user base. This solid foundation positions BlockDAG as a crypto project to watch closely, with the potential for substantial growth once it launches on exchanges. The Takeaway: BlockDAG Takes Center Stage As the legal drama surrounding SEI unfolds, and the MANA rally continues to capture the spotlight, BlockDAG is emerging as one of the most exciting crypto prospects. With a remarkable 2,380% surge in presale price and over $224 million raised, BlockDAG is gearing up for what could be a game-changing entry into the crypto market. The project’s listing on centralized exchanges is fast approaching, and many analysts believe this could be the catalyst for the next big price jump, potentially reaching $1. The clock is ticking for anyone looking to get in at the current price of $0.0019, as the opportunity to buy at these levels may not last much longer. BlockDAG has quickly positioned itself as one of the top crypto projects to watch for 2025 and beyond.

But now, their momentum has stalled, with prices trapped in tight ranges and investors questioning their long-term utility. Beneath the noise, a new contender is emerging: RCO Finance (RCOF) . Armed with $7.5M in venture capital and over 285,000 users, RCOF aims to disrupt the status quo. Rather than leaning on hype or slow upgrades, RCOF is tapping into AI-driven finance tool, something ADA and SOL haven’t quite managed. Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL): What Went Wrong? Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) were once hailed as Ethereum killers, promising scalability, speed, and institutional adoption. But the moments of massive gains driven by community hype and big promises are long gone. Now, ADA and SOL face moments of setbacks. Even with the Vasil upgrade on Cardano , ADA’s price hovers between $0.5 and $0.7 , far from its $3 peak. Solana also continues to deal with repeated network outages and speculative meme-driven spikes. Even with their strong communities, both platforms have hit a wall in their growth. The real issue for ADA and SOL is that they rely heavily on hype and incremental updates. Investors nowadays look for platforms that deliver tangible benefits; tools that can help them navigate market volatility, not just speculative potential. Now they’re eyeing projects like RCO Finance, which offer practical, real-world solutions. Why VCs Are Betting Big on RCO Finance The $7.5M VC investment in RCO Finance signals a shift in crypto’s evolution. Institutions aren’t just chasing hype, they’re backing real innovation.

In line with RCO Finance’s mission to remove traditional barriers to investing, the platform enables trading across a broad range of markets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, forex, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies, all within a unified experience. User-friendly features such as the Smart Portfolio Management simplify the process of managing diverse investments.

Finally, RCO Finance prioritises user privacy and security. Its non-KYC approach preserves decentralisation, while the SolidProof audit independently verifies the platform’s reliability. This unique combination of AI-driven insights, broad asset availability, intuitive tools, strong token incentives, and a commitment to user autonomy positions RCO Finance to potentially outpace traditional crypto giants like ADA and SOL Last Chance to Buy RCOF Before Prices Climb While Cardano and Solana stumble, RCO Finance is gaining rapid momentum.

Big names like Chainlink have experienced their peaks, leaving many to wonder if the window for significant returns has already closed. Yet, a new player is on the scene, with a promise that could redefine how the crypto market operates: Qubetics ($TICS). As the world continues to search for the next big opportunity, Qubetics is flying under the radar, quietly positioning itself to outperform the likes of Chainlink, Solana, and other previous crypto giants. Those who missed Chainlink’s peak should be paying attention right now—Qubetics might be the next big opportunity. Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem offering tools that many earlier projects failed to deliver. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network was revolutionary, but its scalability and real-world applicability didn’t quite meet the expectations of every market segment. Fast forward to 2025, and Qubetics is changing the game. With its presale in full swing and token prices still at a manageable $0.2093, those entering now could see returns that surpass anything seen before. Its suite of solutions, including QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, promises to solve real-world problems and drive massive adoption. Chainlink: The Missed Opportunity of a Lifetime Chainlink’s rise was nothing short of meteoric. It became one of the most popular crypto assets, with a unique proposition—decentralized oracles bridging blockchain networks with real-world data. While this was groundbreaking, it faced challenges in scaling and widespread adoption. Many believed that Chainlink would revolutionize the financial industry, yet its actual impact fell short of expectations in certain sectors. For those who hopped on the Chainlink train too late, the high returns have become a thing of the past. Once the market priced in Chainlink’s utility, it became clear that the opportunity to reap the greatest rewards had passed. If you didn’t get in during the early stages, waiting for another shot at big returns seemed futile. But now, with Qubetics entering the scene, those who missed out on Chainlink’s peak have another shot at a massive win. Qubetics: The New Star in the Crypto Sky Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a revolution in the making. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics focuses on providing solutions that cater to a wide range of real-world problems, something that other projects couldn’t fully address. Whether you’re a developer, business owner, or someone who simply believes in the future of decentralized technologies, Qubetics has something for everyone. Right now, Qubetics is in its 32nd presale stage, with over 510 million tokens already sold. The presale has raised over $16.6 million, and with over 25,600 holders, the demand is skyrocketing. At $0.2093 per token, the opportunity is still affordable, but time is running out. Analysts predict that $TICS will reach $1, offering a 377% ROI, $5, offering a 2288% ROI, and could even hit $15 after the mainnet launch, resulting in a staggering 7066% ROI. Qubetics Application: Solving Real-World Problems Qubetics isn’t just another crypto token; it’s a tool for revolutionizing industries. One of its standout features is the Qubetics application, which is set to change how businesses, professionals, and everyday individuals interact with blockchain technology. Imagine a developer building decentralized applications (dApps) who needs seamless blockchain interaction but is hindered by the complexity of other platforms. Enter Qubetics. With the Qubetics IDE and QubeQode, developers can quickly code, test, and deploy decentralized applications with ease. The Qubetics ecosystem takes care of the underlying complexity, allowing developers to focus on what matters most: innovation. But it’s not just for developers.

Currently in the sixth stage of a successful presale, RCO Finance has generated considerable excitement through the launch of innovative artificial intelligence (AI) products and features designed for both institutional and retail investors. Major Institutions Set To Join RCOF’s Token Presale A major venture capital firm has put $7.5 million into the platform, therefore enhancing its roadmap and upgrading the beta platform just revealed, providing early access to RCOF’s ecosystem before its scheduled launch later this year. $17 million have also been raised so far, attracting the attention of major institutions and suggesting that even more may join the token presale in the future, raising RCOF’s value and possible price. Traders on the beta platform will be in to boost profits, lower risks, and discover new opportunities across more than 100,000 assets in global markets using artificial intelligence technology, including its own Robo Advisor. Using a combination of artificial intelligence, creative features, and advanced trading tools, traders can significantly raise their winning rates and portfolios, which offers huge profit potential. The Power Of RCO Finance’s AI-Driven Robo Advisor Operating as an investment manager, the Robo Advisor personalizes trading and investing suggestions to users’ individual goals. It creates personalized investing strategies and modifies asset allocations based on machine learning algorithms. Its adaptability to changing market conditions—whether bullish or bearish—enables the platform to seize profitable opportunities and execute trades at the most advantageous moments. For instance, the Robo Advisor can predict trends, identify when a popular memecoin or cryptocurrency is likely to have significant price fluctuations, and then trade appropriately to maximize earnings. This means that only people engaged in the RCO Finance token presale will have the opportunity to benefit from these market insights going forward, with the potential to turn tiny investments into millions in record time. Potential 400% Returns Await Early Investors Aside from the Robo Advisor, the RCO Finance team has added several features to its token presale features. Among other asset classes—including crypto, stocks, bonds, and commodities—the recently launched AI-Powered Dashboard provides market transparency. An Instant Deposit System lets account financing directly from connected bank cards, while a Demo Trading Environment offers risk-free simulated trading across all asset classes. Through Telegram and X (formerly Twitter), users may also monitor their portfolio performance and get real-time notifications. When combined with the Robo Advisor, this creates the ideal setting for optimal transactions. These features have prompted analysts to optimize their projections for RCOF. Early backers are already enjoying returns of 1,000%, and experts predict that, once these products are fully launched and RCOF is listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs), the token’s value could surge from $0.13 to approximately $0.60, resulting in potential returns of nearly 400% for those who hold the altcoin for a brief period. Looking ahead, the RCO Finance team plans to unveil a new set of features in the second quarter of the year for its token presale participants, which, combined with institutional support, could further elevate these projections, offering even greater profit potential. Now’s The Time To Invest According to the platform’s token presale roadmap, users can anticipate the launch of AI-Powered Simulated Trading, which will enable demo users to compare manual trades against AI-executed strategies. A Demo Trading Leaderboard will rank the top 50 demo traders by profit rise, hence promoting competition and skill development. Users will be provided by In-Depth Trade Performance Analytics a whole package to review their trading history. Furthermore, Calendar-Based P/L Tracking would provide performance measurement across many timeframes; CRM Sync and User Behavior Tracking will enhance customised onboarding and participation. Moreover, the inclusion of an artificial intelligence trading indicator will provide real-time notifications for overbought or oversold conditions, so alerting users to unusual market trends. Given this, together with the robust tokenomics of the protocol intended to enhance incentives, accessibility, and discounts within the RCO Finance ecosystem, now is the time to engage in RCOF’s token presale. Apart from continuous smart contract audits for global compliance, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure your financial future by simple registration in a know-your-customer (KYC)-free environment that respects privacy and security. Don’t miss this chance; buy RCOF tokens at a significant discount before they take off.

This bullish shift comes after April closed in the green, reclaiming technical levels and signaling the potential for a significant move toward the six-figure price territory. Market expert Titan Of Crypto has announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin has officially hit a local bottom. The analyst shared a chart showcasing that Bitcoin is flashing one of the strongest bullish signals. Bitcoin Price Establishes Solid Local Bottom According to the Ichimoku Cloud analysis, BTC’s price has closed firmly above the Tenkan (red line), Kijun (blue line), and Kimo cloud. All of these Ichimoku lines are sloping upwards, reinforcing that Bitcoin’s momentum and trend structure are aligned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Raging Bull Indicator Turns Back On, But This Level Holds The Key A close above the Tenkan signals short-term bullish momentum, while the Kijun confirms strength in a medium-trend. The thick Kimo cloud represents the most bullish configuration, indicating clear trend dominance. Furthermore, when Bitcoin closes above all Ichimoku lines, it establishes a dynamic support or resistance zone, validating the overall bullish structure. Adding more weight to this bullish signal, Titan of Crypto revealed that Bitcoin has reclaimed the April high, a key resistance level of around $95,173, which is now acting as a support area. The rectangular zone highlighted as “the local bottom” on the chart reflects price action between February and April 2025, where BTC formed a higher low above the Kijun. The bullish April monthly candle close above this zone officially establishes this region as a strong foundational support, which validates the possibility of a local bottom from a technical standpoint. With the local bottom confirmed and momentum on its side, Bitcoin could be headed to the next likely resistance area, marked on the chart as the “Next Point of Interest.” This area sits above the $110,000 region, near $115,000. For this bullish scenario to play out, BTC must maintain its position above the April high and the Kijun as dynamic support. Bulls will need to defend any retracements toward these zones to preserve momentum. Failure to do so could lead to a deeper correction, effectively invalidating the bullish outlook. BTC Price Action Looks Strong In a more recent X post, Titan of Crypto announced that Bitcoin is breaking out of a tight range and its price action looks strong. He shared an Ichimoku Cloud analysis of the cryptocurrency, showing a potential bullish breakout setup on the 1-day timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Golden Cross That Only Happens Once Every Cycle, What To Expect Looking at the price chart, Bitcoin has been consolidating between $92,880 and $95,800 over the past several days, but momentum appears to be building for a potential breakout.

As bullish sentiment returned, the total crypto market cap climbed almost 3.5% to stabilise around $3.11 trillion on Friday. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index cooled off after hitting a multi-month high of 72 last week, but still closed the current week in “greed” at 67, suggesting that some caution remains. The altcoin sector saw more modest action compared to Bitcoin, with most top cryptocurrencies giving up last week’s gains, and only a handful managing to hold on to double-digit returns. Altcoin trading remained relatively muted, hinting that traders were still sitting on the sidelines, weighing macro cues before making riskier bets. Why is Bitcoin going up? Macroeconomic data dominated sentiment through the week, keeping Bitcoin rangebound as traders waited for clarity on the Fed’s next move. The first catalyst came midweek with the release of US PCE inflation data, which showed no month-on-month growth and a continued decline in core PCE to 2.6%, its lowest reading in nearly a year. The figures were stable, but not soft enough to justify an immediate rate cut, prompting a brief dip in crypto prices. The cautious mood deepened after fresh labour market data showed signs of cooling. ADP’s private payroll report came in well below expectations, while first estimates for Q1 GDP revealed a surprise 0.3% contraction. The downturn was largely driven by a spike in imports ahead of Trump’s new tariff wave, reinforcing investor concerns around slowing growth and elevated trade tensions. However, sentiment began to recover on Friday following a statement from China’s commerce ministry expressing openness to trade talks with the US. The news sparked optimism across global markets, lifting Bitcoin past $97,000 as hopes for de-escalation in the ongoing tariff standoff gained traction. Momentum strengthened further after April’s nonfarm payrolls beat expectations, easing fears of a deeper slowdown. While the Fed is still expected to hold rates steady next week, markets are now more confident that easing could come later this summer, especially with Trump renewing pressure on the central bank to cut. As of late Asian trading hours on Friday, bulls were back in control, pushing Bitcoin toward the $98,000 level and setting the stage for a potential breakout toward six figures in the days ahead. Will Bitcoin hit $100k? The answer may rest heavily on geopolitics, particularly the thawing trade tensions between the US and China. Analysts now view May as a crucial month. As Nansen’s Aurelie Barthere explains, exemptions on several tariff categories—including auto parts and low-value shipments—are set to expire. If no progress is made this month, recession risks could grow, dragging Bitcoin and other speculative assets down. However, Barthere believes a deal or “agreement in principle” is more likely, with both sides keen to avoid economic disruption. Beyond trade tensions, recession fears are also back in focus. Analysts at Apollo Global have warned that the US could slip into a recession by summer, pointing to the biggest drop in corporate earnings expectations since 2020. While a slowdown could initially pressure Bitcoin, some analysts say it might ultimately benefit from the shift in Fed policy expectations. Historical trends show Bitcoin has performed strongly in post-recession environments, particularly when monetary easing follows. Most analysts were bullish regarding the short-term price action over the weekend. According to Cas Abbé, spot demand will be the real deciding factor for what comes next for Bitcoin. “If there is a spike in Coinbase Bitcoin Premium during US hours, my bet will be to the upside. If BTC fails to attract spot demand, I think we could see a long squeeze with BTC potentially reaching the $94K to $95K level,” Abbé wrote in a May 2 post. Others like Nonzee also echoed similar sentiment, as he shared a Wyckoff accumulation schematic suggesting Bitcoin is nearing the final phase of a breakout structure. According to a chart he shared, Bitcoin appears to have completed its “spring” and “test” phases, key markers in Wyckoff theory that often precede a strong upside move. Bitcoin/USD 1-day chart. Source: Nonzee Offering an alternate perspective, well-followed analyst Ted added that Offering an alternate perspective, well-followed analyst Ted said that Bitcoin may still need a brief consolidation phase before its next leg higher. According to Ted, the $96K–$99K zone could act as near-term resistance, with price action potentially stalling there for a few days. However, he expects Bitcoin to eventually break out to the upside, continuing its recovery in line with the Wyckoff structure’s “Sign of Strength” phase. When writing, Bitcoin was trading at $97,423.72, up 2% in the past days. Altcoins’ momentum is yet to return Broader crypto markets followed Bitcoin’s lead, with most major altcoins posting modest gains. Ethereum rose 1.4% to $1,838, XRP edged up 0.5% to $2.22, while Solana and Cardano added 0.6% and 2.7% respectively. Dogecoin led the pack with a 3.3% surge. The total altcoin market cap rose just over 1.6%, holding steady around the $1.2 trillion mark. While altcoin season hasn’t kicked off yet, Bitcoin’s dominance climbed to 64.89% this week, its highest level since January 2021, raising speculation that it could be around the corner. According to Rekt Capital, traders may need to wait until Bitcoin dominance approaches the 71% level, where past rejections have typically triggered sharp altcoin rallies. Still, several top altcoins outperformed the market this week, logging double-digit gains. The top performers were: Virtuals Protocol Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL) soared over 100% in the past 7 days, hitting a 3-month high of $1.86 as of press time. Its market cap crossed the $1.2 billion mark, though daily trading volume was down 45% from the previous day, sitting at $371 million, hinting that trading activity is starting to cool off a bit. Source: CoinMarketCap The main driver behind this week’s gains was the successful rollout of Virtual’s Genesis Launch update. This update introduced several key features, like letting developers auto-lock their token allocations and set up transparent vesting schedules. Another major boost came from the announcement that Recognized Staked Agents are now eligible to earn points in the ecosystem, opening up new incentives for participants, rewarding those actively staking and engaging with the platform. VIRTUAL also gained steam from its recent listing on crypto exchange Binance.US, which likely attracted fresh investor interest and liquidity, pulling in both retail and institutional buyers. Solayer Over the past week, Solayer (LAYER) climbed 29% to $3.03, lifting its market cap to over $638 million. However, daily trading volume slipped 22% over the past day, settling at around $146 million at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap The week’s gains appear largely tied to renewed market attention following the reveal of the Solayer Emerald Card. The card allows users to spend USDC directly via Visa without converting to fiat, and also offers an annual yield option through sUSD, a stablecoin backed by US Treasury bills. Additionally, the Emerald Card includes a rewards system where transactions generate points, which can be exchanged for LAYER tokens, partner airdrops, or referral bonuses. Monero Monero (XMR) was up 26% over the past week, trading at $288.7 at the time of writing. Its market cap stood at $5.3 billion, with daily trading volume hovering over $120.7 million. Source: CoinMarketCap While no major positive development or news could be identified as of press time, part of this recent surge appears linked to on-chain activity flagged by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who identified a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC (worth about $330.7 million) that was later swapped into XMR. The large-scale conversion led to a sharp price surge, which likely drew the attention of day traders and scalpers, further contributing to the token’s sharp price increase.

In September of last year, $38,000 was stolen from an account that Justin Chan jointly held with his sister, reports the ABC-affiliated news station KGTV. The theft happened after a SIM-swapping attack, where a hacker managed to convince Xfinity Mobile to port Chan’s cellphone number to a new device. With access to two-factor verification codes, Chan says the hacker changed his login credentials and initiated three outgoing wire transfers. “All these instances occurred within a three-hour period starting at around 2:00am, 3:00am. It was very fast.” Chan reported the fraudulent incident to Bank of America, but says the lender refused to reimburse. “ Our investigation found the transaction in question was confirmed valid by you via (SMS/MMS) text message response or speaking directly with Fraud Detection Employee.” Bank of America later reopened an investigation in November but still denied Chan a refund. Chan also presented a letter to Bank of America from Xfinity Mobile saying that his phone number was “likely accessed by a third party as a result of fraudulent activity” but the lender did not respond. “ I didn’t think I would get the money back. It was a very tough situation to begin with. Bank of America was being difficult.” KGTV says things took a positive turn after the news team continued to press Bank of America on the matter. The lender reimbursed $20,000 and the trading platform Robinhood, where the remaining $18,000 had been sent, refunded the remaining funds.

44092172,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154722,1746242144,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shockwave: Brown University Holds $4.9M in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/brown-university-bitcoin-etf/,"The world of finance is constantly evolving, and perhaps no sector has seen more dramatic shifts recently than the intersection of traditional investments and digital assets. A significant development has just emerged, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and financial analysts: a leading Ivy League institution has publicly disclosed a substantial holding in a spot Bitcoin ETF . Ivy League Embraces Digital Assets: Brown University’s Bold Move In a move that underscores the increasing legitimacy and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance, Brown University , one of the United States’ most prestigious Ivy League universities, has reported holding shares in BlackRock’s popular spot Bitcoin ETF . This isn’t just any investment; it’s a clear signal from an institution known for its cautious and long-term investment strategies. According to a recent securities filing, as reported by Wu Blockchain via X, Brown University held 105,000 shares of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , ticker IBIT, as of March 31st. This holding was valued at approximately $4.9 million at the time. What makes this particularly noteworthy is that these shares were a new addition to the university’s portfolio during the first quarter of this year, indicating a recent strategic decision to gain exposure to Bitcoin via this regulated investment vehicle. While $4.9 million might seem modest compared to the multi-billion dollar endowments managed by Ivy League schools, its significance lies in the institution itself. An Ivy League university adding a spot Bitcoin ETF to its holdings sends a powerful message about the growing acceptance and perceived stability of Bitcoin as an asset class among sophisticated, long-term investors. Understanding the Significance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock IBIT provide investors with exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly buy, hold, or manage the cryptocurrency itself. This structure simplifies investment, reduces technical hurdles, and operates within traditional brokerage accounts and regulatory frameworks. The approval of these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year was a landmark event, paving the way for broader Institutional Adoption . For institutions like universities, pension funds, and endowments, investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF is often the preferred or only viable method to gain Bitcoin exposure due to internal investment mandates, regulatory requirements, and operational simplicity. The fact that an institution like Brown University has chosen this route highlights the effectiveness of the ETF structure in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. BlackRock IBIT: A Popular Choice for Institutional Adoption BlackRock IBIT has quickly emerged as one of the most successful and popular spot Bitcoin ETFs since its launch. Its rapid accumulation of assets under management speaks volumes about investor confidence, both retail and institutional, in BlackRock’s reputation and the ETF structure itself. Brown University’s choice to invest specifically in BlackRock IBIT further validates the fund’s position as a leading vehicle for Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin. Brown University’s overall investment portfolio is substantial, totaling $216 million across 14 different stocks (as per the specific filing mentioned). The $4.9 million allocated to BlackRock IBIT represents a calculated allocation within a diversified strategy. It signals a belief that Bitcoin, accessed through a regulated ETF, has a role to play in a modern, diversified portfolio, potentially as a hedge against inflation or as a growth asset with unique characteristics. What Does This Mean for Institutional Adoption and the Market? This disclosure from Brown University is more than just news about one university’s portfolio; it’s a potential bellwether for broader trends. Here’s why it’s significant: Validation: An Ivy League university adding a spot Bitcoin ETF provides significant validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Precedent: This move could encourage other endowments, foundations, and institutional investors who have been watching from the sidelines to consider their own allocations. Liquidity and Stability: Increased institutional participation through ETFs adds liquidity and can contribute to market stability over the long term. Education and Awareness: Such disclosures bring attention to Bitcoin and digital assets within traditional financial circles and educational institutions themselves. While it’s crucial not to extrapolate too much from a single data point, the pattern of increasing interest and allocation from sophisticated investors and institutions like Brown University , facilitated by products like BlackRock IBIT , points towards a future where digital assets are a more integrated part of the global financial landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Investment The disclosure from Brown University is likely just the beginning. As spot Bitcoin ETFs mature and gain longer track records, and as regulatory clarity potentially improves, more institutions are expected to explore allocations. The due diligence processes for large endowments and pension funds are rigorous, but the fact that an institution like Brown has completed this process and made an investment is a positive sign for the broader trend of Institutional Adoption . Investors watching this space should pay attention not only to the performance of the ETFs themselves but also to future filings from other large institutions. These disclosures provide valuable insights into the evolving sentiment and strategic thinking among some of the world’s most influential investors. Conclusion: A Milestone for Bitcoin’s Mainstream Journey Brown University’s decision to invest nearly $5 million in BlackRock IBIT is a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream financial acceptance. It highlights the effectiveness of spot Bitcoin ETFs in facilitating Institutional Adoption and demonstrates that even historically conservative Ivy League institutions are beginning to recognize the potential role of digital assets in their portfolios. This development adds another layer of credibility to the asset class and could pave the way for further institutional inflows in the future, solidifying Bitcoin’s position within the global financial ecosystem.

44092269,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154749,1746242446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Apple Crypto Rules: Exciting Easing for iOS Apps and NFTs on iPhone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-crypto-rules-eased/,"Get ready, crypto enthusiasts and developers! Apple, a giant in the tech world, has made a significant move that could reshape how we interact with digital assets on our mobile devices. The long-anticipated changes to Apple crypto rules are finally here, bringing new opportunities for iOS crypto apps and users alike. For a long time, navigating the App Store’s policies around cryptocurrencies and NFTs felt restrictive for developers. Now, following a key U.S. court ruling, Apple has updated its guidelines, opening up new possibilities, particularly concerning payments and NFT transactions. What’s Changing with Apple Crypto Rules? The core of the update addresses two major pain points for developers integrating crypto functionalities: External Payment Links: Previously, apps were heavily restricted in linking to external websites for purchases, forcing many transactions through Apple’s in-app purchase system, subject to their commission. The updated guidelines now allow developers of U.S. apps to include buttons or links that direct users to an external website to complete a purchase, including those involving crypto. NFT Secondary Marketplace Purchases: This is a big one for the digital collectibles space. Apple now explicitly allows apps to facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs on secondary marketplaces within the app, provided the transaction complies with other App Store Review Guidelines. This directly impacts how developers can build experiences around the NFT on App Store ecosystem. These changes, as reported by outlets like Decrypt, represent a notable shift from Apple’s historically cautious stance on decentralized technologies within its walled garden. Impact on iOS Crypto Apps and Developers So, what does this mean if you’re building or using iOS crypto apps ? The implications are substantial: Increased Flexibility: Developers have more options for handling transactions, potentially reducing reliance on Apple’s in-app purchase system for certain crypto-related activities. New Business Models: Enabling secondary NFT sales directly within apps unlocks new revenue streams and user engagement models for platforms focusing on digital art, collectibles, and gaming. Improved User Experience: Users might see more seamless integration of crypto purchases and NFT trading within their favorite apps on their crypto apps iPhone . This update signals Apple’s adaptation to the evolving digital economy, acknowledging the growing importance of crypto and NFTs. Accessing NFT on App Store: What’s Possible Now? The ability to buy and sell NFTs on secondary marketplaces directly through apps is a game-changer for the NFT on App Store experience. Before this change, facilitating such transactions within an app was often a complex and restricted process. Now, platforms focused on NFTs can offer a more integrated trading experience, potentially attracting more users to the space via the familiar and trusted App Store environment. Imagine browsing a digital art gallery app and being able to not just view, but also purchase or sell NFTs from other users directly within the app, using an external payment method if the developer chooses to offer it. This was previously a significant hurdle. Navigating the Apple App Store Crypto Landscape While the rules have eased, it’s crucial to understand that not everything is a free-for-all. The updated Apple App Store crypto guidelines still maintain restrictions on certain activities deemed high-risk or non-compliant with Apple’s broader policies. Activities such as cryptocurrency mining within apps, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and other securities-related crypto activities remain prohibited. Developers must still navigate the complex review process and ensure their apps comply with all other guidelines related to user safety, privacy, and financial regulations. What Remains Restricted for Crypto Apps iPhone Users? Even with the relaxed crypto apps iPhone rules, some core limitations persist: Mining: Running cryptocurrency mining processes in the background is still not allowed due to battery and performance concerns. ICOs and Securities: Apps cannot facilitate the trading of cryptocurrency futures, options, or other securities, nor can they conduct ICOs. Compliance: Apps must still comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including financial regulations, which can be complex for crypto. So, while buying an NFT or using an external payment link for a crypto-related service is becoming easier, don’t expect to turn your iPhone into a Bitcoin miner via an app anytime soon. Summary: A Step Forward for Crypto on iOS Apple’s updated App Store guidelines represent a significant step forward for the integration of crypto and NFTs into the mainstream mobile ecosystem, particularly for users and developers in the U.S. By allowing external payment links and facilitating secondary NFT sales, Apple is acknowledging the growing importance of decentralized technologies and providing developers with more flexibility. While restrictions on activities like mining and ICOs remain, these changes pave the way for more innovative and user-friendly iOS crypto apps in the future. This move is poised to benefit developers seeking alternative payment methods and users looking for more direct access to the vibrant NFT market on their iPhones.

Hayes doubts print money plans for Bitcoin “The United States is a deficit country; the only way they can do a Strategic Reserve is not sell the Bitcoin they took from people, fine, that’s 200,000 Bitcoin,” he said. Arthur Hayes spoke to Kyle Chasse on his crypto interview series. Source: Kyle Chasse However, Hayes said it’s hard to imagine any “properly elected” politician openly announcing that the government plans to print money to buy Bitcoin ( BTC ). “Especially when the popular narrative is a bunch of Bitcoin bros going to the club.” “Is that really what you want people to think about your policy?” he asked. On March 6, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile in the US. The US holds 198,012 Bitcoin worth over $18 billion, as per recent data. The reserve is primarily formed of Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil cases , including significant amounts from the Silk Road and Bitfinex hack cases. However, many crypto industry leaders believe that if the US government starts buying Bitcoin, it could set off an aggressive domino effect. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of exchange aggregator 1inch, said during Cointelegraph’s LONGITUDE event in Dubai that if the US were to start buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency. He added. “I’m pretty sure we’ll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.” Hayes sees Bitcoin to altcoin rotation playbook staying the same Hayes remains confident that the Bitcoin cycle leading into altcoin season will follow the same pattern as it did in 2021, despite differing views from other analysts. “I personally think Bitcoin dominance is going back to where it was before the 2021 altcoin season, which is about 70%,” Hayes said. Hayes isn’t convinced the pattern will change. “Then people just start rotating,” he said. “It’s back at all-time highs; bull markets are back, and altcoins should outperform. Should is a keyword there,” Hayes said. “Depends on what you buy,” he added. Related: Bitcoin price about to ‘blast’ higher as Fed rate cut odds jump to 60% Bitcoin dominance — the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the entire crypto market — is 64.78% at the time of publication, according to TradingView data. Bitcoin dominance was 57.59% on Jan. 1. Source: TradingView This represents an 11.68% increase since Jan. 1, when Bitcoin dominance was hovering just below 60%, a level where some analysts said would be its peak before altcoin season began. Several analysts doubted that Bitcoin dominance would ever return to 70%. One of those skeptics was Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen, who explained in August that he doesn’t “think it is going back up to 70%,” and his target for Bitcoin dominance is 60%. Meanwhile, in December CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said “altseason is no longer defined by asset rotation from Bitcoin.” He said the traditional signal marking the beginning of an altcoin season when capital rotates from Bitcoin to altcoins is outdated. Instead, altcoin trading volume has become more prevalent against stablecoin and fiat currency pairs.

That’s why recent reports of a significant Kraken wallet connection issue have caught the attention of users across the platform. As a leading crypto exchange , any technical hiccup at Kraken can impact a large number of traders and investors. What’s Happening with the Kraken Wallet Connection? U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has officially acknowledged a technical problem impacting how users connect to their digital wallets on the platform. The core of the issue appears to be related to the wallet connection process itself. According to Kraken’s statements, users attempting to access their wallets may encounter several frustrating experiences, including: Errors: Specific error messages popping up when trying to view wallet details or initiate transactions. Indefinite Loading: The wallet interface simply spinning or freezing, failing to load account balances or transaction history. Inability to Access Funds: The most critical impact, preventing users from seeing their holdings or performing essential actions like depositing, withdrawing, or trading. This issue specifically pertains to the integrated wallets users manage directly within the Kraken exchange platform, rather than external self-custody wallets. Why is a Stable Wallet Connection Critical for a Crypto Exchange? For any crypto exchange , the wallet function is the gateway for users to interact with their digital assets. It’s where your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are held (or more accurately, where the private keys controlled by the exchange that give you access to those funds are linked). A reliable wallet connection is essential for several key functions: Viewing Balances: Users need to see exactly how much crypto they hold. Depositing Funds: Sending crypto from an external wallet or another exchange to Kraken. Withdrawing Funds: Moving crypto from Kraken to an external wallet or another platform. Trading: While trading interfaces might load, you need a connected wallet to execute buy or sell orders using your existing balance. Checking Transaction History: Reviewing past deposits, withdrawals, and trades. When the Kraken wallet connection fails, all these fundamental activities become impossible or severely hindered, leading to significant user frustration and potential financial implications, especially in volatile market conditions. Kraken’s Response: Investigation and Communication Upon identifying the problem, Kraken has stated they are actively investigating the root cause of the wallet connection issue. Transparency and timely communication from a cryptocurrency exchange during such incidents are crucial for maintaining user trust. While the initial announcement indicated an investigation was underway, users should monitor Kraken’s official communication channels for updates. These typically include: The official Kraken Status Page. Kraken’s official social media accounts (e.g., Twitter). Email notifications from Kraken support. Staying informed through these verified sources is the best way for users to understand the progress of the fix and when normal service is expected to resume for the Kraken wallet . What Challenges Do Users Face During This Kraken Wallet Issue? Beyond the immediate frustration of not being able to access funds, the Kraken wallet connection problem presents several challenges: 1. Trading Limitations: If you can’t see your balance or access your wallet, you cannot make timely trades. In a market known for rapid price swings, this can mean missed opportunities or the inability to react to sudden drops or pumps. 2. Uncertainty and Anxiety: Not being able to view your assets can be stressful for any investor. Users may worry about the safety of their funds, even if the underlying issue is technical and not a security breach. 3. Deposit and Withdrawal Halts: The inability to move funds on or off the exchange locks users into their current positions, regardless of their needs or external market factors. 4. Planning Disruptions: Investors who planned to make specific transactions at a certain time based on market analysis find their strategies disrupted by the unexpected outage. These challenges highlight just how vital a stable and reliable platform is for a major cryptocurrency exchange like Kraken. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Kraken Wallet Problem If you are a Kraken user affected by this wallet connection issue, here are some actionable steps you can take: Action Why It Helps Check Official Channels Get accurate, real-time updates directly from Kraken’s status page or official social media. Avoid relying on unverified sources. Be Patient Technical issues, especially on large, complex platforms, take time to diagnose and fix properly. Rushing the process can lead to further complications. Avoid Unofficial Support Be wary of individuals contacting you via social media or other platforms claiming to be support and asking for your login details or private keys. These are likely scams. Kraken support will not ask for this information. Review Security Practices While waiting, take the opportunity to review your account security: enable 2FA, use a strong unique password, and be aware of phishing attempts. Consider Diversification (Long-Term) For future preparedness, consider holding assets across multiple reputable exchanges or in self-custody wallets to avoid being entirely reliant on one platform’s uptime. Remember, Kraken is investigating the issue, and their technical teams are working to restore full functionality to the Kraken wallet and the platform as a whole. The Broader Picture: Reliability in the Cryptocurrency Exchange Space Incidents like the Kraken wallet connection issue, while frustrating, are not entirely uncommon in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Technical glitches can arise from various factors, including software updates, infrastructure load, or external network problems. What distinguishes a reliable platform is not necessarily the absence of issues, but the speed and effectiveness of their response, their communication with users, and their ability to implement long-term solutions to prevent recurrence. Users of any crypto exchange should be aware that platform downtime is a possibility and factor this into their trading and investment strategies, especially during periods of high market volatility. Conclusion: Awaiting Resolution for the Kraken Wallet The current Kraken wallet connection issue serves as a reminder of the technical complexities underlying even the most popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms. While frustrating for users unable to access their funds or trade, Kraken has acknowledged the problem and is working towards a resolution. For affected users, the best course of action is to remain patient, rely solely on official Kraken communication channels for updates, and take basic security precautions. As the investigation progresses, the crypto community will be watching for Kraken to restore full functionality and provide insights into the cause of the disruption to their wallet connection services.

44092856,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154780,1746243658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Google Gemini Safety Report Reveals Regression,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-safety-report/,"In the fast-paced world of artificial intelligence, developments happen rapidly, influencing everything from how we search for information to how complex systems operate. For those following the intersection of technology and finance, including the cryptocurrency space, understanding the capabilities and limitations of powerful AI models is increasingly relevant. A recent report from Google has brought a critical aspect of AI development into focus: safety. Specifically, concerns are being raised about the latest internal benchmarks for one of Google’s AI models, highlighting potential regressions in key safety metrics. This development regarding Google Gemini safety is prompting discussions across the tech industry and beyond. What’s Happening with Gemini 2.5 Flash Safety Scores? Google recently published a technical report detailing the performance of its new AI models. Among the findings, one stood out: the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, a newer iteration, performed worse on certain internal safety evaluations compared to its predecessor, Gemini 2.0 Flash. This regression in safety scores is a notable point as AI models become more widely deployed. According to Google’s report, the decline was measured across two specific metrics: Text-to-text safety: This metric assesses how often an AI model generates responses that violate Google’s safety guidelines when given a text prompt. Gemini 2.5 Flash showed a 4.1% regression in this area. Image-to-text safety: This metric evaluates how well the model adheres to safety boundaries when processing information from an image prompt. Gemini 2.5 Flash saw a more significant regression of 9.6% here. Google confirmed these findings, stating that Gemini 2.5 Flash indeed “performs worse on text-to-text and image-to-text safety.” These automated tests suggest that the newer model is more prone to generating potentially problematic content based on user inputs, whether text or image-based. Why is AI Model Safety Becoming a Bigger Concern? These surprising benchmark results for AI model safety come at a time when the broader AI industry is navigating a complex challenge: making models more ‘permissive’. This means making them less likely to simply refuse to answer questions on controversial or sensitive topics. The goal is often to provide more helpful or comprehensive responses, even on difficult subjects. Other major players are also exploring this path: Meta has stated that its latest Llama models were tuned to avoid endorsing specific views and to respond to more politically debated prompts. OpenAI has indicated plans to adjust future models to offer multiple perspectives on controversial issues rather than taking an editorial stance or refusing to engage. While the intention behind increased permissiveness is often to make AI more useful and less prone to frustrating users with excessive guardrails, it creates a delicate balance. The risk is that in becoming more open to diverse prompts, models might inadvertently become more susceptible to generating harmful, biased, or unsafe content. This highlights the ongoing tension in developing robust AI model safety protocols. Instruction Following vs. AI Policy Violations: A Tightrope Walk? Google’s report points to a core reason for the safety regression in Gemini 2.5 Flash : its improved ability to follow instructions. While generally a positive trait, this also means it follows instructions more faithfully even when those instructions cross problematic lines or request content that constitutes AI policy violations . As Google’s report notes, “Naturally, there is tension between [instruction following] on sensitive topics and safety policy violations, which is reflected across our evaluations.” The model is better at doing what the user asks, but if the user asks for something unsafe, it’s now more likely to comply. While Google attributes some of the regression to ‘false positives’ in their automated testing system, they acknowledge that Gemini 2.5 Flash does sometimes generate “violative content” when explicitly prompted to do so. This underscores the challenge: making a model helpful and responsive without making it exploitable for harmful purposes. Testing conducted via the AI platform OpenRouter reportedly showed Gemini 2.5 Flash generating essays supporting concerning ideas like replacing human judges with AI, weakening due process, and implementing widespread warrantless surveillance programs without hesitation. These examples illustrate the potential for AI policy violations when instruction following overrides safety guardrails. Is AI Safety Testing Transparent Enough? The details provided in Google’s technical report, or lack thereof, have also drawn criticism. Thomas Woodside, co-founder of the Secure AI Project, emphasized the need for greater transparency in AI safety testing . “There’s a trade-off between instruction-following and policy following, because some users may ask for content that would violate policies,” Woodside stated. “In this case, Google’s latest Flash model complies with instructions more while also violating policies more.” Woodside highlighted that Google did not provide extensive detail on the specific instances where policies were violated, beyond stating they were not severe. Without this detailed information, it becomes difficult for independent analysts to fully understand the nature and severity of the safety issues. This lack of detail in AI safety testing reports is a recurring point of concern for researchers and the public alike. Google has faced scrutiny over its safety reporting practices before. The technical report for its more powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro model was initially delayed and later published with key safety testing details omitted, requiring a subsequent, more detailed release. This history adds to the calls for more upfront and comprehensive transparency in how powerful AI models are evaluated for safety before and after release. What Does This Google Gemini Safety Report Mean for AI’s Future? The findings in the latest report on Google Gemini safety are a clear indicator of the ongoing challenges in scaling AI capabilities while maintaining robust safety standards. As models like Gemini become more sophisticated and integrated into various applications, including potentially those relevant to finance, data analysis, or automated systems within the broader tech ecosystem that includes cryptocurrency, their safety and reliability are paramount. The tension between making AI helpful and ensuring it is safe is a fundamental challenge that the industry must continue to address proactively. The regression seen in Gemini 2.5 Flash’s internal safety scores serves as a reminder that progress in one area (like instruction following) can inadvertently impact another (like safety), requiring continuous vigilance, rigorous testing, and open reporting.

Ripple executed the release on May 3, 2025, in three trades—500 million XRP, 300 million XRP, and 200 million—worth at least $2.2 billion at XRP’s average exchange rate. The release is notable because it came two days later than usual for Ripple to release funds , as the firm unlocks one billion XRP each first day of the month. Details of the transactions were released by Whale Alert, a blockchain data service that confirmed the payments had been sent from Ripple’s escrow wallet. Ripple alters escrow timing amid XRP’s market consolidation Ripple’s monthly escrow process has been established since 2017 to provide a consistent and predictable supply of XRP to support market liquidity. The initial plan was to place 55 billion XRP into escrow, with one billion monthly release for 55 months. The latest release followed Ripple’s escrow lockup of 700 million XRP on May 2, 2025. This is the third month in a row that Ripple has made this pre-release move — also noticed in April and March — which could suggest a change of tactic. Traditionally, around 700 million XRP has been relocked after each release. However, Ripple recently changed when this relocking occurred from post-release to before release. This shift has led to speculation on Ripple’s focus regarding liquidity control and the distribution of the XRP supply. Ripple has not publicly issued a statement as to why the change in timing is being made. Still, some in the market speculate that the new date has something to do with market conditions or internal policy changes. However, the company has not verified these rumors. So far in May, XRP has traded between $1.96 and $2.50. Analysts say the asset is consolidating right now. Charts watchers point out that XRP has been maintaining above the key support levels, such as the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and the historical resistance of around $1.80. Crypto analyst Casitrades provided her technical analysis , speculating that a back-test of the $2.25 level may occur and that a move further down to $1.90 is still on the table. The analyst added that the recent RSI is overbought, suggesting short-term price declines may be followed by some rebound time. The near-term sentiment is neutral, with longer-term traders closely watching resistance at $2.25. If XRP can maintain above this level, higher targets of $2.68 and $3.00 could be on the table. XRP is “loading” as Wall Street quietly moves in Recently, popular crypto influencer John Squire commented on the popular claim within the crypto community from critics labeling XRP as a “dead coin”. In Squire’s view, XRP is “loading,” potentially setting up for a monumental rally. In a lengthy May 1 post on X, John Squire noted that Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP is the only top 10 cryptocurrency mired in a multi-year-long legal battle with the U.S. government and emerged victorious. With the regulatory cloud finally behind it, Squire thinks XRP is poised to see a tidal wave of institutional adoption that sends the crypto higher in value. The pundit says that big money is gearing up as the CME Group is ready to introduce cash-settled XRP futures later this month. A comparable product from Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was introduced in April, underscoring growing institutional interest in XRP. Squire backed this sentiment by citing rumors of a potential XRP trust from asset management giant BlackRock — arguably the most highly awaited XRP product. He claims this is not retail-driven hype but early indications of Wall Street quietly positioning itself. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While the focus in the crypto world often centers on decentralized technologies, the broader advancements in AI, like those by tech giants such as Google, significantly shape the future of technology and how we interact with it. A significant development on this front involves the introduction of powerful AI tools to younger users. Google Gemini for Kids Under 13: What’s Happening? In a move that signals a new phase in AI adoption, Google is preparing to make its Google Gemini chatbot accessible to a younger demographic. Starting next week, children under the age of 13 who have Google accounts managed by their parents will be able to use the Gemini AI. This expansion aims to introduce AI tools to a new generation, allowing them to interact with and potentially learn from the technology in a controlled environment. How Family Link Enables AI Access Access to Google Gemini for this age group will be facilitated through Google’s existing service, Family Link . Family Link is a tool designed to give parents control over their child’s Google account, allowing them to set digital ground rules, manage apps, track screen time, and now, opt into specific Google services like Gemini for their children. This integration underscores Google’s approach to rolling out AI to younger users under parental supervision, aiming to provide a structured and monitored introduction to the technology. Addressing Chatbot Safety and Data Privacy Introducing AI to children raises immediate questions about chatbot safety and privacy. Google has stated that specific guardrails are being put in place for younger users interacting with Gemini. These measures are designed to filter content, prevent inappropriate responses, and ensure interactions are suitable for children. Furthermore, a crucial commitment from Google is that the data generated from these interactions with younger users will not be used to train its AI models. This addresses a significant privacy concern, assuring parents that their child’s conversations will not contribute to the general development of the AI. The Broader Context: The Race for Generative AI Google’s decision comes as the race in the generative AI space intensifies. Companies are eager to establish their AI platforms and capture various user segments, including younger audiences who represent future users and innovators. However, this push also highlights the current limitations and potential risks associated with chatbots, which are still imperfect and can sometimes produce inaccurate or even harmful content. Organizations like the UN Educational, Scientific and Coastal Organization (UNESCO) have called for stricter regulations on AI in education, including age limits and robust data protection policies, emphasizing the need for caution and careful implementation when bringing powerful AI tools to young people. Making AI for kids available through supervised platforms like Family Link is a step towards controlled access, but it also opens up discussions about digital literacy, critical thinking, and the ethical implications of AI interaction from a young age. As AI technology continues to advance, the balance between providing access to innovative tools and ensuring user safety, especially for vulnerable populations like children, remains a critical challenge for tech companies and regulators alike.

44094252,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154779,1746246619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Apple AI: Exclusive Partnership with Anthropic for Revolutionary Coding Platform,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-ai-coding-platform/,"The intersection of technology giants and artificial intelligence continues to heat up, and a recent report suggests a significant collaboration that could reshape software development. According to Bloomberg, Apple is reportedly teaming up with AI research company Anthropic to build a sophisticated AI coding platform . This development is particularly interesting for those following the rapid advancements in Generative AI and its practical applications. What’s Happening with Apple AI and Anthropic? The core of the report centers on Apple’s alleged partnership with Anthropic to develop a “vibe-coding” software platform. This system is designed to leverage generative AI capabilities to assist programmers with writing, editing, and testing code. Here’s a breakdown of the key details: The platform is described as a new iteration of Apple’s existing programming software, Xcode. It is expected to utilize Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet model, known for its strong performance in coding tasks. Initially, Apple plans to implement the software for internal use. A decision on whether to release the platform publicly has not yet been made. This move signals Apple’s strategic intent to deeply integrate AI into its core development tools, potentially boosting efficiency and innovation within its ecosystem. Why is Anthropic AI a Key Player Here? Anthropic has quickly become a prominent name in the generative AI space, particularly recognized for its focus on AI safety and developing powerful models like the Claude series. The report highlights that the latest Claude models are notably popular among developers specifically for coding tasks.

It suggests Apple sees specific strengths in Anthropic’s technology for this particular application, complementing its other AI partnerships. How Does This Fit into Apple’s Broader Generative AI Strategy? This reported partnership with Anthropic is not an isolated event but appears to be part of a larger, multi-faceted Apple AI strategy. Apple has been actively building out its AI capabilities, recently unveiling “Apple Intelligence” features that integrate generative AI across its devices and applications. Notably, Apple has already confirmed a partnership with OpenAI, using ChatGPT to power some of its Apple Intelligence functionalities. The company has also indicated that it may add Google’s Gemini models as an alternative option in the future. This network approach allows Apple to tap into the specific strengths of different AI providers for various tasks, from powering on-device features to assisting internal development with Xcode AI . What Does This Mean for the Future of Xcode AI and Development? The potential integration of advanced generative AI into Xcode could have significant implications for developers building applications for Apple’s platforms. An AI-powered coding assistant could potentially: Accelerate development time by automating repetitive tasks. Assist with debugging and identifying errors more quickly. Suggest code improvements and alternative approaches. Lower the barrier to entry for new developers by providing guidance and examples. While the platform is reportedly starting internally, a public release could democratize access to powerful AI coding tools within the Apple developer community. This would make Xcode AI a much more dynamic and helpful environment. Considering the Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of an AI-enhanced Xcode is exciting, implementing such a system comes with challenges. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated code, addressing potential security concerns, and seamlessly integrating the AI into existing developer workflows are crucial considerations. However, the opportunities are substantial. A successful AI coding platform could significantly enhance developer productivity, foster innovation, and strengthen the appeal of developing on Apple’s platforms. The collaboration between Apple and Anthropic brings together significant resources and expertise from both the hardware/software giant and a leading Generative AI research lab. A Glimpse into Apple’s AI Ambitions The reported partnership between Apple and Anthropic underscores Apple’s aggressive push into the artificial intelligence domain. By collaborating with multiple leading AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and now potentially Anthropic, Apple is positioning itself to offer a diverse range of AI capabilities, tailored for different use cases. This specific focus on an AI coding platform highlights the importance Apple places on its developer ecosystem and the tools they use to build the applications that power its devices. The development of advanced Xcode AI features powered by Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet could represent a significant leap forward in developer productivity and the capabilities of Apple’s software tools.

XRP OTC Deals Aren’t Market Manipulation Rector opens the broadcast by calling the thesis “a new round of misinformation and FUD,” stressing that “institutions are [not] going to get XRP at $100,000 on the private ledger. That’s not happening.” He explains that what social-media accounts now label “dark pools” are simply over-the-counter (OTC) desks—private bilateral venues that large holders have used for decades in equities, foreign exchange and, more recently, digital assets. “It’s nothing new or specific to XRP,” he says, adding that Ripple Labs has been off-loading part of its treasury via OTC since 2019 without depressing the open-market price. Indeed, XRP has “pumped tremendously since November,” Rector notes, even as Ripple distributed fresh supply to institutional counterparties. Much of Clover’s allegation hinges on the idea that a separate, private version of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) carries its own price—orders of magnitude above the public market’s. Rector calls that notion a fundamental misunderstanding of how Ripple’s enterprise tooling works. Central-bank or government pilots often ask for “private ledgers where they can keep messaging and transactions hidden from the public view,” he acknowledges, but those environments are permissioned sidechains or wrapped derivatives. “XRP only exists on the public XRP Ledger that we all use . Your XRP can never leave the XRP Ledger,” he states. If testers wanted to model a six-figure price for stress-testing purposes, “that’s not the real XRP, never was, never would be.” To underscore the point, Rector cites Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz, who “has already addressed this” and clarified that “there are not two prices of XRP.” Rector also invokes examples from other enterprise-focused chains—XDC’s hybrid architecture and Constellation’s Department of Defense “Metagraph” deployment—to show that privacy partitions are standard practice, not evidence of hidden liquidity at surreal valuations. OTC Buyers Get A Discount While some retail traders fear that Wall Street would happily pay an astronomical premium behind closed doors, Rector argues the economics are inverted: “Why would an institution pay $10,000 per XRP on the private ledger […] when it’s available on the public market for $2?” OTC desks exist precisely so that whales can accumulate “without moving the market,” not to overpay. In fact, history shows that Ripple has often granted institutional partners a discount, not a markup—something revealed in discovery during the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. Rector reminds viewers that Ripple’s data set includes “over 1,700 NDAs” and that R3 once negotiated an option to buy five billion XRP “for a sub-penny” over three years, ultimately settling for a single billion when the broader partnership soured. None of those figures approach the six-figure fantasy. At press time, XRP traded at $2.21.

The lawmakers argue that these companies are using U.S. capital to aid China’s military modernization and are linked to serious human rights violations. “These entities benefit from American investor capital while advancing the strategic objectives of the Chinese Communist Party,” the letter said. “They also pose an unacceptable risk to American investors.” Commercial companies from China may support the interests of the Chinese state Moolenaar and Scott highlighted that even companies that appear to be purely commercial are often involved in supporting the interests of the Chinese state. They cited China’s military-civil fusion policy, which allows the government to compel private companies to share technology with the People’s Liberation Army. The lawmakers’ call is part of a broader U.S. push to cut off Chinese access to American money, technology, and know-how. It comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, already deepened by an ongoing trade war . Just one day before the letter was sent, the CIA released two videos in Chinese aimed at recruiting more intelligence assets inside China — another signal of growing rivalry between the two powers. In the letter, Moolenaar and Scott said the Chinese Communist Party’s control over companies is “systemically concealed from U.S. investors” and warned that Chinese law creates “unpredictable risk” that cannot be fixed by better disclosures. They also claimed many of the 25 companies mentioned were “actively integrated into the Chinese military and surveillance apparatus.” They argued that the SEC already has the authority to act under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which allows the agency to suspend or revoke the listing of foreign companies that do not meet U.S. auditing standards or fail to protect investors. “The SEC can — and must — act,” the lawmakers wrote. Among the firms named were Pony AI, a self-driving technology company, and Hesai, a laser sensor company that the U.S. Department of Defense has linked to China’s military — an allegation Hesai denies. Others include Tencent Music, a streaming service owned by Tencent Holdings , already blacklisted by the Pentagon, and Daqo New Energy Corp, a solar material producer previously sanctioned by the U.S. Commerce Department over alleged use of forced labor in Xinjiang. The lawmakers argue that the 25 firms are just a small portion The lawmakers said the 25 firms represent only a small portion of Chinese companies using U.S. capital while working with “a genocidal dictatorship and our foremost geostrategic rival.” As of March, there were 286 Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress to monitor the economic and national security impact of U.S.-China trade. The SEC has not yet responded publicly. Chairman Paul Atkins, who took office last month, has not laid out his agenda regarding China. His predecessor, Gary Gensler, had placed greater scrutiny on Chinese companies. Atkins, during his confirmation hearing, emphasized the importance of transparent accounting and auditing standards for protecting investors. Meanwhile, the House China Committee has also increased its focus on American financial firms that do business with Chinese companies accused of military ties or human rights violations. The Chinese embassy in Washington pushed back against the U.S. actions. Spokesperson Liu Pengyu said China opposes the use of national security as a reason to target its companies and criticized what he described as the politicization of trade and technology. “We oppose turning trade and technological issues into political weapons,” Liu said.

One such signal recently highlighted by a prominent figure in the traditional finance space has caught the attention of the Crypto Market : the dynamic relationship between two seemingly disparate assets – Gold and Bitcoin. Jurrien Timmer, the head of global macro at financial giant Fidelity, shared some intriguing observations on X (formerly Twitter). His analysis points to a potential turning point where Bitcoin Investment could be poised to outperform the age-old safe haven, Gold. This isn’t just a casual comment; it’s based on specific market metrics that suggest a fascinating negative correlation and an alternating leadership in risk-adjusted returns between the two assets. Understanding the Intriguing Bitcoin vs Gold Dynamic For years, Bitcoin has earned the moniker “ Digital Gold ” due to its perceived scarcity, decentralized nature, and store-of-value properties, drawing parallels to the physical metal. However, their price movements haven’t always mirrored each other. In fact, as Timmer notes, they’ve often shown a negative correlation. What does negative correlation mean in this context? Simply put, when one asset performs well, the other tends to perform less well, or even decline. This inverse relationship makes their interplay particularly interesting for investors seeking diversification or trying to understand capital flows between traditional and digital assets. Historically, both assets have served different purposes in a portfolio: Gold as a traditional hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, and Bitcoin initially as a speculative technology play that has matured into a recognized, albeit volatile, asset class. What Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer is Observing Jurrien Timmer’s analysis goes beyond simple price correlation. He specifically highlighted the Sharpe Ratio of both assets. The Sharpe Ratio is a measure used to evaluate the performance of an investment by adjusting for its risk. It indicates the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Timmer’s key observation is that the Sharpe Ratios of Gold and Bitcoin have shown an alternating pattern of leadership. This suggests that periods where Gold offered better risk-adjusted returns were followed by periods where Bitcoin did, and vice versa. Currently, Timmer pointed out the Sharpe Ratio for Bitcoin is around -0.40, while Gold’s stands at a positive 1.33. At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive – Gold has a much better Sharpe Ratio right now, indicating superior risk-adjusted returns recently. However, in the context of their historically alternating leadership, a significantly negative Sharpe Ratio for Bitcoin, contrasting with a strong positive one for Gold, could signal that Bitcoin is currently undervalued relative to its risk profile compared to Gold, and thus potentially poised for a period of outperformance to regain leadership in risk-adjusted returns. This analysis from a figure at Fidelity, a major player in traditional finance increasingly involved in digital assets, lends significant weight to the discussion about the future roles of Gold and Bitcoin in investment portfolios. The Significance of the Sharpe Ratio in Crypto Market Analysis Why is the Sharpe Ratio important, especially in the volatile Crypto Market ? Risk Adjustment: It doesn’t just look at returns; it considers the risk (volatility) taken to achieve those returns. A high return with extreme volatility might result in a lower Sharpe Ratio than a moderate return with low volatility. Comparison Tool: It allows investors to compare the performance of different assets on a level playing field, considering their inherent risk levels. Identifying Potential Shifts: As Timmer suggests, observing the *relative* Sharpe Ratios and their historical patterns can potentially help identify when one asset might be set to outperform another on a risk-adjusted basis. The current disparity, with Bitcoin’s negative Sharpe Ratio indicating poor recent risk-adjusted performance and Gold’s positive one showing strong recent performance, fits the pattern of alternation Timmer observed. It implies that the pendulum might be ready to swing back towards Bitcoin. Is Bitcoin Investment Poised to Outshine Digital Gold ? The question on many investors’ minds now is whether this observation truly signals a significant shift. Several factors could support the idea that Bitcoin Investment is entering a phase where it could outperform Gold: Maturing Asset Class: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a legitimate asset class by institutional investors, leading to potential increased capital inflow. Macroeconomic Environment: Depending on future inflation trends, interest rates, and global stability, investors might favor assets with higher growth potential (like Bitcoin) over traditional safe havens (like Gold). Technological Advantages: Bitcoin offers ease of transfer, divisibility, and verifiable scarcity that Gold cannot match in the digital age. Network Effects: As adoption grows, Bitcoin’s network effect strengthens, potentially increasing its value proposition. The Halving Cycle: Bitcoin’s programmed supply constraint events (halvings) have historically preceded significant price rallies, reducing the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. While Gold has thousands of years of history as a store of value, Bitcoin has built a strong case as a modern alternative in just over a decade. The narrative of Bitcoin as “ Digital Gold ” isn’t going away; it’s evolving. The question is whether its unique properties and market dynamics will allow it to surpass Gold in terms of investor preference and performance in the coming period. Challenges and Opportunities in This Potential Shift Investing based on such observations comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities. Opportunities: Potential for Higher Returns: If Bitcoin does enter a period of outperformance, investors could see significant gains, potentially exceeding those from Gold. Diversification: The observed negative correlation suggests that holding both assets could offer diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Participation in Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the burgeoning blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin remains significantly more volatile than Gold. A negative Sharpe Ratio, even if signaling a potential turn, highlights recent price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, which can introduce unpredictable risks. Market Sentiment: The crypto market is heavily influenced by sentiment and news, which can lead to rapid price changes independent of fundamental value. Gold’s Enduring Appeal: Gold’s status as a safe haven is deeply ingrained in global finance and culture, making a complete dethroning by Bitcoin unlikely in the short term. Investors must weigh these factors carefully. While the signal from Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer is compelling, it’s just one piece of the puzzle in a complex global market. Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should investors take away from Timmer’s observation about the Bitcoin vs Gold dynamic? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on macroeconomic indicators and how they might influence both traditional assets like Gold and digital assets like Bitcoin. Understand the Metrics: Familiarize yourself with concepts like the Sharpe Ratio and correlation, but remember they are tools, not guarantees. Consider Diversification: The negative correlation pattern might strengthen the case for holding both Gold and Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, rather than viewing them as mutually exclusive. Long-Term Perspective: Both assets have shown significant moves over the long term. Short-term predictions based on metrics like the Sharpe Ratio’s current state should be viewed within a broader, long-term investment strategy. Do Your Own Research: Timmer’s observation is valuable, but it’s crucial to conduct your own thorough research and consider your personal risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions regarding Bitcoin Investment or Gold. The potential shift from Gold to Bitcoin isn’t a guaranteed event, but the analysis from a respected figure like Jurrien Timmer provides a solid basis for discussion and further investigation into the evolving roles of these two assets in the global financial landscape. The narrative of Digital Gold is clearly still very much alive and perhaps entering a new chapter. Conclusion Jurrien Timmer’s insights from Fidelity offer a compelling perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin vs Gold relationship. By highlighting their negative correlation and the alternating leadership in their Sharpe Ratios, he suggests that Bitcoin may be strategically positioned to outperform Gold in the near future. While Gold has long reigned as the ultimate safe haven, Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class, combined with its unique digital properties and the potential for shifting capital flows in the Crypto Market , makes this a dynamic worth watching closely. Investors considering Bitcoin Investment or evaluating their exposure to traditional assets like Gold should pay attention to these expert observations and conduct their own diligent research to navigate the fascinating intersection of these two worlds.

44094806,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154789,1746247842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Chatbots: Warning Issued on Engagement Tactics,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-chatbots-engagement-warning/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, where AI intersects with everything from finance to social interaction, concerns are emerging about the direction of AI Development . A recent warning from a prominent figure in the tech industry highlights a potential pitfall: the focus on driving engagement metrics over providing genuine utility. This perspective is particularly relevant as we see AI models becoming more integrated into daily life, including tools that could impact the cryptocurrency space and beyond. The AI Chatbots Engagement Problem Kevin Systrom, the co-founder of Instagram, has voiced a significant concern regarding the current trajectory of AI Chatbots . According to Systrom, many AI companies appear to be prioritizing strategies aimed at artificially boosting user interaction, a practice he describes as trying to “juice engagement.” Instead of focusing on delivering concise, insightful, and truly helpful answers, these AI systems are designed to keep users talking, often by prompting them with follow-up questions after every interaction. Systrom made these observations at a recent industry event, drawing a parallel between these AI tactics and those historically used by social media platforms. The goal in both cases, he suggests, is to aggressively expand metrics like time spent on the platform or daily active users (DAU). While these metrics are crucial for business growth and investor perception, Systrom argues that this approach in AI is counterproductive and ultimately harms the user experience. “You can see some of these companies going down the rabbit hole that all the consumer companies have gone down in trying to juice engagement,” he stated. He highlighted the repetitive pattern where, after asking a question, the AI immediately poses another small question, seemingly just to elicit further responses. Is User Engagement Becoming the Sole Focus? The focus on maximizing User Engagement in AI chatbots is not occurring in a vacuum. These comments come amid broader discussions about the behavior of large language models, such as criticisms leveled against ChatGPT for sometimes being overly conversational or evasive rather than providing direct answers. OpenAI has acknowledged this feedback, attributing it partly to responding to “short-term feedback” from users. However, Systrom suggests that this overly engaging behavior might not be an accidental ‘bug’ resulting from user feedback but rather a deliberate ‘feature.’ The incentive for AI companies is clear: demonstrate impressive metrics like increased time on platform or high daily active users to stakeholders. Designing chatbots that encourage prolonged interaction, regardless of the actual utility of that interaction, is one way to achieve this. This focus on engagement metrics, while understandable from a business perspective, raises questions about the core purpose of Generative AI tools. Are they being built primarily to serve users with high-quality information and assistance, or are they being optimized to serve the companies’ need for favorable engagement statistics? The Challenge for Generative AI Development The tension between building genuinely useful tools and optimizing for business metrics like AI Engagement presents a significant challenge in the current phase of AI Development . Systrom’s critique implies that the pursuit of engagement at all costs can detract from the fundamental value proposition of AI: providing intelligent, efficient, and accurate information or performing complex tasks effectively. He did not name specific companies, but his comments reflect a concern that the industry might be repeating the patterns seen in social media, where addictive design and engagement loops sometimes took precedence over user well-being or the quality of information exchanged. While OpenAI, in response to the original report, pointed to their user specifications noting that their models “often does not have all of the information” and may need “clarification or more details,” Systrom’s point is less about the need for clarification and more about the *method* used – the seemingly gratuitous follow-up questions designed to prolong interaction rather than genuinely improve the answer. According to OpenAI’s specs, unless a question is truly vague, the AI should attempt to answer and then indicate how more information could help, rather than just asking generic follow-ups to keep the conversation going. Actionable Insights for Better AI Development Systrom offered a clear piece of advice for companies involved in AI Development : they should be “laser-focused” on delivering high-quality answers and insights. This means prioritizing accuracy, relevance, and conciseness over designing interactions purely to inflate engagement numbers. His perspective is a call for the AI industry to learn from the experiences of social media and other consumer tech sectors. While engagement is important for product stickiness and user retention, it should ideally be a byproduct of providing exceptional value, not the primary design goal achieved through potentially manipulative tactics. Building trust in AI Chatbots and Generative AI tools depends on their reliability and utility. If users feel they are being unnecessarily prodded or led down conversational rabbit holes rather than getting the information they need efficiently, that trust can erode. The long-term success of AI platforms may well depend on resisting the urge to prioritize superficial engagement metrics over fundamental usefulness. In conclusion, the warning from the Instagram co-founder serves as a timely reminder for the AI industry. As AI Chatbots become more sophisticated, the focus must remain squarely on leveraging their power to provide genuinely useful insights and solutions, rather than falling into the trap of optimizing for engagement numbers at the expense of user value. Prioritizing quality in AI Development is crucial for building sustainable and trustworthy AI systems that truly benefit users.

Although Cardano (ADA) has received a lot of attention, two other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin (LTC) and Remittix (RTX) , are starting to show promise. With Remittix’s presale positioned to take advantage of the thriving cross-border payments market and Litecoin’s well-established reputation as a quick and inexpensive transaction choice, both have distinctive growth prospects. Litecoin’s bullish potential: Why it’s a top pick for May’s crypto Litecoin (LTC) has shown steady growth since early April, evident in the higher lows it has formed on the price chart this month, probably because large investors (whales) are quietly accumulating tokens. However, the formation of a descending triangle pattern suggests traders should not abandon caution. Source: Trading View Litecoin (LTC) could hit a psychological barrier above the resistance levels between $85 and $88, and it could still rally to $100 in May if volume holds strong. The support near the $79–$80 range has historically held significance. Historically, late April to early May has been a favorable period for crypto as tax sell-offs ease and institutions rebalance. Buyers have already shown interest to the tune of a 15% surge in trading volume, up to $425.49 million and a market cap of around $6.35 billion. Litecoin could be good value for traders looking for gains in mid-cap tokens this month. Remittix (RTX) and the path to big profits in May Cross-border payments have long been a source of frustration, with millions of people worldwide navigating inefficient and delayed systems. Remittix is revolutionizing this by using blockchain technology to facilitate transfers that land as local fiat in minutes, bypassing banks, clearinghouses, and middlemen. This results in fast, seamless payouts with no guessing or waiting, enabling users to send funds as easily as sending a message. Remittix’s peer-to-peer design removes the geographical and documentation obstacles that have historically restricted access to financial services. Participants only need to have a cryptocurrency wallet and an internet connection; there aren’t many Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements. Where legacy systems are prone to security risks and inefficiency, Remittix ensures trust with on-chain, encrypted, immutable, and traceable transactions. As the market focuses on solving financial exclusion and inefficiencies, Remittix’s practical solutions position it as the best option for investors looking for significant gains in May. Cardano’s critical test: Will key support hold? Cardano (ADA) is closely watched by analysts and its strong community, and its price movements and technological development have never struggled to hold interest. Source: Trading View However, investors are approaching ADA with caution, considering how a drop below the $0.50 support could trigger further capitulation. On the upside, tentative traders only need a strong bounce to launch a rally based on optimism. In the short term, Cardano hangs in a delicate balance, and even experienced traders have a hard time evaluating entry points. Conclusion Cardano (ADA) is a mainstay of the cryptocurrency space, but its unpredictable price swings and negative momentum will be a persistent headache throughout May. On the other hand, whales have gravitated toward Litecoin (LTC), and it has rewarded them already with more gains due if momentum holds. Remittix (RTX) is also becoming more well-known for its creative approach to international payments, which provides seamless transactions and an intuitive platform for users everywhere. Both Litecoin and Remittix are set for strong growth, making them attractive options for investors looking for promising gains in May. Remittix, already selling nearly $530 million in tokens and with 55.02% sold in its current presale, is emerging as a PayFi frontrunner, with early investors still having a chance to join.

According to on-chain data shared on X by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, Pump.fun deposited 105,233 SOL worth $15.86 million at the time, to Kraken. This move takes the Pump.fun’s deposits to Kraken to 3,202,498 SOL, which is worth $591 million at $185 per SOL. Pump.fun has become a major player in the Solana memecoin ecosystem since last year, offering users a simple interface to launch and trade meme tokens on the go. The platform reportedly earns a cut of trading fees and also benefits from tokens it launches, giving it ample opportunity profit from the wild swings of the meme coin market. These recent deposits also suggest renewed interest in Solana memecoin projects. Pump.fun deposits indicate changing investor mood The consistent profit-taking by Pump.fun suggest that is proof that the platform regularly capitalizes on the cyclical meme coin hype, converting its SOL into stablecoins or fiat as interest spikes. Roughly a week ago, Lookonchain reported that Pump.fun deposited 117,913 SOL worth $18.26 million, taking its Kraken deposits to 3,097,265 SOL($575 million). It also sold 264,373 SOL for 41.64 million USDC at $158. On-chain data indicate that Pump.fun also made large deposits in early April, late March, February, and in January, all to Kraken. However, the recent deposits and the short interval between them have increased speculation , with some quarters accusing the platform of wider profit taking at the detriment of SOL. Critics argue that meme coin platforms encourage reckless speculation and rug pulls. They also finger Pump.fun’s regular SOL transfers as doing more harm than good to Solana’s ecosystem. Despite concerns over market manipulation and sustainability, Pump.fun’s transfers appear to align with renewed optimism around Solana’s meme coin economy. Solana memecoins hemorrhaged value to scams and profit-taking Memecoin projects, especially those hosted on Solana before now, have been relatively quiet following the sharp drop in market cap of President Donald Trump’s official memecoin, TRUMP, as well as that of his wife, MELANIA . The market was further shaken following the collapse of the LIBRA project endorsed by Javier Milei, Argentina’s president, which rode on the popularity of the TRUMP memecoin. LIBRA happened to be a scam and was reportedly launched by bad actors who rug pulled investors and dealt the memecoin market a huge blow as interests fell to an all-time low. The impact of the LIBRA’s collapse and the attendant apathy for memecoins affected Pump.fun’s revenue which was already taking hits following the failure of its livestream feature launch. Pump.fun endured over 50% decline in token launches , with some commenters predicting that the figure could drop further. However, it appears to have weathered that lull as the platform tries to regain the pace of token launches in January 2025. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This new update decouples wallet activation from migration , meaning users who have passed any stage of KYC can now immediately engage with the Pi ecosystem. Despite this simplified access, strict KYC standards remain in place , maintaining the platform’s focus on security and user authenticity. Third-Party Wallet Access Now Available for Non-Users One of the most groundbreaking parts of the update is its third-party onboarding capability . New users who were never part of Pi Network’s mining phase can now get their own Mainnet wallets via verified third-party platforms. Services like Banxa , which is now KYB-verified, offer streamlined KYC checks that allow newcomers to enter the ecosystem quickly— no mining or migration needed . This dramatically lowers the entry barrier for global users. Boosting Ecosystem Growth and Real-World Utility This update isn’t just about wallets—it’s about ecosystem expansion.

Last around $87, the Litecoin price has been in a strong uptrend in recent weeks. Since bouncing at its early April lows under $64, LTC has risen around 40%. In doing so, its broken convincingly above its 21 and 50DMAs, as well as a multi-week downtrend. Bulls are now focused on a likely near-term retest of the $97 area, a major zone of support-turned-resistance going back to December. A break above here would unlock a move higher towards recent multi-month highs in the $140s, more than 60% up versus current levels. Chart analysis suggests this is the likeliest next move for Litecoin . But with macro risks growing in the background, a lot of uncertainty remains. Where Next for the Litecoin Price? The strong rally in crypto and US stock markets in recent weeks has been driven by hopes that US President Donald Trump is backing off from his trade war, and the economic shock of trade uncertainty won’t be so bad. Forward looking “soft” US economic data releases paint a picture of a rapidly deteriorating economy. But more backwards looking “hard” data, like the US jobs report released on Friday , show the economy holding up for now, underpinning the optimistic attitude of the market. 177,000 jobs were added to the US economy in April: pic.twitter.com/k521TNsrCa — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) May 2, 2025 That said, sentiment could quick turn for the worse if recession fears come flooding back. And altcoins like Litecoin are highly exposed to a possible pullback. Sure, the Litecoin price could reach back to its recent highs in the $140 area in the coming months. But traders would do well not to chase the rally higher. That’s not until the conditions for a new altcoin season really start to fall into place. Historically these conditions have been 1) major central banks pumping the market full of liquidity and 2) strong economic growth and optimism about the future. With the Fed still concerned about “sticky” inflation and trade uncertainty unlikely to abate any time soon, these goldilocks conditions for altcoins aren’t likely to arrive any time soon. Solely (SOLX) – A Better Alternative for Near-term Gains? A better crypto to buy now for near-term gains might be a promising new Solana project called Solely (SOLX) , which has caught the attention of the web3 community with its impressive presale that’s raked in over $32 million so far. Solaxy is hitting a Supernova! 32M Raised!! pic.twitter.com/0oWzeK5vTm — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) April 27, 2025 That ranks it as one of the biggest presales of the year, and tees it up to be one of the biggest token launches of 2025. Solaxy is the first Layer-2 solution for the Solana blockchain, designed to address network congestion and enhance scalability. By processing transactions off-chain and using rollups, Solaxy ensures faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining Solana’s security. With its massive presale haul, a 125% APY staking program and a growing community of over 70,000 followers, Solaxy is gaining major traction. Its no surprise then that some analysts are predicting a 10x return by the end of 2025, driven by Solana’s surging DeFi activity and Solaxy’s innovative infrastructure. As Solana’s ecosystem expands, Solaxy’s utility and potential make it a top crypto investment now.

As the market gears up for its next surge, these lesser-known digital assets could deliver staggering returns. This article delves into three rising stars that might make early backers exceptionally wealthy in the upcoming bull run. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.003333 Next Stage : $0.005 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $13 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Terra Classic (LUNC): Rising from the Ashes to Reinvent Stablecoins Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain platform aiming to transform global payments. It uses stablecoins linked to real-world currencies, offering price stability for users. This means you can send money quickly and cheaply without worrying about value fluctuations. Launched in 2019, Terra offered stablecoins tied to the US dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik, and more by 2021. In May 2022, Terra introduced a new blockchain, rebranding the original as Terra Classic. The native token, formerly LUNA, became LUNA Classic (LUNC). Some compare this to the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split. Terra’s CEO, Do Kwon, sees the collapse of UST in 2022 as a pivotal moment, similar to Ethereum’s 2017 hack. LUNC combines the stability of traditional currencies with blockchain’s benefits. In today’s market, where trust in stablecoins is crucial, LUNC stands out. Its focus on real-world currency pegs makes it an attractive option compared to other cryptocurrencies. Stellar Lumens: Connecting the World’s Money with Speed and Simplicity Stellar (XLM) is a network that makes moving money across the world fast and cheap. It doesn’t favor any country’s currency and has its own coin called Stellar Lumens. Since 2014, Stellar has handled billions of transactions and partnered with big companies. What makes it special is that it can send any type of money—whether it’s dollars, euros, or even other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Instead of trying to change the whole financial system, Stellar aims to make it better by helping different financial systems work together. In today’s market, Stellar stands out because it bridges traditional money and digital assets. While some cryptocurrencies focus on replacing banks, Stellar works with them. This approach might make it more appealing as governments and big institutions show interest in blockchain technology. Compared to other coins that are often volatile, Stellar offers practical uses like global payments and currency conversion. With its strong foundation and real-world partnerships, Stellar may play a significant role as the crypto market continues to evolve. Conclusion While LUNC and XLM hold promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in a memecoin poised for success in the current bull run.

With this upward momentum, the leading cryptocurrency appears to be setting its sights on a new all-time high (ATH), as several technical and momentum indicators hint at a growing bullish trend. Bitcoin Monthly Stochastic RSI Turning Bullish In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared a BTC monthly chart indicating that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of a bullish crossover. For the uninitiated, a Stochastic RSI bullish crossover signals growing upward momentum and is often interpreted as a potential buy signal or the start of a potential rally. Titan of Crypto added that if confirmed, the bullish crossover may initiate BTC’s next leg up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashing Pre-Rally Signals Seen Before Major 2024 Breakouts, Analyst Says As an example, the analyst referred to BTC’s price action on the monthly chart from back in Q3 2021. At the time, a similar bullish crossover in the Stochastic RSI preceded a 56.9% surge in Bitcoin’s price. However, Bitcoin must hold above crucial support levels to maintain this bullish structure. In a separate X post, renowned analyst Ali Martinez noted that BTC could re-test the $95,700 support zone before advancing toward the $100,000 milestone. On the resistance side, Martinez emphasized that $97,530 remains a “key level to watch.” A successful breakout beyond this threshold could pave the way for BTC to revisit or surpass its previous ATH. As it stands, Bitcoin is trading roughly 10% below its record high. Analysts Predict BTC’s Next Move Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also weighed in on BTC’s potential trajectory. In an X post published yesterday, he suggested that once BTC decisively breaks through the $97,000 to $99,000 zone, it could face rejection near $104,500. Following that, holding the $97,000–$99,000 range as support would be critical for BTC to launch toward new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Momentum Yet To Recover From Deep Negative Zone, Analyst Says Similarly, analyst Ted noted that BTC is currently trading in a Wyckoff accumulation phase. The analyst added that BTC’s slide below $76,000 in early April was likely the bottom for this market cycle. He added: Looking at the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, it seems like the $96K-$99K level could act as a resistance. I think BTC could consolidate here for a few days, before eventually breaking to the upside. Despite bullish momentum, some concerns remain. Analysts caution that Bitcoin is unlikely to face a true supply shock in the immediate future, which could temper upside potential. At press time, BTC trades at $97,142, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

In April alone, these large market participants went on an accumulation spree not only for BTC and XRP, but ADA as well. Data shared by the popular analyst Ali Martinez indicates that whales had accumulated over 410,000,000 ADA in April alone. In terms of USD value, the stash is worth close to $300 million at today’s prices. Whales accumulated over 410 million #Cardano $ADA in April! pic.twitter.com/8Qa6xCaWtb — Ali (@ali_charts) May 2, 2025 This was in stark contrast to their behavior in late February and mid-March, when reports emerged left and right about big sell-offs. The overall market sentiment was a lot less favorable at the time as the trade war initiated by US President Trump struck all financial fields, and crypto was no exception. Now, though, while the tariff shock seems to be over, investors are gradually returning to the cryptocurrency space with large purchases. As reported earlier this week, whales accumulated $4 billion worth of BTC within just two weeks. In April, they went on an XRP buying spree as well, purchasing over 900,000,000 tokens. Although the number for ADA is smaller in both absolute terms and USD perspective, it still shows a massive behavior change. ADA’s price tumbled to a multi-month low of $0.5 in early April. It has recovered about 40% since then and now sits at $0.7. However, similar large purchases from whales are likely to have a positive long-term effect on its price if they continue to accumulate instead of selling.

A major legal battle between Ripple vs SEC has officially ended , and fresh efforts are underway to build clearer, fairer rules for digital assets. In a new Crypto In One Minute episode , Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, confirmed that the U.S. SEC has officially dropped all crypto-related lawsuits, including its long-standing case against Ripple. The final appeal was withdrawn in March 2025 , putting an end to years of legal battles. Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Ends While the SEC has closed all crypto cases, some people still believe the Ripple vs SEC isn’t over. But as crypto analyst Vincent Van Code pointed out, Alderoty has clearly stated that the case is done, ending all doubts with just a few words. Alderoty explained that the main problem was the lack of clear rules. For years, the SEC tried to control the crypto industry using old laws that weren’t made for digital assets. This led to confusion and unfair penalties for many crypto companies. Alderoty said, “You can’t punish an industry for rules it was never given.” Now, Ripple is working closely with lawmakers to help build new crypto laws that make sense. New Rules Will Protect and Support the Industry Ripple is helping design new laws with four big goals in mind: protecting consumers from scams, keeping markets safe, stopping bad actors, and supporting innovation. The goal is to make sure crypto can grow without harming the public. Alderoty believes this shift gives the U.S. a chance to lead in global digital finance by creating fair rules that help both companies and investors. Big Meeting Between Ripple and New SEC Chair Ripple’s Executive Chairman, Chris Larsen, met with new SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, on May 2, 2025 . Atkins, who was appointed under a more crypto-friendly administration, has already said the SEC should support the industry instead of slowing it down. This meeting could help bring even more clarity about XRP’s status and how Ripple’s technology fits into the future of finance. Is an XRP ETF Coming? With all this progress, excitement is building. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas predicts there’s now an 85% chance that an XRP ETF will be approved in 2025. XRP is currently trading at $2.23 , up over 3% in the last 24 hours. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,” US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in an April 30 court filing. Apple must make changes “effective immediately” “Effective immediately, Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users, nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases,” Rogers added. Rogers reiterated, “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence.” Source: Hector Lopez The ruling stated that Apple must not impose “any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app.” It added, “no reason exists to audit, monitor, track or require developers to report purchases or any other activity that consumers make outside an app.” It was ruled that Apple can't control how developers design or place links that lead users to buy items outside the app. Apple also cannot exclude “certain categories of apps and developers from obtaining link access.” Following the court ruling, several crypto industry participants noticed that Apple guidelines were updated, with some claiming that the tone of the guidelines suggests they weren’t too pleased with the ruling. Appfigures co-founder and CEO Ariel Michaeli said that people may find Apple’s “passive aggressive language confusing.” Related: FTX sues NFT Stars and Kurosemi in push to recover tokens Michaeli summarized Apple’s update as Apps can now link to an external non-fungible token (NFT) collection, can link outside of the App Store without needing an entitlement, and can link to an external payment system without requiring an entitlement. Crypto commentator “Xero” told their 50,000 X followers on May 2, “This is hugely bullish for mobile crypto games and apps.” Meanwhile, Alex Masmej said , “This is absolutely huge for crypto.” The same day, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said Epic would be relaunching Fortnite to the US Apple App Store. “Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,” Sweeney said. In August 2023, Justice Elena Kagan declined to let a federal appeals court decision take immediate effect as Epic had asked — with no explanation for the decision.

In a video shared on X, she revealed that Ripple has signed over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with many entities. According to the video, this is not just a theory, but a fact drawn directly from legal filings during the SEC case against Ripple. This revelation shows the scale of Ripple’s efforts to integrate its technology with banks, governments, and payment providers. The extent of these agreements, confirmed through court documents, indicates that Ripple’s expansion is well underway, just not publicly visible. According to Amelie, “Institutions don’t move until the regulatory green light flashes,” suggesting that these partners are waiting for full legal clarity before launching their integrations. WOW! OVER 1700 NDA‘S HAVE BEEN SIGNED BY RIPPLE! INSTITUTIONS DON‘T MOVE UNTIL THE REGULATORY GREENLIGHT FLASHES – THIS IS HOW THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM QUIETLY UPGRADES! #XRP ISN‘T JUST A BET – IT‘S THE FOUNDATION! pic.twitter.com/3Nb4XlhAKy — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 1, 2025 NDAs, Legal Firewalls, and the Path to Regulatory Readiness The existence of over 1,700 NDAs shows the guarded nature of Ripple’s institutional relationships. These agreements are standard practice when major financial infrastructure is being tested, particularly when regulatory approval is still pending. NDAs ensure that testing, pilot programs, and backend integrations can proceed without disclosing strategic plans to the public or competitors. The video also emphasized that this figure may only represent a portion of Ripple’s full network. Beyond the publicly known NDAs, there are likely additional engagements involving regulatory sandboxes, vendor partnerships, and international financial entities. The scale of involvement suggests Ripple’s long-term positioning across key sectors of the global economic system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple already has many known partnerships worldwide, and these NDAs show that the company’s network using XRP is much larger than many market participants expect. Ripple has repeatedly advocated for clear policy frameworks and global standards, including ISO 20022 compliance . When those frameworks are in place, the institutions under NDA can activate their systems, which could give XRP’s price a major boost as institutions flood the market. XRP Positioned as a Core Infrastructure Layer The use of XRP as part of this institutional framework is not a speculative matter but an integral part of Ripple’s ecosystem. With over 1,700 entities involved in confidential agreements, the role of XRP is being quietly cemented as a foundational component for cross-border settlement and liquidity provisioning. Like many investors, the institutions are waiting for the official end of the Ripple lawsuit. While the SEC has agreed to drop its appeal, institutions want full legal clarity before entering the market. The end of the lawsuit is near, as both parties have filed a joint motion showing that they have reached a settlement agreement.

Solana, on the other hand, shows hesitation as technical indicators tighten without clear direction. While these two giants battle for momentum, a rising contender is stealing attention, Remittix . With real-world payment utility, a powerful API, and a fast-moving presale already raising over $14.7 million, Remittix may just be the unexpected top gainer investors are watching for this May to determine the best crypto to buy now . Bitcoin Holds Steady Near $96k With Bullish Setup Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing strong bullish signals again, with analysts suggesting the king of crypto may be gearing up for its next major move. According to Rose Premium Signals , BTC’s current market setup mirrors previous successful breakout structures that triggered massive rallies in the past. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could finally be on track to hit six figures in the near term—a narrative that continues to excite long-term holders and institutional watchers alike. That said, the confirmation isn’t in yet. Analysts widely agree that BTC needs to post a consistent weekly close above its descending channel to officially reverse the current downtrend. Right now, BTC is hovering around $97,561 , with a key resistance level at $97,190. A clear breakout and close above that mark could unlock a much stronger uptrend, potentially leading to price targets at $118,476, then $136,753, and eventually $161,132. These levels aren’t just hype—they’re based on structural projections that map the path BTC could take if momentum sustains. But while Bitcoin’s chart looks increasingly bullish, not all major assets are following the same rhythm. Solana, for instance, is showing signs of hesitation, with its momentum cooling and volume thinning. That divergence in behavior is exactly why some traders are turning their attention to newer, high-potential tokens like Remittix. Solana Setup Suggests Volatility but Direction Remains Unclear Solana is back on traders’ radar, but the signals it’s flashing aren’t as clear-cut as Bitcoin’s recent bullish momentum. According to respected chart analyst Ali , SOL’s Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart are tightening—a setup that often hints at an incoming surge in volatility. Historically, this kind of squeeze has preceded large price movements, but it doesn’t confirm the direction of the breakout. That’s the catch. The Bollinger Bands, which consist of a middle moving average and two outer bands, are converging on the price, reflecting unusually low volatility. When this happens, it often means a big move is coming. SOL has been moving within a narrow range, and with the current price hovering around $150.14 , up 0.2% in the last 24 hours, traders are watching closely. But while the setup looks promising, it’s still unclear whether the breakout will push higher or take a bearish turn. That’s why many are hesitant to jump in without further confirmation from momentum or volume-based indicators. Compared to Bitcoin’s more decisive price action, Solana is walking a tightrope. The setup is there, but the certainty isn’t. That uncertainty is one of the reasons why many traders are diverting their attention toward emerging projects like Remittix. For May, SOL could break either way—but RTX is already breaking into the conversation as a potential top gainer of the month. Remittix Gains Ground as Investors Seek the Next Big Mover While Bitcoin looks ready to break higher and Solana sits in a zone of indecision, a new player, Remittix (RTX) , is gaining traction with real-world payments utility and explosive presale momentum and is quietly making a serious case for top gainer this May. Whales and early investors have already taken notice, with over 531 million RTX tokens scooped up and more than $14.7 million raised in presale. That kind of traction isn’t built on hype alone. Remittix is tapping into a real, immediate opportunity: the fractured $190 trillion global payments market. Instead of vague roadmaps or long-term promises, Remittix is delivering a working utility from day one. Its core function is simple yet powerful—converting crypto into over 30 fiat currencies and sending it straight to bank accounts with zero fuss. Transactions are fast, transparent, and cost just a flat 1%, with no foreign exchange fees. For freelancers, international businesses, and families relying on remittances, that’s a game changer. But Remittix isn’t stopping there. Its Pay API brings enterprise-grade solutions into the mix, letting companies accept crypto payments and settle in fiat seamlessly. This is the kind of infrastructure big firms want but rarely get from the average altcoin project. Add in a staking program offering up to 18% APY and a real-time use case for blockchain in global finance, and it’s easy to see why some believe RTX could outperform the market this month. While Bitcoin eyes six figures and Solana keeps traders guessing, Remittix is moving with precision, and it just might be the best crypto to buy now in May.

It’s easy to get swept up in the hype. But what if there was a way to get ahead of the curve? What if you could spot the next 100x crypto, the one that might make all the difference in your portfolio? This isn’t just about throwing money at any coin that catches your eye. It’s about choosing wisely—and understanding the ones that are setting the stage for something truly revolutionary. Enter Qubetics , XRP, and GateToken. Each one is bringing something different to the table, and 2025 could very well be their year to shine. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just dipping your toes into the world of blockchain, these coins have the potential to change the game. But what makes them stand out? Let’s break it down. Qubetics: The Decentralized VPN Revolutionizing Blockchain Connectivity Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency. It’s pushing the boundaries of blockchain innovation with its decentralized VPN, offering a solution that is as much about privacy as it is about opportunity. With the rise of data breaches and privacy concerns, more and more individuals and businesses are seeking ways to protect their online presence. Qubetics offers a decentralized VPN that promises to be the go-to solution for both professionals and everyday users looking for secure, anonymous internet access. The top crypto presale for Qubetics is already generating buzz. In its 32nd stage, over 510 million tokens have been sold to more than 25,600 holders, raising over $16.6 million. Analysts predict significant growth once the mainnet launches, with the $TICS token potentially seeing returns of 7066%. Here’s why Qubetics is becoming the top choice for the blockchain community: Decentralized VPN : The decentralized nature of Qubetics allows for a safer, more private internet experience for businesses, professionals, and everyday users. Strong Presale Performance : With its rapid sales and high demand, Qubetics has proven to be a hot ticket in the crypto space. Innovative Blockchain Tools : The Qubetics ecosystem includes tools like QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, making it an attractive option for developers and businesses looking to build on its platform. In a world where online privacy is more important than ever, Qubetics offers a unique solution that other coins simply don’t. The growth potential here is real, with analysts predicting a price of $15 after the mainnet launch. If you’re looking for a crypto that could see 100x returns, Qubetics should be at the top of your list. XRP News: Ripple’s Strategic Moves and Market Dynamics Ripple executed a significant transaction, moving approximately 500 million XRP tokens across its internal wallets. This action was part of the company’s monthly escrow unlock, a routine process where a portion of XRP held in escrow is released. Following the release, Ripple promptly relocked 700 million XRP tokens, demonstrating its commitment to maintaining a controlled supply and mitigating potential market volatility. This move has sparked discussions within the crypto community about Ripple’s strategic intentions and its impact on XRP’s market dynamics.​ In addition to the escrow activities, Ripple’s Executive Chairman, Chris Larsen, is scheduled to meet with SEC Chair Paul Atkins on May 2, 2025. This high-level meeting is anticipated to address ongoing regulatory discussions, including the classification of XRP and the potential approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The outcome of this meeting could have significant implications for XRP’s regulatory standing and its future in the broader financial ecosystem. GateToken (GT) GateToken (GT), the native token of Gate.io, has recently been recognized as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies for Q2 2025. Analysts highlight GT’s strong performance and its integral role within the Gate.io ecosystem, which includes staking, fee discounts, and governance participation. The token’s utility and the platform’s expanding user base contribute to its positive outlook in the current market. ​ In addition to its market performance, Gate.io has been actively enhancing its platform’s security and user experience. The exchange recently conducted an emergency system upgrade to improve its infrastructure. During this upgrade, futures services were temporarily suspended, though spot trading, deposits, and withdrawals remained unaffected. Gate.io has pledged 100% compensation to users affected by this temporary suspension, demonstrating its commitment to user satisfaction and platform reliability. ​ These developments underscore GateToken’s growing significance in the cryptocurrency market and Gate.io’s dedication to providing a secure and efficient trading environment. Decentralized VPN: The Future of Online Privacy When it comes to blockchain technology, the potential for decentralized VPNs is huge. A decentralized VPN removes the need for centralized intermediaries, offering a more secure and private internet experience. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on a central server, decentralized VPNs utilize a distributed network of nodes to route traffic, making it harder for hackers to intercept or track users’ data. Some key benefits of decentralized VPNs include: Enhanced Privacy : Your data is encrypted and routed through a decentralized network, making it more secure and harder to trace. Freedom from Censorship: Because the network is decentralized, users are less likely to face government censorship or restrictions on internet access. Better Security : With multiple nodes in different locations, decentralized VPNs offer more robust security features than traditional VPN services. Qubetics is leading the way in this space, offering a decentralized VPN that can benefit both businesses and individuals looking for a secure, private browsing experience.

44097593,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154781,1746253836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Frozen Bitcoin: Crucial Breakthrough in Recovering Stolen Funds After Major Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/frozen-bitcoin-recovery-funds/,"Imagine waking up to find hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency simply gone. That’s the nightmare scenario faced recently when a significant Bitcoin hack occurred, resulting in the theft of 3,520 BTC, valued at a staggering $330.7 million at the time. Hacks of this magnitude send ripples of shock through the entire crypto community, highlighting the ever-present risks in the digital asset space. Understanding the Massive Bitcoin Hack Earlier this week, reports surfaced about a specific wallet address being compromised. The details are still emerging, but the outcome was clear and devastating: a massive amount of Bitcoin was illicitly moved out of the wallet. This wasn’t a small phishing scam; the scale suggests a sophisticated attack targeting significant holdings. While the exact methods used by the attackers are often kept confidential during investigations, such large-scale thefts can involve complex exploits, compromised private keys, or breaches of related infrastructure. The initial news was grim. Over three thousand Bitcoins, a fortune by any standard, vanished into the labyrinthine world of blockchain transactions. For the victim, this represented a catastrophic loss. For the wider market, it served as a stark reminder that even in the supposedly secure realm of crypto, vulnerabilities exist, and vigilance is paramount. The Power of On-Chain Analysis in Tracking Stolen Crypto In the wake of a crypto theft, the blockchain itself becomes the primary tool for investigation. Unlike traditional finance, where funds might disappear into opaque accounts, cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on public ledgers. This is where the crucial work of on-chain analysis comes into play. On-chain sleuths, often operating pseudonymously like the well-known ZachXBT, are experts at following the money trail on the blockchain. They analyze transaction patterns, identify suspicious movements, cluster addresses likely controlled by the same entity, and try to trace stolen funds as they are moved, mixed, or sent to exchanges. It’s a digital detective game requiring deep technical knowledge and persistence. In this specific case, ZachXBT was instrumental in tracking the movement of the stolen Bitcoin . By meticulously following the transactions originating from the compromised wallet, they were able to identify where portions of the funds were being sent. This tracking is a critical first step in any crypto recovery effort. Key aspects of on-chain analysis include: Transaction Tracing: Following funds hop-by-hop across the blockchain. Address Clustering: Identifying multiple addresses controlled by the same entity based on transaction history. Flow Analysis: Understanding how funds are being dispersed, mixed, or consolidated. Exchange Identification: Pinpointing when stolen funds arrive at centralized exchanges. This analytical work is vital because while the blockchain is public, identifying the real-world individuals behind addresses is the main challenge. However, when stolen funds hit regulated entities like centralized exchanges, there’s a potential choke point where real-world identity verification might be linked to the digital assets. How Binance Security Helped Freeze Bitcoin Following the trail through on-chain analysis often leads investigators to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Attackers frequently attempt to cash out or convert stolen funds on these platforms. This is where the collaboration between blockchain analysts and exchanges becomes incredibly powerful in facilitating crypto recovery . According to reports confirmed by ZachXBT, a portion of the stolen Bitcoin , specifically around $7 million worth, was traced to accounts on the Binance exchange. Upon being alerted to the presence of these potentially illicit funds, the Binance security team took swift action. Their cooperation was crucial in identifying the specific accounts and, importantly, freezing the assets held within them. The ability to frozen Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on an exchange is a significant step in the recovery process. It prevents the attackers from moving the funds further, converting them to fiat, or distributing them in a way that makes them harder to trace and reclaim. This action demonstrates the vital role that major, compliant exchanges play in combating crypto crime. Here’s why exchange collaboration is key: Exchanges often have KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures, potentially linking blockchain addresses to real-world identities. They have the technical infrastructure to identify and restrict transactions from specific addresses or accounts flagged as suspicious. They can cooperate with law enforcement and victims in asset recovery processes. The fact that Binance was able to act quickly and effectively to frozen Bitcoin highlights the importance of robust security protocols and a willingness to collaborate with the community and investigators. While $7 million is a fraction of the total $330 million stolen, it’s a tangible win in a challenging situation and offers a glimmer of hope for potential further recovery. The Challenges of Crypto Recovery: Why Freezing is Just One Step While freezing $7 million in frozen Bitcoin is a significant positive development, it’s important to understand the immense challenges that still lie ahead in achieving full crypto recovery . Recovering stolen cryptocurrency is notoriously difficult for several reasons: Speed and Dispersion: Attackers often move funds rapidly across multiple addresses, chains, and mixing services to obscure the trail. Decentralization: Many crypto transactions occur peer-to-peer or on decentralized platforms that lack a central authority to freeze assets. Jurisdictional Issues: Stolen funds can be moved across international borders, involving complex legal processes to seize assets in different countries. Identity Obfuscation: While transactions are public, linking addresses to verified identities requires cooperation from centralized entities or extensive off-chain investigation. Mixers and Tumblers: Services designed to pool and mix funds make it extremely hard to trace the origin of specific coins. Freezing funds on a centralized exchange is often the easiest part of the recovery process. The harder steps involve navigating legal systems to prove ownership of the frozen assets and obtain court orders for their return. This can be a lengthy and expensive process, often requiring international cooperation. What This Bitcoin Hack Incident Tells Us About Crypto Security Every major Bitcoin hack serves as a critical learning event for the entire ecosystem. This incident underscores several key points regarding crypto security : 1. No System is Impenetrable: Even seemingly secure wallets or platforms can be vulnerable. Users and institutions must remain vigilant. 2. The Value of On-Chain Analysis: The ability to track funds on the blockchain is a powerful tool in combating crime and is essential for any hope of recovery. 3. The Critical Role of Centralized Exchanges: While decentralization is a core crypto principle, centralized exchanges remain vital gateways and, importantly, potential points for intervention and asset freezing when collaborating with investigators and authorities. 4. The Need for Collaboration: Effective crime fighting in the crypto space requires close cooperation between on-chain analysts, exchanges, law enforcement, and victims. 5. User Responsibility: This hack, like many others, is a reminder for individuals to prioritize wallet security, use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and be wary of phishing attempts. Actionable Insights for Staying Safe and Supporting Crypto Recovery Efforts Based on incidents like this major Bitcoin hack , what can individuals and entities do? For Individuals: Strengthen Wallet Security: Use hardware wallets for significant holdings. Be extremely cautious with hot wallets and exchange accounts. Enable 2FA: Always use strong two-factor authentication, preferably not SMS-based. Be Phishing Aware: Double-check URLs, never share private keys or seed phrases. Use Reputable Exchanges: Choose exchanges with strong security track records and clear policies on asset recovery assistance. Monitor Addresses: Regularly check your wallet addresses for unexpected activity. For Exchanges and Institutions: Enhance Security Protocols: Continuously update and test security measures against evolving threats. Improve On-Chain Monitoring: Implement sophisticated tools to detect suspicious activity and incoming funds from known illicit sources. Streamline Collaboration: Establish clear procedures for working with law enforcement and on-chain analysts when hacks occur. Educate Users: Provide resources and guidance on best security practices. Every successful instance of freezing or recovering funds, even a portion of a large theft, contributes to building confidence in the ecosystem’s ability to fight back against criminals and strengthens the case for crypto recovery as a viable outcome. A Glimmer of Hope: The Significance of Freezing Funds While the majority of the stolen funds from this particular Bitcoin hack remain unrecovered, the fact that $7 million was successfully traced and frozen with the help of Binance security is a significant positive development. It sends a strong message to potential attackers: the blockchain leaves a trail, the community is watching, and centralized entities can and will cooperate to prevent the liquidation of stolen assets. This successful freezing action is a testament to the growing maturity of the crypto ecosystem’s ability to respond to criminal activity. It highlights the effectiveness of combining decentralized public ledger data with the centralized control points offered by exchanges. While the path to reclaiming the frozen Bitcoin is complex, this step is a crucial victory in a difficult battle. Conclusion: Fighting Back Against Crypto Crime The recent massive Bitcoin hack serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in the digital asset world. However, the swift action taken by on-chain analysis experts like ZachXBT and the crucial support from Binance security in helping to freeze $7 million in frozen Bitcoin demonstrates the powerful countermeasures available to the community. While the bulk of the stolen funds remain at large, this incident underscores the vital importance of collaboration between analysts, exchanges, and victims in the ongoing fight for crypto recovery . It’s a complex battle, but every successful step in tracing, freezing, and potentially recovering stolen assets strengthens the ecosystem and makes it a less attractive target for criminals.

On Friday, Seth Wilks and Raj Mukherjee were reportedly told to accept deferred resignations, meaning they’re still technically employed for a few months, but they’ve already been pushed out and placed on paid leave. The orders were part of a government-wide cleanout that started earlier this year. DOGE is leading that charge. Both Wilks and Mukherjee came from the private crypto sector before joining the IRS. Seth used to be a vice president at TaxBit, and Raj previously worked as head of tax for Binance.US and also held a senior role at ConsenSys. The two had barely been in office since February 2024, when they were brought in to help rebuild the agency’s approach to taxing crypto. Trump’s DOGE campaign forces mass exit of crypto officials They were hired to lead compliance, reporting, and crypto enforcement programs. They had also been managing the agency’s work with the crypto industry itself. Their biggest known task was helping launch a new tax form, the 1099-DA, which rolled out last summer. That form was meant to help Americans report income and trades linked to crypto. Both officials were also working on new IRS rules tailored to the crypto space. One rule they helped finish, right before the Biden administration ended, targeted DeFi brokers with tough new data collection demands. That rule got wiped out earlier this year through the Congressional Review Act, with President Trump signing the joint resolution. It was one of the first signs that DOGE wasn’t just trimming staff — it was rewriting the government’s approach to crypto regulation altogether. Seth held the title of executive director of digital asset strategy and development, while Raj served as executive director of the digital assets office. They were the most senior crypto officers inside the IRS. But according to CoinDesk, they both accepted voluntary buyout offers ahead of a much larger round of staff cuts. The federal government had already warned that IRS reductions were coming fast. Over 20,000 IRS employees have already signed onto the same deferred resignation plan, as reported last month by the New York Times. Everyone in that program is being placed on paid leave until September, after which most won’t return. That’s part of the DOGE directive to cut down bloated staffing left behind by the Biden administration. The IRS had been expanded by roughly 20,000 workers under Biden’s leadership, with the goal of pulling in more tax revenue. But Trump’s team is doing the opposite. They’re slashing those numbers and focusing on “efficiency,” as confirmed by a Treasury Department spokesperson. “The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy and customer service the American people deserve,” the spokesperson said on behalf of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Even higher up, the exits didn’t stop at crypto officers. Melanie Krause, the IRS’s acting commissioner, also left. She wasn’t alone. Several top officials left with her after the agency agreed to start sharing taxpayer data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That decision came directly from the Trump administration and was meant to aid the deportation of undocumented immigrants. The IRS has always kept taxpayer data confidential. That change triggered internal unrest and pushed several longtime officials to walk. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The European Union has passed a powerful new law, the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), which will change how crypto works in Europe starting July 1, 2027. Meanwhile, anonymous wallets or privacy-focused coins will be banned completely. Here is the list of coins, check if you hold any. If you do, here’s what you might need to consider next. No More Anonymous Crypto or Privacy Coins The days of anonymous crypto accounts are nearing an end, as the European Union takes a firm step toward tighter oversight . This major change is part of the EU’s new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), which aims to stop illegal activity by making all crypto transactions traceable. In addition to banning anonymous accounts, the regulation includes a direct ban on tokens that enhance privacy and obscure transactions. Meanwhile, any crypto transaction over €1,000 will now require full ID verification. No matter what platform you use, bank, app, or crypto exchange, you’ll need to complete full KYC (Know Your Customer) checks to use their services List of Coins Which Are Banned The EU’s new rules will make it illegal for crypto platforms to list or support privacy coins. This includes popular tokens like Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Dash (DASH) — all known for hiding user transactions. If you currently hold any of these coins, you’ll need to plan and explore your options before the ban takes effect in July 2027. Meet AMLA – The New Crypto Watchdog To make sure these rules are followed, the EU is setting up a brand-new authority called AMLA (Anti-Money Laundering Authority). Starting in 2027, AMLA will directly oversee larger crypto platforms that operate in at least six EU countries. Around 40 major players are expected to be selected for direct monitoring. Companies handling over €50 million in transactions or serving more than 20,000 customers in a single country will fall under this watch. What Should Crypto Users Do Now? If you’re using platforms that offer anonymous services or privacy coins, it’s time to start planning ahead.

44097896,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154786,1746254446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,IRS Crypto Tax Experts Resign: Decoding Their Move to D.O.G.E.,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/irs-crypto-tax-resignations/,"In a significant development for the world of crypto tax and regulation, two prominent figures hired by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to bolster its efforts in crypto compliance and enforcement have reportedly resigned. Seth Wilks and Raj Mukherjee, who joined the IRS last year with mandates to enhance the agency’s capacity to handle digital asset taxation, are now moving to new roles with an entity known as the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). This news, reported by CoinDesk, raises questions about the future trajectory of IRS crypto tax initiatives and the potential implications of their departure. Why Were These Experts Crucial for IRS Crypto Tax Efforts? The IRS has been increasingly focused on closing the “tax gap” related to cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. As the crypto market grew, so did the complexity of tracking and taxing digital assets. Recognizing the need for specialized expertise, the IRS brought in individuals with deep experience in both the crypto industry and government relations concerning technology and finance. Seth Wilks: Formerly the VP of Government Relations at TaxBit, a leading provider of crypto tax software. His background indicates a strong understanding of the intersection between tax policy, technology, and the crypto ecosystem, as well as experience in navigating regulatory landscapes. Raj Mukherjee: An executive from Binance US, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. His operational experience within a major crypto platform would have provided invaluable insight into how digital asset transactions occur, how data is structured, and the challenges faced by exchanges in meeting reporting requirements. These hires were seen as a strategic move by the IRS to bring in talent that could bridge the gap between traditional tax enforcement mechanisms and the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and digital assets. Their work was centered on developing and implementing programs aimed at improving cryptocurrency reporting, ensuring compliance among taxpayers and platforms, and strengthening enforcement actions against non-compliance. What Does Their Resignation Mean for Crypto Tax Enforcement? The departure of key personnel like Wilks and Mukherjee could potentially impact the pace and effectiveness of crypto tax enforcement within the IRS. While the agency undoubtedly has other dedicated professionals, losing individuals with their specific blend of industry insight and regulatory experience could present challenges. Their roles involved intricate work on: Developing clearer guidance for taxpayers and tax professionals regarding crypto transactions. Enhancing the IRS’s capabilities to identify unreported crypto activity. Collaborating with crypto platforms to improve data reporting standards. Formulating strategies for compliance checks and audits related to digital assets. The continuity of these programs and initiatives might face disruptions as new personnel step in or existing staff take on additional responsibilities. This doesn’t necessarily mean a halt to enforcement, but it could potentially slow down progress on certain fronts or require a period of adjustment. Why the Move to the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.)? The move to the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this development. The name itself is unusual and could prompt various interpretations, especially within the crypto community familiar with meme culture. Based on the report, D.O.G.E. is presented as an entity focused on government efficiency. Without further public information on D.O.G.E., the exact nature of their new roles and how their expertise in crypto and tax will be utilized remains subject to speculation. Potential reasons or implications for such a move could include: A shift towards a broader mandate beyond just tax, focusing on how blockchain and digital assets can improve government operations or efficiency in general. Opportunities within D.O.G.E. that better align with their long-term career goals or offer new challenges. A potential focus on advising various government departments on digital asset technology and policy, rather than solely tax enforcement. Perhaps D.O.G.E. is a newly formed or expanding entity with significant resources and a compelling vision for leveraging technology in the public sector. The transition of experts from a specific enforcement role within the IRS to a potentially broader efficiency-focused role in D.O.G.E. is a notable pivot. It suggests their skills are valuable across different government functions, or perhaps indicates a new direction in how their expertise will be applied. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation and Compliance? The broader landscape of crypto regulation and compliance in the U.S. is complex and involves multiple agencies beyond the IRS, including the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, and others. While these resignations are specific to the IRS’s tax division, they occur within this larger regulatory context. Challenges in crypto regulation include: Defining different types of digital assets (securities, commodities, currencies). Developing consistent and clear rules across various use cases (trading, DeFi, NFTs). Ensuring international cooperation on regulatory and enforcement matters. Attracting and retaining talent with the necessary technical and financial expertise within government agencies. The departure of experts can highlight the challenges government agencies face in competing with the private sector for talent in specialized fields like crypto and blockchain. It underscores the ongoing need for agencies to build internal capacity and expertise. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders Regardless of personnel changes at the IRS, the fundamental requirement for U.S. taxpayers to report and pay taxes on their cryptocurrency gains and income remains unchanged. This development serves as a reminder of the IRS’s continued focus on this area. Key takeaways for crypto holders: Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest IRS guidance on cryptocurrency. Maintain Records: Accurately track all cryptocurrency transactions, including purchases, sales, trades, and income (like staking rewards, airdrops). Understand Taxable Events: Be aware of which activities trigger a taxable event (generally selling, trading, or using crypto to pay for goods/services). Consider Professional Help: Consult with a tax professional experienced in cryptocurrency to ensure accurate reporting and compliance. Utilizing specialized crypto tax software can also be highly beneficial. While the specifics of IRS enforcement strategies may evolve, the obligation to comply with tax laws is constant. Proactive record-keeping and seeking expert advice are the best ways to navigate the complexities of blockchain and digital asset taxation. Conclusion: A Noteworthy Shift in the Crypto Regulatory Landscape The resignations of Seth Wilks and Raj Mukherjee from the IRS mark a noteworthy moment in the ongoing development of cryptocurrency tax enforcement in the United States. These individuals brought valuable, specialized experience from the private sector to a government agency grappling with the complexities of digital assets. Their move to the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) opens a new chapter, the details of which are yet to fully unfold. While their departure from the IRS tax unit might pose short-term challenges for specific programs, it also perhaps signals a broader application of their expertise within the government structure or highlights the dynamic nature of talent movement in the crypto space. For taxpayers, the core message remains clear: crypto compliance is essential, and the IRS continues to build its capacity, albeit with changing personnel, to ensure reporting requirements are met.

Deaton believes it’s because Circle sees a much larger opportunity ahead. According to Deaton, Circle is now focused on its upcoming IPO, expecting a potential valuation close to $10 billion, especially with favorable regulatory shifts and rising institutional interest in crypto. Circle filed its S-1 with the SEC on April 1, 2025, planning to list on the NYSE under the ticker “CRCL,” with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup as lead underwriters. The IPO is expected this summer. Circle is aiming for a valuation between $4 billion and $5 billion for its IPO.… https://t.co/G8WijZzg9g — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) May 2, 2025 Circle IPO Momentum Grows Circle officially filed its S-1 with the U.S. SEC on April 1 and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “CRCL.” Backed by financial giants JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup as lead underwriters, the IPO is expected to launch this summer. While its current IPO target is between $4 billion and $5 billion, Deaton believes market conditions and improved regulations could drive its valuation much higher, possibly matching its $9 billion target from a failed SPAC attempt in 2022. Crypto Eri explained that Ripple probably doesn’t want to buy Circle just to make money. Instead, Ripple could be trying to reduce competition. By owning Circle, Ripple would gain control over USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin in the market after Tether (USDT). That would help Ripple dominate the stablecoin space, push smaller competitors aside, and also get access to Circle’s payment network, which is expected to grow big time once Circle goes public through its IPO. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tether’s New U.S. Stablecoin Set to Launch Amid Trump’s Pro-Crypto Push , Regulatory Winds Turn in Crypto’s Favor Moreover, the US regulations are changing fitting to crypto needs. Under the new administration, crypto regulation is taking a more supportive turn. One major step is the STABLE GENIUS Act , which lays out a clear framework for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. The bill offers state-level oversight for issuers with under $10 billion in assets and federal regulation for larger players, with strict audit and compliance standards. Deaton says this new clarity, combined with political momentum and investor confidence, makes a $10 billion IPO valuation for Circle entirely possible. Rejecting Ripple’s $5B offer suggests Circle is confident in its long-term value and wants to go public on its terms. Overall, Ripple’s bid may have been a strategic move, but Circle is signaling it doesn’t need a buyer; it needs a runway.

Speaking at a “Crypto In One Minute” session shared via Ripple’s official channels, Alderoty noted that the SEC’s move signifies a broader realization that enforcement actions cannot be effectively pursued without clear regulatory frameworks for crypto in the U.S..

A recent announcement offering exclusive access to a White House tour and dinner for top holders of his TRUMP memecoin has sparked ethical concerns from both sides of the aisle. GOP Senators Criticize Trump’s Crypto Incentives Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Lisa Murkowski have voiced concern over the implications of Trump’s crypto-driven incentives. According to a report from CNBC on May 2, Lummis said that the idea of the president offering White House access to token holders “gives [her] pause.” Murkowski echoed those concerns, stating plainly, “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour.” The criticism stems from Trump’s April 23 announcement that top holders of his TRUMP memecoin would be eligible to apply for a White House dinner and tour—a move many interpreted as monetizing presidential access. Legislative Support Despite Reservations Despite her reservations about Trump’s memecoin strategy, Senator Lummis also took to social media on May 2 to praise the former president’s support for crypto legislation. She posted a video on X in which she said she was “particularly pleased” with Trump’s backing of the BITCOIN Act—short for Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide. The act would formalize a strategic national reserve of Bitcoin in the United States, aligning with Trump’s recent pro-crypto rhetoric. This duality illustrates the complicated position many lawmakers face: balancing concern over ethical optics with policy alignment on digital assets. Ongoing Ethics Concerns and Accusations The TRUMP token, launched on January 17, has drawn significant criticism from both lawmakers and the crypto community. Critics argue that it creates potential conflicts of interest and could open the door for foreign influence in U.S. politics by enabling anonymous crypto transfers that benefit Trump directly. “Trump once claimed he is so rich he cannot be bought,” said Craig Holman, an ethics specialist with Public Citizen. “But his obsession with money means he apparently can be bought for a meme.” Holman’s remark underscores the perception that the memecoin scheme may be undermining the very principles Trump once touted. Impeachment Demands Resurface The controversy escalated when Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff called for Trump’s impeachment during a town hall meeting on April 25. Ossoff criticized the TRUMP coin dinner offer as a form of “selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him,” framing the move as a blatant conflict of interest. Though Trump was impeached twice during his presidency and acquitted both times, the memecoin saga has reignited impeachment talk—this time from the perspective of financial impropriety. Who Will Dine With Trump? With the planned dinner set for May 22, speculation has swirled around who might actually attend. The TRUMP coin leaderboard lists top wallet holders, though only usernames are visible. This has led to rumors that high-profile figures like Tron founder Justin Sun or Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be among the invitees. As of May 2, neither individual nor their companies had confirmed any involvement, leaving the dinner’s guest list shrouded in uncertainty. Ethical and Political Ramifications Continue to Unfold As Trump continues to build his crypto presence, his memecoin initiative stands at the intersection of innovation and political controversy. While some view it as a clever move to rally support and funding from a tech-savvy base, others see it as a dangerous precedent that commercializes access to political power. Whether this controversy fades or grows into a larger ethical scandal remains to be seen—but the pushback from both Democrats and Republicans suggests that this is more than just a digital gimmick. It’s a political flashpoint in the ongoing debate over crypto’s role in government and campaign finance.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-03 06:50:11
44098164,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154791,1746255029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin’s Astonishing Climb: Overtakes Silver in Asset Ranking,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-surpasses-silver-asset/,"A significant shift is happening in the world of finance and assets. Bitcoin , the pioneering cryptocurrency, has officially surpassed silver in terms of market capitalization, claiming its spot as the world’s seventh-largest asset. According to data from Infinite Market Cap, Bitcoin’s market cap recently soared to approximately $1.92 trillion. This monumental figure pushes it past the total market value of silver, an asset with thousands of years of history as a store of value and industrial metal. This milestone is more than just a number; it represents a growing acceptance and recognition of digital assets on a global scale. Bitcoin’s Market Cap: A New Era Unfolds The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital experiment to a multi-trillion-dollar asset has been nothing short of remarkable. Launched in 2009, it started with virtually no market value. Over the years, its price and adoption have seen exponential growth, punctuated by periods of intense volatility. Surpassing silver is a symbolic victory, placing Bitcoin among traditional financial heavyweights like gold, major tech companies, and national debt markets. This climb up the asset rankings reflects increasing institutional interest, greater accessibility through regulated products like spot ETFs, and a growing narrative around Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The $1.92 trillion figure isn’t static; market caps fluctuate constantly with price changes. However, maintaining a position above silver for a sustained period solidifies its standing in the global asset landscape. Understanding Bitcoin vs Silver: A Tale of Two Assets Comparing Bitcoin vs Silver is fascinating because they represent fundamentally different asset classes – one physical, tangible, and ancient; the other digital, intangible, and modern. Yet, both have been discussed as potential stores of value or hedges. Here’s a brief comparison: Nature: Silver is a physical commodity, mined from the earth. Bitcoin is a digital asset, created and secured through cryptographic processes on a decentralized network. Supply: Silver’s supply increases gradually through mining, though its total availability is unknown. Bitcoin has a strictly limited supply capped at 21 million coins, making it deflationary by design. Use Cases: Silver has extensive industrial uses (electronics, solar panels, jewelry) in addition to its investment appeal. Bitcoin’s primary use cases are as a digital store of value, a medium of exchange (though less common for everyday transactions), and a programmable money layer. History: Silver has been used as money and a store of value for millennia. Bitcoin has just over a decade of history. Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has been significantly more volatile than silver, experiencing larger and more rapid price swings. Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere globally with an internet connection, 24/7. Silver requires physical handling, storage, and traditional financial systems for transfer. While silver’s value is tied to both its scarcity and its industrial demand, Bitcoin’s value is derived from its fixed supply, network security, decentralization, and increasing adoption as ‘digital gold’. Driving Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Ascent Several key factors have contributed to Bitcoin’s rapid rise and its ability to surpass traditional assets like silver: Institutional Adoption: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets like the U.S. have opened the floodgates for institutional capital and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The Halving Event: Bitcoin’s supply issuance is cut in half approximately every four years, an event known as the ‘halving’. This programmed scarcity reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, historically acting as a catalyst for price appreciation due to supply constraints. Macroeconomic Environment: Concerns about inflation, currency debasement, and global economic instability have driven some investors to seek alternative stores of value outside of traditional fiat currencies and assets. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it appealing in this context. Increased Awareness and Accessibility: As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, understanding and access points (exchanges, wallets, regulated products) improve, bringing more participants into the market. These factors combine to create strong demand dynamics against a predictable and limited supply, underpinning Bitcoin’s impressive market cap growth. The Appeal of the Crypto Asset: Why Investors Are Watching Beyond just Bitcoin, the broader category of Crypto asset classes is gaining traction. Investors are increasingly recognizing the unique properties that digital assets offer: Decentralization: Unlike traditional assets controlled by central banks or governments, many crypto assets, including Bitcoin, operate on decentralized networks, reducing single points of failure and censorship risk. Scarcity and Predictability: The transparent and often capped supply of many cryptocurrencies offers a predictable inflation schedule, a stark contrast to the potentially unlimited printing of fiat money. Global Accessibility: Crypto markets operate 24/7, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate, regardless of geographical location or traditional banking access. Innovation: The underlying blockchain technology enables new financial applications (DeFi), digital ownership (NFTs), and programmable money that are not possible with traditional assets. Bitcoin, as the largest and most established crypto asset, often serves as the gateway for investors exploring this new digital frontier. Challenges and Considerations for Digital Gold While Bitcoin’s rise is impressive, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks associated with this Digital Gold narrative and the asset itself: Volatility: Despite its growth, Bitcoin remains significantly more volatile than traditional assets like gold or silver. Large price swings can occur rapidly, posing risks for investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. New regulations could impact how Bitcoin is traded, held, or used. Security Risks: While the Bitcoin network itself is highly secure, individual investors face risks related to wallet security, exchange hacks, and phishing scams. Environmental Concerns: The energy consumption of Bitcoin mining (using Proof-of-Work) is a significant concern and subject to ongoing debate and efforts towards sustainability. Market Manipulation: The relatively young and less regulated nature of crypto markets can make them susceptible to manipulation. Investing in Bitcoin requires careful consideration of these factors and is not suitable for everyone. What Does This Milestone Mean for Your Portfolio? Bitcoin’s market cap surpassing silver doesn’t automatically mean you should buy Bitcoin. However, it highlights the increasing importance of this asset class in the global financial ecosystem. For investors, this milestone could mean: Revisiting Assumptions: Traditional asset allocation models may need to consider digital assets like Bitcoin. Due Diligence is Key: Understand the technology, the risks, and your own investment goals before investing. Long-Term Perspective: Many view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value rather than a short-term trade. Diversification: For some, a small allocation to digital assets might fit within a diversified portfolio strategy, acknowledging the high risk but also the potential for high reward. Consulting with a financial advisor familiar with digital assets is always recommended. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent past silver in market capitalization is a historic moment. It underscores the rapid evolution of the financial world and the growing acceptance of digital assets. While challenges remain, the trajectory suggests that Bitcoin and the broader crypto asset class are becoming increasingly difficult for traditional finance to ignore. This milestone isn’t the end, but rather another significant step in Bitcoin’s journey to becoming a globally recognized and substantial asset.

This news, initially reported by Wu Blockchain on X, indicates a potential shift in how some media companies view their corporate finance strategies. What Does the SEC Filing Reveal? Thumzup Media recently filed a Form S-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This type of filing allows a company to register securities for a potential offering, providing flexibility to raise capital over time. The filing proposes offering securities valued at up to $200 million. Crucially, the S-3 filing outlines the intended use of the net proceeds from this potential offering. While general corporate purposes are listed, the filing specifically mentions two key areas: Funding working capital and other general corporate needs. Purchasing Bitcoin to be held as a primary treasury reserve asset. This explicit mention of acquiring Bitcoin for the corporate treasury is what has captured the attention of the market, placing Thumzup Media in the spotlight regarding its financial and investment approach. Why Are Companies Adopting a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy ? The concept of holding Bitcoin on a company’s balance sheet gained significant traction following pioneers like MicroStrategy. The motivations behind such a move are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin can serve as a digital store of value similar to gold. Potential Appreciation: Anticipating long-term price increases in Bitcoin. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional treasury holdings. Innovation & Signaling: Demonstrating a forward-thinking approach and potentially attracting investors interested in the digital asset space. For Thumzup Media , a company operating in the dynamic media landscape, adopting a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy could align with a tech-savvy brand image and potentially offer a unique financial advantage. Is This Part of a Larger Trend in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption ? Absolutely. Thumzup Media’s filing is another data point in the ongoing trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While major financial institutions and investment funds have been active in the crypto space, corporate treasury adoption is a distinct and significant movement. It signifies a deeper integration of digital assets into traditional corporate finance. Other notable examples include: Company Industry Status of Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Aggressively accumulating Bitcoin as primary treasury reserve. Tesla Automotive & Clean Energy Holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services Holds Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Each company has its unique reasons and strategies, but the common thread is the decision to allocate a portion of corporate funds to Bitcoin. Thumzup Media’s potential entry into this group, particularly from the media sector, could encourage other companies in similar industries to consider the asset. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for Thumzup Media ? Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s value increases, the treasury holdings could grow significantly. Inflation Protection: May preserve purchasing power better than cash in inflationary environments. Investor Interest: Could attract investors bullish on Bitcoin and digital assets. Balance Sheet Strength: A valuable asset could potentially strengthen the balance sheet (though accounting rules are complex). Challenges and Risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, which could lead to significant fluctuations in the company’s reported earnings and balance sheet value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and varies globally. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex and may impact financial reporting. Security Risks: Storing and managing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols. Public Perception: While growing, corporate crypto adoption can still be viewed with skepticism by some stakeholders. Thumzup Media will need to carefully navigate these challenges should they proceed with significant Bitcoin Treasury purchases. Actionable Insights from This Development For investors and market observers, Thumzup Media’s SEC Filing provides several points to consider: Monitor Thumzup’s Progress: Watch for updates on the securities offering and any subsequent announcements regarding actual Bitcoin purchases. Industry Trend: See if other companies, particularly in the media or technology sectors, follow suit. Understand Corporate Motivations: Analyze the specific reasons companies provide for adopting a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . Assess Risk Tolerance: Recognize that companies holding Bitcoin are exposed to its price volatility. Concluding Thoughts: A New Player in the Bitcoin Treasury Space? Thumzup Media’s filing is a clear statement of intent. By explicitly including Bitcoin purchases as a use of proceeds from a potential $200 million securities offering, the company signals a strong interest in digital assets as part of its long-term financial strategy. While the actual purchases depend on the success of the offering and subsequent decisions, this move underscores the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset among publicly traded companies. It’s a development that further cements the narrative of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and highlights the evolving nature of corporate finance in the digital age.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stepped in after the city’s dollar hit the strong end of its peg, pushing toward 7.75 per dollar, and this was the first time since 2020 they took this specific action. An official at the HKMA’s New York office reportedly confirmed to Bloomberg that the purchases were real, done by phone, and done fast. The decision was triggered by the drop in the value of the US dollar, which had been dragging the Hong Kong dollar to levels that risked snapping the peg entirely. The HKMA, acting as the city’s central bank, had previously intervened by selling dollars in 2022 and 2023 when the local currency was getting too weak and about to break below 7.85. This time, they had to flip the strategy. This was real-world emergency management to defend a system that’s been around since the ’80s. China watches Fannie Mae while shifting away from Treasuries As the HKMA moved in the markets, Taiwan’s central bank did the same. On the same Friday, Taiwan’s dollar jumped 3% against the greenback — the biggest one-day move since 1988. Their central bank had no choice but to intervene too. Regionally, every monetary authority is now dealing with currency swings, and no one’s sitting still. Earlier this year, a headline about President Donald Trump’s overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reached the desks of China’s foreign exchange regulators. That got Beijing’s full attention. Officials at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (Safe) immediately told their team to look into the investment risks tied to that change. Both Fannie and Freddie are mortgage companies that turn home loans into investment products. The US government took them over in the 2008 crash, but Trump now wants them out of government hands. What stood out to the Chinese officials was the idea of mortgage-backed securities that still carry an implied US government guarantee. Safe considered those — and even direct equity stakes in Fannie and Freddie — as possible replacements for US Treasuries. They weren’t guessing either. People familiar with the agency said the shift was based on protecting China’s massive foreign reserves, which are still deeply tied to US dollar assets. China’s holdings in US currency are leftovers from the country’s export-heavy growth. Factories pumped out products for the West, cash came back in, and the excess was shoveled into Treasuries to help Washington keep the lights on. That pile reached $4 trillion in 2014 and hasn’t gone under $3 trillion since 2016. At one point, 60% of China’s reserves were in US dollar assets, with Treasuries making up the bulk. But the flaws in that portfolio started to show fast. A paper written by Pan Liu and Zhang Weiwan, also from Tsinghua, in 2024, warned that what happened to Russia’s money showed how much control the US holds through its dollar system. They said “the lesson for China is clear.” Between January 2022 and December 2024, China slashed its US Treasury holdings by 27%, down to $759 billion, a drop way faster than the 17% decline seen from 2015 to 2022. China didn’t just dump Treasuries. They reportedly turned to agency bonds — securities issued by firms like Fannie Mae. These bonds carry similar credit ratings but pay better. From 2018 to early 2020, China increased its agency bond holdings by 60%, reaching $261 billion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The firm says on the social media platform X that long-term holders (LTHs) of Bitcoin – entities that have kept their coins inactive for at least 155 days – may start selling BTC near the $100,000 level based on the unrealized profit margin metric, potentially causing a market correction. “Historically, LTHs begin distributing more aggressively around a 350% unrealized profit margin, which aligns with a BTC price of ~$99,900. As the market nears this level, increased sell-side pressure is likely, requiring strong demand to absorb it.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode also says that LTHs are gobbling up Bitcoin since it broke into the $90,000 range late last month, suggesting it may soon hit the $99,000 level. “Long-Term Holders continue to accumulate, with +254,000 BTC aging beyond 155 days since the recent low – many bought above $95,000. Spending remains light, signaling renewed confidence and a lack of interest in de-risking at current prices.” Source: Glassnode/X Lastly, the analytics firm says that if Bitcoin is able to break through the $100,000 resistance level, the flagship crypto asset will likely hit new all-time highs. “A large cluster of coins was acquired between $95,000-$98,000, meaning some BTC holders may exit at breakeven. This, combined with rising LTH profits, creates a key resistance zone. A clean breakout could open the path to price discovery above $100,000.” Bitcoin is trading for $96,675 at time of writing, flat on the day.

The growing accumulation of Bitcoin by nation-states suggests a strategic shift in reserve management amid evolving global economic dynamics.

As digital assets gain mainstream traction, the conversation around how best to oversee this burgeoning space intensifies. At the heart of this discussion is crypto regulation , a critical area where industry stakeholders and government bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seek common ground. Why is Flexible SEC Crypto Regulation Crucial? Recently, a significant voice from the industry, the Blockchain Association , stepped forward with a compelling message for the SEC. This prominent advocacy group, representing a wide array of companies including major players like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap Labs, is urging the Commission to adopt a more adaptable and less rigid approach to oversight. Their core argument, as detailed in a statement to the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force and reported by The Block, centers on the unique nature of blockchain technology and the diverse applications of digital assets. The association emphasizes that regulatory frameworks should avoid blanket rules or policies that could inadvertently stifle innovation or restrict the legitimate use of this transformative technology. Think about it: blockchain isn’t just about speculative tokens. It powers everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to supply chain management, digital identity, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A one-size-fits-all regulatory hammer, designed for traditional financial instruments, might not be the right tool for this multifaceted ecosystem. Understanding the Blockchain Association’s Stance The Blockchain Association acts as a bridge between the innovative world of crypto and the corridors of power in Washington D.C. Their mission includes educating policymakers and advocating for policies that support the growth and adoption of blockchain technology in the United States. Their membership roster highlights the breadth of the industry they represent, from exchanges and custodians to DeFi platforms and infrastructure providers. Their call for a flexible approach isn’t a plea for a regulatory free-for-all. Instead, it’s a request for nuanced, tailored rules that recognize the technical realities and diverse use cases of digital assets. Key points likely underpinning their argument include: Technology Neutrality: Regulations should focus on the activity and risk, not just the underlying technology. Clarity and Certainty: The industry needs clear guidelines to build and operate responsibly, attracting investment and talent. Innovation Preservation: Overly restrictive rules could push innovation overseas, costing the U.S. its competitive edge. Investor Protection: A flexible approach can still prioritize robust investor protection without hindering legitimate development. This perspective is crucial for shaping effective cryptocurrency policy that benefits both consumers and innovators. What Challenges Does the SEC Face with Digital Assets? Regulating digital assets presents unique challenges for bodies like the SEC. Unlike traditional stocks or bonds with established legal precedents and structures, crypto assets often blur lines. Is a token a security, a commodity, or something entirely new? The answer can depend on its structure, how it was offered, and how it functions within a decentralized network. The SEC’s current approach often involves applying existing securities laws, primarily the Howey Test, to determine if a crypto asset constitutes an investment contract. While this provides a framework, the industry argues it doesn’t fully capture the complexity and potential of all digital assets. This is where the push for a flexible SEC crypto strategy becomes particularly relevant. Challenges for the SEC include: Identifying and prosecuting bad actors in a pseudonymous or anonymous environment. Keeping pace with rapidly evolving technology and new business models (like DeFi). Jurisdictional complexities in a global market. Ensuring consistent application of rules across a diverse range of assets and activities. The Path Forward: Collaboration and Tailored Rules The dialogue between the Blockchain Association and the SEC highlights the ongoing process of defining appropriate cryptocurrency policy . A flexible approach doesn’t mean lax enforcement; rather, it suggests a willingness to develop rules specifically designed for the nuances of digital assets, perhaps drawing inspiration from regulatory frameworks in other jurisdictions or creating entirely new categories. Examples of what a more flexible approach might entail: Developing specific rules for decentralized protocols vs. centralized intermediaries. Providing clear guidance on which digital assets are NOT considered securities. Creating regulatory sandboxes or pilot programs for new blockchain applications. Enhancing collaboration and information sharing between the SEC and other relevant agencies (like the CFTC). The outcome of this regulatory debate will significantly impact the future of the crypto industry in the United States, influencing everything from investor access to the types of innovation that can flourish domestically. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Crypto Regulation The call from the Blockchain Association for a flexible approach to crypto regulation is a critical moment in the ongoing dialogue between the industry and regulators. It underscores the industry’s desire for clear, predictable rules that foster innovation while protecting consumers. The SEC faces the complex task of applying existing laws and potentially developing new ones to a rapidly changing technological landscape. Finding the right balance is paramount. A thoughtful, flexible approach to digital assets regulation could unlock immense potential, driving economic growth and maintaining the U.S.’s position at the forefront of technological advancement. Ignoring the unique characteristics of blockchain technology, however, risks stifling innovation and pushing valuable activity to less regulated environments. The path forward likely requires continued dialogue, education, and a willingness from all parties to adapt and evolve alongside the technology itself.

He said the idea of elected officials approving such a move seems far-fetched, especially given the public image of “Bitcoin bros partying at clubs.” Even though the U.S. already holds around 200,000 BTC seized from criminal cases, Hayes doesn’t believe that holding will grow intentionally. Trump, who recently signed an executive order to create a strategic digital asset reserve , might struggle to deliver on his crypto promises, Hayes noted. With only 12 months before midterms, he doubts there’s time to enact real change. “People are impatient because they’re desperate,” Hayes warned, adding that disappointment could trigger a brutal correction across Bitcoin and other so-called “Trump trades.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 8 Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2025 from Institutions You Can’t Miss , Despite this, Hayes remains bullish on Bitcoin long-term. He expects the U.S. dollar will be devalued under Trump’s economic plan, possibly using gold as a reference. This could make Bitcoin more attractive globally. Hayes also believes a major crypto boost could come from China if Hong Kong ETFs open up to mainland investors, and even suggests EU governments may secretly buy crypto as inflation bites. While he predicts Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2028 , Hayes stressed the path will be tough to attain. In the meantime, his playbook for a Bitcoin-led altcoin cycle remains the same, despite other analysts doubting it’ll repeat like 2021. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Discover This Polygon-Based Token Set for 15,000% Growth",https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/missed-gains-on-pepe-and-shib-discover-this-polygon-based-token-set-growth/,"The post Missed Gains on Pepe and SHIB? Discover This Polygon-Based Token Set for 15,000% Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For those who watched in regret as meme coins like Pepe and SHIB soared to unimaginable heights, a new opportunity awaits. An innovative token on the Polygon network is capturing attention, promising potential growth that could surpass previous trends. Could this be the next chance to ride a wave of exponential returns? Delve in to uncover this emerging prospect in the crypto sphere. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain. It was created as a tribute to the internet meme Pepe the Frog, popularized by artist Matt Furie in the early 2000s. The coin aims to capitalize on the success of other meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE maintains a no-tax policy and is upfront about its lack of utility, embracing its identity purely as a memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching up to $1.6 billion. This rapid growth drew attention to memecoins, leading to increased interest and volatility in the market. The PEPE roadmap includes plans for listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover” in its third phase. With a growing community and strategic plans for expansion, PEPE stands out in the current market cycle as a notable memecoin connected to a widely recognized internet meme. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it began with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of the tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin to build trust within the crypto community. Buterin donated a significant portion of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, actions that increased SHIB’s visibility and credibility. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for compatibility with decentralized applications. The development of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a non-fungible token (NFT) platform and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-based governance system indicate potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s attractiveness may be influenced by its expanding ecosystem and the ongoing interest in Ethereum-based projects. Its growing utility within decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs may contribute to its appeal in the crypto space. Conclusion Although PEPE and SHIB have shown impressive gains, XYZVerse (XYZ) aims to surpass them, uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem poised for significant growth in the 2025 bull run.

This isn’t a distant dream; it’s a planned reality for the French Riviera city. Cannes is setting an ambitious target: 90% of its shops are expected to accept cryptocurrency payments by the summer of 2025. This move signals a significant step towards integrating digital assets into everyday commerce in one of Europe’s most famous destinations. Why is Cannes Embracing Cannes Crypto Adoption? The push for widespread Cannes crypto adoption is driven by a desire to modernize the city’s payment infrastructure and cater to a specific demographic. According to Artem Shaginyan of Web3 firm Lunu Pay, which is spearheading the technical implementation, the initiative is strongly supported by the Cannes municipal government. The primary goals include: Modernizing Payment Systems: Moving beyond traditional methods to embrace cutting-edge financial technology. Attracting High-Net-Worth Individuals: Many crypto holders are affluent and travel frequently. Making crypto payments easy could entice them to spend more time and money in Cannes. Enhancing the City’s Image: Positioning Cannes as a forward-thinking, tech-friendly destination. Boosting Local Commerce: Potentially increasing transaction volume and attracting new customers to local businesses. This strategic embrace of digital currency is about more than just novelty; it’s a calculated move to keep Cannes competitive and attractive in a rapidly evolving global economy. How Will Cryptocurrency Payments Work in Cannes? The core of this initiative lies in integrating systems that allow merchants to easily accept various cryptocurrencies. Lunu Pay, a company specializing in Web3 payment solutions, is expected to provide the necessary infrastructure. Typically, such systems work by: Merchant Integration: Shops will install or update their point-of-sale (POS) systems to include a crypto payment option. This might involve dedicated terminals, QR code scanners, or software integration. Customer Payment: A customer wishing to pay with crypto scans a QR code or uses a payment terminal linked to their crypto wallet. Instant Conversion (Optional but likely): The payment processor (like Lunu Pay) can instantly convert the received cryptocurrency into the local fiat currency (Euros) before transferring it to the merchant’s bank account. This protects merchants from crypto price volatility. Confirmation: The transaction is confirmed on the blockchain and the payment processor’s network. This process aims to be as seamless as paying with a credit card, removing complexity for both the merchant and the customer. The goal is to make using cryptocurrency payments as commonplace as using traditional methods. The Role of Web3 Payments in Urban Development The term ‘Web3 payments’ refers to payment solutions built on decentralized technologies like blockchain. These systems often promise lower transaction fees, faster settlements (especially for international transactions), and increased security compared to traditional payment networks. For a city like Cannes, which hosts major international events like the Cannes Film Festival and attracts visitors from around the globe, leveraging Web3 payments could offer distinct advantages: Reduced Fees: Merchants might benefit from lower transaction costs compared to credit card processing fees. Faster Access to Funds: Settlements can potentially be quicker, improving cash flow for businesses. Global Accessibility: Tourists from countries with different banking systems or high international transaction fees might find crypto payments more convenient. Innovation Showcase: Adopting Web3 technologies positions Cannes as a leader in financial innovation. Lunu Pay’s involvement highlights the growing role of specialized Web3 firms in building the infrastructure needed for mass crypto adoption at a city level. Their expertise in handling the technical complexities, regulatory considerations, and merchant onboarding is crucial for hitting the 90% adoption target. Cannes Joins the Ranks of Digital Payments Pioneers Cannes is not the first city to explore or implement widespread digital payments using cryptocurrencies, but its high target and status as a major tourist hub make its initiative particularly noteworthy. Several other cities have already taken significant steps: Lugano, Switzerland: Arguably the most prominent example, Lugano has embraced Bitcoin and Tether (USDT) as de facto legal tender alongside the Swiss Franc. Residents can pay for taxes, public services, and goods at many businesses using crypto. Vancouver, Canada: While not as comprehensive as Lugano, Vancouver has seen various businesses and even some local services explore crypto payment options over the years, driven by a strong tech and crypto community. Panama City, Panama: Panama has been exploring legislation to make crypto legal tender, and while the national effort has faced hurdles, crypto usage in businesses, particularly in Panama City, has been growing organically. These crypto adoption cities serve as case studies, offering lessons on the opportunities and challenges involved in integrating digital currencies into urban economies. Cannes can learn from their experiences, potentially streamlining its own implementation process. Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to 90% Adoption Achieving 90% adoption among Cannes merchants by summer 2025 is an ambitious goal. Several factors will influence its success: Merchant Education and Onboarding: Many small business owners may be unfamiliar or hesitant about cryptocurrencies. Providing clear information, easy-to-use technology, and reliable support will be essential. Regulatory Clarity: While France is part of the EU with evolving crypto regulations (like MiCA), local implementation needs to be clear and compliant. User Adoption: While the initiative targets high-income clientele, widespread adoption also requires tourists and residents to be willing and able to use crypto for payments. User-friendly wallet solutions are key. Technology Reliability: The payment systems need to be fast, secure, and reliable, especially during peak tourist seasons and major events. Volatility Concerns: While instant conversion mitigates merchant risk, the inherent volatility of some cryptocurrencies remains a factor for users holding them. However, the opportunities are significant. Successfully integrating crypto could provide a blueprint for other European cities and further legitimize cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange, not just an investment asset. What This Means for Visitors and Residents By summer 2025, visitors to Cannes might find paying for hotels, restaurants, shops, and perhaps even taxis with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins to be a common experience. For residents, it could offer an alternative payment method, though its utility will depend on how widely it’s accepted beyond the targeted shops. The initiative could also spur local interest and education in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. A Glimpse into the Future of Payments Cannes’ plan is more than just a local payment upgrade; it’s a high-profile experiment in urban financial innovation. If successful, it could significantly boost the visibility and acceptance of cryptocurrency payments in a major European economy. The world will be watching to see if the glamour of Cannes can be seamlessly blended with the innovation of Web3, creating a truly modern payment ecosystem by the summer of 2025.

In phase 4 at $0.025 per token, the project has attracted 9,300 holders, signifying solid investor confidence. As phase 4 reaches 55% capacity, anticipation builds for the phase 5, which will see a 20%-price hike to $0.03. This structural ascent of the project has left Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in a great position against meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Could it emerge as much better than them in the next market blow-off? Pepe (PEPE) rides Bull Waves PEPE has paved towards $0.0000085, the level where demand builds up in its sails. Daily chart shows a 2% change in the last 24 hours, but volume spikes to $181 million. Other indicators such as RSI-14 climbing up to 62 hint at the bullish mode slowly setting in. A lot of momentum is on its side, but everything seems to be balanced against a premature meme coin fear. There could be resistance at $0.00000898. If it drops below $0.00000780, it may pose a danger to the uptrend. There is a lot of speculation over PEPE to hit the 2025 target of $0.000035. But aren’t such projected gains reinforced more by hype rather than some utility? How will this stand against more solid projects? This ambiguity drives investors towards alternatives that command actual value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fans the frenzy of investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sells its tokens in phase 4, which is now open at $0.025 and already over 55% full. Any investor purchasing these tokens right now is set for a 20% return at the start of phase 5, at $0.03, a smart step in its tokenomics. The listing price of the project on exchanges will be $0.06, promising 140% returns upon launch, with analysts eyeing the surge post-launch to $2.50 for an eventual phenomenal return of about 9,900%. Recently, the team set up a dashboard showing the top-50 holders, who will have bonus tokens for as long as they maintain their position, keeping the buzz alive. Phase 4 approaches sell-out status, and FOMO just keeps getting heavier and heavier now. MUTM’s audited path to trust The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing security, actively pursuing a Certik audit for its smart contract. Once finalized, this milestone will be broadcast across social channels, bolstering investor trust. Unlike PEPE and DOGE, which lean on speculative fervor, MUTM’s focus on transparency and utility sets it apart. Its structured presale, already raising $7.4 million, reflects unwavering demand. With 9,300 holders and counting, the project’s momentum is undeniable. This commitment to reliability, paired with its lucrative returns, positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a standout in the crypto market, ready to eclipse meme-driven tokens. Sealing the deal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now becomes the best substitute for Dogecoin (DOGE) as well as new entrants, like Pepe (PEPE), in the next climb of the crypto market. With PEPE riding volatile waves and DOGE clinging on to nostalgia, MUTM offers a concrete way to profit, as seen in its 140% pre-launch return and a mind-boggling potential post-launch increase of about 9,900%. The ongoing phase 4 presale, teetering at 55% capacity, requires urgency from investors. Make your investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it is not too late to catch the wave ahead of phase 5’s price increase- when even more investors will come on board.

This savvy investor bought 4.91 trillion $PEPE tokens and methodically sold off portions over time, including a recent $2.8 million profit from just 100 billion tokens, netting a total of $27.5 million from 3.03 trillion $PEPE alone. At its peak, $PEPE shattered expectations, breaking through $0.000028 and reaching a new all-time high before the broader market downturn. But here’s the twist: according to growing speculation across crypto communities, that same master of timing and risk might now be eyeing the next big play — Codename:Pepe. With PEPE’s meteoric rise now behind him, the opportunity to replicate those 25,000x gains won’t come from legacy meme coins. Codename: Pepe, on the other hand, combines meme virality with AI-driven trend analytics and deflationary tokenomics — a fresh recipe for another moonshot. If history is about to repeat itself, this could be your chance to spot the next $ 3 K-to-$73 M trade before it explodes. Let’s dive into why Codename:Pepe might be the next jackpot for meme coin visionaries. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe (AGNT) is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. However, not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices .

Since market players are looking towards the $4-$6 area, Remittix’s ongoing presale is making its presence felt with solid numbers and community backing. SUI Breaks Falling Wedge Pattern, Targets $6 Milestone SUI’s price movement unfolded exactly how technicians had predicted: stabilizing in the $2.80–$3.10 range before cutting a falling wedge—characterized by a pattern usually followed by violent bounces—and breaking out with conviction. The breakout triggered a 40% rally in a month to move SUI to $3.45. The first upside target has been set by analysts at around $4.79 and a secondary target at $6.12 with Fibonacci extensions and past resistance. The Sui token is in an attempt to escape the downtrend bearing channel on the daily chart, according to popular analyst Jonathan Carter.

44099292,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154801,1746257429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Mining: Cipher Mining’s Strategic BTC Sale Offers Key Insight,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cipher-mining-bitcoin-sale/,"Hello, crypto enthusiasts and mining observers! Ever wondered what publicly traded Bitcoin miners do with all the BTC they mine? Do they hold onto every single coin, hoping for future price increases, or do they sell some to cover costs and fund operations? Let’s dive into the recent activity of Nasdaq-listed Cipher Mining to get some fascinating insights into the world of industrial-scale Bitcoin mining . What Did Cipher Mining Announce for April? On May 2, Cipher Mining shared an update on its operational performance for April through a press release via GlobeNewswire. The announcement highlighted two key figures regarding their BTC holdings and production: BTC Mined: In April, Cipher Mining successfully mined 174 BTC . This represents the company’s production from its mining operations during that month. BTC Sold: Significantly, the company also sold 350 BTC during April. This figure is higher than the amount mined in the same period. Ending BTC Holdings: As of the end of April, after accounting for mining and sales, Cipher Mining held a total of 855 BTC on its balance sheet. These numbers immediately raise questions. Why would a Bitcoin miner sell more BTC than it mined in a given month? This isn’t uncommon in the industry and points to the complex financial management involved in running large-scale crypto mining operations. Why Do Bitcoin Miners Sell Their BTC Holdings? At first glance, it might seem counterintuitive for a Bitcoin miner to sell the very asset they are working so hard to produce, especially if they are bullish on its long-term price potential. However, selling mined BTC is a fundamental part of the business model for most public mining companies. Here are the primary reasons: 1. Covering Operational Costs: Running a Bitcoin mining facility is expensive. There are significant costs associated with electricity (often the largest expense), facility maintenance, hardware upgrades and repairs, staffing, and other overheads. Selling a portion of mined BTC provides the necessary fiat currency (like USD) to cover these ongoing expenses. 2. Funding Capital Expenditures: Miners often need to invest in new, more efficient mining hardware (ASIC machines) or expand their infrastructure (power capacity, buildings). Selling BTC is a common way to raise capital for these investments without resorting to debt or equity financing, although those methods are also used. 3. Managing Financial Risk: The price of BTC can be highly volatile. By selling some mined coins, companies can secure revenue at current market prices, hedging against potential future price drops that could make holding less profitable. This is a form of treasury management. 4. Strategic Balance: Companies like Cipher Mining aim to find a balance between realizing immediate revenue from sales and accumulating BTC on their balance sheet for potential future appreciation. The decision on how much to sell versus hold depends on market conditions, operational needs, and the company’s long-term strategy. Understanding Cipher Mining’s Strategic Approach Looking at Cipher Mining’s April figures – mining 174 BTC and selling 350 BTC – suggests a strategic decision likely driven by one or more of the factors mentioned above. Selling more than they mined in April indicates they used some previously held BTC in addition to their April production to meet their financial requirements or strategic goals. This could mean they had significant operational costs or capital expenditures planned for April. It could also reflect a view on market conditions, deciding that selling at April’s prices was advantageous for their treasury compared to holding. Their ending balance of 855 BTC shows they still maintain a substantial reserve of the digital asset. The strategy of a Bitcoin miner isn’t just about mining; it’s also about how they manage the mined asset. Companies like Cipher Mining must constantly evaluate energy costs, network difficulty, hardware efficiency, and the market price of BTC to optimize their profitability and growth. How Does This Relate to the Broader Crypto Mining Landscape? The actions of individual miners like Cipher Mining are part of the larger dynamics within the crypto mining industry. The industry faces constant evolution, from technological advancements in ASIC chips to significant events like the Bitcoin halving, which reduces the block reward miners receive. Post-halving periods, in particular, often put pressure on miners. With reduced rewards per block, efficiency becomes paramount, and less efficient operations may struggle. Miners need robust strategies for managing costs and revenues, and selling mined BTC becomes even more critical for survival and investment in better hardware. Furthermore, the cumulative selling pressure from multiple Bitcoin mining companies can have an impact on the market supply of BTC , although the extent of this impact is a subject of ongoing debate among analysts. It’s one factor among many influencing BTC price movements. What Actionable Insights Can We Gain? For investors interested in the Bitcoin mining sector or in understanding the supply dynamics of BTC , reports like the one from Cipher Mining offer valuable insights: Miner Performance Metrics: Pay attention to how much BTC a company mines (production), how much it sells (liquidity/cost coverage), and how much it holds (balance sheet strength/long-term view). Cost Management: The amount a miner needs to sell can indicate their operational efficiency and energy costs. Lower selling relative to mining might suggest lower costs or a stronger balance sheet allowing them to hold more. Strategic Signals: Changes in a company’s sell-vs.-hold ratio can signal their management’s view on market conditions or upcoming capital needs. Industry Trends: Observing multiple miners’ reports provides a broader picture of the health and strategies prevalent in the crypto mining industry. Understanding these operational details is key to evaluating the financial health and strategic positioning of companies involved in Bitcoin mining . Conclusion: A Glimpse into Miner Strategy Cipher Mining’s April report, detailing the mining of 174 BTC and the sale of 350 BTC , provides a clear example of the strategic decisions faced by publicly traded Bitcoin miner s. Selling mined BTC is a necessary function to cover significant operational costs and fund future growth in a capital-intensive industry like crypto mining . Their decision to sell more than they mined in April highlights the dynamic nature of their treasury management and strategic allocation of capital. While they liquidated a substantial amount, their retained holding of 855 BTC demonstrates a continued belief in the asset’s value. These reports are crucial for anyone tracking the financial health of mining companies and understanding the supply side of the BTC market. It’s a constant balancing act between immediate financial needs and long-term potential in the ever-evolving world of Bitcoin mining .

Although the asset pulled back slightly from a 24-hour high above $97,000, it still recorded a 2.4% increase over the past week, maintaining its broader uptrend. Recent on-chain data points to a growing sense of bullish sentiment in the market. Notably, a sharp increase in the taker buy/sell ratio on Binance suggests that traders are becoming more aggressive in their buying behavior. Some analysts are interpreting this shift as a potential prelude to further upside movement, especially as exchange outflows signal a tightening supply. Related Reading: Traders Rush Into Bitcoin Options as Implied Volatility Drops, Is a Big Move Coming? Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Points to Aggressive Buying Behavior Amr Taha, a contributor to the QuickTake platform by CryptoQuant, highlighted that the taker buy/sell ratio on Binance recently spiked to 1.142—its highest point in recent history. This metric compares the volume of market buy orders (taker buys) to market sell orders (taker sells). A value above 1 indicates that market participants are executing more aggressive buy orders than sell orders, suggesting a growing eagerness to enter the market even at higher price levels. Taha’s analysis also referenced a visual spike on Binance’s order book, signaling a wave of taker buys that reflect immediate interest in BTC accumulation. The timing of this spike coincided with Bitcoin’s recent move above $96,000. At the same time, data from CryptoQuant’s Whales Screener revealed a $200 million BTC outflow from centralized exchanges. This withdrawal likely represents a shift from liquid trading platforms to cold storage, implying reduced selling pressure and heightened confidence among large holders. Futures Traders That Drove October Rally Return In a separate update, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Mignolet pointed to the re-emergence of entities in the futures market that were active during Bitcoin’s sharp rally in October 2023. These futures participants, often institutional or high-frequency traders, played a notable role in driving momentum during that rally. According to Mignolet, similar entities have started showing signs of activity again since late April.

Combined with the recent net exchange outflows and aggressive spot buying on Binance, this resurgence could provide additional fuel for Bitcoin’s climb toward six-figure territory. Overall, while volatility remains a notable feature of crypto markets, current indicators suggest strong bullish undertones may be building beneath the surface.

Schwartz revealed that his dream scenario would be a partnership between Ripple and SWIFT where its banks used Ripple’s payment network for free. He also suggested that he would be open to paying SWIFT for this partnership, stating that it would fit Ripple’s strategy for XRP. His comments reveal how Ripple once viewed integration with SWIFT as a strategic opportunity to accelerate XRP adoption across the global banking system. However, recent developments suggest this scenario no longer aligns with Ripple’s plans. DAVID SCHWARTZ IN 2020: “MY DREAM SCENARIO IS SWIFT MAKES A DEAL WITH RIPPLE WHERE ALL THEIR BANKS GET TO USE RIPPLENET FOR FREE, MAYBE EVEN PAYING SWIFT! FITS OUR #XRP STRATEGY PERFECTLY!“ pic.twitter.com/WalYuhwGHq — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 1, 2025 No Partnership Between Ripple and SWIFT Contrary to the speculation implied by resurfaced statements and circulating rumors, there is no confirmed partnership between Ripple and SWIFT. Recent claims suggesting SWIFT was testing XRP across its network of over 11,000 institutions were quickly dismissed . Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has been direct in distinguishing Ripple’s strategy from SWIFT’s legacy approach. He described SWIFT’s messaging-based system as outdated , implying that Ripple’s focus on real-time settlement and tokenized liquidity offers a more viable solution for modern cross-border payment needs. This direct criticism shows the competitive relationship between the two parties. While Ripple may have once considered collaboration, the current stance from its leadership reflects a clear shift toward positioning Ripple as a replacement for SWIFT. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Vision to Replace, Not Integrate Ripple’s business model has evolved to directly challenge the systems SWIFT has built over the decades. With XRP’s increasing adoption across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, and growing attention on its efficiency as a bridge currency, Ripple appears committed to creating an independent global payment infrastructure. Despite the hopeful tone of Schwartz’s 2020 remarks, the current positioning from Ripple’s leadership and operational strategy shows no intention of cooperating with SWIFT. The company is focused on deploying its network, emphasizing transparency, speed, and on-chain settlement. Garlinghouse has repeatedly spoken about moving on from SWIFT’s legacy system , and XRP’s numerous advantages could usher in a new age of instant cross-border payments. While Schwartz once imagined a potential partnership with SWIFT as a dream scenario, Ripple has moved in a different direction. The company now sees itself as the foundation for a new financial system that eliminates the need for intermediaries like SWIFT, not just a supplement to the banking industry’s legacy rails.

Playtron , a company focused on building operating systems for gaming devices, is making a bold move into the decentralized finance space with a brand-new digital currency designed specifically for players. This isn’t just any digital coin; it’s a programmable stablecoin called the Game Dollar , and it’s slated for an exclusive launch on the Sui blockchain in Q4 2025. What Exactly is Playtron’s Game Dollar Stablecoin? At its core, the Game Dollar is being developed as a digital currency engineered for the unique needs of the gaming ecosystem. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, a stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. This stability is crucial for creating a reliable in-game economy and transaction system. Playtron envisions the Game Dollar serving multiple key functions within their gaming universe: Purchases: Enabling seamless buying of games, in-game items, and virtual goods. Subscriptions: Facilitating easy payment for gaming service subscriptions. Rewards: Providing a stable and tangible way to reward players for achievements, participation, or content creation. This programmable nature means the Game Dollar can potentially be integrated into game logic for automated payments, escrow services, or complex reward structures, opening up new possibilities for developers and players alike. Why is Playtron Building a Stablecoin for Gaming? The current landscape for digital transactions in gaming often involves various payment processors, regional currency conversions, and sometimes unpredictable fees. Integrating a dedicated stablecoin like the Game Dollar aims to streamline these processes and offer several potential benefits: Stability: Eliminating the risk of currency value fluctuations impacting in-game economies or the cost of items. Reduced Fees: Leveraging blockchain technology can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment gateways. Global Accessibility: Providing a consistent currency accessible to gamers worldwide, regardless of their local currency. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Transactions recorded on the blockchain offer a higher degree of transparency and security. New Economic Models: Enabling innovative features like player-owned assets, true digital scarcity, and direct peer-to-peer trading within games. By creating their own stablecoin, Playtron seeks to build a more integrated, efficient, and potentially more rewarding economic layer for their gaming ecosystem. The Role of Sui Blockchain in the Game Dollar Launch The decision to launch the Game Dollar exclusively on the Sui blockchain is a key detail. Sui is a relatively new layer 1 blockchain known for its focus on scalability and low transaction fees, designed to handle high throughput. These characteristics make it a potentially strong candidate for supporting the massive number of transactions that a popular gaming platform could generate. Sui’s object-centric model and parallel transaction execution capabilities are often highlighted as advantages for applications requiring fast, cheap, and complex interactions, such as those found in decentralized gaming and asset management. Playtron’s choice suggests they believe Sui provides the necessary technical foundation to support the widespread adoption and usage of the Game Dollar . Infrastructure Powering the Game Dollar: M0 and Bridge Building a reliable stablecoin requires robust infrastructure. The report mentions that the Game Dollar will be supported by infrastructure providers M0 and Bridge. While specific details of their roles weren’t fully elaborated in the initial report, infrastructure providers in the stablecoin space typically handle critical functions such as: Minting and Redemption: Managing the process of creating new stablecoins and allowing users to redeem them for the underlying collateral. Collateral Management: Ensuring the reserves backing the stablecoin are securely held and transparently managed. Compliance: Handling regulatory requirements related to KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering). Integration Tools: Providing APIs and SDKs for developers to easily integrate the stablecoin into their applications (in this case, games and the Playtron ecosystem). The involvement of specialized infrastructure providers suggests Playtron is aiming for a professionally managed and compliant stablecoin operation. How Does the Game Dollar Fit into Playtron’s Ecosystem? The Game Dollar isn’t just a standalone currency; it’s designed to be deeply integrated into Playtron ‘s broader vision for the future of gaming . It will power: Playtron’s Linux-based GameOS: This operating system, designed for gaming devices, will likely have native support for managing and using the Game Dollar for various functions within the OS itself (e.g., purchasing games from a store). The Upcoming SuiPlay0X1 Handheld: This highly anticipated handheld gaming device, also based on GameOS and integrating with the Sui blockchain, will be a primary platform for using the Game Dollar for in-game transactions and ecosystem interactions. Other Titles Built on the Sui Blockchain: The potential extends beyond Playtron’s hardware and OS. Any game developed on the Sui blockchain could potentially integrate and utilize the Game Dollar , creating a shared economy across different titles. This strategic integration positions the Game Dollar as a foundational element of Playtron ‘s interconnected gaming universe on Sui . Looking Ahead: The Q4 2025 Launch on Sui The planned launch timeline of Q4 2025 gives Playtron and the infrastructure providers ample time to develop and refine the Game Dollar , ensuring it’s robust and ready for adoption. Launching exclusively on Sui initially allows them to focus their efforts and potentially build a strong initial user base within the Sui ecosystem before considering expansion. The success of the Game Dollar will depend on several factors, including developer adoption, ease of use for gamers, regulatory clarity, and the overall growth of the Sui blockchain and Playtron’s hardware/software platforms. However, the initiative represents a significant step towards integrating stable, programmable digital currencies directly into the core of the gaming experience. Conclusion: A New Era for Gaming Economies? Playtron ‘s plan to launch the Game Dollar stablecoin on Sui in Q4 2025 is a fascinating development in the intersection of gaming and blockchain. By creating a stable, programmable currency designed specifically for purchases, subscriptions, and rewards, Playtron aims to build a more efficient, transparent, and integrated economic system for its GameOS, the SuiPlay0X1 handheld, and the broader Sui gaming ecosystem. Supported by M0 and Bridge, this initiative could pave the way for new economic models within games and offer gamers a more consistent and potentially rewarding experience. It’s a move that underscores the growing potential of stablecoins to power real-world applications, with gaming emerging as a key frontier.

44099847,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154797,1746258605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Senator Lummis Expresses Grave Concerns Over Trump Memecoin Dinner, Pushing for Urgent Digital Asset Rules",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lummis-concerns-trump-memecoin/,"The world of cryptocurrency is rapidly intersecting with traditional politics, creating new dynamics and, at times, raising eyebrows. A recent event involving a popular memecoin tied to former President Donald Trump has ignited a conversation among lawmakers, particularly concerning transparency and ethics for elected officials holding digital assets. At the heart of this discussion is Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a well-known supporter of the crypto space, who voiced significant concerns following news of a private dinner planned for top holders of the TRUMP memecoin. Why is Senator Lummis Concerned About the Trump Memecoin Dinner? Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican representing Wyoming, is one of the most vocal proponents of cryptocurrency on Capitol Hill. Her support stems from a belief in the innovation and potential of digital assets and blockchain technology. She even publicly disclosed her own Bitcoin holdings, setting an example for transparency in a nascent asset class. However, her support for the technology doesn’t blind her to potential ethical pitfalls. According to a report by CNBC, Senator Lummis specifically highlighted the need for standardized rules governing how elected U.S. officials hold and disclose digital assets. Her comments were a direct reaction to the news surrounding President Donald Trump’s upcoming gala dinner. The dinner, scheduled for May 22nd in Washington, D.C., is reportedly a private event for the top 220 holders of the TRUMP memecoin (ticker: TRUMP). The event’s website, GetTrumpMemes, promotes this exclusive gathering. While former presidents are not subject to the same disclosure rules as sitting officials, the nature of the event—a private dinner for holders of a specific, volatile digital asset tied to a political figure—raises questions about influence, access, and the potential for conflicts of interest, particularly if current officials were to attend or if the precedent impacts future interactions. Senator Lummis’s concern centers on the lack of clear, mandated rules for current elected officials regarding their digital asset holdings. Unlike stocks, bonds, or real estate, the regulatory framework for digital assets is still evolving, and disclosure requirements for politicians are not as standardized or comprehensive. The Need for Clear Digital Asset Rules for US Officials The current situation highlights a gap in existing ethics and transparency regulations. While officials are required to disclose holdings of traditional assets, the rules for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets are less defined. This ambiguity creates several challenges: Transparency: Without clear rules, it’s difficult for the public to know which digital assets their representatives hold and whether those holdings could influence their legislative decisions. Conflicts of Interest: An official holding significant amounts of a specific digital asset could face conflicts when voting on legislation that might impact that asset’s value or regulatory status. Market Integrity: If officials possess non-public information that could affect the value of digital assets they hold, it raises concerns similar to insider trading in traditional markets. Public Trust: A lack of clear rules and transparency can erode public trust in government and the legislative process, especially as digital assets become more mainstream. Senator Lummis’s call for legislation aims to address these issues by creating a level playing field and ensuring that digital asset holdings are subject to the same level of scrutiny and disclosure as traditional assets. This would involve defining what constitutes a reportable digital asset, setting clear thresholds for disclosure, and establishing penalties for non-compliance. Beyond Senator Lummis: Other Voices of Concern Senator Lummis is not alone in expressing unease about the situation. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, reportedly echoed similar concerns about the TRUMP memecoin dinner event. This suggests that the issue is not confined to one political viewpoint but touches upon broader ethical considerations that resonate across the aisle. The fact that senators from different states and potentially different political leanings on other issues are highlighting this concern underscores its importance. It signals a growing awareness within the U.S. Senate about the potential implications of the increasing overlap between political figures and the often-unregulated world of memecoins and other digital assets. Understanding Memecoins and Political Figures Memecoins are a unique and often volatile segment of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which were designed with specific technological goals, memecoins are often created as social experiments, jokes, or, in this case, tied to cultural or political figures. Their value is often driven by social media trends, community hype, and speculation rather than underlying technology or utility. The existence of a memecoin specifically tied to a prominent political figure like Donald Trump is a relatively new phenomenon. While it can be seen by supporters as a way to engage a community or even as a form of political fundraising (though the dinner is for holders, not necessarily a direct fundraiser), it inherently links a political brand to a speculative, unregulated financial instrument. This linkage is precisely what raises red flags for lawmakers concerned about ethics and influence. The volatility and speculative nature of memecoins make the need for clear disclosure rules even more pressing for public officials. A sudden surge or drop in value could create significant financial incentives or pressures that could potentially sway an official’s stance on relevant legislation. Comparing Rules: Traditional Assets vs. Digital Assets for US Officials To better understand the gap Senator Lummis is highlighting, it’s useful to compare the existing rules for traditional assets with the current state for digital assets: Asset Type Disclosure Requirements for US Officials Challenges with Digital Assets Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds Generally clear rules under the Ethics in Government Act; required annual financial disclosures detailing holdings, transactions, and income. Blind trusts are an option to avoid conflicts. Established valuation methods; regulated markets; clear ownership records. Real Estate Required annual disclosure of property holdings, income, and transactions. Tangible asset with established valuation methods and public records. Cryptocurrencies & Digital Assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Memecoins) Disclosure requirements are less clear and standardized. While some officials disclose voluntarily, specific rules for *all* digital assets, valuation methods, and transaction reporting are not as robust or universally applied as for traditional assets. The definition of what constitutes a ‘security’ or ‘commodity’ in the digital asset space is also still debated, adding complexity. Volatile prices; difficulty in valuation (especially for smaller tokens/memecoins); potential for anonymity; rapid transaction speeds; diverse range of asset types (fungible tokens, NFTs, etc.). This table illustrates the regulatory lag when it comes to digital assets. The existing framework, designed for traditional finance, doesn’t easily accommodate the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies and memecoins. Potential Impacts and the Path Forward for Crypto Regulation The concerns raised by Senator Lummis and others underscore the increasing urgency for comprehensive crypto regulation in the United States. While significant debate exists on *how* to regulate the space, there is growing consensus on the need for clarity, particularly concerning consumer protection, market integrity, and, as highlighted here, the ethical considerations for public officials. Legislation addressing digital asset holdings by officials could be part of broader regulatory efforts. Such legislation might include: Clear definitions of reportable digital assets. Specific thresholds for disclosure (e.g., value held). Requirements for reporting transactions (buys, sells, exchanges). Guidelines on how to value digital assets for disclosure purposes. Rules regarding participation in events tied to specific digital assets. Potential restrictions on holding certain types of digital assets while in office, especially those directly related to legislative matters. The involvement of a prominent political figure and a memecoin in this specific instance brings the issue into sharp focus. It moves the conversation from abstract regulatory principles to concrete examples that the public can more easily understand. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community and Voters For individuals involved in the cryptocurrency space or simply concerned about government ethics, this development offers several key takeaways: Pay Attention to Legislation: Follow legislative proposals related to crypto regulation and government ethics. Senator Lummis is a key figure in this space, but many other lawmakers are also engaged. Advocate for Transparency: Support initiatives and proposals that promote transparency regarding elected officials’ financial holdings, including digital assets. Understand the Risks of Memecoins: While memecoins can offer speculative opportunities, be aware of their inherent volatility and the potential for manipulation or association with political or social movements that may carry their own risks. Engage with Representatives: Contact your elected officials to share your views on crypto regulation and the importance of ethical standards for those in public office. This event serves as a powerful reminder that as digital assets become more integrated into the economy and society, the regulatory and ethical frameworks governing them must evolve as well. The concerns raised by Senator Lummis are a critical step in prompting that necessary evolution. Compelling Summary: Navigating the Crypto-Political Crossroads The news surrounding the Trump memecoin dinner and the subsequent concerns voiced by Senator Cynthia Lummis and Senator Lisa Murkowski underscore a critical juncture at the intersection of cryptocurrency and U.S. politics. While digital assets offer exciting potential, their increasing presence in the financial lives of elected officials highlights an urgent need for clear, standardized rules regarding disclosure and potential conflicts of interest. Senator Lummis, a staunch crypto advocate, is paradoxically leading the charge for greater regulation in this specific area, recognizing that transparency is vital for maintaining public trust and ensuring ethical governance. As memecoins and other digital assets become intertwined with political figures and events, the call for comprehensive legislation to govern officials’ holdings grows louder, signaling a necessary evolution in how the U.S. navigates the complex and rapidly changing landscape of digital finance within the political sphere.

One of the most popular tools for gauging this collective mood is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This index provides a simple, numerical snapshot of whether market participants are leaning towards caution or exuberance. As of May 3rd, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, registered a reading of 65. While this is a slight dip of two points from the previous day’s 67, it firmly keeps the index within the ‘Greed’ territory. But what exactly does a reading of 65 signify, and how should investors interpret this? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is designed to measure the general sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Suggests investors are very worried. This can be a sign that prices are undervalued. 25-49: Fear – Indicates general market apprehension. 50-74: Greed – Shows growing optimism and potentially increasing buying pressure. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Points to a potentially overheated market where prices might be due for a correction. The underlying principle is simple psychology: when the market is experiencing ‘Fear’, it often signals a potential buying opportunity for contrarian investors. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ can suggest the market is topping out, potentially signaling a time to sell. Breaking Down the Factors Behind the Index The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key Market Sentiment Crypto indicators. Understanding these components helps demystify the index’s reading: Factor Weighting How it’s Measured Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values. High volatility signals fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current volume and market momentum (especially for Bitcoin) with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market indicates greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes posts on social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for specific keywords and sentiment, also considering how quickly posts are receiving interactions. High levels of positive, enthusiastic chatter signal greed. Surveys 15% Polls users weekly to get a direct feel for investor sentiment. (Note: This factor is currently paused by Alternative). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Increasing dominance can signal fear (money flowing to ‘safer’ Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance (altcoin season) can signal greed. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. Rising search interest, especially for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation,” can indicate fear. Decoding the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ Reading of 65 A reading of 65 places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, though not yet in ‘Extreme Greed’. This suggests that overall, participants are feeling optimistic and confident about market prospects. Buying pressure is likely outweighing selling pressure, and there’s a general positive buzz. While this reflects a healthy, upward-trending market environment, it’s also a level where caution begins to become important. The market is no longer in ‘Fear’ territory, where assets might be significantly undervalued. Instead, prices are likely well-bid, and the risk of a sharp downturn increases as the index climbs higher towards ‘Extreme Greed’. How Can Investors Use the Crypto Sentiment Index? The Crypto Sentiment index is best used as a complementary tool, not a standalone trading signal. Here are a few ways investors might utilize it: Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use the index contrarianly – buying during ‘Extreme Fear’ and selling during ‘Extreme Greed’. A reading of 65 isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’, but it suggests the optimal buying window based purely on this strategy might have passed, and it’s prudent to start thinking about risk management. Confirmation Tool: It can be used to confirm signals from other technical or fundamental analysis. If charts look bullish and the index is in ‘Greed’, it reinforces the positive outlook (though also highlights potential overheating). Emotional Check: Seeing the index in ‘Greed’ can serve as a reminder to check your own emotions. Are you buying purely out of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) because everyone else seems optimistic? The index can help you step back and make more rational decisions. Risk Management: As the index moves higher into the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’, increasing caution might be warranted. This could mean tightening stop-losses, taking partial profits, or reducing position sizes. Bitcoin Fear and Greed: A Key Driver While the index is for the overall crypto market, Bitcoin Fear and Greed is a significant component and often a leading indicator. Due to Bitcoin’s market dominance and influence, its price movements, volatility, and social media chatter heavily sway the overall index. When Bitcoin is rallying strongly with high volume and positive sentiment, the overall index is likely to reflect that ‘Greed’. Conversely, a sharp Bitcoin sell-off will quickly pull the index down into ‘Fear’. The current reading of 65 reflects, in large part, the prevailing sentiment around Bitcoin. Why the Slight Dip? A two-point drop from 67 to 65 is minor and doesn’t necessarily signal a significant shift in sentiment. It could be attributed to various small factors: Minor price consolidation or a small dip in Bitcoin or major altcoins. A slight decrease in trading volume after a period of high activity. A minor shift in social media tone or search interest. These small fluctuations are normal and don’t negate the overall ‘Greed’ signal. The key takeaway is that the market sentiment remains predominantly positive, despite the fractional change. Conclusion: Navigating the Greed Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remaining at 65 in the ‘Greed’ zone tells us that optimism currently reigns in the market. While this is generally positive for price action, it’s also a reminder that sentiment can shift rapidly. The index is a valuable tool for understanding the market’s emotional state, but it should always be used in conjunction with thorough research and a sound investment strategy. Staying informed about the factors driving the index and maintaining a disciplined approach are essential for navigating the potentially volatile landscape of cryptocurrencies, especially when sentiment is leaning towards exuberance.

According to a disclosure from the firm, Chase has become a “significant holder” of Droneshield (DRO), currently controlling at least 5.31% of outstanding shares. Droneshield is a company based in New South Wales, Australia, that specializes in radio frequency sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and electronic warfare. The firm provides anti-drone technology to the government, military, law enforcement, VIPs and other entities. At time of writing, DRO is up 132% since January 1st of this year, and is up 1,475% from its 2020 low, currently trading at $1.34 AUD ($0.87). JPMorgan joins several other large institutions, including Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Fidelity and State Street, in becoming large holders of DRO. While the bank continues building positions in various assets, its CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been periodically offloading his shares in JPMorgan itself since February of 2024. Dimon sold 133,639 shares of the largest US bank by total assets on April 14th, for a total of approximately $31.50 million, and in February, the CEO sold 866,361 JPMorgan Chase shares worth about $233.78 million when the stock was trading close to all-time high levels.

44100588,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=720143,1746259810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44100588.jpeg,Trump demands that Supreme Court let Elon Musk’s DOGE access all Social Security data,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-supreme-court-doge-access-all-ssa-data/,"President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to let Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have full access to the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) data. The Justice Department told the justices to block a previous ruling from Judge Ellen Hollander that stopped DOGE from entering the SSA’s internal systems. The department argued that the judge’s decision went beyond her authority and interfered with the Executive Branch. They said the order prevents the team tasked with fixing government data systems from doing their jobs. “The district court is forcing the Executive Branch to stop employees charged with modernizing government information systems from accessing the data in those systems because, in the court’s judgment, those employees do not ‘need’ such access,” they wrote. According to Reuters , the court fight started after two unions and an advocacy group filed a lawsuit to stop Musk’s DOGE from pulling sensitive data from the SSA. Hollander, who was appointed by Barack Obama, agreed with them. She said DOGE gave no real reason why it needed to see almost every record in the system. Her ruling from April 17 called the request “unprecedented” and said it broke the 90-year tradition of privacy inside the SSA. She also said the attempt revealed a deep problem in the agency’s foundation. Republicans fight Trump’s plan from inside Congress On April 30, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond backed Hollander in a divided decision. The court refused to lift her order, which meant DOGE stayed locked out of the SSA. The Supreme Court gave the people challenging Trump’s move until May 12 to respond. While this plays out in court, Trump is also getting hit from the other side—Congress. Even Republicans aren’t backing Musk’s federal cuts. Musk’s DOGE says it already cut $160 billion from the government budget. During the campaign, Musk claimed he’d slash $2 trillion. But now that Trump is back in the White House, lawmakers from his own party are quietly refusing to back any of the cuts as actual law. The Washington Post reported that some Republicans privately admitted that writing even a piece of the DOGE cuts into law would be too much. The administration has almost no way to lock in the cuts without Congress. Republicans have started avoiding town halls after Medicare and Social Security cuts sparked public outrage. Some lawmakers have switched to phone-only events. The National Republican Congressional Committee told them to skip public meetings altogether. Trump’s team offered a smaller plan: send $9.3 billion of the DOGE cuts to Congress for approval. That includes wiping out the U.S. Agency for International Development, folding it into the State Department, and cutting public broadcasting money. Still, Congress hasn’t moved. Robert Shea, a Republican and former official at the White House budget office, told the Post , “None of the activities of the DOGE have heretofore had any impact on the budget, the debt or the deficit. Until Congress acts, those savings don’t really become real.” He warned that the White House must now choose between using the actual funding passed by Congress or breaking budget law. That could cause a constitutional crisis. Every side is now pushing back against Musk and Trump’s DOGE. The courts have frozen access to data. Congress won’t touch the cuts. And even with $160 billion claimed in reductions, nothing is legally locked in. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

A recent report from Whale Alert has once again captured the community’s attention, highlighting a significant event involving Ripple’s native token. A staggering 200 million XRP has been unlocked from an escrow wallet, and the identity of the wallet holder remains unknown. This development naturally leads to questions about its potential impact on the XRP Price and the broader market sentiment surrounding Ripple XRP . Understanding the XRP Unlock Mechanism To fully grasp the significance of this event, it’s crucial to understand Ripple’s unique use of XRP Escrow . In December 2017, Ripple locked up 55 billion XRP (roughly 55% of the total supply) in a series of 55 smart contracts. Each contract was designed to release 1 billion XRP on the first day of each month over 55 months. The purpose was to provide transparency and predictability regarding the supply of XRP that could potentially enter the market. Any XRP not used or sold by Ripple within a month is typically placed back into a new escrow contract at the end of the month. This structured release mechanism has been a consistent part of the Ripple XRP ecosystem. However, the unlock reported by Whale Alert appears to be separate from the standard monthly 1 billion XRP release that typically originates from Ripple’s known escrow addresses. The report specifically mentioned an ‘unknown wallet,’ adding a layer of mystery to this particular XRP Unlock . What Does 200 Million XRP Represent? While not the full 1 billion released monthly by Ripple, 200 million XRP is still a substantial amount. At current market prices, this represents a significant value in U.S. dollars. To put it in perspective: It’s 20% of Ripple’s standard monthly release amount. It’s a large enough sum that its movement could potentially influence market dynamics if it were to be sold on exchanges. Movements of this size are often associated with major players or institutions, commonly referred to as a Crypto Whale . The emergence of such a large sum from escrow, especially from an unknown source, raises immediate questions about its origin and intended destination. Who is This Mysterious Crypto Whale? The fact that the unlocking wallet is labeled as ‘unknown’ by tracking services like Whale Alert is particularly intriguing. While Ripple’s own escrow wallets are well-documented, this suggests the funds might belong to a different entity. Potential possibilities for the owner of such a large sum could include: An early investor or large holder who had their XRP locked up separately. An institution or partner that received a large allocation of XRP under specific terms, potentially involving a custom escrow arrangement. Ripple itself, perhaps using a different or previously unidentified wallet for a specific purpose. Identifying the Crypto Whale behind this unlock is key to understanding its potential implications. An unlock by Ripple for operational use (like ODL transactions or partnerships) might have a different market impact than an unlock by a private investor looking to sell. How Could This XRP Unlock Affect the XRP Price? Large cryptocurrency unlocks often spark debate about potential market impact. The primary concern is typically whether the unlocked funds will be sold on exchanges, increasing supply and potentially putting downward pressure on the XRP Price . Here’s a look at the potential scenarios: Potential Bearish Impact: Increased Selling Pressure: If the owner intends to sell a significant portion of the 200 million XRP, it could absorb market demand and lead to a price drop. Market Sentiment: The mere knowledge of a large unlock, especially from an unknown source, can create uncertainty and negatively affect investor sentiment. Potential Bullish or Neutral Impact: Holding or Staking: The owner might simply move the XRP to a different wallet for long-term holding or participation in network activities (though XRP Ledger doesn’t have traditional staking like PoS chains). OTC Deals: The XRP could be intended for over-the-counter (OTC) deals with institutions or partners, which have less direct impact on exchange prices. Operational Use: If owned by Ripple or a partner, the XRP could be used for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) flows, funding new ventures, or strategic investments, which may not immediately hit the open market in large quantities. Re-locking: The XRP might be moved to a new escrow contract, essentially extending the lock-up period. Without knowing the identity of the owner and their intentions, predicting the exact impact on XRP Price is speculative. However, market participants will be closely watching for subsequent movements of these funds. Why is Tracking Crypto Whales Important? Movements by large holders, or Crypto Whale s, are often seen as indicators of market sentiment or potential future price action. When a whale moves a large sum to an exchange, it can signal an intent to sell. Conversely, moving funds off exchanges to cold storage can indicate an intent to hold. Tracking these movements provides valuable, albeit not definitive, insights: Supply Analysis: Understanding where large amounts of crypto are held (exchanges vs. private wallets vs. escrow) helps assess potential selling pressure. Sentiment Gauge: Whale activity can influence broader market psychology. Liquidity Insights: Large movements can impact liquidity on exchanges. Tools like Whale Alert play a vital role in bringing these large transactions to light, allowing the community to analyze and react. What Should Ripple XRP Holders Do Now? For individuals holding Ripple XRP , a large unlock event, especially from an unknown source, can be concerning. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and crypto tracking services like Whale Alert for updates on the movement of these specific 200 million XRP. Monitor Market Reaction: Observe how the XRP Price reacts in the hours and days following the report. Is there increased selling volume? Does the price hold steady? Context is Key: Remember that this unlock is just one factor among many influencing XRP’s price, including broader market trends, regulatory news (particularly the SEC case), and developments within the Ripple ecosystem. Avoid Panic Decisions: Do not make impulsive trading decisions based solely on this unlock report. Consider your own investment strategy and risk tolerance. Look for Subsequent Moves: The unlock itself is less impactful than where the funds move next. Watch if the 200 million XRP is sent to an exchange, a known corporate wallet, or remains dormant. Understanding the mechanics of XRP Escrow and the potential motivations of a Crypto Whale can help investors make more informed decisions rather than reacting out of fear. The Broader Context for Ripple XRP This unlock occurs within a dynamic period for Ripple XRP . The company continues to expand its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service globally, advocate for regulatory clarity, and engage in various partnerships. The ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a dominant factor influencing market sentiment and the XRP Price . While a 200 million XRP unlock is notable, its long-term impact depends heavily on the ultimate destination and purpose of the funds. It serves as a reminder that large, sometimes unpredictable, movements can occur in the crypto market, adding layers of complexity for investors. Conclusion: Watching the Waves of XRP The report of 200 million XRP being unlocked from an unknown escrow wallet is a significant event that has rightly caught the attention of the crypto community. While the existence of XRP Escrow provides a degree of transparency for Ripple’s planned releases, this particular XRP Unlock from an unidentified source introduces an element of uncertainty. The identity and intentions of the Crypto Whale holding these funds are currently unknown, leaving market participants to speculate on the potential impact on the XRP Price . Whether this leads to increased selling pressure, is part of a strategic move, or simply represents a shift in storage for a large holder remains to be seen. For those invested in or watching Ripple XRP , the coming days will be crucial for observing the next steps for these 200 million tokens and assessing their effect on the market landscape. Staying informed and analyzing subsequent movements will be key to navigating the potential volatility.

Backed by a rock-solid infrastructure and available globally 24/7, TronZap is already becoming the go-to platform for developers, traders, and power users across the TRON ecosystem. Avoid “OUT_OF_ENERGY” on TRON: Why You’re Burning TRX and How to Save It TRON is a high-throughput blockchain where every transaction requires bandwidth and energy . While bandwidth is used for basic transactions, energy is consumed by smart contract executions , like USDT transfers. Here’s the catch: if your wallet doesn’t have enough energy, the TRON network burns your TRX to compensate — and the transaction still goes through. In that case, you’ll see an “OUT_OF_ENERGY” error, and your TRX balance will be reduced to cover the energy cost. For example, a simple USDT transfer without energy can cost up to 13.4 TRX — which might seem minor, but quickly adds up for active traders, on-chain gamers, or DeFi users. Many ask, “ How to buy Tron energy? ” — and that’s where TronZap comes in with a simple, no-login solution. Introducing TronZap: Fast, Affordable, Tron Energy Rental Service TronZap allows users to buy Tron energy on-demand by sending a small TRX payment — no registration, no private key access, no wallet connection . Within 60 seconds, energy is delegated to the user’s wallet via TRON’s native delegation system. “We stake our own TRX and lend out energy to users in real time,” said the TronZap team. “Our mission is to make energy rental on TRON instant, transparent, and frictionless.” With TronZap, a USDT transfer can cost as little as 3.7 TRX — compared to 13.4 TRX without energy. This near-4x cost reduction can significantly improve the experience for frequent traders, on-chain gamers, and dApp users. Scalable, Secure, and Developer-Friendly TronZap is fully non-custodial. Users never need to share their wallet credentials , and all interactions are handled by smart contract-based delegation.

Recent news highlights this critical need for caution, as a significant development unfolds: the FTC Crypto Lawsuit against a major online trading education firm sends an alarming warning to consumers everywhere. In a move underscoring regulatory concerns in the digital asset and online trading education space, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), joined by the state of Nevada, has filed a comprehensive lawsuit against a company known by several names, including IYOVIA, IM Mastery Academy, iMarketsLive, and IM Academy. The core allegation? A massive $1.2 billion fraud scheme that allegedly preyed on consumers seeking financial knowledge. Unpacking the Allegations in the IM Mastery Academy Lawsuit According to the lawsuit, the company presented itself as a provider of educational services covering various financial markets, including cryptocurrency, forex, and the stock market. However, the regulatory bodies claim the reality was far different from the promises made. The central allegations revolve around two key issues: Misrepresentation of Earnings: The lawsuit claims the company significantly misrepresented the potential earnings its customers and salespeople could achieve. Prospective students were allegedly led to believe they could easily make substantial income through the company’s trading strategies and educational materials. Operating as a Multi-Level Marketing Scheme: A major component of the lawsuit is the claim that the company primarily operated as an illegal multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, or pyramid scheme, rather than a legitimate educational institution. The focus, regulators allege, was on recruiting new participants rather than providing valuable trading education. This dual nature – allegedly deceptive education combined with a recruitment-focused structure – forms the basis of the regulatory action. The FTC and Nevada argue that the vast majority of participants lost money, funneling funds into a system that primarily rewarded recruitment, not successful trading or genuine learning. Is It Education or a Crypto Education Scam? The line between legitimate online education and deceptive schemes can sometimes be blurry, but the allegations against IM Mastery Academy are stark. The lawsuit suggests that the educational aspect was merely a facade for a recruitment-driven operation. Here’s a breakdown of what regulators often look for when distinguishing genuine education from a potential scam: Feature Legitimate Education Alleged Scam (like IM Mastery Academy) Primary Focus Teaching marketable skills, providing knowledge Recruiting new members Revenue Source Tuition/fees for educational content Recruitment bonuses, fees from new members Income Potential Based on applying learned skills (trading success), requires effort & risk Based primarily on recruiting others, high income promises often tied to recruitment tiers Transparency Clear curriculum, qualified instructors, realistic expectations Vague promises of wealth, emphasis on lifestyle, downplaying risk, complex compensation plans rewarding recruitment In the case of IM Mastery Academy, the lawsuit specifically points to the alleged misrepresentations of income potential and the emphasis on recruitment commissions as hallmarks of an illegal pyramid scheme masquerading as a legitimate educational service. This raises serious questions for anyone considering paying for online trading or crypto education services. The Mechanics of Alleged Crypto Multi-Level Marketing Multi-level marketing (MLM) is a business model where participants earn money both from direct sales of products/services and from recruiting new participants who then recruit others. While some MLMs are legitimate, they can easily devolve into illegal pyramid schemes if the primary focus and source of income shifts from selling products/services to recruiting new members. The FTC has clear guidelines on this. The lawsuit against IM Mastery Academy alleges it crossed this line. Participants allegedly paid substantial fees for the educational packages, but a significant portion of the income generated within the company reportedly came from these fees paid by new recruits, rather than from successful trading outcomes based on the education provided. The recruitment structure allegedly incentivized members to bring in more people, creating a pyramid-like compensation structure where those at the top benefited most from the fees paid by those lower down. This model is particularly concerning in the context of complex markets like cryptocurrency and forex, where successful trading requires significant skill, knowledge, discipline, and carries inherent risk. If a company promises easy wealth through education but primarily rewards recruitment, it’s a major red flag for potential Online Trading Fraud. Warning Signs: How to Avoid Potential Online Trading Fraud and Education Scams This lawsuit serves as a crucial reminder for anyone looking to enter the world of online trading or seeking education in this area. Protecting yourself requires diligence. Here are some actionable insights and warning signs to look out for: Promises of Easy or Guaranteed Income: Be extremely skeptical of any program promising quick, easy, or guaranteed high returns, especially in volatile markets like crypto or forex. Legitimate trading involves risk and requires hard work and skill. Emphasis on Recruitment: If the primary way to make significant money within the program is by recruiting new members rather than by successfully applying the trading strategies taught, it’s likely an MLM and potentially an illegal pyramid scheme. High Upfront Fees with Vague Deliverables: Be wary of programs that charge substantial fees upfront for educational materials or access to trading tools without clearly defining the curriculum, instructor qualifications, or the actual value provided beyond access to a community or potential recruitment network. Pressure to Join Quickly: High-pressure sales tactics, urgency, and demands for immediate payment are common in fraudulent schemes. Lack of Transparency: Legitimate educational institutions and trading platforms are transparent about their fees, risks, and the credentials of their educators. Be suspicious if information is hard to find or seems intentionally confusing. Focus on Lifestyle Marketing: Many alleged scams use images and testimonials showing lavish lifestyles purportedly achieved through the program. This is often a tactic to sell the dream rather than provide solid education. Always research the company thoroughly, look for unbiased reviews (not just testimonials promoted by the company), check with regulatory bodies like the FTC or state attorney generals, and understand that trading involves significant risk of loss. What This FTC Crypto Lawsuit Means for the Industry The action against IM Mastery Academy is part of a broader trend of increased regulatory scrutiny on the cryptocurrency space and related online financial services. As more people become interested in crypto and online trading, fraudsters adapt their tactics. Lawsuits like this signal that regulators are actively monitoring this space and are willing to take action against companies they believe are engaged in deceptive practices and illegal schemes. For legitimate crypto and online trading education providers, this lawsuit reinforces the need for transparency, realistic expectations, and a clear focus on providing genuine educational value rather than promoting recruitment or unrealistic income claims. For consumers, it’s a powerful reminder to conduct thorough due diligence before committing time and money to any online investment or trading program. Conclusion: Navigating the Waters of Online Trading Fraud The allegations against IM Mastery Academy, as outlined in the FTC Crypto Lawsuit, paint a concerning picture of an alleged $1.2 billion fraud built on misrepresented earnings and a Crypto Multi-Level Marketing structure. While the legal process will determine the outcome, the case serves as a vital cautionary tale. It highlights the sophisticated ways alleged Crypto Education Scam operations can present themselves. For anyone looking to gain knowledge in cryptocurrency or online trading, the message is clear: prioritize legitimate, transparent education over programs promising easy wealth, especially those heavily reliant on recruitment. Your financial future depends on making informed decisions and avoiding the pitfalls of deceptive schemes.

But this isn’t just another acquisition. For anyone holding or following XRP, this could be a game-changer. Here’s what it could mean and why it matters more than you think. Why Ripple Is So Eager to Buy Circle? Motive At first, Ripple’s plan to buy Circle might seem like just another business move. But if you look closer, there’s a much bigger reason behind it. Circle, the company that created USDC, one of the biggest stablecoins in the world, holds more than $60 billion in value. IF RIPPLE ACQUIRES CIRCLE, XRP’S PRICE WON’T JUST REACT—IT COULD EVOLVE. Most are watching the deal. But this is about what happens to XRP if it goes through. Here’s what every holder needs to understand. pic.twitter.com/RXWpUKmL8K — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 2, 2025 If Ripple buys Circle, it would get access to all that money, along with Circle’s strong connections with banks and government regulators. This would make RippleNet, Ripple’s payment system, even stronger. XRP would then play an even bigger role in connecting all the money moving around. Interestingly, Ripple has already made a move. It reportedly offered $5 billion to acquire Circle. That offer was rejected, with insiders saying Circle felt it was undervalued. Since then, rumors have spread that Ripple may have raised its offer to as high as $20 billion, though that hasn’t been confirmed officially. How Would This Affect XRP? If Ripple owns both its own stablecoin (RLUSD) and USDC, it can make the payment system simpler and smoother. This means money can move faster, with fewer steps and lower costs. For people who hold XRP, this could be a big deal. XRP wouldn’t just help with sending money across countries, it could become a key part of how money moves everywhere, even with stablecoins. If Ripple takes that over, it may finally earn the kind of trust Wall Street needs to seriously consider XRP & its upcoming ETFs. What If the Deal Doesn’t Happen? Even if Circle says no or goes public instead , the message is clear, Ripple wants more control over stablecoin liquidity. And it won’t stop with one offer. Whether this deal happens or not, Ripple is setting the stage for XRP to play a much bigger role in the next phase of finance. If Ripple succeeds, XRP won’t just be part of the system—it could be the system.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-03 08:22:02

44101011,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalikbuterin-ethereum-simplification-bitcoin-inspired-redesign,1746261015,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Vitalik wants to make Ethereum ‘as simple as Bitcoin’ in 5 years,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalikbuterin-ethereum-simplification-bitcoin-inspired-redesign?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin called for simplifying Ethereum’s base protocol, aiming to make the network more efficient, secure and accessible, drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s minimalist design. In a blog post titled “Simplifying the L1,” published on May 3, Buterin laid out a vision to restructure Ethereum’s architecture across consensus, execution and shared components. “This post will describe how Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin,” Buterin wrote, arguing that simplicity is key to Ethereum’s resilience and long-term scalability. While recent upgrades like proof-of-stake (PoS) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) integration have made Ethereum more robust, he said that technical complexity has led to bloated development cycles, higher costs and greater risks of bugs: “Historically, Ethereum has often not done this (sometimes because of my own decisions), and this has contributed to much of our excessive development expenditure, all kinds of security risk, and insularity of R&D culture, often in pursuit of benefits that have proven illusory.” Buterin praises Bitcoin for its simplicity. Source: Vitalik Buterin Related: ‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story’ is less about crypto and more about being human Ethereum eyes “3-Slot Finality” to simplify consensus One key area of focus is Ethereum’s consensus layer. Central to this effort is the proposed “3-slot finality” model, which eliminates complex components like epochs, sync committees and validator shuffling. “The reduced number of active validators at a time means that it becomes safer to use simpler implementations of the fork choice rule,” Buterin wrote. Other proposed improvements include allowing for more straightforward fork choice rules and adopting Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (STARK)-based aggregation protocols to decentralize and simplify network coordination. On the execution layer, Buterin proposed a shift from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to a simpler, ZK-friendly virtual machine like RISC-V. This move could offer 100x performance improvements for zero-knowledge proofs and significantly simplify the protocol. RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) used in designing computer processors. It follows a minimalist design philosophy, using a small set of simple instructions for high efficiency and easier implementation. To preserve backward compatibility, Buterin suggested running legacy EVM contracts onchain via a RISC-V interpreter while supporting both VMs concurrently during a transitional phase. Source: Vitalik Buterin Related: Ethereum community members propose new fee structure for the app layer Buterin calls for protocol-wide standards Buterin also advocated for protocol-wide standardization. He suggested adopting a single erasure coding method, serialization format (favoring SSZ), and tree structure to reduce redundant complexity and streamline Ethereum’s tooling and infrastructure. “Simplicity is in many ways similar to decentralization,” Buterin wrote. He suggested Ethereum adopt a “max line-of-code” target similar to what Tinygrad does, keeping consensus-critical logic as lean and auditable as possible. Non-critical legacy features would remain but reside outside the core specification. Buterin’s proposal aimed at simplifying Ethereum comes as the network continues to lose market share to competing blockchains. During a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event on May 2, Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen, said Ethereum’s relative dominance among L1 blockchain networks has declined . “If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.” Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-03 08:30:15

According to Artem Shaginyan, founder and head of strategy of Web3 payment company Lunu Pay, the Cannes municipal government hopes for a 90% crypto acceptance rate among local merchants. He added, “When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory.” Cannes Mayor held a training session to urge merchants to accept crypto payment integration Cannes, which attracts more than 3 million visitors annually, is striving to become a global hub of crypto tourism. Many shop owners are said to view the acceptance of cryptos as a way to cater to the high-net-worth crowd and tech-savvy travelers, who are increasingly embracing decentralized finance rather than traditional banking. As part of its ongoing efforts to prepare for the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in the summer of 2025, Cannes is working towards encouraging even more local merchants to accept crypto payments. Cannes mayor David Lisnard has personally called for crypto payments, presenting it as a step toward modernization rather than from an ideological standpoint. Local shops will start accepting crypto payments this summer, and the city’s municipal government seems ready to welcome more crypto investors. In February, the Cannes Mayor held a training session for shop owners and professionals to encourage crypto payments incorporation. By improving the city’s payment ecosystem in the long term, the city hopes to draw in more customers with high disposable income. Cannes is not the only city that has gone down the crypto route when it comes to modernizing its payment mechanisms. In December 2023, the Swiss city of Lugano, a municipality of the country’s Ticino crypto valley, started accepting Bitcoin and stablecoin payments for taxes and municipal services. Before that, Governor Jared Polis of Colorado had green-lighted crypto tax payments in September 2022. Vancouver is also on the list of cities that have adopted crypto. In December 2024, it approved a motion to explore Bitcoin’s incorporation into the city’s financial system and possibly integrate a Bitcoin treasury strategy. North Carolina Representative Neal Jackson also introduced a bill, “The North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act,” on April 10. If it passes, the state will accept cryptocurrencies as a recognized tax payment form. However, the added conditions restrict the type of cryptocurrency that can be used. For an asset to be used for payments, it needs to have a market cap above $750 billion to make it liquid enough to cover large transactions. Then again, its daily trading volume should be more than $10 billion and have at least 10 years of market history. Panama City joined the list of crypto-accepting jurisdictions On April 15, Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi declared that the city would accept cryptocurrency payments for taxes and municipal fees, extending to bus tickets and permits. So far, the city has only allowed payments in Bitcoin, Ether, Circle’s USDC, and Tether’s USDT. Before April 15, however, the city, even under previous administrations, had tried to introduce pro-crypto legislation but failed. Mizrachi argued that the main reason the others were unsuccessful was due to the existing laws requiring transactions exclusively in U.S. dollars. He said his government bypassed those requirements by collaborating with a bank that immediately converts any digital assets received into US dollars. This way meant they could incorporate crypto into their payment system without drafting any new legislation. He also believes implementing crypto into their systems will help protect their public treasuries from inflation, increase investment, and improve the city’s status.

If so, a recent report from CME Group likely caught your attention. The derivatives giant just announced an absolutely massive surge in its CME crypto futures trading volume for April, highlighting a significant uptick in professional engagement with digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. What’s Behind the Huge Jump in CME Crypto Futures? CME Group, a leading global derivatives marketplace, revealed in a May 2 press release that its cryptocurrency average daily volume (ADV) hit an impressive 183,000 contracts in April. This volume translates to a staggering $8.9 billion in notional value, showcasing the scale of trading activity. What’s truly remarkable is the comparison to the previous year: this represents a colossal 129% increase year-over-year. This kind of growth isn’t just a minor blip; it suggests a powerful trend. Institutions, professional traders, and sophisticated investors are increasingly turning to regulated platforms like CME to gain exposure to cryptocurrency price movements without directly holding the underlying assets. The infrastructure and regulatory clarity offered by CME are significant drawcards for these large players. Breaking Down the Bitcoin and Ether Futures Volume While the overall CME crypto futures volume is impressive, looking at the individual products provides even more insight into where the demand lies: Micro Bitcoin Futures: The ADV for these smaller-sized Bitcoin contracts rose by a substantial 115% year-over-year, reaching 78,000 contracts in April. This indicates strong interest not only in direct Bitcoin exposure but also in more granular, flexible trading options. The popularity of Micro Bitcoin futures volume underscores the diverse strategies being employed by market participants. Micro Ether Futures: Ethereum’s derivative performance was even more explosive. Micro Ether futures ADV soared by an incredible 165% year-over-year, hitting 63,000 contracts. This surge in Ether futures volume points to growing institutional confidence and trading activity around the Ethereum ecosystem, perhaps fueled by anticipation or reaction to network developments and market trends. The growth in both Micro Bitcoin and Micro Ether futures volume highlights the increasing sophistication of crypto derivatives trading on regulated exchanges. These products allow for hedging, speculation, and complex trading strategies that are essential tools for institutional investors managing large portfolios. Why Does Surging Institutional Crypto Interest Matter? The significant jump in institutional crypto activity on platforms like CME is a crucial indicator for the broader market. Here’s why it’s important: Market Validation: Increased institutional participation lends credibility and maturity to the cryptocurrency asset class. Enhanced Liquidity: Higher trading volumes generally lead to deeper markets and potentially less volatility caused by large orders. Price Discovery: Regulated futures markets play a vital role in price discovery, helping to establish fair market values. Infrastructure Development: The demand from institutions drives further development of robust trading infrastructure and services. This trend suggests that cryptocurrency is moving further into the mainstream financial landscape, becoming an accepted part of diversified investment strategies for professional firms. What’s Next for Crypto Derivatives Trading? The data from CME Group provides a clear snapshot of accelerating adoption within the institutional space. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve and more sophisticated trading tools become available, we can likely expect further growth in crypto derivatives trading . While challenges such as regulatory uncertainty and market volatility persist, the trajectory shown by CME’s volume figures is overwhelmingly positive for the long-term integration of digital assets into global finance. This sustained increase in CME crypto futures volume, particularly the robust performance of Bitcoin and Ether futures, serves as a compelling testament to the evolving nature of the crypto market – one where institutional players are becoming increasingly influential.

On May 2nd, these investment vehicles witnessed a significant net inflow, indicating renewed investor interest. This development is particularly noteworthy as it marks a positive shift following periods of volatility in the crypto market . What Happened with Bitcoin ETF Inflows on May 2nd? According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined net inflow of $678.78 million on May 2nd. This figure represents the second consecutive day of positive flows into these funds, a trend closely watched by market participants. What makes this inflow particularly striking is its source. The entire amount, every single dollar of that $678.78 million, came from just one fund: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( BlackRock IBIT ). This highlights the significant influence and investor confidence associated with BlackRock’s offering in the competitive ETF space. Other US spot Bitcoin ETFs, including major players like Grayscale’s GBTC, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark Invest/21Shares’ ARKB, reported no change in their holdings on this specific day. This means their inflows and outflows netted out to zero, or they simply saw no activity, leaving BlackRock IBIT as the sole driver of the day’s substantial positive flow. BlackRock IBIT’s Dominance in the Bitcoin Investment Space BlackRock’s IBIT has consistently been a top performer since the launch of spot US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Its ability to attract such large sums, even when other funds are stagnant, underscores its position as a preferred vehicle for many looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated financial product. This strong performance by BlackRock IBIT is often seen as a positive signal for institutional interest and overall market health. For many investors, choosing an ETF for Bitcoin investment comes down to factors like issuer reputation, fees, and liquidity. BlackRock, being one of the world’s largest asset managers, brings significant credibility, which likely contributes to IBIT’s success in attracting considerable Bitcoin ETF inflows . What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investment and the Crypto Market? Large and consistent Bitcoin ETF inflows are generally interpreted as a bullish sign for the price of Bitcoin. Increased demand via these regulated products can absorb supply and put upward pressure on the asset’s value. The fact that May 2nd marked the second straight day of inflows suggests a potential shift in sentiment after a period characterized by outflows or lower activity. This trend in US spot Bitcoin ETFs is crucial for the broader crypto market. It indicates that traditional finance participants are actively engaging with Bitcoin, seeing it as a viable asset for Bitcoin investment portfolios. While the crypto market is influenced by many factors, institutional flows via ETFs are becoming an increasingly important one to monitor. Key takeaways from this inflow event: Strong Demand: The $678M figure shows robust demand for Bitcoin exposure via ETFs. BlackRock’s Influence: BlackRock IBIT continues to be a dominant force in attracting capital. Trend Reversal?: Two consecutive days of positive Bitcoin ETF inflows could signal changing market sentiment. Market Signal: ETF activity is a key indicator of institutional interest in the crypto market. Looking Ahead: Sustaining Positive Flows The focus now shifts to whether this positive trend in Bitcoin ETF inflows can be sustained. Factors such as global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin’s own price performance will likely influence future flows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Continued strong performance from funds like BlackRock IBIT will be key to maintaining positive momentum for Bitcoin investment via these products. Investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring daily flow data to gauge sentiment and predict potential impacts on the crypto market. The performance of these ETFs is now inextricably linked to the broader narrative around institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Conclusion The $678 million net inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 2nd, driven entirely by BlackRock IBIT, is a significant data point. It underscores the continued demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels and highlights BlackRock’s leading role in this space. As these Bitcoin ETF inflows continue to be a major factor influencing the crypto market, investors should watch these trends closely as part of their overall Bitcoin investment strategy. The positive flows suggest a potential strengthening of market sentiment, offering a hopeful outlook for the near term.

One new decentralized finance (DeFi) project making serious waves right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With analysts predicting a potential surge of up to 19,900% in the months ahead, it’s quickly becoming a name serious investors are adding to their watchlists. For anyone searching what crypto to invest in ahead of the next big market breakout, Mutuum stands out for its real utilities, growing momentum, and clear growth plan. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t just another hyped-up presale. It’s a thoughtfully designed decentralized lending and borrowing platform that offers users both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Through P2C, users can lend stable and major assets into secure pools, earning steady returns based on supply and demand dynamics. Meanwhile, P2P lending gives users more flexibility by allowing direct loans between individuals for more customized terms. This dual approach not only attracts a broader range of users but also positions Mutuum to adapt as DeFi evolves. Adding to this structure, Mutuum introduces mtTokens — digital representations of user deposits that automatically grow in value through interest accumulation. Instead of users needing to manually manage their earnings, mtTokens handle it passively, offering a clear edge for those looking for reliable passive income through crypto investment opportunities. Momentum around Mutuum’s presale is impossible to ignore. So far, the project has raised over $7.3 million, gathered a community of more than 9,200 holders, and sold more than 432 million tokens — all while still priced at just $0.025. This strong early support shows that smart investors are recognizing Mutuum’s potential early, adding it to their lists of top cryptocurrencies to buy now before broader exposure kicks in. With Phase 4 wrapping up, the price will soon rise to $0.03, triggering a built-in 20% gain for early buyers. This growing demand has created a powerful sense of urgency, especially among those scanning the market for the best crypto to invest in before the next wave of DeFi growth takes off. Unlike many DeFi projects that depend on third-party tokens, Mutuum Finance is building its own overcollateralized stablecoin directly into its ecosystem. Users mint stablecoins by depositing collateral, and the system ensures that each stablecoin is backed by real assets on-chain. This not only strengthens the platform’s internal economy but also insulates it from external volatility, a move that adds serious long-term security. Revenue generated from platform activity — including lending fees and stablecoin operations — will also be partially redirected to support the MUTM token. This strategy builds constant buy pressure and rewards participants who are willing to stay engaged with the platform long-term, a rarity among many newer DeFi crypto projects. Looking at historical DeFi surges and combining that with Mutuum’s real-world utility, analysts see a path toward a 19,900% increase within a few months post-launch. If this forecast plays out, the current $0.025 entry price could transform dramatically, putting early backers in a position for life-changing returns. To put it into perspective, a $500 investment today would grow to nearly $100,000 if the upper target is achieved. Even hitting a fraction of that growth would outperform almost any major altcoin currently available on the market. For investors wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in during the current presale season, Mutuum is a project that’s hard to ignore. Mutuum Finance is more than just another DeFi idea on paper. It’s an active project with real lending systems, passive income tools, a sustainable revenue model, and an expanding community. With its presale closing in fast, a built-in stablecoin system ready, and tokenomics structured for steady value growth, Mutuum Finance could easily become one of the next big cryptocurrencies as the next cycle heats up. For those serious about crypto investing, especially ahead of the next bull market, keeping an eye on Mutuum Finance — or better yet, securing a position now — looks like one of the smarter moves for 2025 and beyond.

Major players like Barclays and Goldman Sachs are making significant calls that could impact everything from your portfolio to the broader economic outlook . Their latest prediction? A July Fed Rate Cut . This forecast isn’t coming out of thin air; it’s a direct response to the surprisingly strong US Jobs Report we just saw. For anyone watching the markets, especially the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic signals is absolutely crucial. What Does This Interest Rate Forecast Signal? When investment banks like Barclays and Goldman Sachs issue an interest rate forecast , the market listens. Their models are sophisticated, and their analysts pore over every piece of economic data. The fact that both institutions, known for their influence and analytical rigor, are aligning on a July rate cut is a powerful signal. This isn’t just a casual guess; it suggests their internal analysis of recent data points strongly towards the Federal Reserve making a move sooner rather than later. Their previous expectations might have been for later in the year, perhaps September or even beyond. Shifting that expectation forward to July indicates a significant re-evaluation based on new information. This kind of recalibration by major banks can often precede broader market consensus shifts and investor positioning. Why the Strong US Jobs Report is the Catalyst The catalyst for this revised interest rate forecast is the recent US Jobs Report . This report is one of the most closely watched pieces of economic data each month. It provides a snapshot of the labor market’s health, including metrics like: Non-Farm Payrolls: How many jobs were added or lost in the previous month (excluding farm workers, government employees, private household employees, and non-profit organization employees). A strong number here means the economy is creating jobs robustly. Unemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work. A lower rate indicates a tighter labor market. Wage Growth: How much average hourly earnings increased. Strong wage growth can signal inflation pressures but also healthy consumer spending power. The latest report reportedly exceeded expectations, meaning the numbers for job creation, unemployment, or potentially wage growth were stronger than economists had predicted. While a strong jobs market is generally good news for the economy, it presents a complex challenge for the Fed, which is trying to balance employment goals with inflation control. Decoding the Fed Rate Cut: What It Means So, why would a strong US Jobs Report lead banks to predict a Fed Rate Cut? It might seem counterintuitive. Typically, a strong economy (signaled by robust job growth) would give the Fed reason to keep rates higher to prevent overheating and inflation. However, the context is key. The Federal Reserve uses interest rates as a primary tool to manage the economy. When they ‘cut’ rates, they are lowering the cost of borrowing money. This makes it cheaper for businesses to invest and expand, and for consumers to take out loans for homes, cars, etc. The goal is to stimulate economic activity. Here’s a breakdown of what a rate cut aims to achieve: Boost Economic Growth: Lower borrowing costs encourage spending and investment. Support Employment: Stimulating businesses can lead to more job creation. Counteract Slowdown Risks: If the Fed sees potential signs of a future slowdown, a proactive cut can help cushion the impact. The fact that Barclays and Goldman Sachs see a cut *despite* a strong jobs report could imply they believe: The Fed’s focus is shifting more towards managing potential risks or achieving a specific inflation target range that they feel is now within reach. The strong jobs report might be interpreted within a broader context that still justifies a cut, perhaps related to other economic indicators or global conditions. They might believe the Fed sees the current strength as temporary or that inflation is sufficiently under control to allow for stimulus without reigniting price pressures. How Does This Impact the Market? The potential for a Fed Rate Cut has significant implications across all financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. This is where the Market Impact becomes highly relevant for our readers. Traditional Markets: Stocks: Lower interest rates generally make stocks more attractive. Borrowing is cheaper for companies (boosting profits), and the lower return on safer assets like bonds encourages investors to move into equities. This often leads to stock market rallies. Bonds: Bond prices typically rise when interest rates fall. Existing bonds issued at higher rates become more valuable. However, future bond yields will be lower. Currency: Lower interest rates can sometimes weaken a country’s currency as it offers lower returns to foreign investors. Cryptocurrency Markets: The Market Impact on crypto is less direct but still profound. Crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin, are often seen by some as alternative stores of value or risk assets. Here’s how a rate cut could influence them: Increased Liquidity: Lower rates mean more money is circulating in the financial system, potentially flowing into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Search for Yield: With lower returns on traditional safe investments, investors might look for higher yields or growth potential in alternative assets, including crypto. Inflation Hedge Narrative: While the link is debated, some investors view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. If a rate cut is perceived as potentially inflationary down the line (by overstimulating the economy), this narrative could gain traction. Investor Sentiment: A general boost in market optimism due to economic stimulus can positively influence sentiment towards crypto. It’s important to note that crypto markets are also driven by their own unique factors, but macro economic shifts like interest rate policy are increasingly influential as institutional adoption grows. Navigating the Economic Outlook: Challenges and Considerations While the forecast from Barclays and Goldman Sachs is noteworthy, the economic outlook remains complex, and a July rate cut is not a certainty. The Federal Reserve’s decisions are based on a wide range of data and considerations, not just one jobs report or the forecasts of a couple of banks. Challenges and Factors the Fed Considers: Inflation Data: This is paramount. The Fed has a 2% inflation target. If inflation remains stubbornly high, even a strong jobs report might not be enough to justify a cut. Wage Growth: While strong wages are good for workers, rapid wage increases can contribute to inflation, complicating the Fed’s decision. Consumer Spending: How are consumers reacting to the current economic climate? Are they still spending robustly or pulling back? Global Economic Conditions: International events and the health of other major economies also play a role. Financial Stability Risks: The Fed must also consider whether its policies could create bubbles or instability in the financial system. Therefore, while the Barclays and Goldman Sachs forecast is a strong indicator, market participants will be closely watching all upcoming economic data releases, particularly inflation reports (like the Consumer Price Index – CPI and Personal Consumption Expenditures – PCE), and statements from Fed officials leading up to the July meeting. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For those tracking the potential Fed Rate Cut and its Market Impact, here are some key things to keep on your radar: Upcoming Economic Data: Pay close attention to the next inflation reports (CPI, PCE), retail sales figures, and manufacturing data. These will provide more pieces of the economic puzzle. Statements from Fed Officials: Members of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) often give speeches or interviews. Their commentary can offer clues about the current thinking within the Fed. The Next FOMC Meeting: The official decision on interest rates is made at the FOMC meetings. The statement released after the meeting and the subsequent press conference by the Fed Chair are critical events. Market Reaction: Observe how stock, bond, and cryptocurrency markets react to incoming data and Fed commentary. Market movements often price in expectations before official announcements. Understanding the interplay between economic data, central bank policy, and market reactions is vital for navigating the current environment, whether you’re focused on traditional assets or the evolving crypto landscape. Concluding Thoughts: A Potential Turning Point? The forecast from Barclays and Goldman Sachs for a July Fed Rate Cut, spurred by the robust US Jobs Report, marks a potentially significant moment in the current economic cycle. It suggests that despite continued strength in the labor market, major financial institutions believe the conditions are aligning for the Federal Reserve to begin easing monetary policy sooner than previously anticipated. This shift in the interest rate forecast has broad implications for the entire economic outlook and is set to create considerable Market Impact across asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. While uncertainties remain, and the Fed’s final decision hinges on a multitude of factors, this forecast highlights the growing expectation that the era of aggressive rate hikes may soon give way to a period of potential cuts, a development keenly watched by investors worldwide.

What we are—I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically.” Trump made the same statement on Truth Social, writing, “We’re only in a transition stage, just getting started!” This came after job data for April showed slower employment growth. He used the new numbers to repeat his demand for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, claiming that lower rates, along with steady jobs, would push the economy forward. Trump, who recently passed his 100th day in office, is trying to control the story as criticism grows over his handling of the economy. Some economists are warning that his tariffs will lead to rising inflation and falling growth. He’s ignoring that and sticking to his line. Stock market rises as trade deals and Fed decision loom A new poll by Reuters/Ipsos showed that Trump’s approval rating dropped five points since his January 20 return to the White House, now sitting at 42%. People are starting to push back against the way he’s dealing with the economy. A report from the Commerce Department showed that GDP fell for the first time in three years. The drop happened after businesses rushed to buy goods ahead of Trump’s tariffs. Still, some economists said consumer spending and private investment were strong signs that growth might bounce back. On the market side, Wall Street is rallying. The S&P 500 recovered from the April 2 drop and posted its longest winning streak since 2004. The index went above its 50-day moving average for the first time in two months. That gain came after China showed interest in talking trade again. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, said, “Making most of April 2 go away is what I think investors are waiting for.” Hogan said just one deal with a big trade partner could set things in motion. “We’re about halfway through that 90-day window, and, really, I think investors would react positively to getting that first deal on the tape.” Art added that China might take more time to negotiate, but a deal with Mexico, Canada, Japan, or the Eurozone could have the same impact. “I certainly feel as though that would be monumental,” he said. While traders chase gains, many still think the U.S. economy might slow down. Some investors believe the country could avoid a full recession, but the risk is there. Technically, the S&P 500 broke through near-term resistance, but it still hasn’t passed the 200-day moving average. The index was last around 5,694. Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said the next resistance is at 5,783, the same level from the day of the November election. She said, “We did see a breakdown that was more significant than the short-term breakout. I call it a round trip—despite the recent bounce, the damage to the charts has been done.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Multiple analysts forecast that the flagship’s crypto next all-time high (ATH) rally is around the corner, with some suggesting that the initial jump could come in the coming days. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Running Out Of Time’? Analyst Says New ATH May Not Come This Cycle Bitcoin To $100,000 This Weekend? Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has recovered from its sub-$80,000 correction, breaking above the $90,000 mark and reclaiming the $93,5000 resistance to re-enter its post-US elections price range. Amid its recovery, the cryptocurrency consolidated between the $93,000-$96,000 range, moving sideways for the last weeks. The start-of-month pump has seen BTC break out of this range after being compressed during this period, resembling its performance from two weeks ago. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades explained that BTC surged to the $83,000-$86,000 region during the mid-April recovery, consolidating for over a week before a small 2% breakout toward the $87,500 resistance. This was followed by a two-day “tight chop” and a breakout to a new higher range. He suggested that Bitcoin displays “a similar setup as the week before” as it has ranged and compressed within the $93,000-$96,000 zone and jumped around 2% to the $97,700 mark. Additionally, the largest crypto by market capitalization’s “tight chop” phase could have started as its price has hovered between $97,050 and $97,700 for the past few hours. If BTC replicates its recent performance, the flagship crypto could rally around 8% toward a new range at the end of the weekend and retest $99,000-$100,000 in the coming days. BTC Resembles Q4 2024 Price Action Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin could repeat its Q4 2024 performance. He highlighted that BTC has recovered from its downside deviation to reclaim its recent re-accumulation range, but it’s facing a lower high resistance within this zone. Notably, the cryptocurrency experienced the same situation in the post-halving re-accumulation range, initially rejected from the lower high to fall to the range’s lows. Weeks later, Bitcoin broke above the lower high resistance, restesting it as support before breaking out and soaring to a new ATH. The analyst noted that the idea was first explored before the US election pump, suggesting that BTC could mimic its Q1 2024 rally, fueled by the US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). “It would be poetry if Bitcoin repeated history and followed through on the same path in this current Range as well,” he stated. However, Rekt Capital detailed that for history to repeat, Bitcoin must get rejected at $99,000, hold the $93,500 mark as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance. Related Reading: Crypto Graveyard: 50% Of Tokens Have Failed In the Past 5 years – Report Then the flagship crypto would need to hold the $97,000-$99,000 range as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. The analyst concluded that if Bitcoin continues holding the $93,500 mark, the price will be positioned to move across its re-accumulation range. Nonetheless, BTC must break its “black Lower High resistance within this Range, which is positioned at ~$99k this week.” As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $97,461, a 3% increase in the weekly timeframe.

44102057,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65942,1746263314,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,New Ripple Ad About Growth In United Arab Emirates Stuns XRP Army,https://timestabloid.com/new-ripple-ad-about-growth-in-united-arab-emirates-stuns-xrp-army/,"Crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) shared Ripple’s new promotional video on X, bringing attention to the company’s latest achievement in the United Arab Emirates. She emphasized a key message from the video, where Reece Merrick. In the clip, Ripple’s Senior Executive Officer/Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa expressed the company’s pride as the first blockchain-enabled payment service provider licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). NEW RIPPLE AD: „THE UAE IS ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES IN THE REGION TO PROVIDE REGULATORY CLARITY FOR THE INDUSTRY. RIPPLE IS PROUD TO BE THE FIRST BLOCKCHAIN ENABLED PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDER TO BE LICENSED BY THE DUBAI FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY!“ #XRP pic.twitter.com/ha2jhXL7rR — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 1, 2025 DFSA Approval Marks a Strategic Win Ripple recently received official approval from the DFSA, which oversees financial activities within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This regulatory license enables Ripple to offer crypto payment services involving XRP within a jurisdiction that has developed one of the region’s clearest legal frameworks for digital assets. Amelie noted that the UAE is “one of the first countries in the region to provide regulatory clarity” for the crypto industry. That clarity, paired with the country’s sizable $40 billion cross-border payments market, makes it a strategic location for Ripple’s continued expansion. In contrast to jurisdictions like the U.S., with a developing crypto regulatory framework and some uncertainty, the UAE’s proactive stance offers companies like Ripple a stable foundation for long-term operations and gives XRP room to expand globally. XRP Utility and Long-Term Market Strategy Ripple’s presence in the UAE aligns with its broader global strategy to engage with regions building formal structures for digital asset services. The DFSA’s licensing regime places Ripple among the limited number of firms authorized to operate within the DIFC’s financial ecosystem. This move further positions Ripple as a trusted partner for institutions seeking compliant crypto-based settlement solutions. By securing this license, Ripple is reinforcing its case for XRP’s role in international finance. The company has focused heavily on leveraging XRP for real-time, cross-border transactions, particularly in corridors where traditional systems are costly or inefficient. The UAE’s support for fintech innovation provides Ripple with a valuable base for expanding such services across the Middle East and Africa. Ripple sees the UAE and surrounding markets as a huge opportunity and has made bullish projections for RLUSD . This growth could benefit XRP in the long term. Amelie’s post drew attention to more than just a marketing message—it signaled a meaningful shift in Ripple’s regulatory status in one of the world’s most crypto-forward regions. While challenges remain in other markets, Ripple’s licensing by the DFSA demonstrates its commitment to operating within legal frameworks that encourage digital asset innovation.

The release was executed through a series of three separate transactions: 500 million XRP valued at approximately $1.1 billion, 300 million XRP worth around $660 million, and 200 million XRP valued at $440 million. This latest movement aligns with Ripple’s pre-established monthly escrow schedule, designed to ensure predictability and transparency in the distribution of XRP. Source: Whale Alert A Return to the Standard Escrow Routine The recent release reaffirms Ripple’s long-standing commitment to controlled and predictable tokenomics. Under its 2017 escrow system, Ripple locked 55 billion XRP into escrow accounts, with the condition that 1 billion XRP could be released each month to fund Ripple’s operations, incentivize partners, and support network liquidity. While many in the XRP community had been closely watching for May’s escrow activity, it appeared for a time that Ripple might skip the scheduled release altogether. As earlier reported by the Timestabloid, Ripple initially moved 700 million XRP on May 1 into escrow without any corresponding release—a pattern it followed last month as well. In April, Ripple re-locked a similar amount of XRP before releasing any tokens from escrow , ultimately unlocking the new batch days later. This deliberate pacing has sparked speculation over Ripple’s evolving approach to liquidity management, especially as XRP adoption grows in both retail and institutional markets. Nonetheless, the latest activity shows a return to the norm, reinforcing the consistency that Ripple has sought to demonstrate through its escrow mechanisms. Acquisition Buzz: Ripple Reportedly Eyes Circle Amid this on-chain activity, speculation has mounted over a potential acquisition by Ripple of Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. While no official confirmation has surfaced, reports suggest Ripple may have considered an acquisition offer around Circle’s estimated $5 billion valuation. If true, a Ripple-Circle deal could significantly reshape the stablecoin landscape, especially given both firms’ deep involvement in cross-border payment infrastructure and overlapping partnerships, such as with African fintech giant Onafriq. These developments, though still speculative, have generated significant intrigue within the crypto community. Market Context and Community Reaction The unlocking of such a large amount of XRP often generates mixed reactions among investors and market watchers. On one hand, the sheer scale—$2.2 billion worth of XRP entering potential circulation—can raise concerns about downward pressure on the token’s price. On the other hand, historical trends show that Ripple rarely dumps large quantities of XRP on the open market all at once. Instead, most of the unlocked tokens are either redistributed in smaller tranches or returned to escrow in subsequent months. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At present, XRP is trading around $2.21, slightly down by 0.08% over the last 24 hours. Despite modest price fluctuations, the token has remained relatively resilient in the face of broader market volatility. Bitcoin, for instance, has reclaimed the $97,000 mark, suggesting a recovering macro environment across digital assets. For XRP, maintaining stability amid large escrow unlocks could indicate a maturing market response and growing investor confidence in Ripple’s supply control. Transparency, Control, and Liquidity Ripple’s escrow model remains one of the most transparent in the crypto space, offering predictability that many other projects lack. Each monthly release is publicly verifiable on-chain, and platforms like Whale Alert offer real-time visibility into the movement of large token volumes. This level of openness is crucial for fostering institutional trust, especially as Ripple pursues international regulatory licenses and broadens its suite of financial products, including the RLUSD stablecoin. Furthermore, Ripple’s regular escrow updates reinforce its commitment to responsible supply control, helping mitigate inflationary concerns and assuring stakeholders that arbitrary decisions will not drive XRP’s distribution. Ripple strengthens XRP’s appeal as a long-term asset in cross-border payments and emerging DeFi use cases by adhering to a transparent, rules-based system. Looking Ahead With the latest 1 billion XRP unlocked, all eyes now turn to Ripple’s next moves—whether it will allocate a portion of the released tokens for ecosystem growth or return significant amounts to escrow, as it has in recent months. As the company continues to make regulatory headway globally and expand the use of its stablecoin RLUSD, the way it manages its XRP reserves could play a critical role in its broader strategic positioning. For now, the reappearance of the standard escrow release pattern offers a familiar rhythm in a market often marked by unpredictability. As Ripple stays the course, investors and industry analysts will continue to monitor how these monthly unlocks align with the company’s evolving ambitions in global finance.

44102101,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/bitcoin-dips-on-path-to-100k-which-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now,1746263423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44102101.jpeg,Bitcoin Dips on Path to $100K - Which Is The Best Crypto to Buy Now?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/bitcoin-dips-on-path-to-100k-which-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now,"The market has made it loud and clear that the bull run has arrived, but that doesn't mean BTC will have smooth sailing from here on out. While the world's largest cryptocurrency is inching closer to the $100K level, it recently experienced a minor dip of 0.39% in the last 24 hours. While there are some reds on the intraday charts, the overall trend is green, leaving people to question whether it is the best crypto to buy now. Is Bitcoin the Best Crypto to Buy Now - Yes and No Bitcoin is currently trading above its $96K support and has a market capitalization of $1.91 trillion. The minor dip in the last 24 hours is the result of a small sell-off, because despite the bullishness, the market continues to be volatile. But this volatility is less likely to impact the rising channel Bitcoin is on. The only reason it could move down is if it breaks below $94K, its key support level—and even then, a ""buying the dip"" opportunity could be created, since history has shown that the community is willing to work hard to maintain a bull run. Furthermore, considering the massive institutional interest and progressive regulations backing Bitcoin, it is possible that the world’s largest crypto will hit a new high soon. One of the core reasons is Strategy’s new $84 billion Bitcoin investment plan, which will massively increase the firm’s already large Bitcoin holdings—currently worth $37.9 billion. Other firms are also stepping up with their intentions to bolster their Bitcoin holdings. Japan-based MetaPlanet has issued $24.8 million in bonds to buy more Bitcoin and plans to raise $250 million for additional BTC purchases. Twenty One Capital will soon go public with a $3.6 billion SPAC merger and aims to operate as a Bitcoin-centric holding company. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer crypto trading by 2026 and will potentially introduce BTC trading to millions of retail investors. BlackRock has also increased its Bitcoin holdings and has even raised its ownership of Strategy to 5% . This factor is likely to continue pushing Bitcoin upward, so the recent small dip is nothing more than an insignificant blip on the radar—at least for now. In this instance, Bitcoin could be the best crypto to buy now. However, there is also a case against buying Bitcoin. For one, it is too expensive right now and beyond the reach of many retail investors. And being a high-cap crypto, even a move beyond $100K would bring only a fractional gain to those who invest. Mid- and low-cap altcoins tell a different story. Their growth is often far greater during a bull run—and if these assets are meme coins, the level of upside is almost exponential. In this case, the best crypto to buy now could be among these altcoins. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Pick These Assets as Bitcoin Alternatives BTC Bull With Bitcoin's growth indirectly impacting the meme coin market to a massive degree, BTC Bull dares to be an asset that could experience the direct impact of Bitcoin's rise. This project is simple in its approach. A meme coin it is, and there are no long-term or large use cases it promises. However, it is still special because it has created a roadmap that could help it grow beyond what a short burst of virality would typically allow. BTC Bull has tied two of its core mechanics—token burns and Bitcoin airdrops—to Bitcoin's growth. Whenever Bitcoin reaches a certain level, these mechanics will be unlocked. The supply-demand narrative would make BTC Bull deflationary, helping it grow based on the rising demand for Bitcoin alternatives. And with Bitcoin airdrops, more retail investors could end up holding Bitcoin based on how many tokens they have bought. This conventional approach within an unconventional setting gives BTC Bull an edge over other projects—including Bitcoin itself. The bull doesn't miss. 🏹 pic.twitter.com/pFDoB0Klzv — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) April 25, 2025 And the picturesque memes add a unique flair to the project, giving it the viral potential that only a few meme coins manage to achieve. SUBBD Bitcoin’s value is driven by speculation, and regardless of all the talk about it being the future, blockchain innovation is where the real money lies. SUBBD is a content creation project that is therefore worth paying attention to. As a content creation platform, SUBBD removes the traditional roadblocks found in legacy platforms. No longer will content creators lose monetization opportunities, as SUBBD promises to give them a bigger portion of their revenue. And with AI tools, these creators could develop a better relationship with their fans—one molded through collaboration, not transaction. Developed by Gabrielle Taylor, SUBBD is poised to become a better alternative to OnlyFans, with features encompassing everything from AI influencers to unique creation kits. Prominent crypto analysts like ClayBro have praised the project, calling it one that could bring much-needed innovation to an $85 billion industry. Available on presale, SUBBD has raised upwards of $300K to date. Investors are circling the project not only because of its profit potential, but also the unique and spicy content they can create—or come across—using it. Solaxy While Bitcoin is growing, one must not forget the high level of traction Solana has been getting. Currently trading just below its resistance at $150, Solana could rise even higher—if not for its shortcomings due to congestion. Solaxy is a project emerging to address this using its unique L2 solution. Through ZK Rollups, Solaxy plans to provide off-chain transaction capabilities to Solana, making it more scalable, faster, and efficient. The project also aims to unleash Solana’s potential by integrating the trait of interoperability. To achieve this, Solaxy has implemented technologies such as Hyperlane and Celestia. Developers have already created a blockchain explorer, giving users insight into what this project could become in the future. While utility stands at the front and center of this project, Solaxy also leans into memes—as evident from the meme-esque images available on its website and official Twitter page. Spread the word of $SOLX everywhere you go. 🔥With this kind of speed NO ONE is going to want to miss out. 🛸🪐 https://t.co/mdaTX9aVVx pic.twitter.com/bRxRYtGr1I — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 1, 2025 Solaxy presents a unique investment opportunity in the sense that the focus should always be on future potential upsides—even if a project is a meme coin. This mixed approach is the reason why Solaxy could reign as the best crypto to buy now in the days to come. Mind of Pepe Bitcoin’s growth could put specific niches, such as AI agents, at the center. Mind of Pepe could ride that interest and move up in value once the presale concludes. Mind of Pepe presents users with a mix of meme coin and AI agent token, offering quirks and perks in equal measure—circumventing traditional market fundamentals that could otherwise limit performance. The AI agent behind Mind of Pepe is developed by Elvora Labs and is set to launch on May 10th. It will provide a host of market insights to investors, including detailed analyses of community sentiment. Furthermore, since the AI agent is associated with a meme coin, jokes will also be a common feature. The intrinsic value of Mind of Pepe, however, also comes from trading alpha calls, which will be exclusive to MIND holders and dispensed via an app or a Discord group. Tools for token deployment and creation are also discussed on the official website, giving Mind of Pepe a much-needed edge in the market. Could it be a better alternative to Bitcoin? Yes—especially due to its low cost and high utility potential. Summary Bitcoin’s journey closer to the $100K level is a landmark movement for a market trying its hardest to get back on track. But as institutional interest continues to be the primary driver behind Bitcoin’s recent growth, retail investors looking for cheaper assets should find their best crypto to buy now elsewhere. The options given in this article could be of benefit. Each option has its own quirks, and the perks they provide could lead to long-term profit.

In a new video, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 565,000 YouTube subscribers that key metrics suggest Bitcoin’s bull market is not over and BTC may soon hit $160,000. The analyst uses the global M2 money supply – which measures the amount of money flowing throughout the financial system – to forecast potential price targets for Bitcoin. “You can see the yellow line is the global M2 money supply. Bitcoin price is following it almost picture perfectly. How high will it go? We are not sure, but estimates are at least $120,000, maybe $160,000. We shall see. But good things are ahead. We might need to be a bit patient, wait out till June, July.” Source: InvestAnswers/YouTube He also says that the buying trends among different Bitcoin holder cohorts indicate that whales are accumulating the flagship digital asset at a greater rate than others. Look at the accumulation. It’s spreading top-down as well… The whales, [those with] greater than 10,000 Bitcoin have been at peak accumulation for quite some time now, around 0.95. The 1,000 to 10,000 whales, and the 100 to 1,000 Bitcoin cohorts are up about 0.9. They keep on stacking. I talked a lot about that 100 to 1,000 cohort. They are critical to watch. They are now the money players. They hold more Bitcoin than anybody else, any other cohort. And then you got the 10 to 100 Bitcoin holders who are pivoting towards 0.6. They’re beginning to stack. And sadly, everybody with less than 10 Bitcoin has continued to distribute. Okay, the small players are selling.” Source: InvestAnswers/YouTube Lastly, he says that his Top and Bottom Indicator (TABI), which draws on multiple metrics in an effort to predict market peaks and bottoms, indicates Bitcoin may head higher. “Now let’s talk about the Top and Bottom Indicator. This tells us when we are getting overheated or not for Bitcoin… We are still yellow. We are still middle of the road. We need to, after this yellow phase, go dark yellow, then orange and then red. We are right bang in the middle with a slight little yellow uptick right now again, beginning to get overheated. But this is where we are, everybody, this bull run is not over.” Source: InvestAnswers/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $97,044 at time of writing, flat on the day.

This shift signals more than just a tech upgrade; it reflects a strategic push to attract high-net-worth clientele and global tourists who are increasingly comfortable transacting in digital currencies. Cannes City Eyes a Digital Futurea The initiative, spearheaded by Web3 payment firm Lunu Pay in collaboration with the Cannes municipal government, targets an ambitious 90% merchant adoption rate within the city. According to Lunu Pay founder Artem Shaginyan, the decision also marks a turning point in how crypto is perceived in mainstream commerce. Rather than being confined to niche internet communities or speculative investment circles, crypto is now being positioned as a practical, day-to-day payment method for luxury goods, services, and hospitality—an especially relevant use case in a city like Cannes that thrives on tourism and high-end commerce. What sets this move apart is the scale and intent behind it. Local authorities are not merely allowing crypto—they are actively training business owners and professionals to understand and implement it. Back in February, Mayor David Lisnard launched a training initiative to familiarize merchants with digital payment tools, a clear indication that this isn’t a half-measure but a determined transition. A Global Trend Gains Momentum Cannes isn’t the only city pushing toward a crypto-integrated future. Governments worldwide are making similar moves in hopes of staying competitive in the increasingly digitized global economy. In Switzerland, the city of Lugano began accepting Bitcoin and select stablecoins for tax and municipal payments as part of a broader initiative to become a blockchain hub. Across the Atlantic, Colorado Governor Jared Polis greenlit crypto tax payments as early as 2022. Vancouver followed suit in 2024, exploring the possibility of integrating Bitcoin into its financial system and even adopting a BTC treasury strategy. Just last month, Panama City took the leap by allowing municipal payments in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, and major stablecoins like USDC and USDt. Mayor Mayer Mizrachi also emphasized that such modernization efforts would position the city as a magnet for global investment and innovation.

The Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin ( BTC ) and create a reserve managed by state officials, was formally struck down on Friday, according to an update on the Arizona State Legislature’s website. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs wrote in a statement aimed at Warren Petersen, the President of the Arizona Senate. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currency,” she added. On April 28, the bill passed a final vote in the state House when 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposing. Hobbs had previously stated she would veto any legislation not tied to a bipartisan agreement on disability funding. Source: Governor Katie Hobbs Related: Bitcoin bros at ‘the club’ may stop US gov’t from buying BTC — Arthur Hayes Another Bitcoin awaits final vote A companion bill, SB1373, which would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Arizona’s rainy-day fund into digital assets like Bitcoin, has not yet reached a final vote. Arizona joins several other states where similar efforts have failed. In recent months, similar proposals in Oklahoma, Montana , South Dakota and Wyoming have stalled or been withdrawn. In contrast, North Carolina’s House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act on April 30, allowing the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain funds in approved cryptocurrencies. The bill has now been moved to the state Senate for consideration. The state-level efforts to create Bitcoin reserves come amid a push from US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers to do the same in the federal government.

Trading at $0.025 in phase 4, the project is now 55% filled, and phase 5 is on the verge of launching with a price jump of 20% to $0.03. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) gained 12% in a week and reached $0.70 but tends to slow down with caution flashing everywhere from its technical indicators. Will Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with its DeFi lending model shine over Cardano (ADA) in 2025? Investors are speaking, and the clock is ticking since presale tokens are running out. Cardano Scaling the Heights Cardano manages to remain afloat above $0.70 with a 33% rise in trade volume to $723 million. But already, the BBTrend indicator, which was at 7.55, shows that momentum is already falling, having dropped sharply from the 13.27 days ago reading. The Directional Movement Index currently maintains both sellers and buyers at a near draw in the battle with an ADX of 17.14, indicating a bit of consolidation. Testing the $0.69 support, Cardano (ADA) is short of falling, should it fail, otherwise it will target 0.77. Cardano (ADA) is a long time since progress strides encourage the hopes of future promise, however, over the short term, market whimsy dictates the reward to those who invest. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is jetting through phase 4, tokens going for $0.025, with 55% already snatched up. Investors will reap a sure 20% profit once Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 5 kicks in at $0.03, given that the tokenomics guarantees 140% return at $0.06 at listing. However, whispers of a post-launch target of $3 for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from the initial target seem set to create a mouth-gaping 11,900% ROI. Recently, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team unveiled a dashboard spotlighting the top 50 holders, and these are rewarded with bonus tokens for holding firm. This fuels FOMO as phase 4 nears its end, pushing investors to act fast. DeFi Innovation Creates Demand The team behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, with results soon to be shared on social channels. This adds trust to a platform that is built purely on overcollateralized lending, where borrowers must lock more collateral than a debt to ensure stability. Lenders make interest through mtTokens that appreciate in value, and a buy-and-distribute system channels revenue of the platform to token repurchasing rewarding stakers. Unlike speculative assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is utility-based, making it a DeFi giant in 2025. A Standout in the Crypto Market Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set a revolutionary course for itself: pulling in presale hype while providing pragmatic DeFi solutions. Its 140% soaring listing gains and what might become a $3 post launch bump are brilliant in contrast to the slow climb that Cardano (ADA) has set for itself, climbing completely at the mercy of the market. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 4 tokens entirely disappear, the price target of $0.03 is looming with a 20% hike over the current value, and this will tempt anyone to move quickly. Steadfast Cardano (ADA) stands firm but presents technical impediments to its 2025 sheen. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the “crypto to watch” because it has a huge potential for phenomenal returns.

Crypto in the United States is entering a new era as policymakers across the federal and state levels consider strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserves and a legislative framework that brings clarity to the industry after years of uncertainty. You might also like: The focus is on strengthening US leadership in crypto tech | Opinion In the last weeks alone, President Trump announced the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve under executive action, while U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation proposing the creation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve through Congress. If passed, it would reinforce Bitcoin’s significance in financial markets and create long-term confidence among miners and investors. For Bitcoin mining, this shift represents a crucial opportunity because clear and consistent regulations can support innovation, attract investment in the sector, and promote sustainable growth. By creating a framework that balances accountability with opportunity, the US can solidify its position as a global leader and ensure that both the Bitcoin mining and energy sectors thrive. During this regulatory renaissance, Bitcoin has remained central to the discussion because it’s the foundation of the crypto ecosystem. But as the only major asset that utilizes proof-of-work, Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure is what keeps the whole industry grounded. Supporting miners with regulatory clarity is essential for the long-term viability of the space. Historically, miners have operated under an unclear mix of state and federal regulations, but Washington is now taking a more deliberate approach and pivoting toward more structured oversight and collaboration. A bill modeled around the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act ( FIT21 ) is already in the works, aiming to end regulatory uncertainty and clearly define the roles of the SEC and CFTC. By replacing reactive regulation with a structured framework, FIT21 (or a future, updated version) has the potential to provide much-needed stability and will help the industry grow with confidence. Bills like the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act and Senator Hagerty’s GENIUS Act represent an important step toward integrating stablecoins into the financial system. This bill could increase liquidity in crypto markets, encourage institutional investment, and reinforce Bitcoin’s role as the reserve asset of the digital economy. You might also like: What happens on day one after the GENIUS Act passes? | Opinion However, it’s crucial that lawmakers differentiate Bitcoin from other digital assets—many of which lack its resilience and long-term viability. Thoughtful regulation should prioritize the foundational importance of Bitcoin and ensure that mining operations are given the clarity and incentives needed to continue strengthening the network. Similar to past emerging industries like ridesharing, states are leading the charge by example. While federal policies are still being developed, many individual states have already embraced Bitcoin mining as a driver of energy innovation and economic development. Fifteen US states, including Texas, Alabama, Arizona, and Florida, have introduced legislative proposals to create Bitcoin strategic reserves, recognizing its long-term potential as a financial asset. Not all of them will pass, but the activity is encouraging. In Arizona and Utah, legislation is already moving through approval channels, potentially setting a precedent for Bitcoin’s role in state financial strategies. Recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate reserve asset alongside gold and other state-held reserves would be a significant moment for institutional adoption. Public-private partnerships are also playing a crucial role at the state level. In Texas, Bitcoin miners are working with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to stabilize the power grid, adjusting their energy consumption based on supply and demand. Collaborations like this show how mining can be an asset to the energy sector and contribute to energy resilience nationwide. In Arkansas, local governments are prohibited from treating Bitcoin miners differently from traditional data centers. Montana passed a similar bill to protect miners from government interference and explicitly said that the industry “provides positive economic value” to local communities. These efforts reflect a growing recognition of Bitcoin mining’s role in economic growth, encouraging further investment and long-term development. The economic benefits of Bitcoin mining are tangible in communities across the country. Thanks to mining operations, rural towns that have struggled with job creation are experiencing new investment and infrastructure development. With the right regulatory approach, this economic revitalization can continue, ensuring that mining remains a net positive for local communities while maintaining a responsible approach to energy use. The next few years will define the future of Bitcoin in the US. With a strong energy infrastructure, increasing regulatory clarity, and a commitment to sustainable growth, America has a generational opportunity to lead. Lawmakers now have the opportunity to craft policies that foster innovation rather than stifle it. By prioritizing Bitcoin’s foundational role and ensuring mining flourishes, the US will secure its place at the forefront of the global crypto economy.

Here’s Why Top Analyst Thinks So,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-to-hit-135k-in-100-days-heres-why-top-analyst-thinks-so/,"The post Bitcoin To Hit $135k in 100 Days? Here’s Why Top Analyst Thinks So appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin might be on the edge of a massive breakout, at least, that’s what crypto analyst Timothy Peterson believes. Based on key market signals, he says Bitcoin could reach $135,000 in just 100 days, and the reasons behind this are worth a closer look. What Does the VIX Have to Do with Bitcoin? At the center of Peterson’s prediction is the VIX, a volatility index that tracks how uncertain investors are about the market. When it spikes, it usually means fear is high. The 4 Things I'm Watching that Point to Bitcoin New ATH in 100 Days. In order of least important to most important. (Day 3, continued tomorrow) $VIX and Volatility. I described this here: https://t.co/k0YFtsc0ft Anything below 18 would be considered ""risk on"". This could… https://t.co/OtgZXByNzc pic.twitter.com/p9Pi33Ueor — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) May 1, 2025 In April, the VIX closed above 56, something that’s happened only twice in modern history, during the 2008 financial crash and the 2020 COVID market panic. In both cases, what followed was a strong bounce back, especially for tech stocks like those in the NASDAQ. Peterson noticed that after a VIX spike, the NASDAQ gained around 10% in the first week, then soared by another 40% over the next 100 trading days. Bitcoin Is Acting Like a Tech Stock What’s surprising is that Bitcoin seems to be moving in a similar pattern to the NASDAQ’s historical rebound. Peterson says the data shows Bitcoin is tracking the NASDAQ’s recovery with 95% accuracy, a striking similarity. But since Bitcoin is more volatile, the impact could be bigger. If market fear (VIX) continues to drop, especially below 18, which is seen as a “risk-on” zone, Peterson predicts Bitcoin could hit $107,000 in a few weeks and rise to $135,000 within 100 days. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. Government Won’t Buy Bitcoin for a Reserve, Says BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes , Bitcoin Price Outlook As of now, Bitcoin price is trading around $96,296 , reflecting a drop of 0.51% with a market cap hitting $1.9 trillion. Looking at the price chart, Bitcoin formed a “local bottom” between February and April 2025. It also stayed above a key line called the Kijun, strengthening the trend. Recently, Bitcoin has broken above its April high of $95,173, which now acts as support, a positive sign for more growth. If it breaks above $95,800, the next target could be $99,000 and then $110,000 to $115,000 . Bitcoin’s price action shows it may be ready for a breakout. If it stays above $95,800, expect more upside soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This week, Panama-based fintech Lulubit revealed plans to expand into Honduras and the Dominican Republic. Already operating in Panama, Guatemala, and Costa Rica, the company aims to ease remittance costs and broaden crypto accessibility. Founded by Ianir Sonis, Lulubit bridges traditional banking and crypto, enabling users to buy and sell digital assets directly via local bank accounts. Its platform helps lower cross-border remittance fees, which can reach 6% in countries like Guatemala, by using stablecoins and blockchain rails, boosting family incomes. Sonis describes Lulubit as a “2.5” company: a hybrid of Web2 and Web3 that offers flexible financial tools for Latin America’s growing population of remote workers and crypto-savvy youth. Towerbank launches Ikigii wallet in Panama At Panama Blockchain Week, Towerbank introduced Ikigii, a digital wallet that merges US dollar accounts and crypto access in one interface. According to Johan Hernández, head of Towerbank’s crypto unit, Ikigii was designed in response to rising crypto activity. The bank chose to embrace this demand by becoming one of the region’s first crypto-friendly financial institutions. Ikigii allows users to seamlessly manage and liquidate crypto assets into fiat, giving customers real-time control over both types of funds. While its initial rollout focuses on Panama, Towerbank has regional ambitions—especially in countries with unstable currencies—aiming to offer broader access to modern financial tools. Visa partners with Bridge to boost stablecoin spending In another major move, Visa announced a partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin payments infrastructure provider owned by Stripe, to roll out stablecoin-enabled Visa cards across Latin America. These cards will allow users to spend stablecoins for everyday purchases, with transactions instantly converted into local currencies at any Visa-accepting merchant. The program is set to launch in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Chile. For developers in the region, the partnership opens up new possibilities to integrate crypto payments into existing platforms. With US lawmakers advancing stablecoin legislation, this collaboration could signal the start of more mainstream adoption of crypto in traditional finance systems worldwide.

The token’s price rallied from $0.13 to over $0.21 intraday, driven by a perfect storm of bullish catalysts including a highly anticipated airdrop campaign and expanded exchange access. Trading volume spiked above $85 million, making STO one of the top gainers in the market. Binance Listing and HODLer Airdrop Fuel STO Demand The Binance listing introduced STO to a much wider user base with trading pairs against USDT, USDC, BNB, FDUSD, and TRY. The move was amplified by Binance’s HODLer airdrop of 15 million tokens, allocated to users subscribed to BNB Simple Earn products. The airdrop, which represented 1.5% of STO’s total supply, helped convert passive holders into active market participants, reinforcing buying interest.

The refund was facilitated by the cybercrime unit of the Cyberabad police, making it the first time where digital assets lost in a fraud case were recovered. According to the report, the funds were recovered after legal intervention and international cooperation. The Indian police were able to trace, freeze, recover, and reimburse the victim in this case. In the report sheet, the case was registered with the police on February 2, 2024, with the victim alerting the police immediately they discovered they had been scammed. Indian police reimburse digital assets stolen by scammers After the Indian police received the complaint, they kickstarted the investigation, following the digital trail of the transactions. The investigation revealed that the victim was lured into investing 24,275 USDT, an equivalent of Rs. 20.39 lakh, into an online crypto investment scheme. Like every scheme, the scammers promised him returns for every investment he made. The police mentioned that the payments were made to several wallets. According to the police, the criminals swindled the victim under the guise of entering trading contracts, promising him high returns on his investments. After following the digital trail of the transactions, the Indian police discovered that some of the funds had already been moved to a wallet that had ties to an international cryptocurrency exchange that had their headquarters in Seychelles. The police issued a formal notice to the exchange, requesting for the Know Your Customer (KYC) and wallet details. The police noted that the exchange was a great help in their investigation, complying with their notice and revealing the identity of the wallet holder. The exchange also confirmed an available balance of 0.03979 BTC, worth about $3,746 or Rs. 3.22 lakh. With the information, the Indian police urged the court for a debit freeze order, which the court duly granted. After the submission of all relevant documents and transaction flow details, the court directed the exchange to initiate a refund of the frozen assets to the victim’s wallet. Subsequently, about 3,125.42 USDT, worth around Rs. 2.68 lakh was returned to the victim. Cybercrime police warn of the rise in criminal activities linked to digital assets Following the case, the Indian police issued an advisory notice on the rise in criminal activities linked to digital assets in the country. While the police highlighted that scammers have also turned up their activities in other parts of the globe, residents should be cautious when relating to strangers that they meet on the internet. They warned the public should refrain from sharing sensitive information with strangers. The police have also warned about the rise in spate of online investment and trading activities. They mentioned that since more people are now turning to crypto to make money, criminals are now entering the space, disguising their intentions, and scamming unsuspecting users. These criminals use platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook to target their potential victims. Some even go as far as befriending them for a couple of months before introducing them to the investment. This way, they gain trust and betray that trust by swindling them. In addition, residents have also been warned to be careful about the kind of apps that they install on their phones. The police mentioned that criminals have gone as far as cloning applications, infusing them with spyware that will help them steal digital assets. They mentioned that, most of the times, scammers present these applications to people as harmless investment apps, with the end game of stealing whatever digital asset the user posses.

He remarked that this longevity reflects a fundamental viability in the ecosystem, regardless of personal alignment with the token. Ripple’s Transformation into a Conglomerate He further observed the transformation of Ripple, the company associated with XRP. In his view, Ripple has evolved into what he called a “holding company, a conglomerate of assets within the digital asset ecosystem.” Tapiero attributed value to this model, describing it as a sophisticated organizational strategy that extends Ripple’s relevance beyond just the XRP token. His comments suggest that Ripple’s structure now includes a range of projects and interests across the blockchain sector, enhancing its strategic importance.

While he did not provide specific projections regarding the ETFs’ performance, his remarks pointed to the broader sentiment that XRP’s presence in regulated investment vehicles is becoming more normalized. The 10T Holdings CEO also addressed the geopolitical and regulatory backdrop influencing XRP’s standing. He referenced Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s ongoing involvement in U.S. policymaking and his engagement with President Donald Trump . Tapiero stated, “You have to take your hat off to Brad Garlinghouse for having got involved with Trump and still very involved,” noting that Garlinghouse has helped advocate for the digital asset sector during the transition from the previous SEC administration. A Shift Toward Institutional Legitimacy He credited Garlinghouse with putting in what he called “a lot of hard work for the space itself,” particularly in pushing back against regulatory opposition from the former SEC leadership. The reference underscores how XRP and Ripple have continued to operate under scrutiny and are now achieving significant regulatory milestones, such as approving a futures-based ETF. Tapiero’s remarks demonstrate a measured acknowledgment of XRP’s resilience and growing presence within the institutional landscape. While he did not express full support, he recognized the asset’s continued relevance, Ripple’s corporate evolution, and Brad Garlinghouse’s political engagement. The SEC’s approval of the ProShares XRP Futures ETFs further reinforces the shifting perception of XRP’s significance in the U.S. digital asset sector.

But beneath its value lies a flaw: mining it demands specialized, expensive hardware and electricity-intensive operations often housed in massive data centers. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, is flipping the mining game on its head—introducing a model that lets anyone with a smartphone start earning crypto, no warehouse or wiring required. The Traditional Model: Expensive, Complex, and Outdated Bitcoin mining has become a game of deep pockets. To stay profitable, miners rely on energy-hungry ASIC rigs that cost thousands of dollars, require technical expertise, and are often located in large-scale facilities. This has led to: High entry barriers for regular users Centralization risks due to concentration of power among few major mining farms Environmental concerns due to massive energy consumption While Bitcoin’s innovation was historic, the technology behind it hasn’t aged well for mass participation. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: Mining for Everyone Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is a next-generation cryptocurrency that takes Bitcoin’s foundation and injects it with modern engineering. Through a hybrid consensus model—Proof-of-Work for security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake for speed—Bitcoin Solaris delivers scalability and security without the need for costly infrastructure. Its revolutionary Solaris Nova mining app is the centerpiece of this shift. Instead of cables and fans, all you need is your phone. The app enables universal participation with: Cross-platform mining: Available on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and even web browsers Adaptive mining algorithm: Detects your device capabilities and adjusts accordingly Integrated wallet: Store BTC-S securely without third-party tools One-tap mining: Literally press a button and start earning Built-in tutorials: Beginners can start without any technical knowledge What If You Caught the Next Big Bitcoin Fork Early? Why It Works: Mining Without Overhead The app’s low-resource design makes mining on everyday devices not only possible but efficient. Here’s how it eliminates the traditional burdens: Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Equipment ASICs worth thousands Smartphones, PCs, or basic GPUs Energy Consumption Very high 99.95% less than Bitcoin Accessibility Limited to tech-savvy users Open to anyone with a device Setup Time Hours or days Minutes with the Solaris Nova App Environmental Impact Heavy carbon footprint Eco-friendly hybrid consensus Built on Trust and Verified Security To ensure transparency and security, Bitcoin Solaris’s smart contracts have been fully audited by leading cybersecurity firms . The network also undergoes continuous review through a public bug bounty program, offering peace of mind to developers and users alike. Beyond Mining: Staking, Features, and Ecosystem Power Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just about mining—it’s a full ecosystem. Here are its standout features: Liquid Staking: Stake BTC-S and receive sBTC-S tokens 1:1, keeping your assets liquid while earning rewards and participating in governance. Helios DeFi Infrastructure: Enables decentralized exchanges, lending, cross-chain transactions, and more, providing utility far beyond basic coin holding. Referral Program: During presale, both the referrer and referred receive bonus BTC-S, encouraging organic community growth. These combined features place Bitcoin Solaris not just ahead of Bitcoin in accessibility—but ahead in long-term ecosystem value. A New Era for Investors: The Presale That’s Making Waves While Bitcoin took years to go mainstream, Bitcoin Solaris is gaining momentum fast. With Phase 1 nearly complete, BTC-S is still priced at just $1.00—but Phase 2 will double that to $2.00, and the launch price is set at $20.00, offering early adopters a potential 1,900% return. This limited-time window has already captured the attention of industry veterans who see Bitcoin Solaris as not just a new token, but the gateway to mainstream adoption of mobile-first mining. Getting Started Is Easy To join this mining revolution: Download the Solaris Nova app on your smartphone or computer when it’s released. Create a secure account within minutes. Let the app auto-configure your device for optimized mining. Start mining BTC-S with a single tap—no hardware, no stress. No cables. No noise. No technical learning curve. Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris represents what Bitcoin could never achieve: decentralized mining from the palm of your hand. By eliminating the need for hardware investment and technical expertise, it has cracked open crypto mining for the global population. If Bitcoin is the past of digital currency, Bitcoin Solaris is its future—accessible, green, and built for everyday users. With a fast-moving presale and a mobile-first approach, Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a competitor to Bitcoin—it’s a complete evolution. Could This Be Your Early Chance at the Future of Bitcoin?

44103446,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-firms-join-forces-tackle-big-tech-ai-monopoly,1746266400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Over 70 crypto firms join forces to tackle big tech’s AI monopoly,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-firms-join-forces-tackle-big-tech-ai-monopoly?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"In a move that hopes to challenge Big Tech’s grip on artificial intelligence, AI agent protocol Thinkagents.ai has launched a new open-source framework for building onchain agents that operate autonomously across decentralized networks. While traditional systems aim to restrict data ownership and platform abilities for their users, Thinkagents.ai is creating an interoperable ecosystem owned and controlled by its users. For Mike Anderson, core contributor at THINK, the Think Agent Standard is the future of AI. Anderson and his team developed the Think Agent Standard to enable millions of autonomous onchain AI agents to transact and communicate. The protocol now has over 70 companies, like Arbitrum and Yuga Labs, on board to help out. The platform is now live, allowing developers, enterprises and Web3 communities to experiment with the framework. “There was always this idea that it’s so much harder to [build AI] and so much more expensive when you have to build a thousand custom ways of doing it,” Anderson said during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. “By standardizing demand — the way people want to receive AI — you can get the whole market to line up because they want customers, and getting customers in AI is really difficult.” Following the release of Meta’s Llama 2 a few years ago, Anderson and his team decided that if the future of decentralized AI ever manifested, they needed to ensure that consumers could easily use graphic processing units (GPUs) without spending billions of dollars. “We watched as this whole ecosystem started to grow, with people saying, ’I’m going to build this part of the stack,’ and others saying they’ll ‘build that part of the stack,” almost as if Amazon Web Services (AWS) showed up with each department, with one saying they’ll do the data and another saying they’ll do the networking,” Anderson said. We found that the problem isn’t having enough builders, it’s aligning them around an actual use case. Mike Anderson, core contributor at THINK. Source: THINK Developing the AI standard The Think Agent Standard was launched by THINK protocol, in partnership with the Independent AI Institute, with the initial use case around Anderson and his team defining an AI agent (a place on a blockchain that has access to a computer and can make decisions), and the AI agents playing the video game Street Fighter 3 against each other. The use case brought nine different companies to work together for an audience of 30,000 viewers last summer. That validated the idea that we could unite all of these infrastructure companies, provide a better product to customers, and do it in a way where users owned their information, data, keys, and encryption. Because if owning and controlling AI agents is to remain in the hands of users, the decentralized AI agent platforms need to be simple, user-intuitive, well-designed and deliver on a user experience that could have changed the way we use and understand social media. Related: How Meta’s antitrust case could dampen AI development “Imagine if we’d had the foresight in 2003 to see social media as a way to organize our lives,” Anderson said. “Instead of having accounts on MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, what if we had a standard where your accounts follow you —where all of your data and everything you’d posted in the past is something you’re providing to them. It’s a very different thing if users owned their accounts and data and could have opted into seeing ads where they would benefit from them. That’s what we’re building.” The future of AI agents Just as the ERC-20 standard enabled the tokenized economy, the Think Agent Standard introduces a modular, permissionless and composable system that allows AI agents to function as sovereign digital entities: Owning wallets, interacting with smart contracts and transacting seamlessly across every blockchain. Each Think agent is powered by Non-Fungible Intelligence™ (NFI), a digital identity layer that establishes ownership, memory, and authentication, with the core genome palette residing on The Root Network and subsequent layers deployed to any connected network natively. The agents are composed of three core elements: The Soul (NFI), which provides a persistent, self-sovereign identity; the Mind, which governs behavior and decision-making; and the Body, which allows interaction across platforms and environments. The first platform built on the Think Agent Standard is SOULS, a personal AI agent that users can own, train and customize. SOULS connects to thousands of open-source applications and evolves over time by integrating the best available intelligence without compromising user privacy or ownership. Related: Crypto projects prepare to battle for privacy in Switzerland Leading organizations in gaming, infrastructure and generative AI, including Yuga Labs, Futureverse, Alchemy, Render, Venice.ai and Magic Eden, are actively integrating the standard into real-world applications, further validating its potential across use cases. “AI agents are the new interface to technology,” Anderson said. “What we’ve been able to do successfully is partner with consumer brands — like Bored Ape Yacht Club — to actually have distribution into a consumer’s end point, and we’ve been able to build all the systems so that they can actually access consumers.” We’re helping people transition to the AI age by owning their intelligence instead of renting it from someone else. For Anderson, a personal AI agent is like a personal dashboard that acts as an extension of your real self. If the information contained within your AI agent were to leak, the results could be personally catastrophic. That’s why Think is standardizing the system the agent can interact with, backed by cryptography, no matter what chain the agent is on. If a safe and successful standard exists within the user-owned AI agent industry, big tech will have a harder time controlling it. It’s why users can own their data through their Think agent, eliminating the need for their data to be copied and live on some external third-party server. In this way, Think agents also hope to address the issue around data ownership by putting users in control of who they share their information with. “When a social company goes out of business, all of that data gets sold to the highest bidder,” Anderson said. “23andMe is the most egregious example of this. They didn’t give you your DNA data and then delete it from their servers, their business model was actually to sell your data to others. Now, who knows who the highest bidder is. Is it an insurance company? The Chinese government? Who is it? Your data exhaust is more valuable than your DNA.” Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ARB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-03 10:00:00

It powers billions in cross-border payments, settles transactions in just 3 to 5 seconds, and is used by major banks and institutions globally. Despite all this, its price remains underwhelming. A recent post by All Things XRP lays out the reasons why and what could change soon. OTC Deals Keep XRP Demand Hidden One of the main reasons XRP’s utility doesn’t impact its price is how it’s being used. Most institutional players acquire XRP over-the-counter (OTC), not through public exchanges. So even though banks are transacting with XRP, that volume doesn’t show up in trading data. This disconnect keeps the price relatively flat despite high utility. Hidden Road is a Trump Card But things could soon shift. Ripple recently acquired Hidden Road , a prime brokerage that moves over $3 trillion a year. If even a portion of that volume starts running through the public XRP Ledger (XRPL), the demand would become visible to markets, possibly causing the price to spike. This could finally allow XRP’s real-world use to show up in price charts. Speculation and ETFs Could Build the Bridge Traders are paying close attention. The ongoing talks around an XRP ETF and Ripple’s expanding network of CBDC and financial partnerships are boosting sentiment. Speculation acts as a bridge between utility and price, and that bridge is currently under construction. Analysts say there’s an 85% chance of an XRP ETF approval this year, which could attract serious institutional money. From Infrastructure to Price Impact Unlike Bitcoin, which is seen as digital gold, XRP functions more like a financial rail. According to Teucrium’s CEO, XRP’s real-world use case might even surpass Bitcoin’s . As crypto markets evolve from hype to utility, XRP stands to benefit. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s Plan to Acquire Circle Could Turn XRP Into a Global Payment Standard , Many people get stuck on the idea of market cap (price × supply), thinking it limits how high XRP can go. But that’s a misunderstanding. For utility tokens like XRP, what matters most is how useful they are. If XRP becomes essential for global payments, price growth is inevitable, regardless of market cap. Right now, XRP’s price doesn’t reflect its true potential. But with institutional pipelines growing, more public usage on the horizon, and ETF access likely, the gap between price and utility may soon close. Real-world use could finally drive real price movement. On the flip side, Versan Aljarrah, CEO of Black Swan Capitalist, claims XRP’s true value has already been set behind closed doors by financial giants like JP Morgan and BlackRock, comparing it to a pre-IPO stock. He believes institutions see XRP as key to global finance and may value it far higher than its current market price, sparking debate over whether retail prices truly reflect its real utility. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44104574,https://cryptonews.com/?p=357216,1746269490,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44104574.jpeg,Solana’s Booming Price Path From $147.91 to $200: Key Resistance Levels and Timeframes to Watch,https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-booming-price-path-from-147-91-to-200-key-resistance-levels-and-timeframes-to-watch/,"Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $147.31, but recent whale activity suggests a much higher target may be in play. On May 3, 2025, an anonymous whale staked 193,909 SOL—worth approximately $28.7 million—on-chain, as confirmed by Solscan. The transfer came from crypto exchange Kraken and hit a staking address just before 10:00 AM UTC. BREAKING: A WHALE JUST STAKED $28.7M WORTH OF $SOL LETS GO pic.twitter.com/Ajfm7liCzJ — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) May 3, 2025 This high-stakes move ignited a surge in trading volume, which spiked 18% to over $1.2 billion in two hours. SOL’s price swiftly responded, climbing from $164.00 to $165.80, while buy-side pressure intensified on Binance and Coinbase. As this unfolded, staking activity across the Solana network jumped by 7%, suggesting growing long-term conviction among large holders. Key Whale Impact Stats: Staked: 193,909 SOL ($28.7M) Volume spike: +18% (to $1.2B) Staking surge: +7% (2.1M SOL total) Solana Technical Outlook: $154 Is the Breakout Trigger From a technical standpoint, Solana’s price structure is compressing within a symmetrical triangle, with key support at $146.62 and overhead resistance at $154. This pattern often precedes explosive moves. Solana Price Chart Source: Tradingview The MACD is neutral but hinting at a potential crossover. Traders should closely watch for a break and close above $154, which opens up targets at $158.76 and potentially $163.13. A confirmed breakout would likely attract momentum traders, pushing SOL toward its psychological milestone: $200. Trade Setup: Entry: Break and close above $154 Targets: $158.76 → $163.13 Stop Loss: Below $143.20 Alternative Scenario: Drop below $146 could drag SOL to $143.24 or $139.10 This setup favors swing traders looking for breakout opportunities with clearly defined risk levels. AI Hype and Whale Moves Fuel Sentiment; Solana in Foucs Solana’s bullish momentum isn’t just about charts—it’s also about narrative. While the $28.7M stake wasn’t explicitly tied to artificial intelligence, Solana’s infrastructure continues to gain traction among AI developers. Projects like Render (RNDR) and Fetch.ai (FET) saw price and volume gains shortly after the whale move. That interconnection points to a broader dynamic: when a major Layer 1 token like SOL gets institutional attention, the ripple effects often benefit related sectors. Traders exploring AI-aligned altcoins should keep a close eye on Solana-driven momentum. Conclusion The combination of whale conviction, on-chain activity, and a bullish technical setup paints a compelling picture for Solana. If SOL breaks $154 with volume, it could sprint toward $163—and possibly challenge $200 in the coming weeks, fueled by rising network demand and macro trends. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.28M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction, crossing $5.28 million in funds raised as it nears its $5.96 million presale cap. Priced at $0.00249, the token has positioned itself as more than just a meme coin—offering real utility through flexible, high-yield staking. Utility-Driven Tokenomics Fuel Demand Unlike typical meme tokens, BTCBULL blends crypto culture appeal with tangible staking rewards. Investors can currently earn an estimated 78% APY while keeping their tokens fully liquid—unstaking is allowed at any time without penalties or lockup periods. This model has resonated with investors who seek yield without sacrificing access, especially in a volatile crypto environment.

His goal? To simplify its architecture, enhance scalability, and boost long-term stability. Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s minimalist design, Buterin is pushing for a shift that could reshape Ethereum’s future. Is this the key to Bitcoin-like success? Let’s dig in to see what Buterin is cooking up. One of the best things about Bitcoin is how simple it is. This simplicity has lots of benefits. Let's bring those benefits to Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/YwmVaOCPlP — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 3, 2025 Is Ethereum Too Complex? Ethereum has evolved into a decentralized powerhouse, hosting an array of applications from DeFi platforms to NFTs and DAOs. But this flexibility has come at a cost. The platform’s complexity has ballooned over time, leading to slower performance, higher costs, and greater security risks. Buterin acknowledges these challenges and is now advocating for a leaner, more efficient Ethereum. “Historically, Ethereum has often not done this (sometimes because of my own decisions), and this has contributed to much of our excessive development expenditure, all kinds of security risk, and insularity of R&D culture, often in pursuit of benefits that have proven illusory.” Buterin’s Proposal to Streamline Ethereum In his May 3 blog post, “Simplifying the L1” , Buterin laid out a roadmap to bring Ethereum closer to the simplicity of Bitcoin while preserving its functionality as a decentralized platform. The key changes proposed include: Reducing Validator Signatures: Buterin suggests cutting the number of validator signatures from around 28,000 to just 8,192 per slot. This drastic reduction would reduce network congestion and enhance Ethereum’s performance, particularly during high-traffic periods. Adopting a ZK-Friendly Virtual Machine (VM): One of the most ambitious proposals is to shift from the current Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to a simpler, ZK-friendly VM like RISC-V. This change would significantly improve zero-knowledge proof functionality, enhancing both security and scalability. Simplifying Data Formats Across the Protocol: Buterin aims to reduce technical debt by standardizing data formats. This would make Ethereum easier to maintain, upgrade, and expand, improving developer accessibility and reducing complexity across the board. Aiming for a More Efficient Network: These changes would collectively make Ethereum faster, more secure, and more developer-friendly – moving it closer to Bitcoin’s streamlined framework while retaining its unique capabilities as a smart contract platform. Ethereum vs Bitcoin: A Design Philosophy Shift While Bitcoin’s design focuses on simplicity, Ethereum has always been about flexibility, hosting decentralized applications and smart contracts. But this versatility has complicated Ethereum’s scalability and overall management. Buterin’s proposal calls for a return to a more minimalist design, taking cues from Bitcoin to make Ethereum easier to develop on and more appealing to long-term investors. Reviving Ethereum’s Cypherpunk Roots In his proposal, Buterin also highlights a growing concern: Ethereum’s increasing centralization and financialization. He believes that simplifying Ethereum’s core architecture is key to preserving its cypherpunk origins – focusing on privacy, decentralization, and open-source principles. This vision aims to ensure Ethereum remains a platform that empowers users, rather than one that becomes overly commercialized or centralized. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Ethereum’s (ETH) Price Trigger a Breakout in May 2025? Will it Reach $2200? , Crypto Community Reacts The crypto community seemed to take this well. Prioritizing simplicity now may slow progress, but it ensures Ethereum’s long-term resilience and broader developer participation. Worth the effort. — Crypto Terry (@cryptoterry) May 3, 2025 Many believe that this shift aligns Ethereum with the foundational values of blockchain technology and positions it for long-term success. Moving On, What Can We Expect? So, what’s next for Buterin’s simplification plan? Over the coming months, he plans to release detailed specifications, gather feedback from the developer community, and begin phased testing of the proposed changes. These updates will focus on reducing complexity, enhancing scalability, and strengthening the network’s long-term sustainability – all while fostering deeper collaboration with the Ethereum community. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Lightchain AI is showing that disruption can bring opportunity even in tough times. Its presale has raised over $19.6 million at $0.007125 per token. That’s a big milestone because many tokens are struggling to find stable ground in current conditions. The project’s success comes from a clear, future-focused plan built on steady growth, community engagement, and real-world relevance. It is not just another speculative asset like memecoins. In fact, Lightchain AI is following a utility-based roadmap. For investors seeking steadiness in uncertain times, it offers a clear path to long-term progress. Why Market is Struggling The world market is in trouble in 2025 because of a mix of aggressive American trade policies, rising risks of recession, and sinking investor confidence. President Trump’s broadside tariffs — up to 245% on Chinese goods and 10% on most imports — have thrown the world’s supply chains into disarray and led to a severe market sell-off, with trillions of dollars in market value going up in smoke. The International Monetary Fund cut its growth expectations for the United States to 1.8 percent while raising the odds of a recession to 40 percent because of trade-related uncertainty and inflation. Large hedge funds are selling consumer discretionary stocks amid fears that spending may slow. At the same time, policy unpredictability and fears over Federal Reserve independence have left investors jittery. The net effect is a skittish, risk-averse market tone. Lightchain AI’s Strategies for Sustainable Growth A central element of Lightchain AI is Governance Integration. It allows token holders to vote on protocol updates and developments on the platform. This means that the project avoids centralized control, and creates a more transparent and flexible ecosystem. On the technical side, Lightchain AI ensures low-latency performance through advanced parallelized AI task execution, enabling real-time responsiveness. Its workflow and data flow systems securely distribute tasks across nodes, process them with high efficiency, and verify results using cryptographic methods. Lightchain AI is also boosting its presence through Ecosystem Growth Initiatives. It has set up grants and incentives to attract developers and businesses to build on its blockchain. By encouraging innovation and widening its network of partners, Lightchain AI aims to strengthen its competitiveness and encourage broader adoption over the long term. Why Lightchain AI is Your Key to Long-Term Success Ready to be part of the future of crypto? Lightchain AI is leading the way with cutting-edge strategies and a commitment to sustainability. By focusing on community engagement, top-tier security, and seamless scalability, it’s building a rock-solid foundation for lasting growth. In a constantly evolving market, Lightchain AI stands out for its ability to adapt, innovate, and thrive. Don’t just watch the blockchain revolution—join it.

But as it pushes toward the $1 mark, it’s facing some serious competition. Cardano (ADA) has been slowly working its way up, with many eyes on its long-term potential. However, the real shockwave could come from a new player on the scene, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With the Phase 4 presale currently live, Mutuum Finance has already raised over $7.5 million and attracted over 9,400 investors. Phase 4 is already more than 50% sold out, and investors joining now are in line for a 140% return when the token hits its launch price of $0.06. While Dogecoin continues to ride its meme wave and Cardano builds on its steady foundation, MUTM’s rapid rise could see it leapfrog both with gains many have only dreamed of. The question now isn’t whether it’s possible, but when will the surge happen, and are you in position to take advantage Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction: A Wild Ride Ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains strong popularity among investors combined with general cryptocurrency enthusiasts so its estimated market value for 2025 remains highly debated. The support of devoted fans combined with regular statements from influential public figures enables Dogecoin to exhibit substantial price changes. Various experts predict Dogecoin will attain new all-time highs and anticipate it will reach $1, but these projections depend on the market activities with investor involvement. The future direction of Dogecoin proves challenging to pinpoint because this cryptocurrency exhibits high volatility which stems from social media support. Objectively Dogecoin lacks stellar technical features of mainstream cryptocurrencies but its tremendous social cachet maintains its popularity making it appealing to investors despite both major gains and substantial dangers. Mutuum Finance Presale Continues to Surge Early investors in Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale run have contributed $7.5 million so far. Investors who enter Mutuum Finance at $0.025 will achieve a 140% gain based on the $0.06 listing price during its market launch. The token experts indicate MUTM will achieve a value of $3 immediately following its launch making this investment chance more appealing. Innovative Lending System Mutuum Finance introduces a dual lending system combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. P2C: This system uses smart contracts to govern lending pools, ensuring stability and adjusting interest rates based on market conditions. P2P: A decentralized approach that removes intermediaries and allows direct transactions between borrowers and lenders, giving both parties complete autonomy. Mutuum Finance strengthens security and transparency through open-source smart contracts in addition to third-party audits which protect users and their investments. Mutuum Finance will also provide support for users with EVM and non-EVM blockchain protocols which expands its accessibility and liquidity capabilities. Community Incentives and $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance intends to expand its community through a $100,000 giveaway which distributes ten distinct $10,000 prizes of MUTM tokens. The referral program at the platform awards its users with rewards when they successfully bring new investors onto the platform which increases natural expansion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a serious contender in the crypto space, already raising over $7.5 million from 9,400+ investors in its Phase 4 presale. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) have solidified their positions, MUTM’s meteoric rise could potentially see it surpass both, delivering massive gains that investors are lining up for. Mutuum’s dual lending system and ongoing $100,000 giveaway make it one of the most innovative and rewarding DeFi projects out there. Don’t miss your chance to get in on this breakout opportunity before it’s too late. Secure your MUTM tokens now, once Phase 4 closes, you’ll be kicking yourself for waiting.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Remittix gains investor attention in 2025 as a low-cap game-changer in cross-border payments, outshining SOL and ADA. Table of Contents Solana, Cardano: Why analysts have their money on the underdog Real-world utility: Remittix’s greatest strength Regulation-ready and retail-centric Conclusion: The best 100x player this cycle? Remittix (RTX) has proven to be one of the strong cryptocurrencies in 2025 as it has received a lot of attention from investors because of its unique method of making cross-border payments. Though Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are still excellent blockchain projects, experts doubt whether they will give 100x returns at this point. Rather, low-cap disruptors like Remittix are taking the limelight. You might also like: Investors rush to Remittix presale, Dogecoin and Solana could fall up to 30% in April Solana, Cardano: Why analysts have their money on the underdog Solana currently stands at a market capitalization of well over $70 billion, with ADA sitting in the region of $15 billion. This level renders exponential jumps a remote probability, with 1.3x to $200 for Solana and 2x to $1 being more likely for Cardano, according to CoinMarketCap. Remittix, however, stands at $0.0757, with AInvest pundits feeling it might surge up to 13,000%. Analysts indicate RTX’s real-world utility and early-stage nature make it a true 100x contender. As CoinStats confirms in its 2025 prediction, RTX’s small cap allows for more explosive growth potential than established players. That is why some are calling it the “best kept secret” of this cycle. Real-world utility: Remittix’s greatest strength Whereas Solana and Cardano focus on DeFi scalability and smart contract development, Remittix solves a real, global problem. Its PayFi platform enables instant crypto-to-fiat transfer, rid of centralized exchanges or slow banks. Remittix operates in the $630 billion remittance market with products for freelancers, gig workers and families sending remittances abroad. Mitrade reports its payments are in customers’ accounts in 24 hours, with 30+ fiat currencies and 40+ cryptos supported. The token API also offers seamless merchant integration, making it a favorite among payment-focused blockchain startups. This real-life adoption focus is what makes Remittix not hype; it’s already operational. Regulation-ready and retail-centric While other crypto payment networks are beset by legal controversy, Remittix stands out for its compliance-first approach. Its design has integrated KYC, fiat off-ramps and liquidity pools optimized for quick settlement. While XRP continues to battle the SEC and ADA grapples with slow uptake, RTX has built itself on international finance standards. As The Tribune reminds us , this gives it a clear path to scale quickly without regulatory speed bumps. It’s no surprise they’re labeling it the “compliant XRP 2.0” with better tech and a broader target market. Conclusion: The best 100x player this cycle? Remittix has raised over $14.7 million and sold 531 million tokens, with retail and institutional buyers on board. It has already increased by 380% since launch, with 2,000% returns forecast in Q1 alone, as stated by CoinStats. They believe a year-end $1 price target is achievable, a 13x return and long-term goals of $5 to $10 are not out of the question. CoinCodex agrees with the thesis, referencing RTX’s strong fundamentals and early success. At these prices, it would only take a slight shift in the markets or a few key exchange listings to trigger 100x returns. Compared to SOL and ADA’s incremental growth potential, RTX’s path looks radically steeper. It’s a cycle of low caps and good stories and Remittix excels with its combination of true utility, low cost of entry and institutional readiness. Users are now able to perform cross-border transactions without worrying about huge bank fees and slow transaction speed. With early access still open and presale momentum accelerating, RTX is positioned to be the breakout altcoin of 2025. For investors hunting for realistic 50x–100x gains, it’s time to think beyond Solana and Cardano and start looking at what’s next.

ADA is now at $0.71, a slight drop of around 1.96% from the last close. Experts are predicting that ADA can realistically go up to $0.69 and $1.85 in 2025, with some positive predictions going as high as $5.66. While such predictions paint a smooth ride of growth, they are overshadowed by ambitious targets set by potential projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is in presale phase 4 at $0.025. The project has already attracted over 9300 investors, has raised over $7.4 million, and is offering incentives like a $100,000 token giveaway to enhance community engagement even more. Moreover, the project team recently launched a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard of the top 50 MUTM holders. Investors have little time as phase four is over 50% sold out amidst massive FOMO. Mutuum Finance presale takes off More than 9300 investors have participated in the Mutuum Finance presale through which they have invested over $7.4 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% to phase 5. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token today before a $0.06 launch price. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has partnered with CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security before the official report gets published on their social media platforms for public transparency and trust. Shakingu up crypto lending through a dual-model approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. The project is also poised to launch a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. The USD-backed stablecoin will work better than algorithmic stablecoins which are usually susceptible to depegs. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The Mutuum Finance giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive early access to platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a powerhouse in the DeFi market, already securing over $7.4 million from 9,300+ investors in its presale. With tokens currently priced at $0.025 and a projected launch price of $0.06, early participants are eyeing up to 140% ROI, but time is running out. Phase 4 is already over 50% sold, and once it closes, prices will jump. Backed by a CertiK audit, an innovative dual lending model, and a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum is drawing massive attention and competition. If you’re not in now, you may soon be late. Secure your MUTM tokens before the next price surge leaves you behind.

Arctic Pablo at $0.00011 Leads the Pack While FLOKI and GOHOME Tweak for the Future,https://timestabloid.com/top-investment-pick-arctic-pablo-at-0-00011-leads-the-pack/,"What if just one early move in crypto could flip your financial future? That’s the kind of talk bubbling around the web right now as meme coins make bold headlines again. FLOKI is flexing new tech integrations, and GOHOME is catching eyeballs with its fresh roadmap release. But all eyes aren’t just there. One coin— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC)—is quietly making waves with a presale format that feels more like a digital treasure hunt than your standard token offering. It’s loaded with staking perks, referral bonuses, and a reward ecosystem that rewards engagement, not just capital. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, FLOKI, and GOHOME. Stake, Earn, and Compete: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Reward Ecosystem Explained Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t your run-of-the-mill meme project. It’s carving a path that combines community engagement with actual earning mechanisms—placing it among the best crypto to invest in this season. At the heart of its ecosystem lies a generous 66% APY during presale, where investors can stake tokens and watch their holdings grow. But it’s not just about passive income. Those who spread the word about Arctic Pablo Coin earn even more through an attractive referral program. It doesn’t stop there. The team’s gamified competitions bring real prizes in both APC tokens and USD, fuelling active community growth. Weekly token burns during the presale remove unsold coins from circulation, locking in value by the block on Binance Smart Chain. This burn strategy ramps up scarcity and adds tangible pressure on supply. All this is designed to create a leaner, more valuable ecosystem—and give early adopters the upper hand. It’s not just clever. It’s what makes Arctic Pablo Coin the best crypto to invest in before mainstream buzz kicks in. Snowflake Square’s Surge: Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Ignites Buy Pressure After completing 20 digital “city stops,” Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now calls Snowflake Square its temporary home—the 21st location in its presale journey. With each new destination, the price inches upward, making early buys a strategic advantage. Right now, 1 APC trades for $0.00011, and those jumping in today stand to gain a jaw-dropping 7,181.82% ROI if holding until the $0.008 launch price. That’s not hype—it’s math. Over $2.39 million has already poured into the project, and with no traditional stages—just a location-based narrative—Arctic Pablo Coin keeps the community glued to every update. The burn mechanism continues to thin supply weekly, stacking value layer by layer. What happens when it reaches the final location? No one knows for sure. But the momentum is building fast. Those still wondering whether this is the best crypto to invest in might not want to wonder too long. With its mix of entertainment, strategy, and financial upside, Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another token—it’s a story that rewards early readers. FLOKI Secures Major Cross-Chain Bridge Integration FLOKI just hit the headlines after announcing its high-speed cross-chain bridge protocol integration. This move is expected to drastically improve interoperability with other DeFi ecosystems and layer-1 chains. The bridge allows for seamless transfers of FLOKI tokens across Ethereum, BNB Chain, and more, reducing transaction friction and boosting liquidity. Investors and developers are taking notice, with analysts speculating this could be a major catalyst for the coin’s next bullish run. GOHOME Unveils Roadmap 2.0 with DAO Voting and GameFi Expansion GOHOME just dropped its Roadmap 2.0, shaking up its community with plans for full DAO governance and new GameFi integrations. The updated vision includes weekly community voting to influence project direction, giving holders more control than ever. The GameFi additions promise play-to-earn experiences that plug directly into the token economy. The coin’s Twitter announcement sparked thousands of retweets within hours, proving GOHOME still has major momentum heading into Q3. Final Thoughts: FLOKI is expanding its reach. GOHOME is empowering its community. But Arctic Pablo Coin is building a presale that feels more like a movement. With 66% staking APY, live competitions, and weekly deflationary token burns, it’s turning heads for more than just hype. Add in a unique presale narrative now set in Snowflake Square—and a price of just $0.00011—and it’s easy to see why Arctic Pablo Coin may just be the best crypto to invest in before it rockets toward launch. Timing is everything. Don’t be the one that reads about it after it’s gone. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin and how does its presale work? Arctic Pablo Coin is a new meme coin offering a location-based presale journey, with a current price of $0.00011 and a target launch price of $0.008, presenting strong ROI potential. Why is Arctic Pablo considered the best crypto to invest in now? Its staking rewards, referral incentives, and deflationary mechanics, along with an ongoing presale that incentivizes early entries, make Arctic Pablo Coin highly attractive to early investors. Where is Arctic Pablo Coin in its presale journey? The project is currently in its 21st location—Snowflake Square—out of multiple phases. Each new phase raises the token price, creating urgency for investors. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin’s staking program unique? It offers a 66% APY during the presale, allowing holders to grow their assets before the official launch. Additional rewards come from referrals and competitions. How is Arctic Pablo Coin reducing token supply? Unsold tokens are permanently burned weekly during the presale, with all remaining tokens set to burn at the end—making the coin deflationary by design.

In just 48 hours, active wallets have surged by 9.6%, from 306,211 to 336,366, according to the data from Cryptoquant. This difference is observed along with a price rise of 24% from its recent lows, indicating high demand for the coin. Ripple (XRP) is also hinting at vitality as it rallies against the 50-day EMA at $2.19, about to break. As that excitement unfolds in the crypto market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gathered investor interest. The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Phase 4, is pricing the token at $0.025, with over $7.5 million raised from the sale of 455 million tokens to about 9,500 holders. Analysts are calling for a historic bull run, with sky-high valuations anticipated for MUTM. Ethereum’s Ascent Ethereum dominates the cryptocurrency space-packed with developers who are partially outdoing co-rivals such as Solana and Cosmos. Having bolstered appreciably more than 2,500 new code commits statically dwarfs the sub-1,500 figures being waged against them by their rivals. All this energy is getting routed towards enhancing scalability and security for DeFi and NFT expansion. A golden cross on ETH’s chart and an above-Ichimoku Cloud breakout, as supportive of bulls, are increasingly setting the stage. Some analysts, including Trader PA, are looking forward to ETH bulldozing toward $6,000 by the end of 2025, largely driven by reaccumulation patterns. However, the relatively high barrier to entry in investing in Ethereum compared with nascent projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offering massive returns needs to be contended with. The Ripple’s Breakout Potential Ripple (XRP) is circulating precariously at some decisive moments when price has been teasing a 50-day EMA. Closing beyond $2.19 will be a major signal for the bulls and might force a rally towards April highs. Elliott-Wave theory, elaborated upon by EGRAG Crypto, looks for a cycle top over $120, similar to that seen in the 2017 monster rise. According to Kaiko Research, XRP’s market depth is pushing past $11 million, above that of Solana, insinuating an ETF-driven liquidity impact. Nonetheless, high targets are still under suspicion since the token supply for XRP is around 99 billion and will demand vast in-gushing flows to move the pending supply. As much as XRP has shown exceptional headway, there are some built-in drawbacks to scale up the experience of short-term gains versus a more nimble, emerging contender like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is picking up traction at full throttle. Mutuum Finance’s Meteoric Rise The presale passes the phase 4 filling halfway with 55% of tokens in phase 4 sold at $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trickling into the mouth of many investors in anticipation of a 140% return at $0.06 listing price. Another thing to look forward to is the opening of phase 5 at the price of $0.03, meaning an immediate 20% profit to buyers. Post-launch price increase is predicted up to $2.50, meaning in all the 9,900% rate of return compared to the current market price. The team is completing a smart contract audit from Certik that will be shared soon in socials as further transparency strengthening. New dashboard set to reward the top 50 holders with bonus tokens is igniting competition in the project. Such rich tokenomics and demand place MUTM ready to soar. Joining the Bullish Tide The buzz around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appends the crow of the crypto market’s bullish wave, contesting already established coins like ETH and XRP. The sellout speed of phase 4 shows that the investors are eager. But make haste; discover Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now and become among the 9,500 holders ready for a shot at unprecedented bullishness.

The scam reporting platform noted that this represents a 17% decline compared to March loss. However, the number of phishing victims increased substantially in April , with a total of 7,565 addresses affected by the attacks. This is a 26% increase compared to the 5,992 victims in March and highlights the evolving tactics by the scammers. The biggest loss in the month was $1.43 million lost by a whale due to signing several phishing signatures. This shows that high-value victims remain vulnerable, as the biggest attack in March was a whale who lost $1.82 million to a similar attack vector. April 2025 Phishing report (Source: ScamSniffer) There were other users who also lost significant amounts to signed phishing signatures. These include a user, 0xc1e4260cb, who lost $666,414 to a multipermit phishing signature, and 0x7C930969FCF who lost $234,000. Meanwhile, the second-biggest attack last month was $700,000 in losses by one user who copied the wrong address. Address poisoning has ranked as one of the leading causes of phishing scam losses this year, and it appears that this will continue. In this particular case, the victim copied a fake address that shared the same first six characters with the legitimate address, while the last four characters were the same except in different alphabet cases. Unsurprisingly, there were other significant losses due to address poisoning. In one case, another user lost $150,000 because they copied the wrong address, while 0xEFc4f1d5 also sent $467,175 to the wrong address for the same reason. Nevertheless, April is the month with the lowest crypto phishing losses this year, other than February, which had $5.32 million in losses. Scammers are devising new ways to attack users Meanwhile, April also saw scammers rely heavily on various means to target users. ScamSniffer identified fake “Solscan” ads on Google Search results as phishing links, noting that the spoof site was the leading search result on Google when a user searched for Solscan. It noted: “These phishing ads are designed to drain your wallet through malicious transaction signatures.” While the URL for the phishing link and the authentic page appear to be the same, clicking on the link actually redirects users to Solscaan.com. Google has removed the ad. Interestingly, fake Google ads were not the only means through which attackers are trying to exploit users. Ethereum Name Service lead developer Nick Johnson also identified another email phishing attack that targets Google accounts, with scammers deploying fake login pages using Google sites for credibility. With scammers relying on various techniques to target crypto users, security analysts continue to highlight how individuals can protect themselves against such attacks by identifying when they are being phished. ScamSniffer shared infographics on its page showing the various ways that scammers can initiate these attacks using Twitter, Discord, airdrop, scam adverts, and software compromise. It also identified all the popular phishing signatures that users can unknowingly sign and lose their assets. Meanwhile, Revoke Cash also posted necessary precautions for users to avoid address poisoning. These precautions include double-checking all the addresses before executing a transaction, not copying addresses from the transaction histories, and using wallets that support bookmarks or whitelisting. $364 million lost to crypto hacks in April Meanwhile, the over $5 million lost in phishing scams only accounts for a small percentage of the total crypto losses in April. According to blockchain security firm CertiK , a total of $364 million was lost to hacks and scams in April. One incident was responsible for $336 million of the losses, and it involved a social engineering attack resulting in the theft of 3,520 Bitcoins from one individual who had been holding the asset since 2017. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT confirmed that the victim was an elderly individual in the US.

The incentive, announced in late April, is aimed at rewarding the top-ranking participants on the token’s leaderboard. This is a move that some critics say dangerously blurs the line between political engagement and monetized access. Republicans Voice Ethical Concerns Senator Cynthia Lummis, often seen as one of crypto’s biggest supporters in Congress, didn’t hold back. Speaking to CNBC, she questioned the propriety of offering such exclusive access in exchange for crypto holdings. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski echoed those sentiments. She stated that she “wouldn’t feel right charging people to tour the Capitol,” drawing a direct contrast between public duty and personal promotion. Ironically, Lummis, while flagging ethical red flags, also applauded Trump on the same day for backing legislation aimed at creating a national Bitcoin reserve . In a Senate address, she praised the BITCOIN Act as a necessary step to solidify the U.S.’s position in innovation. The contradiction hasn’t gone unnoticed, highlighting the growing complexity of crypto’s intersection with politics. TRUMP Raises Questions About Influence and Transparency The TRUMP token, launched on January 17, immediately sparked controversy, with critics citing potential foreign influence and campaign finance loopholes. The latest dinner incentive has reignited that fire. Ethics watchdog Craig Holman didn’t mince words, suggesting Trump may be willing to trade access for crypto-based fame. “He once said he couldn’t be bought,” Holman remarked. “But now he seems available — for a meme.” The backlash hasn’t been limited to whispers. Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, took it a step further by calling for Trump’s impeachment , likening the event to selling political favors for digital tokens. While the impeachment talk is unlikely to gain traction in the current political landscape, it underscores how deeply divisive the president’s crypto experiment has become. With the dinner scheduled for May 22, attention now turns to who might attend. Speculation has swirled around big names like Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Both are rumored to hold sizable amounts of the TRUMP coin.

This article explores three lesser-known digital coins that might turn early investment into significant wealth. Delving into these underdogs could reveal opportunities that others have yet to discover. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Terra Classic (LUNC): Rising from the Ashes to Reinvent Stablecoins Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain platform aiming to transform global payments. It uses stablecoins linked to real-world currencies, offering price stability for users. This means you can send money quickly and cheaply without worrying about value fluctuations. Launched in 2019, Terra offered stablecoins tied to the US dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik, and more by 2021. In May 2022, Terra introduced a new blockchain, rebranding the original as Terra Classic. The native token, formerly LUNA, became LUNA Classic (LUNC). Some compare this to the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split. Terra's CEO, Do Kwon, sees the collapse of UST in 2022 as a pivotal moment, similar to Ethereum's 2017 hack. LUNC combines the stability of traditional currencies with blockchain's benefits. In today's market, where trust in stablecoins is crucial, LUNC stands out. Its focus on real-world currency pegs makes it an attractive option compared to other cryptocurrencies. Stellar Lumens: Connecting the World's Money with Speed and Simplicity Stellar (XLM) is a network that makes moving money across the world fast and cheap. It doesn't favor any country's currency and has its own coin called Stellar Lumens. Since 2014, Stellar has handled billions of transactions and partnered with big companies. What makes it special is that it can send any type of money—whether it's dollars, euros, or even other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Instead of trying to change the whole financial system, Stellar aims to make it better by helping different financial systems work together. In today's market, Stellar stands out because it bridges traditional money and digital assets. While some cryptocurrencies focus on replacing banks, Stellar works with them. This approach might make it more appealing as governments and big institutions show interest in blockchain technology. Compared to other coins that are often volatile, Stellar offers practical uses like global payments and currency conversion. With its strong foundation and real-world partnerships, Stellar may play a significant role as the crypto market continues to evolve. Conclusion In the current bull run, while LUNC and XLM present promising opportunities, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its unique sports memecoin concept and ambitious growth potential.

In a one-minute video posted on X, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty attributed the SEC’s retreat to regulatory ambiguity. In the newest Crypto In One Minute, Ripple's Chief Legal Officer @s_alderoty explains why the SEC dropped its appeal against Ripple in March 2025, and where the US is going with smart crypto regulation on the horizon: https://t.co/HJ4wTBWDmx 🔒 Protecting consumers 🟢… pic.twitter.com/KD9bi66sGI — Ripple (@Ripple) May 2, 2025 Alderoty summed up six years of litigation in a few words, pleading that the SEC cannot justify enforcement without first giving legal clarity. “You can’t sue someone before you explain the rules,” he said, criticizing the agency’s approach to crypto oversight. A quiet yet impactful victory that Ripple was able to win was having the SEC drop the case after the SEC itself withdrew its final appeal in March 2025. However, legal observers view the move as an admission that the SEC’s case had no strong regulatory foundation. With the lawsuit behind them, Ripple is now ready to start working with lawmakers, according to Alderoty. He also stressed the need to leave the courtroom and focus on cleaning up regulatory confusion that has plagued the crypto sector for quite some time. The firm has indicated that it intends to work with Congress in pursuit of a legislative approach to supporting innovation, not at the expense of compliance. Ripple expands its connections Now that the lawsuit is behind it, Ripple has its focus back on expanding globally. The company recently purchased Hidden Road in an acquisition for $1.25 billion, which bolsters the company’s position in both brokerage and traditional finance settlement. In a bolder move, Ripple allegedly increased its proposed offer to acquire Circle’s USDC issuer to more than $20 billion from $5 billion. Bloomberg sources said the deal is being actively negotiated. If Ripple succeeds, it will take possession of the world’s second-biggest stablecoin and change the balance of power in the stablecoin market. The acquisition comes as Circle has recently filed for a U.S. IPO and is taking a cautious approach in public markets. Ripple’s international progress is also marked by its payment corridor developments. Ripple continues to work with SBI Remit in Japan to power faster, cheaper remittances, using XRP as a bridge asset. It joins MoneyGram and Stellar in creating real-world utility for crypto in cross-border payments. Ripple’s model cuts down on foreign exchange costs and allows users to eliminate the necessity of pre-funded accounts in underbanked markets. XRP ETF odds climb The growing prospect of an XRP spot ETF approval has grabbed the market’s attention. Polymarket data shows that the probability of approval by the end of 2025 has risen to 78% from 65% in recent weeks. Polymarket odds of an XRP spot ETF approval by the end of 2025 are up to 78%. Source: Polymarket Analysts say that the SEC’s passive stance and quiet acceptance that XRP ETF filings can be filed indicate that approval could already be happening. If approved, the XRP ETF will expose institutional and retail investors to XRP while avoiding the need to hold the token directly. The move would follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have already opened the floodgates on capital inflows. XRP is trading at $2.20 after rising over 5% over the last 24 hours. The coin’s volume is currently over $2.1 billion. Investor behavior also points to optimism. However, Santiment also noted that whale wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have added 200 million tokens this week.

PEPE approaches critical resistance: Price breakout or pullback ahead? PEPE coin is currently trading between $0.0000076 and $0.0000099, showing notable activity in recent sessions. The coin is inching closer to its nearest resistance level at $0.000010978, a point it hasn’t surpassed recently. This level is critical as it could determine the coin’s next direction. If PEPE breaks through the resistance, it might signal a bullish trend. Surpassing this point could lead to price increases of around 10% from its current upper range. Such a move might attract more attention and potentially drive further growth for the coin. However, if the coin fails to break the resistance, it could retreat toward its nearest support level at $0.000006414. This would represent a decline of about 20% from its current upper price. A drop to this support might test the resolve of investors and could indicate a period of consolidation. The upcoming days are crucial for PEPE. The coin’s ability to break through resistance or fall back to support will shape its short-term outlook. Traders and enthusiasts are watching closely to see which direction PEPE will take next. Conclusion In the midst of the current bull market, established memecoins like PEPE have captured attention but may offer less short-term potential for substantial gains. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a promising contender, aiming to deliver maximum profits by harnessing true artificial intelligence. By integrating AI to analyze market trends and identify lucrative opportunities, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself uniquely in the memecoin arena.

In the past few days, a meme coin named after the bishop of Rome and the leader of the Catholic Church has exploded in popularity. In the past several hours alone, a few big moves made the CT news, with insiders allegedly dumping, while one investor lost over $110,000 in minutes. With exchanges such as GateIo and MEXC rushing to add the new meme coin sensation for trading for their users, it’s no wonder that the asset’s value shot up by several thousand percent in hours. According to some reports , its market cap exceeded $300 million at one point before it crashed. It’s hard to verify this data on independent third-party data aggregators, such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, as it’s missing at press time. CoinGecko even says it has removed the POPE coin from its platform. The meme coin’s website claims that 35% of the 1B max supply will go to the Catholic Church. 25% will be for creators and marketing, and only 100 million will be for public distribution. It also asserts that it was created “in support of the Pope and the Catholic Church, with proceeds going to the church and its initiatives around the globe.” “POPE was created to support a future Pope who champions cryptocurrency and decentralization-fostering empowerment, global impact, and spiritual connectivity,” the website also reads. Lastly, the slogan is “a meme coin so holy, it blesses every transaction.” Not sure how blessed was this transaction by a developer or an insider who made over $1 million in two hours by dumping tokens to the community. The POPE madness also resulted in a substantial loss for one trader who decided to FOMO in. According to Lookonchain, they lost $111,000 in just under five minutes. Don’t FOMO trade. This guy lost $111K on $POPE in under 5 minutes. He spent 200K $USDC to #FOMO buy $POPE , but right after his purchase, the price dropped sharply. In a panic, he sold for just $89K—burning $111K in minutes. https://t.co/R27uhqIzA4 pic.twitter.com/TkYXH5bPPc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 3, 2025 The post POPE Meme Coin Madness: Insiders Made $1M, Outsider Lost $111K in 5 Minutes appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Meme coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-03 11:52:27

Price is above the 9-day SMA, and RSI is rising at 63.86, indicating growing strength. A potential rounding bottom pattern is forming, suggesting a trend reversal.

Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, it could gradually rise towards $2,400 or more by the end of 2025, especially if the market becomes more positive. However, Ethereum will face resistance around $2,500, so it may take time to break through this level. The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

The world’s largest crypto options exchange, Deribit, is officially eyeing a stateside push, sensing fresh opportunity under a markedly friendlier Trump administration. They’re making a statement for sure. Deribit, which clocked in a jaw-dropping $1.3 trillion in notional volume last year, is now “actively reassessing” entry into the US market, CEO Luuk Strijers told the Financial Times . Why now? Because the shift in regulatory tone under Trump has (reportedly) cracked open doors that were tightly shut during the Biden-era clampdown. Crypto Derivatives Get Their Moment – And Deribit Wants In Deribit isn’t the only player noticing the shift. As Trump’s administration takes a more lenient stance on crypto, major exchanges are ready to re-enter the US. The SEC, which had been cracking down hard during the Biden era, has paused or dropped over a dozen cases. Even the Department of Justice has dissolved its cryptocurrency enforcement unit – signaling a softer touch. It’s all part of the larger trend. Competitors like Kraken have also made big moves in the derivatives space, recently acquiring NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, talks of Coinbase acquiring Deribit are heating up. Both companies have notified Dubai regulators, which means this deal might be closer than it seems. Phew – things are picking up pace faster than most expected! Crypto Firms Are Coming Back to the USA Other major crypto firms are also exploring a return. OKX , for example, just announced plans to open a US headquarters in San Jose, California. Even Nexo, which left the US in 2022 due to unclear regulations, has said it plans to come back. This growing trend reflects a larger shift in sentiment, as Trump pushes his vision of making the US the “crypto capital of the world.” It’s no surprise that firms are eager to follow suit. The message from the Trump administration is clear – regulation can be both responsible and growth-oriented. It’s certainly a breath of fresh air that the industry needed for a long, I mean LOONNNGGG time! Justin Sun Teams Up with Deribit On May 2, TRON founder and crypto heavyweight Justin Sun made a headline appearance on Deribit’s podcast during BlockParty 2025 – a major gathering of Web3 builders, investors, and thought leaders. In a relaxed poolside interview, Sun sat down with the Deribit team to discuss the future of decentralized finance and where the market is headed. The team shared their excitement on Twitter, writing, “We are honored to have @justinsuntron on our podcast today.” Sun reposted the tweet, adding, “Glad to be with @DeribitOfficial together!” Glad to be with @DeribitOfficial together! https://t.co/d60Fgxt6lM — H.E.

XRP Price Prediction May 2025 High Price : $2.50 Low Price : $1.85 Average Price : $2.0 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, the value of XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average Ripple price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

Competitive Moves Between Ripple and Circle Moon Lambo observed a clear pattern of mutual market positioning between Ripple and Circle over recent months. He noted that Ripple first introduced RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin aimed at the same market segment occupied by USDC. Shortly after this announcement, Circle launched a cross-border payments platform, a move widely viewed as direct competition to Ripple’s enterprise focus and XRP’s use as a bridge asset . In Moon Lambo’s view, the acquisition offer now appears to follow a sequence of tit-for-tat moves, with Ripple potentially looking to buy out the company it had just positioned itself against. Bill Morgan Raises Strategic Questions Bill Morgan took a more analytical approach, identifying two key questions raised by the report. He suggested that RLUSD may not be scaling at the pace Ripple needs to meet its goals in payments and tokenization. If true, this could indicate that Ripple anticipates rapid growth in demand for tokenized assets and stablecoin settlements and may be seeking a more immediate path to market share. Morgan also proposed the possibility that RLUSD’s launch was never intended as a fully standalone product, but rather a component of a broader strategy—one that could include the acquisition of an already dominant player like Circle. Exactly, and it raises two questions in my mind. Firstly, is RLUSD adoption too slow to meet Ripple’s needs in terms of payments and tokenisation which suggests Ripple expects massive adoption to happen in the short-term and medium term. Secondly, was the introduction of RLUSD… — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) April 30, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Stablecoin Market Dynamics and Ripple’s Position These interpretations reflect broader concerns about adoption timelines, product viability, and the intense competition shaping the stablecoin and cross-border payments sectors. Ripple’s RLUSD was introduced last year as part of a push to offer a regulatory-compliant, enterprise-grade stablecoin. However, it enters a market already dominated by Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT, both of which have long-established liquidity and integrations across crypto exchanges and DeFi platforms. The scale of that competition may have prompted Ripple to explore an acquisition to boost its reach. Potential Impact on XRP and Cross-Border Strategy Circle has expanded aggressively into the payments space, an area Ripple has targeted since its founding. By launching its cross-border solutions, Circle appears to be encroaching on Ripple’s territory, prompting speculation that Ripple’s acquisition interest could be both a defensive and strategic move. If confirmed, such a transaction would significantly alter the dynamics of the stablecoin landscape. Ripple would gain access to USDC’s infrastructure, partnerships, and user base, positioning itself more competitively in stablecoins and digital payments overall. It could also raise new questions about the role of XRP going forward, as USDC and RLUSD would presumably operate in overlapping use cases. The analysis by Moon Lambo and Bill Morgan underscores a growing sense that Ripple’s strategy may involve both internal development and external consolidation to strengthen its foothold in the evolving financial ecosystem.

Table of Contents XRP repeating the magic of 2021 YETIO poised to become the next big altcoin Final words The SEC vs Ripple lawsuit is finally over and it seems like XRP is on the verge of repeating the history of 2021, the year when it turned investors into millionaires. While XRP is moving slowly, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a meme-utility project, is positioning itself as the next big altcoin in the market. You might also like: Pi Network’s decline leads investors to Yeti Ouro’s high-ROI presale now in stage 4 XRP repeating the magic of 2021 Before breaking into the possibility of whether XRP has the potential to repeat its 2021 rally, let’s look into the on-chain metrics. In the three-month time stamp, XRP experienced a massive fall of 26% in market cap, going down from $170 Billion to $125.7 Billion. On the other hand, XRP’s volume experienced a peak during early February and March before declining in April. During this time, the total supply of XRP remained constant. Now that the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit is finally over, XRP is slowly entering into the bull market. Upon writing, XRP price is standing at $2.2438, showing a nice improvement of 3.66% in the past 24 hours. In fact, XRP has shown a steady improvement over the month, with an exponential increase of 4.28% in value and 3.67% in market cap. Back in 2021, XRP price rose from $0.20 to $1.80, turning mere investors into millionaires overnight. If XRP replicates the same pattern, the chances of investors becoming millionaires will be high. However, for that to happen, the altcoin needs to cross several hurdles, both in terms of geopolitical and technical aspects. In case there’s any kind of geopolitical disturbances, like trade wars, XRP might experience a major pullback. Looking into the technical aspect of XRP, the coin is currently near the middle Bollinger band ($2.2427), signifying a slightly bullish trend. However, to enter the bullish trend, XRP would have to break free from the resistant level of $2.2547. If it fails to do so, there’s still support at 2.2307. However, hopes of XRP breaking free are high. On the other hand, RSI is standing at 54.26, which is basically the neutral territory. But, the RSI trend is pointing upwards, showing potential of the index to go beyond 60. If that happens, XRP might enter into the bullish trend soon. YETIO poised to become the next big altcoin While XRP is still facing doubts, YETIO is moving positively during its pre-launch stage. What started off as a normal crypto project with the aim to mix the fun of memecoins and the utility of altcoins has now transformed into one of the most potential projects. Yeti Ouro is already showing its capability by selling 232,837,657 YETIO tokens and raising over $3.8 Million. Though the coin is currently valued at $0.041, it is bringing profit for users who invested when YETIO was $0.012. The major reasons behind YETIO’s success are its clear vision of growing with the community, creating fun, engaging activities, and having a limited number of tokens, aka only 1 Billion YETIO in supply. Moreover, YETIO is set to grow post-launch due to its upcoming game, Yeti Go. Though it might appear as just another racing game, Yeti Go is way beyond that. Apart from having solid graphics and audio, thanks to the creative developers and audio experts (ones who are well-known for being nominated for Grammy), Yeti Go has nice P2E mechanics. Due to this, gamers will get YETIO tokens after winning races, which they can use inside the game. To induce excitement, the team has released a teaser showcasing the brilliant world of Yeti Go. It clearly displays the various tracks, mini-games, vehicles, and other important aspects of the game, giving a rough idea of what to expect from the game. Besides, developers are also introducing new characters and particles to improve the gaming experience. Coming to the Yeti Ouro project, since it is built on Ethereum, the chances of scalability are high. To ensure investors about project safety, the team has audited YETIO by SolidProof . Final words While the question of XRP repeating the 2021 magic looms in the air, YETIO proceeds to bring forth more profit for the users. However, both projects have chances of facing setbacks for various reasons. That’s why it is extremely important to read the market patterns and remain updated with changing news. It would help investors understand which project is safe to invest in. For more information on YETIO, visit the website , Discord , Twitter (X) or Telegram .

Institutions, and long-term holders have all referenced a scenario in which Bitcoin is above seven figures, perhaps driven by increasing adoption, inflation-hedging demand, and 21 million token cap. But when Bitcoin surges, it doesn’t go alone. Altcoins—cryptocurrencies that trade independently of Bitcoin—tend to see even bigger percentage price jumps. Keeping that in mind, the actual question is: what could happen to Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), and new emerging tokens such as Remittix (RTX) if Bitcoin were to cross the psychological $1 million threshold? Solana (SOL): The Speed Demon Poised for a Parabolic Run Trading at around $150.34 today, Solana is also well known for its very fast transaction speeds and low fee. Its growing ecosystem, including DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces, as well as the activity of developers, have placed it firmly on the list of Ethereum’s strongest competitors. When Bitcoin reaches $1 million, Solana has a lot to gain from capital and spotlights on high-performance chains. Analyst projections already place its value potentially at $1,500–$1,800 under such a favorable situation. With the network development and increasing total value locked (TVL) in Solana-based projects, the projection even stands to be on the conservative side. With its present market position and the level of innovation being created on its chain, Solana stands to increase in tandem with the increase in Bitcoin. XRP: The Legal Underdog Ready to Reclaim Global Finance XRP stands alone. Much more of a utility token than a speculative one, XRP is deep within several real-world financial use cases through Ripple Labs. Its long court battle with the SEC has smudged investor opinion for several years, but recent developments have shifted in Ripple’s favor, reopening XRP as a genuine altcoin player. At its current price level of $2.22, XRP would naturally be mimicking Bitcoin in a large bull trend. The predictions are varied, but projections place the price of XRP anywhere from $7.50 to $14.00 if Bitcoin hits the $1M threshold. As XRP boasts some strong financial partnerships and regulatory certainty becomes a potentiality, it could be particularly well-positioned to receive a portion of institutional demand. Its main use case—international payments—is only becoming increasingly significant as the old banking infrastructure grapples with outdated systems. Cardano (ADA): The Silent Giant Building for a Breakout Cardano has long been polarizing in the crypto community, with fans hailing its scholarly approach to blockchain innovation and detractors citing its more gradual deployment of major features. In spite of that, ADA has continued to sit in the upper echelon of crypto assets by market cap. Currently trading at $0.708, Cardano has space to grow, particularly if Bitcoin’s increase triggers a wider altcoin surge. The highest conservative estimates of ADA in a $1 million BTC scenario would put it around $6.50, while some bullish predictions reach $10. That would be a decent gain for long-term investors. Cardano’s proof-of-stake consensus protocol, decentralized governance framework, and constant upgrade cycle through the Basho and Voltaire phases could possibly support such growth, as long as the platform keeps attracting developers and users. Remittix (RTX): The $0.07 Sleeper Set to Dominate a $600B Market And then there’s Remittix , the dark horse that’s beginning to cause a splash in the altcoin world. At a paltry $0.0757, RTX isn’t out to be the next meme token or Ethereum killer. Instead, it’s a laser-beam dedicated to a single use case: revolutionizing cross-border remittances. The traditional remittance market of over $600 billion annually is plagued with high fees, slow transaction times, and inadequate access—especially in the developing world. Remittix aims to change all that. Remittix’s mission is to build a blockchain network that allows migrant workers and businesses to make payments to any part of the globe instantly and at low fees. High Risk, High Reward—But RTX May Offer More If Bitcoin does reach $1 million and infuses fresh mainstream momentum into use-case cryptocurrencies, Remittix can be a monstrous beneficiary. As an early-stage company with its tiny market cap, a progression from $0.0757 to even $3.00–$5.00 would be 100x–166x growth. Speculative, maybe, but that kind of return is not unheard of in crypto history. Ethereum’s 2015 ICO sold ETH for around $0.30—today it is trading in thousands. What makes Remittix even more intriguing is its timing. The token is in presale, meaning it offers a special chance to get in before it goes live on major exchanges. Where there are so many presales in and of themselves on hype alone, Remittix is founded on an actual-world problem to solve—and a massive market to capture. Conclusion: High Risk, High Reward—But RTX May Offer More And if Bitcoins actually get up to $1 million, nobody’s arguing that the premier big altcoins aren’t going to see significant boosts in value. Solana, Cardano, and XRP are particularly well-positioned through the tried and true ecosystems alongside mainstream usage. And there are new contenders like Remittix which are likely to surprise everyone. With a hands-on mission, minimal entry barrier, and astronomic upside, RTX isn’t just riding Bitcoin’s wave—it may create its own.

Analyst Flags Indicators That Preceded Every Major BTC Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ath-incoming-analyst-flags-indicators-that-preceded-every-major-btc-rally/,"Bitcoin continues to extend its recent recovery, gaining over 15% in the past two weeks to reach a market price of $97,559 at the time of writing. This renewed momentum brings the asset closer to the $100,000 psychological level, marking a potential turning point for investor sentiment in the broader crypto market. While short-term price action often generates mixed reactions, some market analysts believe that key long-term indicators may be aligning for a larger move ahead. One of those voices is Bitcoin maxi Robert Breedlove, who shared a series of observations on X about indicators that could point toward a sustained bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selling Expected Around This Level, Report Says Miner Costs and Long-Term Holder Behavior Point to Market Strength Citing analysis from Blockware, Breedlove pointed to the “industry average” miner cost of production — a model that aggregates various operational metrics such as electricity prices and hardware efficiency. According to this metric, Bitcoin has historically bottomed out when its market price approached or dipped below the average production cost. The model previously aligned with six significant market lows, and Breedlove notes it is flashing a bottom signal once again. In addition to mining economics, Breedlove referenced long-term holder supply data as another crucial input. This metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin that has remained unmoved on-chain for at least 155 days, a proxy for investor conviction and potential supply constraints. Over the past 30 days alone, long-term holders have added approximately 150,000 BTC to their balances. Historically, such accumulation during periods of price consolidation or retracement has preceded upward price movements due to the resulting decrease in sell-side pressure. With Bitcoin trading between $80,000 and $100,000, Breedlove suggests that fewer holders appear willing to exit their positions, potentially reducing available supply at these levels. Rising Liquidity and Macro Trends Add Fuel to Bullish Outlook on Bitcoin Another major factor is global fiat liquidity, which Breedlove highlights as a key demand-side component in Bitcoin’s price dynamics. The analyst points to the role of increasing dollar and international currency liquidity, driven by expanding access to Bitcoin through financial instruments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), public company treasury holdings, and convertible bond offerings. He argues that greater access to capital and simplified exposure pathways have enhanced Bitcoin’s correlation with broader liquidity trends, increasing the likelihood of upward movement as fiat liquidity rises. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Nearly Back To Neutral—Green Sign For Rally? Breedlove concluded by reaffirming that Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain unchanged — fixed supply, 10-minute blocks, and predictable halving events — but external factors such as liquidity, regulation, and institutional adoption continue to influence its price action. Lastly, and most importantly, is USD liquidity. This effectively represents the “demand” side of the equation. More dollars in the system means more potential bidders. Bitcoin is highly correlated to fiat liquidity – and that’s becoming increasingly more of the case as ETFs,… pic.twitter.com/i5iE6NzM55 — Robert ₿reedlove (@Breedlove22) May 1, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin ATH|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-05-03 12:00:40

While others only check users (KYC), Pi is also checking the businesses (KYB) that want to work with it. Big exchanges like OKX, Bitget, and MEXC have already agreed to follow these rules. So why are these big names okay with more work and more rules? There’s something special going on with Pi, and it might change how people see crypto. Why Are Exchanges Willing to Go Through KYB for Pi? Normally, exchanges prefer smoother onboarding. KYB is a lengthy , detail-heavy process. But in Pi’s case, analysts believe exchanges see something bigger on the horizon. According to insights from Dr. Altcoin , Pi Network’s KYB requirement aligns directly with a global project called the Digital Currency Global Initiative, a joint effort by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which is a United Nations agency, and Stanford University’s Future of Digital Currency Initiative (FDCI). This global initiative focuses on five big goals: Financial Inclusion – Making digital money systems open and fair to everyone. Interoperability – Making sure systems and networks can talk to each other easily. Identity Verification – Pushing for strong KYC and KYB rules for trust. Programmable Money – Allowing smart contracts and automation. Decentralized Finance – Building powerful, open markets. Interestingly, Pi Network checks all five boxes, and it may be the only crypto project that does. Not only does it ask users to complete KYC, but it also insists that exchanges and businesses meet KYB standards. Pi Network Eyes Bigger Stage Notably, OKX, the first exchange to complete KYB with Pi , is also a listed partner in the global project. And with Pi’s roots tracing back to Stanford, it’s no surprise the project is working closely with institutions that emphasize trust, transparency, and regulation—traits often missing in crypto.

That’s according to Artem Shaginyan, CEO of Lunu Pay, one of the leading Web3 payment solutions providers. The French Riviera city has set its sights on 90% crypto payment coverage by its local businesses. When a city like Cannes starts to adopt crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 is no longer niche,” said Shaginyan. This will attract international visitors, especially high-net-worth individuals, as well as make Cannes a modern hub for digital finance. Local Government Leads the Way in Crypto Adoption In February, Cannes Mayor David Lisnard announced specialized crypto payment instruction workshops for business owners and professionals in the city. The workshops are aimed at accelerating the process and offering smooth onboarding for the merchants new to digital assets. The move is part of a larger plan to update Cannes’ commercial infrastructure and make it more appealing to tech-savvy, international clientele. Cities Around the Globe Follow Similar Patterns Cannes is not alone in embracing crypto. Several international jurisdictions have made the same announcement in recent times: Lugano, Switzerland began accepting Bitcoin and stablecoins for taxes and municipal services in December 2023. Colorado, USA started accepting crypto tax payments in September 2022. Vancouver, Canada passed a motion in December 2024 to become a “Bitcoin-friendly city.” Panama City followed in April 2025 by accepting Bitcoin, Ether, USDC, and USDT for municipal payments. These actions are all indicative of a growing consensus among city governments that digital assets can play a central role in local economies.

Here’s When the ADA Price May Rise and Sustain Above $1,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-price-prediction-2025-heres-when-the-ada-price-may-rise-and-sustain-above-1/,"The post Cardano Price Prediction 2025? Here’s When the ADA Price May Rise and Sustain Above $1 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets have triggered a strong recovery phase, but the Cardano price has remained stuck within a range. The token has been consolidating within a tight range between $0.66 and $0.73, suggesting a massive drop in the volatility. The trading activity has dropped significantly but it does point towards a potential upswing, as a couple of reasons indicate that the ADA price rally is about to go 10x from here. The platform is about to undergo a revolutionary upgrade called the ‘Loas’ upgrade, which aims to transform the network’s capabilities. This upgrade is set to enhance the transaction speed while maintaining the decentralization. The upgrade targets the DeFi and NFT applications as the NFT ecosystem is expanding at a greater pace. On the other hand, the institutional adoption is expected to grow after the inclusion of ADA into the National crypto reserve and with the launch of an ADA ETF. In the times when the development activity of Cardano has surpassed Ethereum, when will the ADA price revive a strong upswing beyond $1? The ADA price is stuck within a descending triangle and seems to have found a strong base at the 50-day MA at $0.673. Meanwhile, the RSI remains elevated, which suggests the ascending consolidation may continue. With this, the price may continue to rise and reach the resistance at above $0.7. This could keep the 50-day MA elevated and further help the token to undergo a bullish crossover with the 200-day MA called the Golden cross. With this, the price is expected to break above the pattern and secure the levels above $1. The third-generation token has surged over $1 multiple times before but the bulls failed to keep up the rally above the gains. However, the MACD shows a drop in the buying pressure while the levels are heading for a bearish crossover. This could keep the Cardano consolidated within a range for a while, followed by a massive breakout once the volume rises in favor of the bulls. Therefore, the ADA price is primed to rise as the markets are displaying huge potential of maintaining a strong upswing in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-03 12:05:36

However, a new Ethereum-based token, Remittix (RTX) , is emerging as a game changer in the blockchain space. As Solana price predictions rise, could Remittix pose a serious threat to SOL’s position, even preventing it from surpassing ETH? This article explores the possibilities and the potential role Remittix could play in disrupting the market. Read on to find out more! Remittix: The Ethereum-based token that could disrupt Solana's rise Remittix (RTX) is quickly gaining attention as one of the most promising Ethereum-based tokens in the blockchain ecosystem. Remittix could be a game-changer for crypto acceptance in practical settings by enabling users to convert their assets into fiat currencies easily. Ultimately, Remittix is an infrastructure fix rather than merely an altcoin. UNLOCKING! 🔥 Remittix 🔥 A 2025 MUST-HAVE! Already generating more than $14.6 million in pre-sale, the cryptocurrency has attracted early backers drawn by its promise to simplify cross-border transactions. Remittix addresses one of the primary issues in the crypto space: the volatility of token circulation, achieved through a limited token supply of 1.5 billion RTX. Every on-chain transaction consumes some tokens, hence, RTX becomes increasingly expensive with time. Remittix distinguishes itself from Ethereum and Solana due to this scarcity aspect, which provides investors with an opportunity to profit from long-term value appreciation. Solana's race with Ethereum: Can it flip ETH? Solana (SOL) has been in the news for its remarkable expansion and rising transaction volume. Supported by a growing ecosystem, its fast and scalable blockchain has attracted significant interest as a potential Ethereum rival. Recent numbers reveal Solana transferring $28.07 billion in just 30 days, exceeding Ethereum and Binance in net transfer volume. This surge points to increasing use cases for Solana’s ecosystem, and experts now project Solana to challenge Ethereum going forward. Bravenewcoin/AMC crypto on X Solana still has some challenges, even if her momentum is indisputable. The primary challenge of the network is balancing its expansion with low transaction costs and avoiding centralization issues. With its latest improvements, Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but Solana’s transaction volume and scalability are clearly appealing. Nonetheless, Solana still lags in providing the same degree of developer support, established community, and network security that Ethereum has developed over the years, notwithstanding its remarkable progress. Ethereum: Still leading, but Remittix could secure its future Ethereum (ETH) remains the leading smart contract platform , but it faces increasing competition from both Solana and emerging tokens, such as Remittix. Through its Ethereum2.0 update, Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) has helped lower scalability concerns and energy usage. Ethereum’s development in dApps and DeFi is limited, nonetheless, by the ongoing struggle with high gas prices and network congestion. TradingView Remittix could provide Ethereum the tools it requires to sustain lead over Solana. Remittix'scross-chain features and Ethereum’s strong development environment help to present Remittix as a complementary rather than a competing solution. Remittix can boost Ethereum’s use cases and expand the platform to markets otherwise unreachable by allowing smooth crypto-to-fiat transactions. Remittix may play a crucial role in lending the Ethereum ecosystem actual value as Ethereum expands its network and enhances scalability. EYES ON THE PRIZE! 🔥 Remittix 🔥 THIS CRYPTO IS ON THE PATH TO BLUE CHIP GLORY! Conclusion While Solana has impressed the market with its transaction volume and technical improvements, it still lacks the real-world utility that Remittix offers, while Ethereum’sscalability issues persist. For investors seeking long-term growth, Remittix presents a solid investment opportunity with its increasing adoption and unique value proposition. Remittix offers quick crypto-to-fiat transactions with low costs and concentrates on solving practical issues in cross-border payments.

In addition, the currency gained up to a nominal 0.10% boost in the day. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to showcase support for the buyers. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the coming weeks will steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of 2025, potentially pushing AMP above $0.007478. However, conducting your research and seeking professional financial advice is recommended. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a nominal gain of 0.10% over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00411, which is just below the average range as the bears remained in the lead during the past week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.0052, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.007478. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $352.11 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.028249. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2026 and reach $0.032403 by 2031.

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has picked up the pace amidst the uptrend in the market. Between the turn of events, marketers are still hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently trading at $0.1780, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.20. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same?

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

Remittix (RTX) has joined major network blockchain players through its $14.7 million token offering at $0.0757 per token to build a fast PayFinetwork. Bitcoin and Solana along with Hedera and VeChain are making crucial technical and regulatory progress while meme-phenomenon Shiba Inu tries to demonstrate upward potential. This analysis examines how various assets function today alongside their key growth drivers and potential development paths going forward. Bitcoin (BTC) — Bulls Eye Six Figures After Strong ETF Inflows Source: Robert Breedlove on X Bitcoin spent numerous weeks in a static pattern before reaching $97,905 on 2 May which triggered a temporary peak before settling near $97,650. BTC maintains most of the price rebound which increased 30 percent from $75,000 and 24 percent from $78,200 recorded in February. The recovery has brought prices to their highest point since more than two months ago while eliminating the market downturn that started with Trump's trade-oriented remarks from February. The continuous support for Bitcoin ETFs acts as the primary driving force behind this strength. The funds have accumulated $4.16 billion in net purchases throughout eight consecutive trading days starting from 21 April. The $21 billion investment from Michael Saylor towards Bitcoin has driven both corporate engagement and investor belief in BTC. Bitcoin price stability is supported by the production cost model according to experts Robert Breedlove and PlanB notes that BTC has surpassed its two-year and five-month realized price points that typically signal bull market conditions. Holding onto current profits helps maintain the $92 k–$95 k price range while abandoning this area of value could potentially lead to further price drops. Solana (SOL) — A Crucial Trendline Stands Between Bulls and Higher Fib Targets Source: TradingView . Solana started the month of May at $149.78 after successfully rebounding from its $115 low in April. Every rally since February has reached its peak at $153–$155 where the descending trend line forms resistance against the asset. During the last 24 hours the trading volume reached $1.289 billion and SOL decreased by 0.99 percent for the day and a total of 1.36 percent for the week. According to the weekly chart SOL is heading toward its 0.5 Fibonacci retracement point at $145.19 based on its historic price range between $17.40 and $272.99. The $145–$150 price zone serves as a common barrier that allows bulls to launch their moves yet acts as consolidation resistance. A decisive close above will unlock the path toward the 0.382 Fib at $175.35 which then leads to the 0.236 level at $212.67. The failure to maintain prices above $145 would likely trigger a return of the $115 level from April which functions as structural support. The multi-month trendline of Solana's 518 million-coin circulation determines its short-term market performance despite its $78 billion market cap base. Hedera (HBAR) — ETF Rumblings and Enterprise Cred Light a Slow-Burn Fuse Source: coincodex The governing council at Hedera Hashgraph consists of IBM, Google, and Boeing which establishes both blue-chip status for HBAR tokens as well as their solid compliance history. Since its launch in 2019 Hedera has refrained from being classified as a security due to which asset managers filed spot ETF applications such as Grayscale Canary's submission to the SEC . HBAR’s market value hovers near $6.66 billion, ample liquidity for institutional products. The CoinCodex algorithm predicts HBAR will decrease -2.23 percent to reach $0.183739 throughout the period from 7 May 2025 to 7 May 2025. The Fear & Greed Index shows 67 (Greed) points but sentiment analysis remains Neutral. The past 30 trading days have shown Hederas stock moving up 16 times (53 percent) while maintaining 7.74 percent market volatility. From a technical perspective the market shows favorable conditions for HBAR acquisition but this depends on potential ETF approval and corporate-chain integration which could generate additional market gains. An approval would bring both additional financial liquidity and extended-term investment capital that would probably sustain price growth during the upcoming quarter. VeChain (VET) — Mainstream Partnerships and Big Staking Pool Bolster the Renaissance Vision Source: coingecko . VeChain currently trades near $0.02739 VeChain maintains a continuous flow of actual world partnership alliances that operate on top of its layer-1 technical foundation. The company formed an alliance with 4ocean to fight marine pollution as it added UFC CEO Dana White to its advisory board which also included Nobel laureate Konstantin Novoselov. The company has taken on the task to integrate mass marketing principles with scientific research methods in order to expand blockchain adoption. VeChain released tools for potential return calculations and established a new staking reward pool where it allocated 5.3 billion VTHO tokens worth about $15 million. CEO Sunny Lu has scheduled a livestream broadcast to reveal details about the Renaissance roadmap and StarGatebridge and their general upgrade approach. The combination of community visibility into VeChain's AI logistics tools and stake rewards represents key factors that boost supply-chain industry adoption before VeChain executes its ""sweeping upgrade."" Remittix (RTX) — Payments Utility Could Elevate RTX Above Pure-Speculation Tokens Since its recent addition to the list Remittix has become a prominent media focus. PayFi bridge from Remittix pursues the $190-trillion global payments market to enable users to transfer BTC, ETH or XRP directly into bank accounts of recipients in under ten seconds at minimal cost. The PayFi protocol consumes Ethereum gas fees on every transaction while distributing micro-fees to RTX holders through a functional network utility mechanism. More than 531 million RTX were sold by the project for $0.0757 which resulted in raising about $14.7 million before its first major exchange listing. Two multinational cash-out networks operating in Asia and Latin America are reportedly getting ready to merge according to developers' insider knowledge. The integration of Remittix technology represents a potential solution for delivering immediate payments to employees doing freelance or gig work and migrants in major remittance markets. Investors predict RTX will rise above other established coins because of its widespread use among retail investors looking for new profitable opportunities. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Community Strength Meets Utility Pressure Source: TradingView . Shiba Inu maintains a price point at $0.00001350 following its resistance rise to $0.000015. Market analysts expect the SHIB price to reach a new resistance level within the range of $0.000017–$0.000018. The RSI indicator stands at 62 which reveals upward market trends without crossing into overbought territory while the MACD also generated a positive signal. The market capitalization of SHIB stands at $8.05 billion presently. The powerful community backing of SHIB continues to be undeniable yet the broader market focuses on functional value. The project developers present technical improvements referred to as Shibarium scaling enhancements to stay competitive in an environment that prioritizes utility together with meme culture. Market participants monitor SHIB's descending-channel resistance level because a successful breakout could re-establish its position as a breakout leader. Final Take — Where Headlines May Land Next Bitcoin exhibits strong resistance at the macro level as it approaches the $100 k price level. The Solana price trendline presents an obstacle that will either drive the market value to $212 or force the price to return to $115. HBAR stands to benefit from both its enterprise relationships and ETF documentation as it presents potential summer market shifts while VeChain maintains its supply-chain position through its practical business relationships and new staking system incentives. Shiba Inu needs to demonstrate that its technological capabilities enhance cultural impact to initiate another price surge. Remittix achieves the rare feat of uniting attention-grabbing media coverage with concrete daily payment benefits which make it both news effective and highly user-accelerating in this developed market. PayFi integration success along with growing transaction volume could propel RTX from its current newcomer status to dominate mainstream headlines and challenge dominant market players throughout the upcoming quarters.

After skyrocketing by triple-digits since its March low of under $0.2, is FARTCOIN primed for a major correction now? Well, this is what the TD Sequential indicator suggests. The metric, used to determine the market exhaustion for an underlying asset after it had traded predominantly in one direction for a while, has flashed a sell signal on the 3-day chart, according to Ali Martinez. Thus, the popular technical analyst indicated that investors might start to take profit following the impressive rally. #Fartcoin is up 550% over the past two months, but the TD Sequential is now flashing a sell signal on the 3-day chart, suggesting a potential wave of profit-taking ahead. pic.twitter.com/QiEJHC99At — Ali (@ali_charts) May 3, 2025 Recall that the asset soared by 260% at one point on a monthly scale ending on April 11 when it first entered the top 100 alts. Although it exited the elite following a substantial correction later that month, it returned once again shortly after and has remained well within those parameters. A price tag of $1.11 and a market cap of over $1.1 billion mean that FARTCOIN is currently the 85th-largest digital asset by that metric, according to CoinGecko. However, Ali Martinez is not the only popular crypto analyst on X claiming that the asset is due for a correction. Captain Faibik indicated that FARTCOIN’s rising wedge and RSI bearish divergence formation on the 4-hour chart suggests a price slide to $0.72. In contrast, Altcoin Sherpa predicted a price surge to $1.5 or even $2 if the current market structure doesn’t turn out to be a fakeout.

Here’s your #XRP Report for the week: SEC Greenlights First XRP Futures ETFs in the U.S. After much anticipation, the SEC has approved the launch of three XRP-linked futures ETFs from ProShares, marking a historic first for regulated XRP products in the U.S. This… pic.twitter.com/Fsd0jK6nG8 — Uphold (@UpholdInc) May 3, 2025 SEC Approves First-Ever XRP Futures ETFs After years of regulatory uncertainty, the SEC has given the green light to a trio of XRP-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from ProShares . These ETFs will provide institutional and retail investors alike with exposure to XRP price movements without directly holding the token, offering a compliant and streamlined route into the digital asset market. The approval marks the first time a U.S. regulatory body has sanctioned any XRP-based ETF product, signaling a shift in regulatory posture and reflecting growing institutional interest. This breakthrough comes just weeks after Teucrium launched its own leveraged 2x XRP ETF, which quickly became its most successful product debut to date, attracting over $5 million in trading volume on its first day alone. The strong reception highlights surging demand for structured XRP investment vehicles, particularly as traditional investors seek more exposure to digital assets amid Bitcoin’s continued dominance and Ethereum’s evolving regulatory clarity. While futures-based ETFs provide a meaningful entry point, market observers continue to watch closely for the SEC’s stance on spot XRP ETFs. Grayscale’s application remains under review, with a key decision deadline looming on May 22. If approved, a spot ETF would allow direct investment in XRP, potentially bringing a significant wave of capital into the ecosystem and affirming XRP’s legitimacy in the eyes of institutional investors. Ripple Quells IPO Speculation for 2025 Amid rising interest in Ripple’s expanding global footprint, speculation has swirled around a potential initial public offering (IPO). However, those rumors were firmly dispelled last week. Ripple President Monica Long addressed the matter directly, clarifying that the company has no intention of pursuing an IPO in 2025. Instead, Ripple remains committed to private market operations and is focused on growing its suite of financial products, including its rapidly expanding On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service and the RLUSD stablecoin initiative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The decision to delay or rule out public listing plans underscores Ripple’s confidence in its current growth strategy. The company recently completed a substantial share buyback, which increased internal equity and rewarded early backers—moves that hint at both financial stability and strategic foresight. With Ripple’s latest valuation pegged at $11.3 billion, the firm continues to position itself as a private fintech leader with a global reach. What Lies Ahead for XRP? With futures ETFs now live and spot ETF approval pending, XRP finds itself at a turning point. Regulatory clarity is beginning to take shape in the U.S., opening doors for more institutional inflows. Meanwhile, Ripple’s stablecoin efforts and broader enterprise adoption are reinforcing the utility narrative that has long separated XRP from other digital assets. Yet, questions remain: will the futures ETFs meaningfully increase demand, or is the industry still waiting for the real catalyst in a spot ETF? Investors are split, but there is little doubt that XRP is gaining the regulatory legitimacy it has long sought—marking a new chapter in its journey from legal ambiguity to mainstream financial infrastructure. As Uphold’s weekly report shows, the momentum is building, and the next few weeks could prove decisive for XRP’s market trajectory and institutional relevance.

At the same time, the native token’s price seems stuck between two major buy and sell walls, with little indication of the direction of the next move. Although it’s still behind the leader, Ethereum, Tron’s USDT share has skyrocketed in the past few years. According to Tether’s transparency page, almost $72 billion worth of the world’s largest stablecoin is on Tron (from the Total Authorized amount), while Ethereum leads with $74.5 billion. The numbers are even closer when you look at the net circulation – $73 billion for Ethereum and $71 billion for Tron. Solana, Ton, and Avalanche trail further behind, with around $2 billion each. Perhaps that’s one of the biggest reasons behind the milestone we hinted about. CryptoQuant informed earlier this week that Tron has “grown to be one of the most active blockchain networks in the world” as it had crossed the $10 billion total transactions target. The report claims that the daily transaction count is well above $8 million, which places Tron among the leaders in the space. Tron Transaction Count. Source: CryptoQuant Although the current average daily numbers are far from the 2023 peak, they are still close to the bull runs in mid-2021 and late 2024. TRX’s price exploded late last year, surging to a new all-time high of over $0.43. However, it failed to maintain its run and has lost over 40% of its value since then. The past few months have seen the asset trading mostly in a tight range between $0.2 and $0.26. According to a popular market observer and data analyst, TRX has built a buy wall at approximately the current price range, which acts as support in case of a violent nosedive. However, it also has a sell wall at around $0.3, which could mean that the asset will remain within this range for a while.

Telegram did not acknowledge the vulnerability with ”session invalidation”. Alleged serial bitcoin extortionist indicted in U.S. Binance reported attempts to copy customers' faces using AI Fraudsters are using AI to copy the faces of customers of cryptocurrency exchange Binance and further bypass the biometrics verification system to steal assets. The platform's team warned users about this. Attackers use publicly available or stolen photos and videos from databases as the basis of a fake 3D facial model. Bypassing the verification system is often combined with password cracking and 2FA attempts. Attacks on unsecured phones and desktops with access to Binance can be carried out remotely, via malware. The exchange team is actively monitoring the threat and urges users to remain vigilant. Telegram denied the existence of a vulnerability with ”session invalidation” The author of Telegram channel ”IT Dig” discovered a vulnerability in the messenger that allows access to user accounts without a password or MFA verification, and notified the developers about it. According to him, the problem arises when authorization via Telegram widget on third-party sites, primarily in the messenger's built-in browser. Such authorizations can create sessions with elevated rights - they allow reading chats, receiving calls without entering a cloud password and notifying the account owner; The main danger is that an attacker can intercept the authorization token and use it on their device, the expert added. He believes that it was this bug that caused the theft of 200 million rubles (~$3 million) worth of cryptocurrency from his client in early 2025. To avoid such risks, the author of the post recommended users to clear the history of the built-in Telegram browser, disable all active web sessions and widgets. Telegram officially refuted the existence of the vulnerability, claiming that the researcher misinterpreted the mechanism of different types of authorizations. In turn, the specialist considers that the response of the messenger team contradicts the content of his video. An alleged serial bitcoin extortionist has been indicted in the US The US Department of Justice charged a Yemeni national, the likely developer and primary operator of the Black Kingdom ransomware virus, for carrying out 1,500 attacks on Microsoft Exchange servers. According to the case file, between March 2021 and June 2023, 36-year-old Rami Khaled Ahmed and his accomplices infected computer networks with the encryptor and demanded a ransom of $10,000 in bitcoins. Its victims included a medical company in Encino, a ski resort in Oregon, a school district in Pennsylvania and a health clinic in Wisconsin. Authorities emphasized that the Black Kingdom virus was created specifically to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server and access target computers. Ahmed faces up to 15 years in prison on combined charges of conspiracy, willful damage to a protected computer, and threatening to do so. iPhone owners have been attacked by spyware Apple has notified a number of users in over a hundred countries of a large-scale attack by government spyware. This is reported by TechCrunch . The victims include Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and Dutch right-wing activist Eva Vlaardingerbroek. The spyware allows access to personal data, correspondence, microphone and camera without the owner's consent. It is currently unclear which group is behind the targeted attacks. Alerted iPhone owners are advised to immediately update iOS to the latest version 18.4.1. and enable Lockdown Mode for increased protection.

TikTok has been ordered to bring its data processing into compliance within six months. The DPC plans to suspend all data transfers to China if the company fails to meet the deadline. RansomHub ransomware program has gone offline Group-IB experts reported that the online infrastructure of the RansomHub ransomware group has ”for unexplained reasons” stopped working since April 1. A number of experts attributed this to the ”departure of many participants” that followed downtime in the syndicate's operations beginning in November 2024. The problems accelerated when rival RaaS group DragonForce claimed that RansomHub had allegedly decided to switch to their infrastructure as part of a new ” сartel of ransomware.” Some affiliates may have gone to Qilin, given the doubling of disclosures on its leak site since February.

In a candid interview on May 1, Hayes made it clear that despite holding nearly 200,000 BTC in seized assets, the U.S. is unlikely to formally grow its crypto reserves—especially by purchasing more Bitcoin outright. “The U.S. is a deficit country,” Hayes said , highlighting that with its ballooning national debt, America isn’t in a position to start stacking sats just for strategy’s sake. Most of the Bitcoin it currently owns—roughly $18 billion worth—was confiscated through law enforcement actions, including high-profile cases like Silk Road and the Bitfinex hack. But when it comes to actively buying Bitcoin with printed dollars, Hayes doesn’t see that being politically feasible. “Imagine a sitting president justifying a spending bill so the government can compete with Bitcoin bros,” he joked. “It’s not a great look.” Despite President Trump’s executive order in March to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve , critics and crypto veterans alike remain skeptical that the policy will translate into actual market purchases. If the U.S. Buys Bitcoin, Expect a Global Scramble While Hayes is dismissive of U.S. buying ambitions, others in the industry believe the very act of the U.S. government entering the Bitcoin market could trigger a ripple effect across the globe. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch, suggested that even smaller nations would start hoarding Bitcoin, creating competition that could push the asset into geopolitical territory. “Countries will soon be fighting over Bitcoin,” Kunz warned. “And the U.S. will lead the charge.” This sentiment plays into a broader narrative of Bitcoin as a sovereign asset, not just a speculative investment—one that could eventually find a place on central bank balance sheets if global trust in fiat systems continues to erode. Hayes Predicts Classic Altcoin Surge Beyond geopolitics, Hayes also weighed in on market dynamics. He remains convinced that the age-old rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins is still very much intact . “Bitcoin dominance is going to rise back toward 70%, just like before the 2021 altseason,” he predicted, pushing back against analysts who say the cycle has changed. While others like Benjamin Cowen and Ki Young Ju argue that altcoin season won’t be driven by Bitcoin anymore, Hayes remains bullish on history repeating itself: “Once Bitcoin hits new highs, people start rotating. That playbook hasn’t changed.” The post Arthur Hayes: US Bitcoin Buying Spree Unlikely, Altcoin Season Still Inevitable appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Bitcoin News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin US,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-05-03 12:40:22

According to the publisher, the role-playing NFT game, dubbed after the popular TV show, will be shuttered and users will no longer be able to play it after the date. The Walking Dead: Empires is a multiplayer survival game that was built around Ethereum NFTs. The game was opened to players in its beta version last year after the developers initially announced its creation in 2021. “After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to sunset The Walking Dead: Empires, with the last playable date set for July 31, 2025,” wrote Gala Games in a statement this week. Gala Games to halt The Walking Dead NFT game The Walking Dead NFT game was available for playtests in early 2023, with the game mandating players to craft weapons, build bases, and fight for survival. The players were charged to keep a safe distance from the zombies or “walkers.” To enhance the gaming experience, users were allowed to buy NFT s in the form of supplies, weapons, or deeds to build a safe base. Unlike some in-game items that disappear from a player’s inventory, The Walking Dead: Empires made sure that their NFT-based items were indestructible. While prices have dropped drastically from the bull market period, some in-game items saw their price shoot up over the last few years. According to data from the OpenSea marketplace, legendary land deed claims, for example, sold for as much as $67,000 in 2021. In 2023, when the game was still available for playtests, users were still asking for top dollars on some items. For example, the NFT-based handgun sold for about $30,000 at the time, with some lower-level items also costing around $1,000. Now, most of these items are being rendered useless after the developers announced plans to shut things down. Users show displeasure at the development As compensation to the players, Gala Games has plans to distribute other NFTs from its gaming ecosystem to users. The platform says it will provide those with “equal functionality” to their existing The Walking Dead: Empires NFT holdings. “While the game’s journey is coming to an end, we remain committed to ensuring that these NFTs continue to have utility,” its statement reads. “As part of the sunset process, we will be distributing new NFTs of equal functionality in other Gala Games products to TWD:E NFT holders.” As expected, users showed mixed feelings towards the news, with the majority of them not taking the news in good faith. “The Walking Dead: Empires officially rugs on Gala,” said crypto gaming personality Jesus Martinez on X (formerly known as Twitter). “People paid upwards of $10K+ for lands and are now getting $2 mystery boxes.” Other players also followed in the same opinion, with a user saying, “Gala mastered the art of frontend extraction and backend non-delivery. Beyond blatant at this point. Add this to the list of money grabs with no intention to fulfill.” The platform has also mentioned that holders of The Walking Dead: Empires NFTs, as of the snapshot that took place on April 29, will receive boxes containing items depending on the type and rarity of their Walking Dead NFTs. The Walking Dead IP also featured in NFTs on the Eluvio blockchain in addition to a collaboration with the Ethereum metaverse game, The Sandbox . The NFT game was modeled after the post-apocalyptic zombie show, which was based on a popular comic book, and ran across 11 seasons and 177 episodes, with multiple shows spinning off the original.

Crypto enthusiasts are keen to see which altcoins might surge next. Could key players like TRX and AVAX be poised to follow Cardano's lead? This article delves into potential market movers and what could trigger the next big altcoin rally.ants are ready for growth. Cardano Trends: Recent Gains and Key Price Levels The past month shows a 9.23% gain with a minor one-week drop of 2.24%. The six-month growth stands at a strong 109.61%. Price figures indicate steady gains interspersed with slight corrections, reflecting a volatile yet improving trend. Current ADA prices trade between $0.547 and $0.781, with near-term resistance at $0.88 and support near $0.41. A secondary resistance at $1.11 and deeper support at $0.18 serve as critical markers. Indicators like a 55.19 RSI and a positive Awesome Oscillator point to cautious bullish strength, suggesting that trading may be appropriate within these established levels. TRON Steady Growth and Key Levels Signal Trade Ideas TRON showed a steady climb with roughly 6.5% gains over one month and an impressive 51% surge in the last six months. Weekly prices advanced by about 3%, reflecting growing confidence among traders. Price movements over these periods indicated a consistent upward trend, supported by increased buyer interest and gradual accumulation. Current prices hover between $0.22 and $0.26, with strong support near $0.20 and resistance at $0.28, extending to a secondary resistance around $0.32. The moderate RSI reading of 55.3 signals a slight upper bias amid a balanced field of buyers and sellers. Trading within these levels may offer promising opportunities by considering buys near support while monitoring for breakouts above resistance. Avalanche (AVAX) Market Pulse: Recent Rallies Amid Mixed Trends Past price movement shows a one-month gain of 17.67% while experiencing a six-month decline of 10.24%. The recent weekly drop of 4.96% adds to the volatility observed. These fluctuations highlight a market that has seen both swift rebounds and corrective pressures. Historical data shows short-term strength despite a mixed longer-term outlook, indicating that the coin has been moving within its trading range. AVAX current prices fluctuate between $16 and $24, with a key support level at $11.13 and resistance around $27.94. Bears currently hold sway over momentum, reflected by a negative reading, while the RSI at 52.90 suggests a neutral trend. Traders can look for opportunities to test resistance levels and secure positions at support zones. Conclusion ADA has shown great potential recently, hinting at a possible market shift. Its performance could inspire other coins like TRX and AVAX to follow suit. If ADA maintains its current momentum, it might set a new trend for altcoins. Observers should watch these coins closely to see if they ride the same upward trend. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The security firm Dvuln says the information it has uncovered was stolen from customers with bank accounts in Australia, spanning four years of malware attacks. Dvuln says it has found login credentials for 14,000 Commonwealth Bank customers, 7,000 ANZ customers, 5,000 NAB customers and 4,000 Westpac customers. “The actual number of compromised customer devices is likely substantially higher, as many infections remain undetected or are traded in private channels outside our visibility.” The data was taken from phones and other devices infected with malware and not due to hacks of the bank’ security systems. Dvuln says a concentrated and cooperative effort is required to combat this type of fraud, citing a recent report from KELA finding billions of passwords have now been lifted from devices worldwide. “…This represents only a fraction of a much larger global problem. When viewed alongside industry findings that 3.9 billion passwords have been stolen through infostealer malware and that these credentials are systematically traded in underground markets, the scale of the threat becomes clear.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With a projected jump to $0.0005309 at launch, that’s not just a discount; it’s a calculated opportunity. As each of the 26 presale stages fills up, the price escalates, shrinking the gap between the current and launch price. The Game Center’s token-burning model ensures that $TCAT supply won’t inflate uncontrollably. And the staking APY of 69% is among the most attractive in the meme coin space. These fundamentals have solidified Troller Cat’s position on multiple watchlists for the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term. With a strong social media presence, clever branding, and community buzz building by the hour, Troller Cat is quickly becoming one of 2025’s hottest presales. Timing could be everything for investors who’ve learned the importance of getting in early—before the crowd. Baby Doge Coin Dips as Market Slumps Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge) is trading at $0.000000001323, showing a slight 0.16% decline over the past 24 hours, as crypto markets trend downward. Its market cap has slipped to $217.04 million, down 0.18%, while 24-hour trading volume has decreased 10.48% to $19.48 million. The token’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) stands at $268 million, with a volume-to-market cap ratio of 9.06%, reflecting moderate trading activity. Baby Doge Coin has a massive total supply of 202.62 quadrillion tokens, a circulating supply of 164.07 quadrillion, and no set maximum supply. This pullback mirrors the broader dip affecting meme coins and altcoins alike. MEW Token Climbs with Strong Gains Across the Board MEW is showing strength, trading at $0.003075 after a 4.73% increase in the past 24 hours. Its market cap has risen to $273.4 million, also up 4.73%, while 24-hour trading volume surged 20.96% to $59.3 million, signaling growing market interest. The token’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) stands at $273.4 million, with a healthy volume-to-market cap ratio of 21.69%, reflecting active trading. MEW has a total, max, and circulating supply of 88.88 billion tokens, meaning the full supply is already in circulation. With gains across price, market cap, and volume, MEW shows positive momentum in a rising market. Conclusion: Where Do the Best Long-Term Meme Coin Opportunities Lie? Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat ($TCAT) emerges as the standout contender in this trio. While Baby Doge and MEW bring their own value and momentum, Troller Cat’s 26-stage presale, 69% APY on staking, GameFi-powered token burns, and deeply community-driven model elevate it into a category of its own.

That’s exactly why a growing number of early investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a decentralized finance project that’s quietly building a strong case for itself as a top cryptocurrency to invest in for sustainable, long-term returns. While many tokens lean on hype and momentary price spikes, MUTM is building out an entire ecosystem designed for real use, passive income, and future scalability — and investors are starting to notice. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t promising the moon without substance. It’s developing an actual DeFi platform designed to offer flexible lending, passive yield, and utility-focused tokenomics. The project is focused on delivering tools users can benefit from long after the bull cycle fades. At the core of its system is a lending and borrowing model that allows users to earn passive income or unlock liquidity without giving up ownership of their crypto. The protocol handles this through a system of mtTokens — smart tokens that grow in value over time as interest builds. These tokens don’t need to be staked or manually managed. Users just hold them, and their value increases automatically based on platform activity. This kind of hands-off income model is becoming increasingly attractive, especially to those who don’t want to constantly babysit their portfolio or chase yield farming trends that come and go. One of the biggest reasons investors are entering MUTM now is because of the presale setup. Currently priced at $0.025, the token is preparing to move into its next phase, where the price will climb to $0.03 — and eventually list at $0.06 upon launch. This means early buyers have the opportunity to enter at more than a 50% discount compared to the initial exchange price. So far, the project has brought in over $7.4 million from 9,250+ holders, a figure that continues to grow daily. This isn’t just a handful of speculators — it’s a fast-growing, actively engaged community of believers putting their money into a product still under development, but already showing clear value. What’s pushing the urgency? Besides the coming price increase, the project has confirmed it will launch a beta version of the platform by the time the token goes live. That, plus expected exchange listings, puts MUTM in prime position to surge out of the gate. Many are wondering how high MUTM can realistically go. Analysts have pointed to a potential 10x to 21x surge shortly after listings. This kind of run isn’t unheard of in early-stage DeFi tokens with clear platforms and early utility. Imagine entering with a $2,500 investment at the current presale price of $0.025. When MUTM climbs to $0.50 shortly after its exchange debut — a 1,900% increase — that initial investment would grow into $50,000. This kind of upside isn’t speculative fantasy; it reflects what similar early-stage DeFi tokens have achieved during prior cycles when backed by working products and strong momentum. The token isn’t being priced up purely on speculation, either. As more users interact with the lending system, hold mtTokens, and use the platform’s upcoming stablecoin, demand naturally builds around the ecosystem. That cycle strengthens the token, creating a long-term flywheel effect. What gives Mutuum an edge over many “next big cryptos” is that it isn’t a fork or a meme. It’s building original systems, including a self-contained overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be issued through the platform’s own mechanics — not tied to third-party risk or off-chain manipulation. That stablecoin will be minted and burned based on collateral supply and loan repayment, ensuring every token remains properly backed on-chain. This adds liquidity depth and creates more reasons for users to remain within the Mutuum ecosystem, increasing overall token utility and value retention. All of this sits alongside a buy-and-distribute model that allocates part of platform revenue to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market. These tokens are then distributed back to participants, especially those holding mtTokens. This cycle helps reduce selling pressure and creates a more balanced economic model. Trust matters in early-stage projects, and Mutuum is checking the right boxes. A live contributor dashboard lets the community track top holders in real-time, showing transparency that’s rarely seen in presales. Additionally, the project is currently being audited by CertiK, a highly regarded authority in blockchain security. Once completed, this audit is expected to add an extra layer of confidence ahead of exchange listings. And there’s more. An ongoing $100,000 giveaway is available exclusively to those taking part in the presale. All the details are available on the official Mutuum website, and it’s helping build even more momentum around the project as the final stages of the presale approach. In a time when many investors are questioning where to put their capital before the next major crypto market breakout, MUTM is offering something different. It’s not just a cheap coin. It’s a functional product with passive income potential, real user tools, and a strategy to reward long-term holders. If you’re looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today — one with a strong foundation, rising adoption, and a clear roadmap — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) should be on your radar. The presale isn’t going to stay open forever. And with momentum building and price increases ahead, those who wait may end up watching from the sidelines.

As of press time, Bitcoin was valued at $95,972, dipping by about 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, however, BTC is up almost 2%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Although Bitcoin is still awaiting a decisive move, the asset’s technical indicators paint a cautiously bullish scenario in the coming days. There is a possible extended upward trend, considering that at the current price, Bitcoin is trading above the 50-day Simple Moving Average ($86,698) and the 200-day SMA ($86,156). However, a 6.63% volatility rate suggests potential price swings. Meanwhile, a Fear & Greed Index of 65 (Greed) and a 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) of 70 nearing overbought territory hint at overconfidence and a possible pullback if momentum weakens. AI predicts Bitcoin price Regarding the price prediction, OpenAI’s ChatGPT forecasts a range between $102,000 and $108,000, with a base case of $105,000 for May 31. The AI model cited several catalysts, such as a possible sustained exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflow into Bitcoin and the impact of the April 2024 halving, as key drivers. ChatGPT also highlighted $100,000 as a critical psychological barrier, suggesting that prices could briefly spike to $112,000 once breached. However, the model warned that macroeconomic risks like inflation or a hawkish Federal Reserve policy could limit gains or trigger a dip toward $97,000. On the other hand, xAI’s Grok offered a wider forecast, setting the price range between $90,000 and $120,000, with a likely range of $105,000 to $115,000. Bitcoin AI price prediction. Source: Grok The model echoed ChatGPT’s view on ETF adoption and halving effects and cautioned around sentiment indicators and seasonal volatility. It noted potential short-term correction if markets become overbought or if regulatory uncertainty resurfaces. Despite the different forecast ranges, both models agree on core themes: Bitcoin remains bullish, $100,000 is a key battleground, and short-term volatility is still in play. Bitcoin technical outlook Meanwhile, technical analysis supports the possibility of trading Bitcoins that are above $100,000. In a May 1 post on X, prominent online analyst TradingShot noted that Bitcoin is staging an impressive comeback, erasing nearly all traces of the recent “Tariffs correction” that shook markets. According to the outlook, every lower high from the previous downtrend has been filled, except for the January 30 peak. The chart signals a bullish continuation, with Bitcoin closing price gaps from its February to April decline. Since bottoming in April, the asset has already posted two 15%+ surges.

Filling this level would mark a third 15.11% gain, putting the short-term target at $106,000.

The SEC needs to make the final decision about the application on or before November 11, 2025. Bloomberg analysts have issued a rating on the chances of approval at 80%, highlighting positive market dynamics and increasing demand from institutional clients. Approval with success would flood Hedera with significant new capital from traditional financial sectors.

The Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin ( BTC ) and create a reserve managed by state officials, was formally struck down on Friday, according to an update on the Arizona State Legislature’s website. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025.

Source: Governor Katie Hobbs Apple softens crypto app rules, “hugely bullish” for crypto industry Crypto app developers are now free to direct users to payments outside of Apple’s ecosystem without restrictions or hefty fees, after a United States district judge ruled that Apple violated an injunction in its antitrust legal battle against Epic Games. “The Court finds Apple in willful violation of this Court’s 2021 Injunction, which was issued to restrain and prohibit Apple’s anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing. Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,” US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in an April 30 court filing. “Effective immediately, Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users, nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases,” Rogers added. Rogers reiterated, “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence.” Bitcoin is a matter of national security — Deputy CIA director The US Central Intelligence Agency is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a tool in its operations, and working with the cryptocurrency is a matter of national security, Michael Ellis, the agency’s deputy director, told podcast host Anthony Pompliano. In an appearance on the market analyst and investor’s show, Ellis told Pompliano that the intelligence agency works with law enforcement to track BTC , and it is a point of data collection in counter-intelligence operations . Ellis added: “Bitcoin is here to stay — cryptocurrency is here to stay. As you know, more and more institutions are adopting it, and I think that is a great trend. One that this administration has obviously been leaning forward into.” ""It's another area of competition where we need to ensure the United States is well-positioned against China and other adversaries,"" Ellis said.

According to a report shared by Cointelegraph via X, projections for Bitcoin’s price range widely, from a conservative $122,000 to an eye-popping $700,000, signaling a growing consensus that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is entering a new phase of institutional adoption and long-term valuation growth. BULLISH: Bitcoin price forecasts for 2025 range from $122,000 to $700,000, according to major banks, investors, and funds. Most estimates fall between $200,000 and $250,000, with BlackRock’s $700K target assuming 2–5% institutional portfolio allocation to $BTC . pic.twitter.com/OvjrrO912Z — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 2, 2025 The $700K Thesis: BlackRock’s Institutional Allocation Model Among the most ambitious forecasts is that of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock’s target of $700,000 per Bitcoin is predicated on the assumption that institutional investors will allocate between 2% to 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This allocation, though seemingly modest, would represent a massive inflow of capital into the asset class, pushing demand far beyond current levels. BlackRock’s model is rooted in portfolio theory, treating Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset that enhances risk-adjusted returns. If institutions, including pension funds, insurance firms, and sovereign wealth entities, follow this strategy en masse, it would represent a structural shift in capital markets—one that redefines Bitcoin as a core macro asset rather than a speculative instrument. Mainstream Forecasts Center Around $200K–$250K While BlackRock’s upper-end estimate captures headlines, most 2025 projections cluster between $200,000 and $250,000. These figures, echoed by several major banks and hedge funds, reflect a blend of macroeconomic analysis, supply-demand modeling, and anticipated regulatory clarity. The halving cycle of 2024, which cut Bitcoin’s issuance rate in half, is another catalyst frequently cited by analysts anticipating price appreciation in the coming year. Market veterans point to the expanding adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs , growing developer activity around Bitcoin’s Layer 2 solutions, and increased geopolitical hedging as further drivers of demand. These institutional products and strategic use cases are expected to provide sustained momentum that distinguishes the current bull cycle from previous speculative booms. Conservative Projections Still Signal Strong Growth Even at the lower end of the spectrum, forecasts remain bullish. A projected price of $122,000 still represents a more than 26% gain from current levels, suggesting strong optimism even among the more cautious corners of the market. These estimates often assume slower regulatory approvals, macroeconomic headwinds, or conservative adoption curves, but still reflect Bitcoin’s evolution into a maturing financial asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such conservative outlooks also tend to emphasize Bitcoin’s role as digital gold , an inflation hedge, and a store of value rather than a medium of exchange. With central banks grappling with persistent inflation and fiat devaluation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply remains a core pillar of the long-term bullish case. The Institutional Era of Bitcoin As the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to mature, the tone of institutional commentary has notably shifted. What was once dismissed as a fringe innovation is now being integrated into the investment playbooks of the world’s most powerful financial entities. The widening range of 2025 price forecasts reflects varying degrees of certainty around adoption rates, but the directional bias is clear: the majority of serious market participants expect higher valuations. Whether Bitcoin ultimately lands closer to $122,000 or tests the upper end of the $700,000 spectrum will depend on a confluence of factors, including monetary policy, regulatory shifts, and the speed of institutional allocation. But one thing is certain—Bitcoin is no longer just a retail phenomenon. It is becoming a permanent fixture in the global financial system.

Kraken noticed something was wrong when the interviewee used a different name from the one listed on his resume. The Kraken team then performed open-source intelligence scans on the interviewee and discovered he was associated with nefarious activity. After red flags started to show, the Kraken team continued interviewing the applicant to get as much information as possible on a potential security breach. The applicant applied for the job after a regular recruitment process. The applicant, however, slipped up on the first call and gave a different name to the one on his resume. The interviewee further displayed signs of having someone coach him during the interview. Kraken, however, was aware of North Korean operatives targeting crypto exchanges, thanks to a partner company giving Kraken the heads-up. For example, other crypto companies were aware of the email used by the interviewee because it was flagged as being associated with disreputable activities. Kraken performed open intelligence analysis on the information they provided, including the email address, and discovered that it had been used multiple times by other employees hired at crypto companies. Many signs were pointing to an organized campaign. The applicant routed his internet traffic through a stand-alone Macintosh workstation to disguise his location. Open-source intelligence linked the applicant’s email to a known data breach. Even the applicant’s identity could be traced to a possible identity theft. Needless to say, the applicant was brazen in his attempts to infiltrate Kraken. Crypto companies like Kraken often employ remote workers to maintain their exchanges. Although the process can be incredibly convenient for workers and managers, there are also a few security holes. Kraken has learned a valuable lesson during this experience, strengthening its resolve to verify new employees rather than trust them at face value. The North Korean operatives could have easily infiltrated the company and used their position to inject malware into the company’s software or even steal valuable information. The infiltration attempt was relatively sophisticated, so, surprisingly, the applicant made such an obvious mistake, using a different name from the one listed on his resume. State-sponsored hackers, notably from North Korea, have surprised the world with multiple attacks. They will probably continue their attempts to breach crypto networks for some time. North Korean hackers have tried many exploits, including malware, phishing attacks, and now a social engineering attempt. There is a new trend of North Korean hackers infiltrating systems to perform exploits from within the system. From recent events, one such example of this trend includes the North Korean Lazarus Group creating shell companies in America to exploit job applicants. Usually, the goal is to steal cryptocurrencies because they are easy to conceal and transfer across borders, even to North Korea. Social Engineering attacks may continue to become a mainstay with the crypto industry, compelling many crypto investors to be extra vigilant when communicating online.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Kraken|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-03 13:05:59

The institutional adoption of $BTC has increased during the last couple of months. Sergej Kunz, founder of 1inch (exchange aggregator), said that retailers might not have much time to accumulate the digital asset. As per Kunz, every retailer should plan to own at least one Bitcoin right now. In the near future, retailers might not be able to afford the asset as institutional buying pressure may propel the prices beyond $200K. Keep reading to find out more about the upcoming rally in ‘digital gold.’ We’ll also suggest the best altcoins you can add to your portfolio for massive gains. The Race Towards ‘Bitcoinization’ Ever since Trump announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve, there has been a race among countries to hoard the asset. During April 21-25, more than $3B were invested in Bitcoin ETFs. As of May 1, these ETFs and institutional funds hold more than $128B worth of $BTC. Countries like the UK, the US, and China hold more than $130B worth of the asset. Other countries like Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador also own a sizable chunk of $BTC. Institutions like Strategy own around 538,200 Bitcoins, buying more than 4.5 times the amount of $BTC being mined every day. Analysts believe that such heavy institutional buying can propel Bitcoin’s price to a whopping $1M. Bitcoin is being increasingly viewed as a safe haven in times of uncertainty, similar to how gold is viewed. Currently trading around $97K , $BTC is nearing the $100K mark and may soon break its all-time high of around $109K. With the price still ripe, this is the best time to buy Bitcoin. However, there’s no arguing that it’s really expensive. If you’re looking to make the most of Bitcoin’s bull run but without burning a hole in your pocket, here are three tokens worth buying. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy Now, Get Free $BTC If you want to follow the footprints of large institutions and ride Bitcoin’s upcoming rally, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is possibly the best crypto to buy now . It’s unlike any other Bitcoin-themed meme coin on the market, seeing as it’s the only one that gives $BTC in its airdrops to its token holder. Essentially, every time Bitcoin crosses a brand-new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their cryptos in Best Wallet will receive free (and real) $BTC. Another reason we’ve predicted $BTCBULL to jump nearly 400% by the end of 2026 is its deflationary mechanism. Simply put, the developers will burn a part of the token supply every time $BTC’s price rises by $25K. As the amount of $BTCBULL tokens in circulation will keep decreasing, it will increase the token’s demand and price. If you’re a Bitcoin maximalist, this is the best time to buy into the BTC Bull Token presale , which has raised over $5.2M so far. That’s because each token is available for a low price of $0.002495. Here’s how to buy it . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Top AI Agent Coin on the Market Today A Bitcoin bull run is likely going to result in increased market penetration for crypto assets as a whole. That means more and more people will be owning cryptocurrencies. However, with education in the industry running thin, you’d need a token like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) that can point you towards the best cryptos to invest in . At its heart, $MIND is an AI agent designed to study social trends and community sentiment to identify cryptos that could be the next to explode. However, we’d like you to think of $MIND as your own crypto investment buddy. This autonomous AI system, which is launching on May 10 , by the way, will interact with crypto influencers online, read their biases and insights into crypto, and finally use its hive-mind intelligence to find out which tokens are in a pole position to skyrocket on account of the attention they’ve been getting from the market participants. What’s more, MIND of Pepe will also be launching its own tokens as it develops further. Access to these, too, will be reserved for $MIND holders. If you want to benefit from $MIND’s revolutionary powers, become an early investor in the project. It’s currently in presale ($8.6M+ raised), and each token is selling for just $0.0037515. Check out our guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe for more info. 3. Turbo ($TURBO) – Trending Meme Coin Created by GPT-4 Turbo ($TURBO) has been one of the most successful meme coins in recent times. Even though $TURBO launched in 2023, it didn’t gain much attention until June 2024. After a ferocious rally that lasted till January, the token saw a steep decline. Now, however, it’s one of the top trending cryptos . $TURBO is up over 200% in the last month and a total of 860% in the last year. Moreover, with a current price of just $0.005199 , $TURBO could be a great purchase if you want to ride the Bitcoin-led crypto wave. It’s worth noting that $TURBO is considered the first meme coin to be completely created by AI (GPT-4, to be precise). Similar to the best meme coins , $TURBO, too, runs on community hype and virality. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Despite Bitcoin’s potential to send the crypto market in an upward spiral, let’s not forget just how volatile the instrument can be. It also means that your investments in crypto aren’t guaranteed to fetch you the desired returns if market conditions aren’t favorable. We suggest investing only a small amount and always doing your own research before diving into crypto.

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops , each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how tokens are brought to the market. The sealed-bid token launch is a growing trend in this crypto fundraising landscape. Unlike public presales or airdrops, where participants see pricing or allocation terms in advance, sealed-bid models keep each bid confidential until the process ends. This approach is increasingly favored for enabling better price discovery, limiting front-running and curbing manipulation , especially for in-demand tokens. Did you know? Sealed-bid auctions are a crypto twist on traditional finance. They have been used for government bond sales and initial public offerings (IPOs). Now they are redefining token launches by hiding bidder-related information and transparency. Sealed-bid token launch, explained A sealed-bid token launch is a method of distributing cryptocurrency tokens where participants submit private bids without knowing what others are offering. This approach, derived from traditional sealed-bid auctions, involves participants offering secret bids, and the highest bidder typically wins. Auction systems, such as sealed-bid launches, are increasingly built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, using privacy-enhancing technologies such as Zama’s fhEVM (fully homomorphic Ethereum Virtual Machine) to ensure confidentiality and fairness. Unlike open auctions, where public visibility can escalate prices through bidding wars, sealed-bid formats prevent strategic bidding based on competitors’ actions. In crypto, a sealed-bid token launch leads to fair and transparent token allocation, minimizing price manipulation and front-running. Systems enforce a single bid per participant by leveraging cryptographic techniques like commitments and smart contract logic to prevent multiple bids and enforce payment obligations. Each participant specifies desired token quantities and prices. After the bidding window closes, bids are revealed and assessed using predefined rules, like clearing prices or allocation tiers. This method often reduces bot interference and promotes equitable access during high-demand launches. A key feature of a sealed-bid token launch is its “one-shot” bidding process. Bidders cannot revise their offers or view others’ bids beforehand, which sets up a level playing field. However, it also brings in strategic uncertainty, as participants must estimate optimal bids without cues about other bids. In April 2024, Conor McGregor fundraised for his memecoin REAL using a sealed-bid launch. The mixed martial arts icon introduced the fundraising through a sealed-bid token auction to prevent bots and snipers from manipulating the sale. The project hoped to promote transparency and integrity in a space often plagued by front-running and rug pulls . While the project didn’t disclose token lock-up details, the sealed-bid format and focus on long-term engagement suggest a strategic attempt to execute a transparent and more community-driven launch. How do sealed-bid token launches work? Sealed-bid token launches follow a structured process that minimizes the chances of manipulation and ensures transparency. Here is how the process usually unfolds: Step 1 (Project announcement): The crypto project typically announces the sealed-bid token sale through its official website, social media channels like X, or platforms like Binance Launchpad. It outlines details such as the number of tokens available, bidding timeline, minimum and maximum bid limits, and the process of token allocation. Step 2 (Private bid submission): Participants submit bids to an auctioneer on the platform by providing secret bids before a deadline. Each bid includes the desired token quantity and the offered price. Participants cannot view other bids, ensuring privacy and reducing strategic manipulation. Step 3 (Bid locking): Once submitted, all bids are locked. This prevents users from changing or withdrawing their bids, reinforcing transparency. Step 4 (Token allocation): Post deadline, the smart contract processes all bids. Tokens are distributed either to the highest bidders or through a pricing model like a clearing price or a tiered allocation. Lower bids may receive a partial allocation or a refund. In McGregor’s fundraising, participants submitted private bids in USDC ( USDC ) during a limited 28-hour window without knowing what others were offering. Once the auction closed, bids were ranked, and tokens were allocated to the highest bidders until the supply ran out. Such auction systems function on a smart contract that ranks all offers, calculates the cutoff price, and allocates tokens to qualifying bidders. Excess funds are refunded automatically. This onchain process eliminates the need for intermediaries, offering immutability and trustless execution. Advantages of sealed-bid token launches Sealed-bid token launches offer an alternative to other models of token sales. This format has gained popularity in crypto, thanks to its potential to create more balanced token distribution and pricing. Transparency: While individual bids remain hidden during the process, all bids and allocations are revealed after the deadline via smart contracts. This ensures onchain verifiability and trust. Reduces gas wars and front-running: Unlike first-come-first-served launches where users race to submit transactions, sealed bids are submitted over a set period. It reduces congestion and the risk of bots exploiting faster access. Encourages fairer price discovery: Since bids are placed without seeing other offers, participants bid based on perceived token value. This mechanism leads to a more organic price that reflects market demand rather than hype or manipulation. Minimizes whale dominance: Sealed bids make it harder for large players to take tokens by simply outbidding small participants in real-time. Prevents manipulation: By removing live price visibility, sealed-bid launches reduce the chances of orchestrated pump-and-dump behavior . It discourages collusion of bidders or biased decisions on the part of the project. Did you know? Sealed-bid launches may evolve with decentralized identity tools. A world might emerge where only verified wallets can bid — combining privacy , fairness and compliance in one go. Risks and limitations of sealed-bid tokens Although sealed-bid token launches introduce a range of benefits, they also entail various risks and compromises. These issues can affect both project teams and participants: Opacity at the initial stage: Since bids remain confidential until the sale concludes, some users might feel lost, unaware of what other people are bidding. Complexity: Sealed-bid auctions can be complex and less transparent to average investors. This complexity may deter participation, especially from those unfamiliar with such mechanisms. Less suitable for small-cap projects: Small-cap projects generally lack an established community. Moreover, small-cap projects rely on viral marketing and word-of-mouth to gain traction, but the closed environment of sealed-bid auctions can dampen momentum. Blockchain-specific risks: As the whole process is executed onchain by a smart contract, blockchain-specific risks such as malfunctioning code and an attacker breaching the network are always present. Risk of underfunding: If the project doesn’t attract enough competitive bids, which is common with lesser-known tokens, it may fall short of funding goals. McGregor’s REAL could raise only 39% of its target. The REAL memecoin, backed by McGregor and launched through a sealed-bid auction, failed to meet its fundraising target, securing only $392,315 — approximately 39% of its $1.008 million goal. Several external factors played a significant role in this outcome. Several external factors contributed significantly to this outcome. Chief among them was the broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which coincided with the token’s launch and led to a generally risk-averse investment environment. This was compounded by growing skepticism toward memecoins, as investors became increasingly wary following a series of high-profile scams and failed projects in the space. The celebrity endorsement, while attention-grabbing, may have also backfired — many investors viewed McGregor’s involvement as superficial and questioned the project’s long-term credibility. Additionally, the token’s design raised red flags, particularly its 12-hour unlock window, which resembled patterns seen in pump-and-dump schemes. A lack of transparent communication and insufficient community engagement further weakened investor confidence. While the sealed-bid auction format is designed to ensure fairness and reduce manipulation, its complexity may have posed a barrier to broader participation, particularly among retail investors unfamiliar with the mechanism. Use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto and future potential Sealed-bid token launches offer a unique approach to fair token distribution. These launches are gaining attention as an alternative to traditional public sales or airdrops. Their design ensures privacy and minimizes manipulation during high-demand token sales. Here are some prominent use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto that reflect their future potential: DAO fundraising and decentralized launchpads: Sealed bids can enhance transparency in fundraising campaigns by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) , thus boosting their credibility. The sealed-bid format reduces front-running and increases trust. Future decentralized launchpads may adopt similar systems to build credibility and avoid hype-driven token launches. KYC and identity integration: As compliance becomes more critical, sealed-bid systems could integrate with Know Your Customer (KYC) or digital identity verification layers. This would allow only verified participants to bid, reducing Sybil attacks and increasing regulatory confidence. Such integration could attract institutional investors and expand access to compliant, fair token sales. Effective for scarce supply tokens: Sealed-bid auctions are most effective when distributing tokens with limited supply . By hiding bid amounts until the auction ends, this method encourages genuine price discovery and prevents bots or whales from dominating the sale. As the crypto space matures, sealed-bid launches may become a standard for transparent and inclusive fundraising.",sealed-bid token launch,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-03 13:15:00

The bill was approved with a 71 to 44 vote. This result places North Carolina second to Arizona in fully approving a crypto law. The states in America are currently voting on whether public funds should be allocated to crypto reserves. Having passed the House in North Carolina, the bill will now move to the Senate for another vote. The House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act, also called House Bill 92. The bill allows for up to 5% of public funds. The allocation further requires that a third party ascertains whether the investment meets standards regarding secure custody, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance. The House also passed the State Investment Modernization Act, House Bill 506, with a vote of 110 to 3. The bill proposes a new North Carolina Investment Authority (NCIA) to take over the treasury’s responsibilities. The NCIA would decide which crypto investments to make, given that the third-party regulator approves. House Bill 92, however, was initially capped at 10% investment for cryptocurrency. The current amendment of the bill has cut that allocation in half. Many politicians who oppose the bill suggest that the allocation will gamble away the state retirement funds. It has been suggested that legislators invest their money in crypto and leave taxpayers to make their own investment decisions. At one stage during the debate, Democrat Marcia Morey held up a printed picture of a Bored Ape NFT that Justin Bieber bought for $1.3 million, which inevitably lost 95% of its value. It was made clear that many risks inherent to digital assets should be considered. However, despite these elaborate protestations, the House passed the bill, albeit with safeguards limiting the amount of risk exposure to public funds. State workers, moreover, raised complaints about the crypto investments, such as Flint Benson from the State Employees of North Carolina, who objected that Bitcoin’s volatility could put state pensions at risk. This seemed to be the main issue that concerned dissenters in the debate, that crypto could be an insecure and risky bet of public funds. The House Bill 92, therefore, introduced many safeguards to assure the public that the state government was not taking unnecessary risks. Some examples of safeguards, contained in the bill, include the requirement of monthly independent audits and a two-thirds majority to decide emergency spending of the reserves. Arizona, meanwhile, is the leader in the race to pass new crypto laws regarding reserve treasuries. However, Arizona has passed a bill that allows up to 10% of public funds to be allocated to crypto investments, which is quite a hefty investment for a state treasury. North Carolina still requires a Senate vote to pass the new laws. The latest development of crypto treasuries could affect the underfunded public pension system, which is facing its problems. Regardless of the outcome, North Carolina has become a leader, next to Arizona, regarding crypto adoption at the state level.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-03 13:16:42

The trading halt will officially begin on May 16, 2025, at around 2 PM ET across all Coinbase platforms, Coinbase.com, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. Why These Tokens Are Being Delisted According to Coinbase , this decision isn’t about poor performance or security issues. Instead, it has to do with token versions. Each of these projects, GAL, LIT, DAR, ORN, and PRQ, has released new versions of their tokens. That means the original versions listed on Coinbase are now considered outdated and no longer meet the platform’s listing standards. Coinbase cares a lot about keeping things safe, reliable, and clear for its users. When tokens go through major upgrades or migrate to new contracts, the old ones can cause problems or stop working well. That’s why Coinbase is removing these older tokens from trading. Trading Already in Limit-Only Mode To ease the transition, Coinbase has already moved all five token pairs to limit-only mode. This means users can still place or cancel limit orders, and trades may happen, but no market orders or advanced trading types are currently supported. It’s a heads-up to the community, get your affairs in order before full suspension takes effect. What Happens to Users Holding These Tokens?

The Australian regulator responsible for such oversight is the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Many registered Digital Currency Exchanges (DCEs) appear to be inactive. AUSTRAC has warned the inactive exchanges to either update their details or be removed from the list. AUSTRAC announced the plan on its government website, stating that many DCEs were inactive out of the 427 registered businesses. AUSTRAC offered them the opportunity to withdraw or face cancellation voluntarily. They reasoned that scammers could use inactive DCEs to commit crimes such as money laundering. They further warned that DCEs must remain up-to-date in their registration process. AUSTRAC then promised that a public list of registered DCEs would be created to help consumers avoid scams. Brendan Thomas, CEO of AUSTRAC, pointed out that businesses must update their details as part of the registration process. He warned DCEs that if they didn’t update their details, they would face cancellation. He said that consumer confidence was very important and that he was trying to prevent people from improperly selling or using DCEs. He said that there were good enough grounds to cancel a registration if the business showed signs of not operating. AUSTRAC is responsible for analysing business intelligence so that scammers are less prevalent in Australia. The agency believes digital assets are a high-risk market and, therefore, focuses a lot of attention on them. AUSTRAC has identified what it thinks is a risk of inactive DCEs being exploited by criminals. AUSTRAC has noticed an alarming increase in crypto scams, prompting more actions to prevent a disaster from happening. Australian businesses that wish to provide conversions between cash and crypto must register with AUSTRAC. The agency monitors these DCEs to detect money laundering, tax evasion, and terror financing. AUSTRAC can delist any of these businesses if a problem is identified. The announcement suggests that AUSTRAC is taking preventative measures before a crime occurs. Inactive DCEs could be exploited by scammers, pretending that the registered business belongs to them, when it is inactive. AUSTRAC has deregistered 10 firms since 2019, including FTX Express in June 2024.

Logistics firm earmarks $20m for Trump memecoin,https://crypto.news/trump-memecoin-freight-technologies-invest-20-million/,"A publicly-traded logistics firm has struck a $20 million deal with an institutional investor to purchase Official Trump memecoins, becoming one of the first companies to anchor its digital asset strategy around the U.S. president’s controversial crypto business. Freight Technologies CEO Javier Selgas pitched the move as part of an effort to grow U.S.-Mexico commerce—though how a memecoin fits into supply chains remains unclear. The investment also comes as the U.S. Office of Government Ethics examines whether President Donald Trump violates federal ethics rules by offering exclusive access to his coin’s top investors. What Is Fr8Tech? Freight Technologies, which refers to itself as Fr8Tech, is a Houston-based company launched in 2015 and trades on NASDAQ. The company aims to use new technologies like artificial intelligence for the optimization of the supply chain processes. The company’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker FRGT, saw its price plummet back in 2018, during Trump’s first term. Like many other companies , Freight Technologies is now moving forward with a digital asset reserve, deviating from the norm of making Bitcoin ( BTC ) the primary asset and embracing a memecoin instead. Social media influence and crypto commentator Mario Nawfal called it the “first-ever” Trump treasury. No major headlines yet, but $FRGT’s move to back a treasury with $TRUMP is catching CT’s eye—social buzz around $TRUMP is strong, even while the token’s price action is cooling and trading shows short-term downside risk. $FRGT is still under the radar, with little volume or data… — Alva (@AlvaApp) April 30, 2025 Costly gimmick? On April 30, Freight Technologies announced the creation of a crypto treasury. The company agreed to issue convertible notes worth up to $20 million with an institutional investor. The capital is secured exclusively for buying Official Trump ( TRUMP ) tokens. The first tranche will amount to $1 million. Selgas, in a prepared statement, referenced Trump’s “America First” principle and tied it to trade efforts between Mexico and the U.S. See below: At the heart of Fr8Tech’s mission is the promotion of productive and active commerce between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is the United States’ top goods trading partner, with Mexico being the leading destination for US exports and the top source for US imports. As US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently stated, “I wish to be clear: America First does not mean America alone. To the contrary, it is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners.” Buying TRUMP is outlined as “an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the U.S..” Still, the company doesn’t elaborate on how a Trump memecoin acquisition will help trade between the two countries or warn readers about the possible risks. After all, the Trump token — like most memecoins — is highly volatile. Although its price has been up roughly 2% in the past 24 hours, it’s been on a downward trajectory since its launch in January. Source: CoinGecko Trump memecoin a strange choice As corporate crypto treasuries become trendy, big-name firms like BlackRock recommend allocating up to 2% of corporate assets in Bitcoin. They argue that BTC is a better store of value than most other digital assets. According to the Bitcoin Treasuries website, 101 public companies hold Bitcoin. Considering Bitcoin’s deflationary design and long-term value appreciation, which have been demonstrated throughout its 15-year history, it’s understandable why some companies may choose Bitcoin as one of their corporate assets. So far, Official Trump has no use case other than incentivizing investors to buy more to be invited to a private dinner with Trump on May 22. $TRUMP saw its value spike over 50% following the promotion. Critics also warn that the “pay to play” aspect of Official Trump raises ethics concerns and could even be used as a bribery tool. “Something that hasn’t been much discussed — creating a bunch of personal memecoins opens the door to secretive foreign buyers trying to curry influence with our leaders,” Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures said on X back in January. “If you hated Hunter Biden’s anonymous art sales, you should hate this too.” Something that hasn’t been much discussed – creating a bunch of personal memecoins opens the door to secretive foreign buyers trying to curry influence with our leaders. If you hated hunter biden’s anonymous art sales, you should hate this too. — nic carter (@nic__carter) January 20, 2025 Last month, Democratic Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren called for a federal ethics investigation into Trump’s promotion of the coin. In a letter to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, the senators allege that Trump may have violated federal ethics rules by offering access to his administration in exchange for financial investment. Freight Technologies has not indicated that it seeks access to the White House by holding Trump memecoins. In the days following the company’s announcement, the FRGT stock price grew 111.21% on May 2. The stock closed Friday at $2.08 per share. The Trump memecoin price seems unaffected by the news.

Bubbles make sense when they burst, so it’s premature to state that corporate crypto treasuries are the bubble. However, some observers feel that a sudden spike of interest in crypto among public companies draws comparisons with the dot-com bubble. Worth reminding the only *real* public companies that have adopted bitcoin as a corporate treasury are $TSLA , $COIN and $XYZ Everybody else sits somewhere on the spectrum between Charles Ponzi and https://t.co/3CghbTay3b — Pledditor (@Pledditor) May 2, 2025 If we look closely, we will see that it’s early to speak about a strong trend or any notable crypto fever among public companies. As more companies acquire Bitcoin, most are relatively small companies that spend humble amounts on it. Strategy, a company holding over 500,000 bitcoins, started to accumulate BTC in 2020. Tesla made a Bitcoin investment in 2021, driving the asset’s price. Strategy became the dominant Bitcoin buyer among public companies. The rest of the public companies hold smaller BTC bags—no need to panic. As for the Fr8Tech news, the company currently has the financing “earmarked” for purchasing Official Trump, so we’ll see what happens when the purchase is officially made. It’s also not the only token sparking the company’s interest. Earlier in April, Fr8Tech disclosed an acquisition of $5.2 million of FET Tokens from Fetch Compute, Inc. in exchange for over 2.3 million shares.

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 82,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is demonstrating strong bullish momentum on the daily time chart. “Bitcoin not giving up any of the pumps. We pump up, we go sideways, we pump up, we go sideways. And now pumping up again. It’s looking really good.” Svenson also says that Bitcoin has confirmed a breakout on the four-hour chart and is poised to go higher based on signals from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators. The RSI is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions, while the MACD is used to determine the direction, momentum and duration of a trend or to identify potential buy and sell signals. “Bitcoin also broke the four-hour RSI resistance. And the MACD on the four-hour has flipped to the bullish side. So there are multiple things leading us to believe that there could be continuation on this move.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube According to the analyst and trader, the breakout could see Bitcoin reach a price of around $100,000. Svenson, however, warns that Bitcoin faces a downside risk and could undergo a correction before proceeding higher. “I don’t want to discount the possibility that Bitcoin after hitting our upside target, you know, maybe there’s some kind of retrace into this zone [below $90,000] before continuation. The market is always crazy, it’s always volatile.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $97,067 at time of writing.

With price forecasts floating between cautious optimism and bold ambition, ADA remains a major player. But rising token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to stir whispers of an “ADA 2.0”, faster-moving, DeFi-ready, and primed for growth. Currently priced at just $0.025, this early-stage DeFi token has already attracted over 9,400 investors and raised more than $7.6 million in its presale, clear signs of strong market confidence. With Phase 4 already over 50% sold, the price is set to increase 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5, with a projected launch price of $0.06, offering early investors up to 140% potential returns. Can ADA hold the throne through 2025—or is a successor emerging? Cardano (ADA) stands as a deliberate blockchain entry in the digital currency market and analysts forecast its December 2025 value to extend between $1.50 and a potentially high $2.95 based on development improvements and market sentiment. Several investors show impatience regarding ADA’s gradual progress because newer altcoins seem to outpace it even though its academic framework combined with developer strength maintains investors’ trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents an alleged upgrade to ADA 2.0 with silently increasing market momentum. The birth of a new DeFi frontier Mutuum Finance is not just another DeFi project, it’s an innovative platform with innovative crypto lending solutions that bridge Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. With the combined paradigm, they offer both flexibility and security: P2C Lending: Users can earn passive income by supplying stablecoins like USDT to smart contract-powered liquidity pools. P2P Lending: Direct, decentralized interactions between users cut out middlemen and maximize ownership control. Together, these models position Mutuum Finance as a next-generation platform, designed to be utilized in the real world and DeFi innovation. A Certik audit is also underway, providing additional transparency and investor confidence as the platform grows. Gamified growth & community incentives Mutuum Finance is also growing a strong, engaged community with its gamified leaderboard, which ranks the top 50 token holders and will give them bonus MUTM tokens as a reward. In an effort to stimulate more engagement, the platform has launched a $100,000 giveaway, divided into 10 prizes of $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Its referral program is yet another layer of growth, building out the ecosystem while rewarding loyal fans. Why investors are paying attention Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the most-watched presales in the DeFi market. As the token price rises and the platform prepares for a full-scale launch, early investors have a unique window to join what could be the next breakout star in decentralized lending. With Cardano (ADA) potentially reaching between $1.50 and $2.95 by December 2025, many investors still see it as a solid long-term bet, but rising performers like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are beginning to shift the narrative. Positioned as a faster, DeFi-ready alternative, MUTM has already raised over $7.6 million from nearly 9,400 early adopters, thanks to its dual lending model, community rewards, and real-world utility. With Phase 4 more than 50% sold out and a 20% price jump ahead in Phase 5, those getting in at $0.025 could lock in up to 140% ROI before launch. Momentum is building, and the window is narrowing fast, Mutuum Finance isn’t just an alternative to ADA, it’s shaping up to be the evolution. If you’re looking for the next big mover, the time to act is now, before the next price surge leaves you behind.

He wrote, “Buy $XRP NOW. Something HUGE is coming.” Though the post lacks explicit detail, it aligns with a growing speculation regarding political and institutional developments that could significantly impact the value and trajectory of XRP. The timing of the statement coincides with multiple reports and analyses that forecast a transformative period for the digital asset. Buy $XRP NOW. Something HUGE is coming. — Amonyx (@amonbuy) April 30, 2025 Trump’s 2025 Tax Plan Proposal and Its Possible Impact on XRP A key element underpinning this renewed optimism comes from a theory reported by Times Tabloid, originating from crypto commentator All Things XRP. This theory ties the future performance of XRP to proposed U.S. tax reforms that could be introduced by President Donald Trump in 2025. Central to the claim is a policy proposal to eliminate federal income taxes for individuals under $200,000 a year. If the policy is implemented, it would affect an estimated 90% of American workers and could have wide-reaching implications for consumer behavior and investment trends. According to the theory, such a tax overhaul could significantly increase disposable income for millions of Americans. The logic follows that with fewer tax burdens, individuals would have greater flexibility in deploying their capital, potentially accelerating the adoption of digital assets like XRP. The hypothesis is grounded in the expectation that increased liquidity among retail investors may translate into higher levels of speculative investment, thereby benefiting the cryptocurrency sector more broadly. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Pending XRP ETFs Signal Institutional Momentum In parallel with political speculation, institutional developments concerning XRP help prominence. According to another report from Times Tabloid , prominent cryptocurrency figure Crypto Eri recently highlighted the status of several pending applications for spot XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. In her update, she listed seven ETF filings under regulatory review, with anticipated decision windows extending from May to October 2025. The entities involved in these filings include Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares Core, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton. Approval of any of these ETFs would mark a significant milestone for XRP, potentially granting the asset a new layer of institutional legitimacy and opening the door to broader investor participation. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to issue formal decisions on these applications, multiple filings from recognized financial firms have boosted expectations of eventual approval. Combined Factors Reinforce Amonyx’s Call to Action Amonyx’s directive to “Buy $XRP NOW” appears to be informed by a confluence of factors, including the potential for radical tax reform and the growing likelihood of regulatory advancement in the form of ETF approval. Though no official announcement has yet confirmed the precise nature of the “HUGE” event alluded to by Amonyx, recent narratives from credible sources provide a basis for the influencer’s assertive stance. As both political and financial landscapes evolve, XRP remains under close observation by market participants for its next growth.

This index, widely used to gauge emotional sentiment in the crypto space, helps traders assess the overall mood of the market. An upward shift often correlates with stronger buying interest and a more bullish outlook. At the same time, Bitcoin has broken past the $94,000 resistance level and is heading toward its all-time high. Historically, moments like this mark the beginning of altcoin season , as liquidity begins shifting from BTC into the broader altcoin market. During these cycles, memecoins have repeatedly delivered some of the biggest gains , often outperforming more established tokens. As momentum builds, the stage may be set for another wave of explosive growth across the crypto space, especially among meme-driven and community-fueled projects. A fresh contender for the next 1000x token of 2025 is quickly emerging as the altcoin market gains steam ahead of its next major surge. SOLAXY aims to enhance Solana’s blockchain performance Solaxy is entering the spotlight with a plan to solve some of Solana’s most critical issues, including congestion, low transaction speed, and scalability problems. Its roadmap is centered around delivering higher efficiency and long-term reliability for developers and users alike. While the technical foundation of Solaxy is attracting infrastructure-focused investors, another rising project is gaining traction thanks to its blend of story, community, and real utility, and that’s Pepeto. PEPETO builds momentum as a utility-driven memecoin with early investor appeal At a current presale price of just $0.000000126, Pepeto gives investors a chance to get in at the ground level. With the upcoming launch of PepetoSwap, a zero-fee trading platform, and the Pepeto Exchange, the project is positioning itself to deliver more than just meme value, it’s aiming to create a sustainable crypto ecosystem. Part of what makes Pepeto stand out is its narrative. With a 420 trillion token supply identical to Pepe’s, rumors continue to circulate that someone connected to the original project may be involved. In Pepeto’s backstory, Pepe managed to grab four of the key documents needed to launch a memecoin, but left behind two critical elements: Technology and Optimization. Pepeto, symbolizing Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, kept the full formula. Pepe may have believed he took everything that mattered, but the most essential ingredients were left behind. PEPETO presale closes soon with listings on the way Investors can still purchase $PEPETO tokens at the presale price of $0.000000126 through the official website, pepeto.io. Supported payment methods include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card via MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

Critics warned that Bitcoin’s volatility posed a financial risk to Arizona’s stability. Despite setbacks, over 35 digital asset reserve bills remain active across the U.S. Arizona failed to lead U.S. states by establishing official Bitcoin holdings as part of its reserve assets. Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed the Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill because she considered Bitcoin an untested investment. The state House approved this bill on April 28 to permit state officials to use seized funds for Bitcoin investments. The proposed legislation created a management system for the Bitcoin reserve under state administrators. According to an under-development measure, the state treasurer could get authority to put 10% of Arizona’s rainy-day funds into digital assets. A companion bill still requires approval before it can become official legislation. Advocates of the bill contended that Arizona would set an example in digital asset regulations through its adoption.

44108863,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65981,1746280777,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Meeting Between Ripple Chairman and New SEC Chair: Ex-SEC Lawyer States Key Point,https://timestabloid.com/meeting-between-ripple-chairman-and-new-sec-chair-ex-sec-lawyer-states-key-point/,"Ripple’s Executive Chairman and co-founder, Chris Larsen, recently met with newly appointed U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins in a closed-door session that immediately sparked widespread attention across the XRP community. The highly anticipated meeting has fueled speculation about a possible resolution to the years-long legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC. However, former SEC Regional Director and legal expert Marc Fagel has reiterated that such a meeting cannot bring about a judicial conclusion in an ongoing federal case. The buzz originated from the XRP community on X, where prominent users posed the question of whether this historic meeting could finally signal the end of the lawsuit that has gripped the crypto industry since 2020. In response to a post by Digital Assets Daily asking, “Will this meeting finally bring to an end the SEC vs Ripple Labs, Inc. case…..”, Marc Fagel issued a firm rebuttal: “No. That’s not how this works.” When another user, XRP SCOTT, replied with a touch of sarcasm—“Well, thanks for telling everyone how it does work”—Fagel elaborated : “Happy to walk you through it. But it’s not like the SEC Chair can meet with the defendant in a case and resolve it at the meeting.” Happy to walk you through it. But it’s not like the SEC Chair can meet with the defendant in a case and resolve it at the meeting. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) May 3, 2025 Why the Meeting Doesn’t Affect the Court Case Fagel’s comments provide critical clarity. While the SEC Chair plays a significant role in setting regulatory policy and priorities, the Chair does not preside over enforcement litigation. The ongoing case between Ripple and the SEC remains under the jurisdiction of Judge Analisa Torres in the Southern District of New York, and it is managed by the Commission’s Enforcement Division, not by its leadership. This means that despite the optics of Larsen meeting with Atkins, the legal outcome of the SEC v. Ripple Labs case cannot be settled in private discussions. Any resolution must occur through formal legal channels, including court motions, hearings, and potential settlement agreements filed with the court. Background on the SEC v. Ripple Labs Case The SEC filed suit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleging that its sale of XRP to institutional investors violated securities laws by constituting an unregistered offering. In July 2023, Judge Torres issued a pivotal ruling: XRP itself was not deemed a security when sold on public exchanges to retail holders. However, she also concluded that Ripple had violated securities laws in its institutional sales of XRP, leaving the case partially unresolved. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s legal team and executives have continued to engage regulators in parallel with courtroom developments, hoping to shape broader policy frameworks for digital assets in the U.S. What the Meeting Could Mean for Crypto Regulation Though the meeting cannot alter the trajectory of the court case, it may signal an openness to dialogue and potential shifts in how the SEC approaches crypto enforcement moving forward. Chair Paul Atkins is widely seen as more crypto-curious and market-friendly than his predecessor, which has raised hopes that the agency under his leadership may seek a more balanced stance on blockchain innovation. Still, as Fagel emphasized, any optimism must be tempered with an understanding of legal boundaries. The XRP community may be eager for closure, but legal processes are defined by judicial protocols, not informal meetings. The May 2 meeting between Ripple’s Chris Larsen and SEC Chair Paul Atkins marks a significant moment for crypto-regulatory relations in the U.S. However, as former SEC official Marc Fagel has emphasized, it does not alter the status of Ripple’s court battle with the SEC. The road to a final resolution remains within the judiciary, not in the corridors of Washington. As such, while the meeting may influence the broader direction of U.S. crypto policy, the case’s resolution is still pending the court’s due process.

44108981,https://cointelegraph.com/news/zora-airdrop-whats-next-web3-creator-economy,1746280800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,"After Zora airdrop goes awry, what’s next for Web3 creator economy?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/zora-airdrop-whats-next-web3-creator-economy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Onchain social network Zora has built a reputation as a popular tool for artists, musicians and other creatives to monetize their content onchain, but the recent launch of its eponymous ZORA token has left many users confused and dissatisfied. The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain. With creators and builders shifting focus and NFTs no longer selling like they used to, does the ZORA token drop symbolize the end of the creator-driven NFT model? Maybe not, but many creatives are changing their perspectives and the role blockchain should play in the creator economy. ZORA token launch and airdrop go awry The ZORA token launched on April 23, and it quickly became a point of controversy among users. To start, Zora did not officially announce that it had gone live until two hours after it was already trading, leading to confusion on social media. Source: ZachXBT The token’s price quickly fell by over 50% within those roughly two hours, from $0.037 to $0.017, adding to users’ complaints. It has since fallen even further, sitting around $0.013 at the time of writing. ZORA’s tokenomics also became a point of contention. 45% of the supply is reserved for the team and investors, while 25% is for the treasury — leaving 20% for community incentives and just 10% for the user airdrop. This led some to complain that the project was keeping too much for itself. Others disliked its general lack of utility. Zora repeatedly stated that the token “is for fun only and does not entitle its holders to any governance rights or a claim on any equity ownership in Zora or its products.” But the project seemed to respond to this criticism on May 1 by announcing that ZORA would have some additional functionalities within the network. However, many others came to the defense of the project, saying that sharing on the platform has been financially lucrative. Others were simply thankful they received anything at all. Source: Wbnns Singer Vérité, who has racked up hundreds of millions of streams as an independent artist and was an early adopter of Web3 tech , told Cointelegraph that “on a base level, I’m appreciative of being rewarded for participating in something early.” She said that while she doesn’t know the team very well, “I feel like they are genuinely trying to construct new models for valuing digital artifacts and have built an aesthetic and culture around their brand in juxtaposition to what are usually awful crypto vibes.” Source: Vérité NFTs no longer the top of the creator food chain Zora’s token launch was the latest move in a broader shift away from the traditional NFT model for creators, in this case toward embracing the cultural dominance of memecoins. While posts on Zora used to be minted as NFTs, now each post creates an instantly tradeable memecoin, also known as a “content coin.” Creators are given 1% of the supply and earn 50% of the trading and liquidity provider fees. Source: Zora While the move from NFTs to content coins was itself controversial, it represents a shift to a new class of creators, according to Adam Levy, host of the Mint podcast and founder of Blueprint, which helps creators go viral onchain. He told Cointelegraph that the wild success of memecoin launchpad Pump.fun “brought in a brand new class of creators that now Zora is trying to capitalize on.” I think the Pump.fun or coin-like model is a perfect token model for a new class of creators that are emerging just generally on the internet. I think it’s like the Gen Z brain rot type of creator that spends a lot of their time remixing content or trying to create viral content in terms of like memetic content. NFT sales remain way down compared to their 2021 peak, and many creators have simply left the NFT space due to its perceived shortcomings. Music-related NFTs , which used to be prevalent on platforms like Zora, have taken a particularly hard beating. Several builders of the most popular creator platforms have moved on to work on other projects. For instance, the team behind music NFT platform Sound.xyz has shifted its focus to a new platform called Vault, which still uses blockchain technology but keeps it hidden on the back end. In a February X post, Sound co-founder David Greenstein said a hyperfocus on speculation led to the decline in NFT interest. “Over time, it became less about the artist, the music, and real connection—and more about financial transactions,” he wrote. “When speculation cooled, so did the energy behind supporting artists.” This sentiment was echoed by Vérité, who said, “I don’t think digital artifacts will have lasting value outside of speculation, experience and patronage.” Related: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift According to music artist and builder Latashá, “We weren’t getting focused on culture; we were getting focused on speculation. And once the bear market hit, it really showcased that.” Latashá, who was previously head of community at Zora and is now building several blockchain-based platforms, told Cointelegraph that people also got too caught up in the language of Web3 instead of simply using the technology: The language and the jargon and even the communities that created that really kind of boxed themselves in when they only stay in that place, right? And so, I always knew that the language was going to change and that the crypto was going to become just the tool, as it should be. What’s next for the onchain creator economy? Despite the shift of interest away from NFTs toward things like memecoins, as encapsulated by Zora, many builders and creators still believe blockchain remains incredibly powerful — just that maybe it needs to be used in a different way. “I learned that you can’t force your idealism onto the world and into the market,” said Vérité. “I am less interested in making ‘Web3 tools’ work because they’re on the blockchain and more interested in finding new ways to solve problems that face artists, audiences and the systems that connect them, regardless of form.” “I definitely won’t sell NFTs to fans,” she added. Levy, on the other hand, remains firm in his belief in NFTs, specifically. “I still have endless conviction in what I’m doing,” he said. He pointed out that cryptocurrency overall, let alone NFTs, is still in the very early stages of adoption. “I think we all need to zoom out.” I don’t think it’s just a fad. I don’t think that this is going to disappear. And I don’t think that because I’ve tasted the sugar of what this is as a creator. [...] And I know there’s a better way to create content on the internet and to monetize on the internet. One notable shift has been to hide the blockchain elements and focus solely on user experience. For example, rap duo Run The Jewels has a fan club where members are rewarded with “JWL” points that can be used to unlock exclusive experiences. JWL is actually an onchain token, but that fact is buried in the club’s FAQ page . “We still need to come up with a better way of making crypto wallets accessible to people so that it is easier,” Renata Lowenbraun, CEO of independent music Web3 platform Infanity, told Cointelegraph. “The moment that happens, everything will change.” Lowenbraun compared blockchain to the internet, saying the internet took decades to truly catch on. NFTs, she argued, had a “false start” before the infrastructure had a chance to mature, “but it doesn’t mean it’s not going to stick and it’s not going to be around and it’s not going to have these amazing applications, particularly for creative people and creative ventures.” For Latashá, the future is in the hands of the artists themselves. “I think artists are just going to build their platforms. I think that’s going to be the future,” she said. From 2021 to 2024, we were really dependent on platforms. [...] And then we witnessed platforms kind of move like Web2 platforms, where they had so much ownership over our worlds and how we move that I think we finally all learned like, ‘Oh yeah, if this is really about building something different, it’s going to have to come from us.’ Whatever the future of the Web3 creator economy holds, it’s clear that it won’t be without road bumps along the way. But if the builders and artists are to be believed, the road bumps lie on the path toward greater artist independence.

Seeing Bitcoin get so close to this big number has sparked a feeling of ""euphoria"" – extreme optimism and excitement – among many investors. While the excitement brings opportunities, it also brings dangers, like getting caught up in the Fear Of Missing Out. It's crucial to stay smart and look for projects with real potential, not just those with soaring prices. Among the top coins getting attention, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out. As a project blending powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) with popular meme coin energy, it represents a most promising opportunity to potentially capture growth fueled by both technology trends and market excitement. Let's explore what this growing euphoria means, and discuss smart ways to invest when things get this exciting. Where the Weak see Fear, the Brave see Potential. 💥⚡ pic.twitter.com/7IL45Rh0S2 — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) April 30, 2025 The Euphoria as Bitcoin Nears the $100K Mark Bitcoin is leading the charge in this current wave of optimism. Recent price analysis shows BTC trading strongly, hovering near $95,000 - $96,000 and making pushes towards the psychologically important $100,000 level. It even surpassed its previous all-time high earlier in the year, reaching over $105,000 before pulling back. What's driving Bitcoin? Institutional Demand: As confirmed by BlackRock at TOKEN2049, big players like institutions and wealth managers are increasingly buying Bitcoin through regulated ETFs. This provides steady buying pressure. ETF Success: The spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves have been very successful, making it easy for more people and institutions to invest in BTC. BlackRock's IBIT ETF even won an award for ""Best New ETF."" Supply Scarcity Narrative: The Bitcoin halving event (which happened in 2024) cut the new supply of BTC in half. As demand potentially grows from ETFs while new supply is limited, basic economics suggests the price could rise. Best Crypto to Buy Now Amidst the Excitement When euphoria starts building and Bitcoin leads the charge, what is the best crypto to buy now? Should you pile into Bitcoin, look at major altcoins, or seek out newer projects with higher growth potential? Here is our top contender: Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): High Potential AI-Meme Coin During periods of high market excitement, coins that combine strong narratives with explosive potential often perform exceptionally well. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) fits this description perfectly, making it arguably one of the most promising cryptos to consider right now. It cleverly blends the powerful AI trend with the viral energy of meme coins, both narratives expected to be strong in 2025. While market euphoria can lift the spirits, $DAGZ has fundamentals that could help it sustain momentum: AI Utility: Its planned AI trading tools and analytics offer real substance beyond hype, appealing to investors looking for value in the hot AI crypto sector. Meme Virality: Its meme coin nature and focus on building the ""Dawgz Army"" community give it the potential to capture widespread attention and go viral during periods of high market excitement. Low Cap Potential: While the project is yet in its presale at a low price of $0.004,this gives it significantly more room for explosive percentage growth if it gains traction during a bull run. Staking Rewards & Audit: Attractive staking rewards encourage long-term holding, potentially reducing volatility, while its security audit from SolidProof adds a layer of trust. For investors looking for the best crypto to buy now that offers high-growth potential and aligns with key 2025 trends, Dawgz AI presents a compelling, higher-risk, higher-reward, opportunity compared to the established giants. Conclusion: Staying Grounded When Excitement Peaks The crypto market in May 2025, with Bitcoin challenging the $100K level and sentiment shifting towards ""Greed,"" is certainly exciting. This growing euphoria brings the potential for significant gains across the board, from established leaders to innovative altcoins. Finding the best crypto to buy now involves identifying projects well-positioned to benefit from this positive momentum. However, euphoria is also a time for maximum caution. The risk of buying near a market top or getting caught in FOMO-driven decisions is high. Sticking to sound strategies, focusing on fundamentally strong projects, and managing risk are more important than ever. While Bitcoin leads the charge, high-potential projects like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , which combine strong narratives like AI with real utility and community excitement, offer compelling opportunities for those willing to look beyond the obvious. As you navigate these exciting market conditions, remember to do your own research, stay grounded, and invest wisely. FAQ Section : With Bitcoin nearing $100K, is it too late to buy? While buying Bitcoin closer to $100K offers less upside potential than buying much lower, many analysts predict prices could go significantly higher long term ($150k, $200k, or more). However, the risk of a short-term pullback is also higher near major resistance levels; strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging might be sensible rather than making onelarge purchase. Consider fundamentally strong altcoins like Dawgz AI for potentially higher percentage gains. How can I avoid FOMO during market euphoria? Have a clear investment plan before euphoria hits, including entry and exit targets. Stick to your strategy and avoid making impulsive buys just because prices are rising fast. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals you understand, like Dawgz AI's AI utility, rather than just chasing green candles. What makes a project a good buy during euphoria? Projects like Dawgz AI that combine elements that thrive in euphoria (meme appeal, strong community, hot AI narrative) with underlying fundamentals (planned utility, audit, staking) are a good buy, just as every other project targeting some kind of real utility. What's the best investment strategy now – go all-in or wait? Going ""all-in"" during market euphoria is rarely advisable due to the high risk of buying near a top. A more prudent strategy might be Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into positions, diversifying across strong projects like BTC, ETH, and high-potential plays like Dawgz AI, and having a clear plan for taking profits or cutting losses.

Ripple has executed its routine monthly unlock of 1 billion XRP tokens from escrow for May, which could introduce fresh price swings for the cryptocurrency . On-chain data indicates that the unlock, involving XRP worth approximately $2.2 billion, occurred in three separate transactions on May 2. Ripple first unlocked 200 million XRP ($440.52 million) at 22:28 UTC to its Ripple (26) address. A minute later, it released another 300 million XRP ($660.86 million) to the same address. At 22:31 UTC, 500 million XRP ($1.1 billion) was unlocked to a separate address, Ripple (27). Ripple’s 500 XRP transaction. Source: WhaleAlert Despite the large volume, Ripple’s monthly 1 billion XRP unlock is part of a long-standing, scheduled strategy to manage supply with minimal historical market impact. Since 2017, Ripple has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to ensure transparency and predictability, addressing concerns over market flooding. Monthly, 1 billion XRP is released to support operations, ecosystem growth, and liquidity for ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) services. Typically, 700 to 800 million XRP is re-locked , with the rest used for expenses, institutional sales, or partnerships, maintaining a balance between liquidity and price stability. Ripple unlocks impact on XRP’s price Past unlocks have not consistently led to significant price drops. For instance, despite the previous unlock, XRP rallied, exiting its extended consolidation below the $2 mark. The price has mainly been influenced by other fundamentals surrounding the token, with the regularity outlook and broader market sentiment playing key roles. With the Ripple and SEC case nearing a conclusion, XRP has failed to make notable gains and is instead relying on general market sentiment and hype around the potential approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) in the U.S. Although the SEC has delayed its decision on the product, there is anticipation that the country might follow suit after Brazil unveiled the first spot XRP ETF , which has the potential to attract institutional investment. A regulatory decision is expected between June and mid-October this year. Despite these fundamentals, whales continue to show confidence in the asset, accumulating about 900 million XRP in April . XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.20, down less than 1% over the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the token is up about 0.2%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP is facing short-term bearishness, considering the asset’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) sits at $2.22, just above its current price. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $1.91 suggests a longer-term uptrend. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) at 55.17 remains neutral, showing no strong momentum in either direction.

Rexas Finance (RXS) , a rising token in the asset tokenization sector, is being compared to popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB). With a forecasted 17,358% price increase by a top crypto millionaire, Rexas Finance is gaining strong momentum ahead of its token launch. Rexas Finance Gains Support from Analysts and Investors Rexas Finance is building interest as it approaches the final phase of its presale. It has raised over $47.5 million from 457 million tokens sold. Early investors have seen the token rise from $0.03 to $0.20, showing steady growth and attracting attention from retail buyers. The project’s confirmed listing on three top exchanges and a $0.25 launch price are adding to the growing anticipation. According to a prominent crypto millionaire, RXS may increase by up to 17,358% in 2025, driven by its asset tokenization model. Utility-Driven Model Attracts Broader Market Rexas Finance connects blockchain with real-world assets like real estate, intellectual property, and commodities. This approach supports fractional ownership, helping more investors access high-value assets without full upfront costs. Its ecosystem includes tools like the Rexas Token Builder and the Rexas Launchpad. These features allow secure, no-code token creation and support multi-chain token sales, which improve accessibility and trading efficiency. Shiba Inu Faces Slower Growth Shiba Inu rose to fame during the meme coin rally in 2021, but current market data shows a slowdown. At a price of $0.00001257, SHIB is still far from previous highs. While the community continues to support the project, recent efforts have not led to major gains. The launch of Shibarium and token burns have been introduced, yet SHIB's recovery has been limited. Investors now seem to prefer projects with broader use and clear revenue models, reducing dependence on viral trends. Global Outreach and Campaign Success Rexas Finance is promoting awareness through a $1 million giveaway, offering $50,000 in rewards to 20 winners. The campaign has received over 1.4 million entries, encouraging both engagement and retail participation. RXS has also launched referral rewards and bonus tokens for presale buyers. This approach has improved organic growth while also strengthening trust in the project. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have expanded its visibility across international markets. Conclusion With confirmed exchange listings, presale performance, and growing demand for real-world asset tokenization, Rexas Finance is building market attention. In contrast, Shiba Inu faces challenges in maintaining its previous momentum. As 2025 approaches, the forecasted 17,358% growth projection for RXS continues to attract investors seeking utility and structured value in the crypto space.

According to the team's report, the applicant immediately seemed suspicious. He joined the first online interview under a name different from the one on his resume, but quickly changed it. During the conversation, the candidate ”periodically changed intonation” as if someone was giving him instructions in real time. Industry partners warned the company about the likelihood of encountering a spy among potential employees and provided a list of email addresses linked to a group of North Korean hackers. A Kraken candidate used one of the listed addresses when applying. Exchange specialists initiated an investigation that revealed a network of fake identities and aliases under which the hacker tried to get a job in companies in the crypto industry and other sectors. In some cases, the attacker managed to get the desired position. Upon closer examination, experts discovered the hacker's attempts to hide his location and forged documents with other people's data. The team put the spy candidate through several rounds of interviews and background checks to gain insight into his identity and tactics. In the final online meeting, the hacker was asked to show his ID and recommend establishments in the city where he supposedly resides. These routine checks took the applicant by surprise, and he was unable to provide convincing answers. ”Don’t trust, verify. This core crypto principle is more relevant than ever in the digital age. State-sponsored attacks aren’t just a crypto, or U.S. corporate, issue – they’re a global threat. Any individual or business handling value is a target, and resilience starts with operationally preparing to withstand these types of attacks,” Nick Percoco, the firm's head of security, commented on the incident. Kraken specialists noted that as cyber threats evolve, maintaining security relies more and more heavily on a holistic proactive approach: ”A culture of productive paranoia is key.” North Korean Hackers Created Fake Companies to Scam Users Contagious Interview, a group linked to the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus, has registered three shell companies to distribute malware. This is according to the Silent Push report. The firms BlockNovas, Angeloper Agency and SoftGlide are being used to deceive users through fake interviews. Silent Push senior analyst Zach Edwards said the two fictitious companies are registered in the United States. According to Silent Push, hackers create fake employee profiles using images generated by artificial intelligence. They also steal photos of real people to boost the credibility of their firms. Analysts reported that attackers find victims through fake job ads on GitHub and freelancing platforms. During the ”interview”, the potential victim encounters a video recording error. The solution is a ”simple copy-and-paste trick” that leads to a malware download. Silent Push has identified three types of ”infectious” software: BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and Otter Cookie. These programs aim to steal information, including cryptocurrency wallet keys. According to Edwards, the hacking campaign has been going on since 2024, since then FBI liquidated the firm Blocknovas. Among the victims there are well-known public users, the expert noted. Hackers stole $100,000 from CEO Emblem Vault via Zoom The head of NFT platform Emblem Vault, Jake Gallen, claimed to have lost more than $100,000 in cryptocurrency due to attackers using Zoom. According to him, the incident occurred during a video call with a crypto community member who identified himself as the owner of a mining platform. Gallen reported that scammers installed GOOPDATE malware on his computer. Several cryptocurrency wallets were compromised, resulting in the loss of bitcoins and Ethereum. Gallen partnered with The Security Alliance (SEAL) to analyze the attack. The company determined that ELUSIVE COMET, a group that uses social engineering to install malware and steal cryptocurrencies, was responsible; According to Gallen, he got into a Zoom meeting with a crypto-enthusiast with 26,000 subscribers on X. During the video call, the attacker used the remote access feature to install the program. SEAL experts tested Zoom and confirmed that by default, the platform allows guests to request remote access to the computer. A researcher under the nickname samczsun told Cointelegraph that for a successful attack, an attacker would need to convince the victim to manually grant such access. The hackers later hacked into Gallen's X account and tried to use it to lure new victims in private messages. They also gained access to Ledger's hardware wallet, even though Gallen had used it several times over three years. SEAL experts link the ELUSIVE COMET group to Aureon Capital, which is responsible for ”millions of dollars in stolen funds” and poses a significant risk to users because of its ”elaborate backstory.”",News|Security,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-03 14:18:44

The nonprofit organization, which claims to be “fighting autocracy,” estimates that nearly 40% of Trump’s net worth now comes from digital assets, totaling around $2.9 billion. That crypto windfall stems from Trump’s personal memecoins, Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and Melania ( MELANIA ), and a sizable stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Trump-affiliated crypto exchange launched in 2024. You might also like: TRUMP coin soars 73% on dinner hype — but July’s unlocks could tell a very different story While the group behind the study describes itself as nonpartisan, it’s led by longtime critics of the president. Still, the numbers are eye-popping. Trump’s crypto portfolio could soon swell even more. World Liberty Financial announced this week that MGX, a firm backed by Abu Dhabi, plans to invest $2 billion into the Trump-linked exchange by purchasing its new stablecoin, USD1. At Token2049 on May 1, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff confirmed that USD1 has been selected as the official stablecoin for MGX’s investment into Binance. Proximity to Trump matters World Liberty’s website reveals just how close the Trumps are to the operation: a family-affiliated entity owns a 60% stake and holds 22.5 billion $WLF tokens. But it’s not solely a family matter. Trump’s White House Crypto Czar, David Sacks, is poised to profit from the USD1 stablecoin’s custodial deal with BitGo — a company in which he still holds a stake. Sacks, per the State Democracy Defenders Action, was allowed to keep his BitGo ownership thanks to a March 5 conflict-of-interest waiver from the White House Counsel. He’s not alone: Trump’s Middle East Envoy, Steven Witkoff, is also listed as a co-founder of WLFI, alongside the president’s two sons, though the details of their financial involvement remain unclear. Also in the mix is Justin Sun, one of the top entrepreneurs in the crypto sector, who first purchased $30 million in $WLFI just weeks after Trump won the 2024 presidential election. That purchase allowed a Trump-affiliated holding company called DT Marks DEFI LLC to receive “75% of the net protocol revenues. ” It’s unclear how much of the MGX deal will benefit Trump, though “a lot” feels like a safe bet. As Trump’s crypto empire expands, so does concern over conflicts of interest. His administration has gradually loosened oversight of the digital asset industry — raising questions about whether crypto cronyism is running rampant. So far, the Trump administration’s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped numerous lawsuits and investigations against crypto and blockchain companies, including Dragonchain , Coinbase , Gemini , Uniswa and Ripple . Or to put it another way: the president’s crypto strategy might be less about decentralization and more about consolidation — of wealth, influence, and dinner invitations to Mar-a-Lago.

This has been made harder by the bearish market winds, as well as declining participation from investors in online activities. As such, the Solana price is still struggling to stay above $150. However, given that there is starting to be a turn in the market sentiment toward the positive, the Solana price could be headed for a quick rebound. This is echoed by crypto analysts who have predicted that the altcoin still has room to run and one in particular suggests that new all-time highs are even possible. Why The Solana Price Is Turning Bullish Crypto analyst TradingShot has explained why the Solana price has been turning bullish recently. In a recent analysis, they explain that the rebound at the beginning of April has shown strength in the digital asset. This came as Solana bounced off the 1-Week MA200 at the start of last month, and this bullish start carried on to the end of the month. Related Reading: Last Chance For Polygon As Crypto Analyst Predicts MATIC Price Will Surge Above $1 Again With the momentum built up, the altcoin saw multiple weekly closes, and eventually closed out the month of April with another green weekly candle. This has set it on a path toward the next critical level, which lies at the 1-Week MA50 and follows the blue trend line at around $170, as shown in the chart below. This level is now the major point to break if Solana is to continue its bullish run in the month of May. The interesting thing about this level, as the crypto analyst explains, is that if the SOL price is able to surmount it, then it is expected to turn into support for the altcoin. Support at $170 would be quite bullish for the Solana price, serving as a possible bounce off point toward $200 once again. Targets From Here As stated above, the first thing is for the Solana price to actually test and break the blue trend line at $170. If this is successful and the bottom is in, then the next big target from here is the $350 level. The crypto analyst explains that this $350 target is the higher high of the wedge.

The customer, whose first name is Steve, says his wife sent a $310,000 check to the IRS in January of last year, reports Fortune. The couple thought nothing of the business-related payment, which they had sent through a secure mailbox at a Seattle-based post office. Eleven-months later, Steve says his accountant told him the check was never received. Steve obtained a copy of the check, and says it had been chemically washed to replace “IRS” with someone he’s never heard of – Ezavier Josiah Staples. Wells Fargo then rejected his claim for reimbursement, stating he had taken too long to report the fraud. The bank says the money was deposited into an account at JPMorgan Chase, and it’s trying to recoup the cash. Steve says he’s stunned at the outcome. “I’m just shocked that [banks] don’t have insurance for this kind of thing, or with all the fraud stuff they’re doing, that they don’t care about protecting the consumer.” It’s just a principle of the thing for me.

Titled “Digital Money,” the April 30 report noted that the stablecoin sector currently boasts a total market capitalization of around $240 billion — a 2% increase in April alone — with projections suggesting it could surge to $2 trillion by 2028. The report addresses the effects of yield-bearing stablecoins in particular, and how they could impact traditional U.S. financial institutions, from the perspective of Treasury demand and U.S. dollar hegemony. The report also considers the impact of tokenized money market funds (MMFs).

44109626,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65989,1746282777,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Pundit Explains Why Eric Trump Is Silent On XRP, But Extols Bitcoin and Ethereum",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-explains-why-eric-trump-is-silent-on-xrp-but-extols-bitcoin-and-ethereum/,"Crypto pundit All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) has raised questions about Eric Trump’s consistent public praise for Bitcoin and Ethereum while remaining silent on XRP. Despite XRP’s numerous advantages over its competitors and growing adoption, neither Eric Trump nor his family-backed venture, World Liberty Finance, has acknowledged it in any capacity. All Things XRP drew attention to Eric Trump’s comments from early 2025, where he publicly praised Ethereum, saying it was a great time to buy the asset, and sharing his optimism during a time when the broader market showed signs of strength. Days later, he also voiced bullish views on Bitcoin. However, despite XRP’s established utility and relevance in the digital asset ecosystem, no similar comments have ever been made. World Liberty Finance’s Portfolio Leaves XRP Behind World Liberty Finance has followed Eric Trump’s lead. The project’s portfolio includes Ethereum, Bitcoin, and stablecoins. According to All Things XRP, the company invested approximately $48 million in Ethereum this year alone. XRP, on the other hand, is excluded . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This has drawn attention given that the digital asset was once included in early discussions about forming a U.S. crypto reserve under the Trump administration, and mentioned specifically by the president when he made the announcement . Eventually, only Bitcoin remained in that plan, leaving XRP out without explanation. Reasons Why the Trumps are Ignoring XRP One factor that may explain the distance from XRP is its complicated legal history. All Things XRP pointed to the prolonged legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although the SEC has agreed to withdraw its appeal , the XRP community waits for the official announcement. This has created panic and uncertainty among market participants. Another explanation offered by the pundit is the strategic focus of World Liberty Finance. The project appears to be centered around Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Ethereum and Bitcoin are notable players in this space, but XRP’s primary use case revolves around cross-border payments, which do not align with DeFi objectives. This divergence might explain why Trump’s crypto venture has not adopted the digital asset. Optics and Timing Could Be Key The Trump brand has a reputation for aligning itself with dominant narratives and avoiding controversy. Engaging with XRP could invite criticism or unwanted political attention, especially in a campaign environment. Additionally, All Things XRP suggested that the silence may not be a dismissal, but a calculated delay. If regulatory clarity around the digital asset strengthens further, World Liberty Finance might revisit its stance.

The surge represents a 40% increase from the previous quarter, with 446 deals closed — a 7% uptick in deal volume, according to a May 1 report by Galaxy. While the topline figure signals renewed investor confidence in digital assets, a single transaction played an outsized role: MGX’s $2 billion investment into Binance accounted for over 40% of all capital raised during the quarter. Binance Transaction Reshapes Funding Landscape Without that deal, total funding would have been $2.8 billion, revealing a 20% decline compared to Q4 2024. Nevertheless, the Binance transaction reshaped the funding landscape. It propelled the Trading, Exchange, Lending, and Investing category to the top of the sector rankings, with $2.55 billion in total raised — a 47.9% jump. Excluding Binance, DeFi would have led the quarter with $763 million in funding. Web3 startups dominated in deal count, representing the most active category with 73 deals, or 16% of the total. These included gaming platforms, NFTs, DAOs, and metaverse ventures. Trading-related firms followed with 62 deals. For the first time since early 2021, the majority of capital flowed into later-stage companies, with 65% of total funding going to Series A rounds and beyond.

Startups based in the United States captured 38.6% of the total deals, reinforcing the country’s lead in the global crypto market. The United Kingdom (8.6%), Singapore (6.4%), and the United Arab Emirates (4.4%) followed. Galaxy’s report also pointed to a renewed correlation between Bitcoin’s price and venture funding trends — a pattern that had weakened in recent years but now appears to be strengthening on a multi-year timeline. Crypto Fundraising Remains Challenging Still, fundraising remains challenging. Galaxy noted persistent headwinds from the 2022–2023 downturn and a shift in investor interest toward artificial intelligence. The AI sector now commands the kind of attention and capital flows that crypto did during its last bull cycle. As a result, crypto-focused venture funds raised just $1.9 billion in Q1 2025. Despite these hurdles, Galaxy expects 2025 to outperform the previous year in total capital raised. As reported, Kaito AI has ranked Paradigm as the top-performing crypto VC firm over the past 12 months, posting an 11.80% performance metric. The firm leads ahead of Alliance (10.64%), Dragonfly (8.32%), a16z (6.94%), and Multicoin Capital (5.86%), which round out the top five. Dragonfly, which ranks third, has invested in major projects like Avalanche (AVAX) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), both of which have gained strong traction in the crypto space. Meanwhile, Alliance, a crypto accelerator for early-stage Web3 startups, has made notable investments in Story Protocol (IP), Manta Network, and Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme coin launchpad. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) secured the fourth spot , with investments in Coinbase, Uniswap, Celo (CELO), Compound, and Dapper Labs, the company behind CryptoKitties.

Arizona has now lost ground in what’s been a race among U.S. states to see which may become the first to establish a crypto reserve as a formal part of their fiscal strategy. Arizona Governor Nixes Bitcoin Reserve Bill The Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would have allowed the state to invest up to 10% of public money in digital assets like Bitcoin, was formally rejected on Friday. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs said in an official statement to Warren Petersen, the President of the Arizona Senate. Had the legislation become law, Arizona would have been the first state in the United States to require public funds to invest in Bitcoin, even outpacing the Treasury Department’s push to get it done, which is still faiting for a full accounting of the nation’s stash before federal officials can move to create the reserve that President Donald Trump has called for. In her veto message, Hobbs explained that Arizona’s retirement system is robust because it sticks to proven investment products. She believes it’s unacceptable to expose the state’s retirement funds to untested investments like digital currencies. While the veto marks a setback for crypto proponents, it’s not unexpected given the governor recent took a recent stand to veto any legislation until a separate funding matter on constituents with disabilities was resolved. Notably, Arizona joins other US states where similar initiatives have failed to advance , including Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Conversely, North Carolina’s House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act on April 30, authorizing the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain funds in approved cryptocurrencies. The legislation was moved to the state Senate for further debate.",Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-03 14:40:13

This rising utility token, born in the heart of Ethereum’s DeFi scene, isn’t wasting time with quiet entries. Investors are buying MUTM at $0.025 with its powerful future growth potential and creative features alongside practical applications in the real world. Mutuum Finance increases its adoption speed while attracting new investors daily because of its improved tokenomics structure. Participants in phase 4 of its ongoing presale have already calculated their anticipated 140% profit based on the projected $0.06 listing price. MUTM’s quick-moving momentum together with increasing investor interest means people wonder if the token will hit $2 per share before ADA achieves its first price point. Presale surge: over $7.6M raised from 9,400+ investors Mutuum Finance presale is picking up speed at breakneck pace. Currently in Phase 4, the token remains available at $0.025, but demand is pushing the supply towards sell-out situation. As soon as Phase 5 is launched, the token will jump to $0.03, providing current investors with a 20% ROI on the spot, with an anticipated launch price of $0.06 suggesting even greater possibilities. Experts already label MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi startups of the year, raising more than $7.6 million and having 9,400+ holders on board. The lending framework of Mutuum Finance integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) components as its main operational base. Smart contract-managed pools in Peer-to-Contract systems allow users to deposit funds and earn passive income in the form of USDT. Users can manage every aspect of their loans and lending directly in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks through decentralized borrowing and lending. The disruptive lending solution enables substantial profits through its technical framework while enhancing liquidity and user base scalability to reshape DeFi borrowing markets. Collateralized stablecoin launches soon The upcoming offering from Mutuum Finance includes a stablecoin built on Ethereum for complete collateralization while being backed by the USD. The stablecoin maintains financial stability by operating through an over-collateralized design thus avoiding previous algorithm-based coin failures. Mutuum Finance smart contracts have been audited and are open-sourced, a crucial step toward building long-term confidence in both the platform and its broader ecosystem. Gamified leaderboards and a $100K giveaway drive community growth To drive user engagement, Mutuum has launched a real-time leaderboard dashboard, spotlighting the top 50 MUTM holders. These elite holders will receive exclusive token rewards, adding a gamified edge to long-term holding. Meanwhile, the platform’s $100,000 token giveaway is in full swing. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM, and an accompanying referral program incentivizes both individuals and organizations to grow the network organically. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a genuine threat to entrenched projects like Cardano (ADA), stealing the spotlight with its utility-first approach and explosive initial adoption. With over $7.6 million raised and 9,400+ investors already on board, this low-cap gem is making waves fast and the clock is ticking. The token is still priced at just $0.025 during Phase 4, but as demand is rising exponentially and Phase 5 applies a 20% surcharge to $0.03, the entry window for high-ROI is quickly disappearing. As the launch price is projected at $0.06, early birds might be able to bank gains of up to 140%, prior to the token’s entry into the open market. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others secure their position, get in now before Phase 4 sells out and you’re left chasing gains from the outside.

Can Cardano-native tools set the… pic.twitter.com/PuzjLC0clB — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) May 2, 2025 Bridging the Divide Between ADA and BTC Sundial Protocol has garnered significant attention in recent months for being the pioneering project that enables seamless connectivity between Bitcoin’s liquidity and Cardano’s smart contract ecosystem. By developing a Layer-2 solution that can securely move BTC value into Cardano’s DeFi architecture, Sundial is attempting to solve one of the industry’s most persistent challenges: bringing Bitcoin’s massive capital base into smart contract-compatible environments without compromising on decentralization or security. Bodega, known for its high-speed, low-fee, decentralized prediction market platform built natively on Cardano, offers an ideal testing ground for this innovation. The partnership will enable users to engage in prediction markets, options, and other derivatives with exposure to Bitcoin-denominated assets, powered by Cardano’s scalable infrastructure. Why This Matters for Cardano and Bitcoin This collaboration signals an important moment for both ecosystems. Cardano enhances its appeal as a serious contender in the DeFi space by leveraging Bitcoin’s unmatched liquidity. For Bitcoin, which has traditionally lacked the programmability to support advanced financial products natively, it opens the door to broader use cases without requiring fundamental changes to the core protocol. Mintern highlighted the importance of the partnership, raising the question of whether Cardano-native tools like Bodega could “set the standard for Bitcoin’s DeFi future.” With Ethereum still dominating the decentralized finance landscape, this Cardano-Bitcoin bridge represents a bold attempt to diversify DeFi infrastructure and offer alternatives that emphasize scalability, lower fees, and a strong emphasis on security. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bigger Picture for DeFi Interoperability As the crypto space matures, interoperability between leading chains is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. Partnerships like the one between Bodega and Sundial demonstrate a shift toward a more collaborative and composable blockchain future. Rather than competing in silos, these projects are seeking synergy, where strengths in one ecosystem can directly empower users in another. This move also positions Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem to play a larger role in the Bitcoin narrative, something that was previously the exclusive domain of wrapped tokens on Ethereum or custodial bridges. With Sundial’s native, trust-minimized solution, and Bodega’s DeFi framework, users may soon have a decentralized way to deploy Bitcoin in complex financial operations—on Cardano’s terms. The Bodega–Sundial partnership marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of blockchain interoperability and decentralized finance. By uniting the liquidity and security of Bitcoin with the programmability and efficiency of Cardano, this collaboration is poised to redefine what’s possible in cross-chain DeFi. While the implementation will be closely watched in the coming months, the strategic intent is clear: empower users with access to Bitcoin-native assets in a fully decentralized, Cardano-powered environment.

44110452,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-institutions-boost-investments,1746284400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Bitcoin mining — Institutions boost investments amid favorable US climate,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-institutions-boost-investments?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Opinion by: Fakhul Miah, managing director of GoMining Institutional The Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age. Is Bitcoin mining profitable? Bitcoin mining is still profitable. CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, shared that the average cost to mine 1 BTC for US-listed miners reached $55,950 in Q3 2024. Two other popular models — one from MacroMicro and another dubbed the Glassnode Difficulty Regression Model — give different estimates. On the very same day of Feb. 20, MacroMicro.me data shows that the average cost to produce 1 BTC hovers above $92,000; Glassnode’s Difficulty Regression Model estimates the cost to mine a single BTC at approximately $34,400, all while the cryptocurrency’s price hit $98,300 on that day. On a global scale, mining costs differ based on the region. For example, the electricity cost to produce 1 BTC in Ireland is roughly $321,000, but it costs just over $1,300 to mine 1 BTC in Iran. Electricity is only part of the equation — hardware, labor and maintenance costs also play a crucial role. Recent data from CoinShares and MacroMicro.me paints a challenging yet nuanced picture for Bitcoin miners in the United States. While some institutional miners remain profitable, the broader landscape reveals increasing operational pressures that could reshape the mining industry. What happens if the challenges aren’t addressed? Mining institutions with high profitability rates could start to expand their operations and possibly acquire struggling miners at bargain prices, potentially putting retail and smaller miners at risk. Sustainable economics for investment attractiveness In addition to receiving the block rewards, miners also benefit from the Bitcoin network’s transaction fees, which depend on network usage. Data shows that the daily Bitcoin transaction fees have been hovering between $360,000 and $1.3 million over the past month — reaching an average of $595,000 daily. This additional revenue stream bolsters Bitcoin mining’s economic appeal and strengthens the resilience of the mining business model by diversifying income sources. Recent: Bitcoin miner Bitfarms secures up to $300M loan from Macquarie It’s not only mining that mining hardware is used for. High computational power, captive power supplies and ready-made infrastructure make miners uniquely equipped to support AI and high-performance computing. In simple terms, mining firms can now rent out their hardware to process AI tasks instead of only focusing on mining Bitcoin. The combination of transaction fee revenue growth and AI computing diversification creates a more resilient and profitable industry model (the existing one has never been quite appealing to institutional investments in the US). Institutional investments on the rise The appealing revenues in the Bitcoin mining industries brought huge attention from institutional investors. This process is easy to spot: Bitcoin mining pools in the US accounted for over 40% of the global Bitcoin network’s hashrate in 2024. According to research by EY-Parthenon and Coinbase, 83% of the 352 global institutions plan to increase their crypto allocations this year, while 51% of the asset managers are considering investments in digital asset companies, including mining companies. That’s why I’m not surprised to witness huge investments in Riot Platforms, CoreWeave and other mining industry players. The favorable market sentiment has paved the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) and specialized funds targeting mining companies. In addition to securing the $650-million investment, CoreWeave aims to go public with a $4-billion IPO to help the Nvidia-backed company reach a $35-billion valuation. Bgin Blockchain, a Singapore-based crypto miner manufacturer, recently filed to go public in the US . Renaissance Capital, an investment advisory firm, expects Bgin Blockchain to raise $50 million for its IPO. This surge in institutional momentum is set to benefit the Bitcoin mining industry by driving up demand and tightening available supply on the market. As more large players accumulate and hold Bitcoin, market scarcity could increase, supporting higher prices and, in turn, boosting miner profitability. The future optimism is more than tangible The strong support from institutional investors comes as the optimism around crypto-friendly policies has significantly increased after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections in November 2024. Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early March, seen as a massive policy shift, triggered positivity in the crypto and mining sectors. This sector gained importance. Last year, Bitcoin mining operations significantly contributed to the US economy, generating roughly $4.1 billion in gross domestic product and creating over 31,000 jobs nationwide. The industry is also revitalizing rural areas by generating tax revenue and repurposing remote locations for mining operations. It sounds like the gusher days of the oil industry a century ago, doesn’t it? The latest investments, leadership appointments and IPOs show that Bitcoin mining firms have a significant tailwind. Meanwhile, they are no longer just about BTC — they are becoming data infrastructure providers for the AI sector, turning into hybrid data processing giants. Taking advantage of this shift, the US could potentially become the leader in the digital asset and Bitcoin mining space due to the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and fulfill its stated goal of being the “crypto capital of the world.” As institutions double down on Bitcoin mining and AI convergence, the question isn’t if this industry will evolve but who will lead the charge. The modern digital gold rush is underway, and the smartest capital is already claiming it. Opinion by: Fakhul Miah, managing director of GoMining Institutional.

High demand reflects the well-structured tokenomics of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and the innovative model of lending, thus placing it in the high-potential DeFi category and poised towards explosive growth in the bull cycle for 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is firing away through phase 4 of its presale, with tokens at the price of $0.025 disappearing at such an alarming speed. Investors purchasing tokens early in this phase will make a cool 20 percent through the purchase when the presale goes to phase 5 at $0.03 — the result of the project’s intentional structure of 11 presale phases. The tokenomics foretell a more impressive jump beyond this immediate rise, with a 140 percent increase through the projection of a listing price of $0.06. Analysts are forecasting even higher numbers after launch at $3; that’s 11,900 percent ROI. Fueling all this urgency is the structured pricing, with limited remainder in phase 4, triggering FOMO — the fear of missing out — among the investors engaged in their long-term thinking. Innovative Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Features Drive Value All of this is adding value to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its ecosystem by providing tangible solutions within DeFi. They are moving forward with a Certik audit for their smart contracts, and the results will soon be shared over the social fronts to allow investors to know that they would be more secure. Recently, the project has also launched a dashboard that displays the top 50 token holders, who will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their ranking. This gamifies investment and engenders loyalty and sustainable investment. This sends Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a notch higher by offering dual-lending, where peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract systems fuse, thereby providing lending flexibility for borrowing and earning in a decentralized framework. A Rising Star in DeFi Insisting that it is a project focused on utility rather than speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steering its boat in an altogether lesser ventured arena of the cryptocurrency market. The mechanism that buys and distributes along with the value of the platform increases demand by the repurchase of tokens, which are then received again by stakers and thus boost their market value. All this is to affirm the dream of a surge in the price up to $3 by 2025, significantly better than many altcoins. What sets Mutuum Finance apart is a presale window that drives investors to hurry and buy when while the price is as low as $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently stands at a crucial juncture that weaves into the reality opportunity — filled DeFi mechanics of tomorrow with presale opportunities today. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project will rise above all odds by the towering market waves of 2025. Hence, this is just the place for the investors to look for a huge return on their investment. Those who look forward to practically making good money by selling their project between $3 and $5 should start acting fast now. You can learn much more by visiting the official channels of the project about price, the presale, and more.

Whether it’s investing in promising tokens or building a community, the right platform can define your long-term impact. Cosmos (ATOM) and Stellar (XLM) continue to attract attention for their market trends and potential. They offer value in terms of price movement and adoption, but their focus remains largely within the bounds of traditional blockchain development. Unstaked ($UNSD) , however, introduces a fresh approach. Centered on decentralized growth, it allows users to build and scale communities using AI-powered tools, without costly agencies or third-party services. It’s a smarter, more autonomous path to meaningful engagement. Cosmos (ATOM) Signals Breakout Potential with Bullish Pattern Cosmos (ATOM) is showing early signs of a bullish reversal, with a falling wedge pattern emerging on the daily chart. This setup often precedes upward movement, and recent buying pressure suggests momentum is building. If ATOM clears key resistance zones, price targets between $5.40 and $9.00 are on the radar for bullish traders. Beyond the chart, Cosmos continues to benefit from its strong developer community and unique interoperability features. As its ecosystem expands and adoption grows, the technical outlook gains added weight. If this breakout confirms, Cosmos could quickly reenter the conversation as a high-potential crypto to watch. Stellar (XLM) Whale Transfer Sparks Market Speculation Stellar (XLM) is under the spotlight after a massive whale transfer moved 245 million XLM in just five minutes. These large-scale transactions often hint at upcoming market shifts, raising questions about whether whales are preparing for accumulation or a strategic sell-off. Such activity tends to influence price dynamics, prompting analysts and traders to monitor the next moves closely. With whales potentially reshaping the short-term trend, smaller participants may look to these signals for clues on where Stellar could be headed next. $UNSD Powers Decentralized Growth Without Middlemen The future of online growth is shifting, and $UNSD is leading that change. Built specifically for decentralized influence-building, $UNSD enables users to grow communities without the need for costly marketing agencies, bots, or third-party platforms. Instead, it leverages AI to deliver tools that support genuine, scalable engagement, all within a transparent, user-first model. Once the presale ends and the project officially launches, $UNSD will activate AI-powered agents designed to operate across platforms like X and Telegram. These agents will help users manage growth, drive conversations, and foster real engagement—all while adapting to user needs and behavior over time. What makes $UNSD unique is its emphasis on autonomy and impact. Rather than relying on hype, the system is built to reward thoughtful engagement and community building. It offers a flexible and scalable way for users to expand their reach without centralized oversight. Currently available in presale stage 2 at just $0.0066, with a projected launch price of $0.1819, $UNSD offers strong early upside. For those looking for the best crypto investment in utility-driven ecosystems, Unstaked opens the door to smarter growth, earned through interaction, not speculation. Crypto Market Snapshot As the crypto space continues to advance, projects like Cosmos (ATOM) and Stellar (XLM) are carving out their roles in blockchain innovation. Yet, Unstaked introduces something different, a model built around decentralized community growth and AI-powered engagement. By eliminating the need for expensive marketing tools and giving users full control, Unstaked creates a more transparent and scalable path to influence. Its focus on intelligent, autonomous growth sets it apart as a forward-thinking platform. For those seeking long-term utility and ownership in their crypto journey, Unstaked presents a fresh and promising direction.

As investors look towards a potential next crypto bull run in 2025, two areas consistently generate massive interest: crypto presales and meme coins. Finding the best meme coin to buy means catching that viral wave, often fueled by internet culture and strong communities, that can lead to unbelievable price surges. What if you could find a project that combines both? One project that recently completed its presale and sits perfectly at the crossroads of meme coin fun and innovative technology is Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) . It's designed to appeal to both those hunting for early presale opportunities and those searching for the next big meme coin, making it one of the most promising contenders to watch as the market gears up. Let's explore why getting in early matters, how to spot potential winners in presales and meme coins, and why Dawgz AI shines so brightly in both categories. The Advantage of Presales & Meme Coins Why do people get so excited about finding projects early, either in a presale or right when a new meme coin launches? It really boils down to the potential for massive rewards, although the risks are equally huge. Why Presales are Tempting: Lowest Price: A crypto presale is usually the only time you can buy a token at its rock-bottom price, directly from the team before it lists anywhere else. This offers the maximum possible profit if the project succeeds later on. Getting In First: You're among the very first supporters, often getting access to information or perks before the general public. Supporting New Ideas: It's a way to directly fund a new technology or idea you believe in from the start. Why Meme Coins are Tempting (Especially Early): Viral Potential: Meme coins can explode seemingly overnight due to social media hype, influencer mentions, or just catching the right cultural wave. Getting in before that happens is the dream each crypto enthusiast is wishing for. Community Power: Strong meme coin communities (Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe) have shown they can create incredible demand and push prices to unexpected heights. Being part of that early community energy can be exciting. High Returns: While extremely risky, the stories of early meme coin investors making life-changing money fuel the ongoing search for the next one. Where the Weak see Fear, the Brave see Potential. 💥⚡ pic.twitter.com/7IL45Rh0S2 — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) April 30, 2025 The Big Risk: Both presales and early meme coin investing are very high risk. Many presales lead to failed projects or outright scams (rug pulls). Most meme coins lose their hype and fade away, leaving later buyers with worthless tokens. Identifying the Best Crypto Presale Opportunities A crypto presale is like getting invited to invest in a startup before it officially opens its doors. It's exciting, but you need to check things out carefully. Here's what makes a presale look more promising: Real Usefulness (Utility): Does the project plan to actually do something useful? Does it solve a real problem, or offer a service people might want? A presale for a project with a clear purpose is usually better than one based just on vague promises. Solid Team & Plan (Roadmap): Can you find out who is behind the project? Do they seem experienced and trustworthy? Do they have a clear, realistic plan (roadmap) for how they will build and launch their product? Transparency matters. Good Token Plan (Tokenomics): How will the token be used? Is there a limited supply? How are the tokens being distributed – is it fair, or does the team keep too much? Are there rewards for holding? A well-thought-out plan for the token is crucial. Security Check (Audit): Has an independent company checked the project's computer code (smart contract) for security holes? An audit is a very important step to build trust and reduce the risk of technical problems or theft. Look for audits from reputable firms like SolidProof . Early Funding: Is the presale actually attracting other investors? A presale that raises a significant amount of money shows that other people also believe in the project's potential. Finding the Best Meme Coin Picking the best meme coin to buy is even trickier than evaluating a presale, because so much depends on unpredictable internet culture and hype. However, as the market matures, investors are looking for meme coins that might actually last beyond a single hype cycle. Here's what might make a meme coin have more staying power: Authentic Community: Is the community real and passionate, or just full of bots spamming ""buy!"" messages? Look for genuine discussion, user-created memes, and active moderation on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and X. A strong, organic community (like the fans of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe) is the lifeblood of any successful meme coin. Utility Potential: Does the meme coin offer anything beyond just being a meme? This could be staking rewards, integration into a game, use within a specific platform, or unique technological features. Meme coins with some kind of usefulness tend to attract more serious interest. Developer Activity & Transparency: Is the team (even if anonymous) still active and communicating updates? Or did they launch the coin and disappear? Ongoing development and communication build trust, even in the meme space. Dawgz AI shines here when viewed as a meme coin. It actively cultivates its ""Dawgz Army"" community. It plans to offer significant AI utility, giving it a strong purpose beyond just being a dog-themed coin.This focus on substance alongside the meme branding is why many see it as the best example of an evolved meme coin with potential to last. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): Top Pick for Presale and Meme Coin Investors Because Dawgz AI combines the key elements of both a promising presale opportunity and an innovative meme coin, it deserves a special focus as the best of both worlds for investors looking to get in early before the next crypto bull run. Why it Excelled as a Presale: Massive Early Demand: Raising over $3.4 million showed huge investor confidence before it even hit exchanges. Low Entry Price: Its multi-stage presale offers $DAGZ tokens at very low prices of $0.004as of today, maximizing the potential upside for early backers. Clear Value Proposition: Unlike many vague presale projects, Dawgz AI had a clear plan to integrate useful AI technology. Fundamentals Checked: It completed a security audit and had transparent tokenomics, adding credibility. Why it Excels as a Meme Coin: AI Utility Edge: Its planned AI features , the BlackBox trading bots offering market analysis set it far apart from other meme coins, giving it real substance. Strong Community Building: It actively fosters its ""Dawgz Army"" using meme culture, contests, and rewards – essential for viral growth. Staking Rewards: Offering passive income through staking gives holders a strong reason to stick around long term, building a more stable base than hype-only coins. Hot Narrative Alignment: It perfectly captures both the AI crypto trend and the enduring popularity of meme coins. Whether you approached it primarily looking for the best crypto presale or the best meme coin to buy, Dawgz AIoffered compelling arguments on both fronts. Its strategic combination of early access, low price, real utility, viral marketing potential, community focus, and security measures makes it a standout project poised for significant attention as it moves beyond its presale phase and towards exchange listings in 2025. Strategies & Risks: Buying Early Before the Bull Run Getting in early on pre-sales or new meme coins before a bull run sounds great, but it is very risky. Here's how to approach it smartly: The Risk is Real: Understand that most presales fail, and most meme coins lose value over time. Scams are everywhere. Never invest money you can't afford to lose completely. Start Small: Especially with unproven projects, start with very small investment amounts. You can always add more later if the project shows positive progress. Diversify: Don't put all your ""early bet"" money into one project. Spreading small amounts across several carefully researched presales or new coins reduces the impact if one fails. Patience is Needed: Don't expect to get rich overnight. Even successful projects take time to develop and grow. Be prepared to hold through ups and downs if you believe in the long-term potential. Have an Exit Plan: Decide beforehand when you will take profits if the price goes up, or when you will cut your losses if things go wrong. Conclusion: Invest Smart During the Next Bull Run The hunt for the best crypto presale and best meme coin to buy before they get listed on major exchanges and catch the wave of the next crypto bull run is thrilling. It offers the chance to get in at the very beginning and potentially see huge returns. However, this early stage is also where the risks are highest. Success requires looking beyond just a cheap price or a funny picture. It means finding projects with real substance, clear plans, strong communities, and a focus on security. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out as a most promising example because it uniquely combines the early entry advantage of a presale with the viral potential of a meme coin, all while adding a powerful layer of AI utility. As you explore these early opportunities in 2025, remember to do thorough research, understand the risks involved, and invest wisely. FAQ Section : How can I find good crypto pre-sales or meme coins early? Look at crypto launchpad sites, presale listing platforms, and monitor social media for new projects generating organic buzz. Research is key – check for utility, security audits, and active communities, like those highlighted for the most promising Dawgz AI. What makes a meme coin the ""best"" one to buy? The best meme coin to buy often has a very strong and active online community, a fun or catchy meme that goes viral, and increasingly in 2025, some kind of real usefulness or unique feature. Projects like the most promisingDawgz AI are getting attention because they mix meme fun with planned AI utility. Are meme coins a safe investment? No, meme coins are generally considered very high-risk investments because their prices depend heavily on social media hype and sentiment, which can change very quickly. While Dawgz AI tries to add safety with an audit and real utility, investing in any meme coin means you could potentially lose all your money. What are the biggest risks of buying crypto before major exchange listings? The main risks include the project potentially failing to get listed on big exchanges, low liquidity (difficulty selling) on early platforms, high volatility after launch, and the possibility of scams or rug pulls. Thoroughly researching projectslike the most promising Dawgz AI helps reduce, but not eliminate, these risks. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The first observation was that the safe haven bet of 2025, gold, has just had a historic run, having surged 30% since the beginning of the year, hitting an all-time high of just over $3,400 per ounce on April 22. However, it is now taking a breather, having fallen around 3% this week while Bitcoin is up around 4%, they observed. “Every time BTC starts catching up like this, it’s the start of something bigger,” they said before adding that last time, BTC went from $70,000 to $108,000. This may be the most bullish setup for Bitcoin since 2020. Gold is taking a breather. Liquidity is rising. And Bitcoin is quietly positioning itself for something big. Here’s why all the signals are flashing green pic.twitter.com/95dWb3XUQN — Swan (@Swan) May 2, 2025 Liquidity Rising The second signal is a global rise in liquidity in the form of M2 money supply , which is rising for the first time since 2021. According to the St. Louis Fed, M2 money supply has increased by 4% over the past 12 months. “Every major Bitcoin bull market has followed this pattern: expanding money supply, softening financial conditions, waning trust in fiat. This is fuel, and Bitcoin is built to absorb it.” Volatility also recently spiked to March 2020 levels. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) – a measure of the stock market’s expectation of volatility – has calmed, but uncertainty hasn’t, and markets are twitchy, they said. “Bitcoin thrives in chaos because it offers certainty, finality, and neutrality when everything else breaks down.” Economist and author Timothy Peterson also commented on the VIX, observing that the index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days, and a VIX score below 18 implies a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin, which could occur “in a few weeks.” His tracking model, which has been accurate 95% of the time, predicted a BTC price of $135,000 in the next three months or so, if the VIX remains low. The Swan analysts pointed to the MVRV ratio, a measure of market value divided by realized value, which just bounced off 1.74. This has “marked the start of every major Bitcoin bull market,” and it’s flashing again now, they said. Additionally, “sellers look exhausted between $90,000 and $100,000,” they said before adding that price is rising above cost basis, and the weak hands are gone. “This is the structure historically seen when Bitcoin is about to go vertical.” Interest Rate Impact At current levels, every 25 basis point decline in rates equates to roughly a 10% increase in Bitcoin price, observed Peterson on May 2. Given the speed with which this rate is falling, a 75 basis point decline is reasonable within one to two months, he said before adding “that would put Bitcoin near $130,000.” BTC is up more than 15% over the past month and closed in on $98,000 in late trading on Friday, its highest level since February 21.

Despite recent range-bound price action, optimism surrounding XRP remains strong among crypto analysts. Many experts see a future where XRP achieves extraordinary price milestones. Some projections even suggest the altcoin could soar to $50 or as high as $100 , especially if its reputation as a global payment solution becomes widely recognized.Amid these wild projections, The Crypto Basic recently assessed how high XRP’s value could climb if its market cap equaled the United States' M1 money supply.XRP Price if It Attained M1 Money SupplyFor context, the U.S. M1 money supply, as reported by CEIC Data, stood at an impressive $18,455.9 billion (or $18.4559 trillion) in January 2025. This marked a slight increase from $18,433.9 billion in December 2024, indicating continued growth in the most liquid forms of money within the American economy. Notably, the M1 money supply includes physical cash, demand deposits like checking accounts, and other assets that are easily convertible to cash for spending.Meanwhile, XRP currently trades around $2.23, having gained about 7% over the past week. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP holds a circulating supply of 58.39 billion tokens, with a total supply over 99 billion tokens. Its current market cap sits at around $130.4 billion.If XRP's market cap matched the U.S. M1 money supply, the asset’s total valuation would surge to $18.4559 trillion. Notably, if this $18.4559 trillion market cap translates to XRP's fully diluted market cap, then the price per XRP would reach $186, considering the total supply of 99.98 billion tokens.However, if this $18.4559 trillion valuation translates to XRP's actual market cap, its price per token would sit at $316, considering the circulating supply of 58.39 billion tokens. This scenario shows what the XRP market could look like if it captured the liquidity represented by M1.Could XRP Hit $186 and $316?Interestingly, analysts from the crypto exchange Changelly are notably bullish on XRP's long-term prospects. They forecast that XRP could reach a maximum price of $315 by February 2040, aligning with the $316 theoretical price target derived from the M1 supply comparison. XRP Price Prediction for 2040 Changelly XRP Price Prediction for 2040 | Changelly Further, these analysts expect XRP to hit this $186 milestone as soon as January 2040, just a month earlier than their higher-end forecast.While Changelly’s projections indicate bullishness, not all analysts share the same level of enthusiasm. Experts from Telegaon present a more conservative outlook. They do not foresee XRP reaching $186 or $315 by 2040. XRP Price Prediction Telegaon 3 XRP Price Prediction | Telegaon Instead, they predict that XRP’s maximum price in that year would peak at $160. Telegaon analysts expect XRP could eventually touch $186, but only between 2040 and 2050.

The RXS token faces a significant milestone through its upcoming listing which experts expect will experience a remarkable 17,036% growth because of its ability to redefine property ownership methods. RXS stands apart from most speculative tokens since it provides real-world value by connecting to assets in the real world. RXS Disrupts Crypto Industry with RWA Tokenization, Gaining Credibility Through Certik Audits and Listings on CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko RXS stands as a disruptive force in the crypto industry because it specializes in RWAs. RXS establishes a link between digital currencies and tangible investments by allowing owners to separate ownership of assets like gold and other commodities into fractional portions. The innovative approach provides equal access to important assets and boosts transparency while improving asset market liquidity. RXS's credibility stands strong because it appears on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms and passes audit inspections from Certik which confirms its secure and reliable features. The approaching official launch of RXS generates increasing investor interest because market participants understand its potential to transform global asset ownership and trading methods. Massive Demand Fuels Growth Market confidence in RXS vision and utility emerged through substantial presale demand which demonstrated widespread acceptance of its potential. RXS successfully attracted a range of investors by obtaining over 50,000 holders while completing nearly 92% of its presale stage. Real-world operational capabilities of the token attract both institutional and retail investors beyond the realm of speculative interests. The upcoming June 2025 listing of RXS at $0.25 receives positive forecast from analysts who predict substantial price movements due to its solid fundamentals and increasing user base. Analysts predict that the 17,036% projected growth demonstrates RXS will transform the crypto market. Conclusion The cryptocurrency markets continuously evolve through the dual examples of Dogecoin and Rexas Finance. Dogecoin maintains public interest through community support and predicted price growth to $5 but Rexas Finance demonstrates valuable utility features that point to increased value potential.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $4.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.63 Market Cap $611.61M Trading Volume $36.99M Circulating Supply 643.93M dYdX All-time High $4.53 All-time Low $0.506 24-hour high $0.648 24-hour low $0.627 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.63 Price Prediction $ 2.15 (223.31%) Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 7.26% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.721985 200-Day SMA $ 1.194168 14-Day RSI 49.46 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faces bearish pressure toward $0.63 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX is facing bearish pressure toward $0.63 Resistance for dYdX is at $0.648 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.6167 The dYdX price analysis for 3 May confirms that dYdX faced a bearish pressure as it aims for a drop below $0.6 after selling pressure intensified.

Currently, sellers are aiming for a hold below the immediate support at $0.6163. The 24-hour volume dropped to $3.41 million, showing decreased interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.628, decreasing by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. dYdX shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the midline at 50, hinting that bullish pressure is still on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, bulls maintain buying confidence as the dYdX price aims for a rebound. dYdX price chart The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.52, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.92964 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.84402 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.844129 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.807292 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.948906 SELL SMA 100 $ 1.315705 SELL SMA 200 $ 1.23951 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.8087 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.902097 SELL EMA 10 $ 1.069497 SELL EMA 21 $ 1.266273 SELL EMA 50 $ 1.426172 SELL EMA 100 $ 1.413397 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.475345 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.648, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.677. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.6167, beginning a bearish trend to $0.5758. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Following the overall selling demand in the market, dYdX witnessed a surge in selling pressure. As a result, bears are aiming for a hold below $0.6 Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.6 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility.

However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.5. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction May 2025 $0.5 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|DYDX|WLD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-03 15:07:39

The latest development indicates increased buyer optimism amidst the volatility observed in the broader cryptocurrency market. A heightened confidence in the spot market further suggests that market speculation is dying, and buyers are throwing their full weight behind their spot holdings. In the spot premium market, traders are introduced to trading crypto assets, in this case, Ripple’s XRP, at a more elevated level. As such, the increase in trading indicates that a firm demand is driving movement in the XRP market. Adding to the growing trend, Glassnode’s recent report highlighted optimism amongst XRP holders over the past months. According to data from the on-chain analytical firm, the number of addresses holding a minimum of 10,000 XRP coin has risen steadily since November 2024. All credit goes to large whales, who reiterate their long-term position in the market by exercising patience through coin accumulation despite market volatility. Anticipation for Spot XRP ETF Heightens The optimistic outlook for the spot market is likely fueled by the expectation of an XRP Spot ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With the regulatory backpedaling on its decision to pursue a case with Ripple, anticipation for approval has heightened. According to data from the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, the probability of a Spot XRP ETF has increased by 78% this year. In March, leading investment firms filed for XRP ETF products, adding the asset to a list of 72 crypto spot-based ETFs awaiting approval from the SEC. Between January and April, XRP has retreated by 35%, and the fourth-largest crypto by market cap now trades at $2.21 at press time. Expectations of a potential surge are still tied to a possible Spot ETF approval.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-03 15:10:24

The crypto market appreciates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the project stands at $0.025 during phase 4 which has filled 57% of its offering. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents investors with a defined tokenomics structure which anticipates 140% value growth when the token gets listed at $0.06. This stands in contrast to Cardano (ADA) missing multiple opportunities to surpass $1 despite previous price spikes. The clear contrast explains why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a more attractive investment in 2025. The upcoming phase presents significant upcoming growth to phase 4 which has nearly reached completion. Defining Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses on developing decentralized finance (DeFi) platform services which link operations between lending and borrowing. Both users who deposit assets to liquidity pools and borrowers can access their services by putting up overcollateralized assets which secures the system stability. Users generate passive income through MTokens which represent their deposits on the platform because these tokens gain value while held. The tokens function throughout multiple DeFi platforms because they can move between them which increases their overall usefulness. Through MUTM the peer-to-peer lending function will enable users to conduct exclusive loan agreements with each other. The combination of a buy-and-distribute mechanism together with practical token operations creates continuous demand for tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to dominate its presale event as phase 4 expects to reach its maximum cap soon. A rising number of investors is buying MUTM tokens for $0.025 because they understand that phase 5 will increase their value by 20% up to $0.03 thus giving existing owners a 20% profit return. The crypto project has a 140% projected tokenomics return at its $0.06 listing price and analysts expect a significant 9,900% ROI to reach $2.50 after launch. Team members launched a dashboard containing a leaderboard for the top 50 token holders where bonus tokens reward participants by maintaining their ranks in the leaderboards. The MUTM leadership implemented this scheme to energize market participants which resulted in phase 4 experiencing rapid sales completion. The team stands at the final stage of conducting a Certik audit for their smart contract before posting updates on their social platforms which enhance trustworthiness. The crypto market recognizes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as its standout entity because of its prevailing momentum. Cardano (ADA) stumbles During the year 2025 Cardano (ADA) fails to keep the momentum from its initial market surge. The cryptocurrency has reached its maximum value point at $0.80 during February but today remains below $0.60 while trading activity stands at only $640 million. Fleeting periods of overbuying emerge on the Relative Strength Index because hype overrides fundamental value. Network transaction fees reached multi-month lows while dropping to $8,100 from the initial $17,100 level. Network activity slowed down by 52%. The current market trends show that ADA will struggle to reach $1 within a short time frame. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents investors with unmistakable growth prospects which establish it as a better investment choice than Cardano (ADA). Sealing a smarter choice Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as an outstanding crypto market contender because of its dominant presale wins and promising high returns over Cardano (ADA). The project implements a systematic price increase plan together with diverse holder incentives which combine to make investment decisions more time-sensitive. The window for acquiring Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.025 price during phase 4 will soon become unavailable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows promising growth potential for 2025 alongside steady price increases and active network usage according to investor demand. However Cardano (ADA) deals with variable momentum strength and decreases in network adoption. The maximal returns can be obtained by investors who enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prior to its upcoming price elevation.

Zaminer Cloud Mining Sees Massive User Sign-Ups As Bitcoin Mining Gains Momentum,https://nulltx.com/is-trumpcoin-a-threat-to-bitcoin-zaminer-cloud-mining-sees-massive-user-sign-ups-as-bitcoin-mining-gains-momentum/,"As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, the recent launch of President Trump’s $TRUMP token has sparked a wave of discussion across the crypto space, with some viewing it as a possible rival to Bitcoin’s dominance.

Cardano (ADA) touts meticulous research and decades-long staying power. Solana (SOL) flaunts blinding throughput and a thriving app culture. And Remittix (RTX) , a newcomer still in presale, promises to weaponize cross-border payments for triple-digit gains. Cardano: Great Tech, “Marketing Problem,” and a Coiled-Spring Chart Cardano’s core engineers insist the chain is battle-tested and “principled,” but even Input Output’s EVP Tim Harrison admits ADA faces a visibility gap: “If no one knows what we’ve built or why it matters, we’ve got a problem.” That branding hurdle arrives just as on-chain governance gains momentum, positioning 2025 as a make-or-break year for mind-share. Meanwhile, price action shows ADA currently trading at around $0.7081 . TradingView analyst CobraVanguard flags a falling-wedge continuation on the 3-day ADA/USDT chart, often a launchpad for fresh upside. Complementing that view, Arman Shaban’s Smart-Money Concepts map reveals ADA completed a full market-structure cycle: an impulse from $0.33 to $1.32, rejection at a bearish order block, and a corrective pullback into current support. source: ArmanShabanTrading on tradingview If bulls reclaim the grey sell-zone on high volume, ADA could replay its prior 4× burst, especially if Cardano’s marketing pivot finally resonates with users beyond its active but insular community. Solana: Speed, Market Share and a Looming Breakout Solana has clawed back momentum after its 2024 outage narrative, trading near $150 with a $77 billion market cap . According to Dune Analytics , the network recorded 33 % higher DEX volume than Ethereum and top layer-2s over the past quarter, processed 400 % more transactions, and hosted 180 % more active addresses. Institutional interest is rising too: DeFi Development Corp. just earmarked Solana in a $1 billion securities offering filed with the U.S. SEC. Technically, the giant cup-and-handle pattern spanning mid-2022 to early-2024 suggests a breakout if SOL clears the $195–$200 resistance range. Classic projections give a target near $392, while more aggressive readings put long-run possibilities between $600 and $3,300, barring macro shocks. Near-term models are milder: CoinCodex sees SOL hovering around $150 this week and drifting toward $138 over three months, whereas DigitalCoinPrice pegs a 2025 average of $293 and a potential high of $326. source: @ali_charts on X To reach a full 10×, Solana will need Firedancer , Jump Crypto’s parallel validator client, to hit mainnet, thus multiplying throughput and burying downtime concerns. If that dovetails with consumer-grade wallets and fee-free UX, SOL could attract another wave of sticky users and siphon liquidity from competing chains. Remittix: A Purpose-Built Payments Engine in Presale Remittix (RTX) distinguishes itself by solving a blunt, billion-dollar pain: cross-border money transfers that still cost migrants and SMEs more than 6 % per ticket and settle in days, not minutes. Live on presale, Remittix has already raised over $14.7 million and placed 531 million tokens at $0.0757 each, setting the stage for a full-network rollout in Q3 2025. Real-world pilots begin this summer with two African mobile-money networks and a Southeast-Asian e-wallet that collectively serve 24 million accounts. Back-tests suggest Remittix can cut settlement costs by 80 % and finalize transfers in seconds, a leap over legacy rails that still charge migrants 6 %+ and clear in days. Tokenomics tilt toward early adopters: only 22 % of supply will circulate in year one, and team allocations vest linearly over four years, capping sell-pressure. Meanwhile, compliance groundwork is underway under EU MiCA and Kenya’s upcoming VASP rules, de-risking future bank integrations. If Remittix captures even 0.2 % of annual remittance flow, quarterly burns could retire millions of RTX, applying steady upward pressure on price. Discounted-cash-flow models tied to fee burns show potential 15–25× upside by end-2026, returns that eclipse even a blue-sky scenario for ADA or SOL. Execution risk is real: missed regulatory filings or pilot delays could stall adoption. But for investors with an appetite for asymmetric upside, RTX’s path from presale to payment staple looks uniquely leveraged. Which Coin Holds the Clearer Path to 10×? Cardano’s deliberate innovation and Solana’s lightning-fast ecosystem will likely yield respectable gains, but both need near-perfect execution to rival a 10× . Remittix (RTX) demands less: prove it can shave costs in a handful of remittance corridors, and the tokenomics will do the heavy lifting. With capped floats, scheduled burns and real pilots queued for 2025, Remittix offers a cleaner, higher-beta route to portfolio-changing returns. For investors hunting the next outsized winner rather than incremental upside, staking an early position in Remittix could be the smartest play of the year.

According to on-chain analyst Ember CN, these sales were conducted through “unilateral liquidity and DCA (dollar-cost averaging) methods.” This continues an overall selling pattern that started over a month and a half ago. You might also like: Pepe rejection likely before bullish continuation? key levels to watch. MELANIA team nets 170,000 Solana Since March 16, the project team has transferred 41.675 million MELANIA ( MELANIA ) tokens from community and liquidity addresses and started converting them to Solana ( SOL ). The total selloff has netted the team 170,000 SOL, valued at approximately $23.063 million. The sale was made for an average $0.55 per $MELANIA token. MELANIA token dump data The analyst detailed the team’s conversion process and mentioned that they “gradually sell the SOL to convert it into USDC, transferring it to other chains or withdrawing it.” This approach suggests a planned liquidation strategy rather than sporadic selling. Amidst the continuous selloffs, the MELANIA token has shown a major price drop in recent market activity. Price data shows a 5.3% drop in the past 24 hours and a 32.1% drop over both the 7-day and 30-day periods. The token remains 97.1% below its all-time high of $13.05 reached on January 20, 2025. The Melania token, associated with First Lady Melania Trump, initially gained traction during the meme coin buzz surrounding political figures and the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin. However, the continuous selling pressure from the project team raises questions about the token’s long-term viability and the team’s commitment to the project. At last check Saturday, MELANIA is down 7.1% over the past 24 hours.

Ardoino, during an interview with the Less Noise More Signal podcast, took aim at the European Union’s regulatory framework for stablecoins, which he said pushes companies like Tether to keep the bulk of their reserves—up to 60%—in uninsured bank deposits. In his scenario, that could mean holding 6 billion euros of a 10 billion euros-pegged stablecoin in small banks with minimal protection. “The bank insurance in Europe is only 100,000 euros,” he said. “If you have 1 billion euros, that’s like spitting on a fire.” European banks, like every other bank, operate on a fractional reserve, Ardoino added. “They can lend out 90% of it to people that want to buy a house, start a business, and all of that.” In his hypothetical 6 billion euros scenario, this would mean 5.4 billion euros would be lent out by the bank. He likened the setup to the lead-up to Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in 2023, when a flood of redemptions exposed the mismatch between deposits and actual liquidity. Ardoino warned that European banks operate under similar fractional reserve models that could unravel under pressure. A 20% redemption event, he estimated, could leave banks short billions. ""As a stablecoin issuer, you go bankrupt — not because of you, but because of the bank. So the bank goes bankrupt and you go bankrupt, and the government would say, ‘Told you so, stablecoins are very dangerous,” Ardoino said. Regulations in Europe, he added, are made to try to help banks in the bloc and bring them liquidity, but this created “huge systemic risk.” The largest banks in Europe, like UBS, would “not bank stablecoins,” pushing stablecoin issuers to use smaller banks, furthering the risk. The comments come as Tether plans to launch a U.S.-based stablecoin product, and as the stablecoin issuer keeps investing in various projects outside of the ecosystem, having recently raised its stake in Latin American producer Adecoagro.",Markets|Tether|Euro|MiCA|Paolo Ardoino|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-03 15:35:31

According to recent reports, Ripple initially offered $5 billion for the company, but Circle declined. Deaton noted that Ripple is now believed to have increased its offer to $20 billion , suggesting the company aims to expand its role in the stablecoin market and strengthen the position of both RLUSD and XRP. Why Circle Rejected Ripple’s First Offer Deaton noted that Circle filed its S-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 1, 2025, announcing plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “CRCL.” The company is working with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup as lead underwriters and aims for a valuation between $4 billion and $5 billion. This figure is notably lower than the $9 billion valuation Circle sought during a failed SPAC deal in 2022. The rejection of Ripple’s $5 billion proposal suggests Circle anticipates a higher post-IPO valuation, potentially exceeding the $9 billion figure it previously targeted. Deaton remarked that Circle may believe its market value will climb further, especially in light of favorable regulatory developments and renewed institutional interest in digital assets. Major Regulatory Shifts for Cryptocurrencies The political and regulatory climate in the U.S. has become increasingly supportive of crypto initiatives. The Trump administration has adopted a more open stance toward digital assets, and the proposed STABLE GENIUS Act is expected to provide a clearer framework for stablecoin issuers. Trump’s pro-crypto stance is clear, and the new regulatory environment contributes to the expectation that Circle’s IPO could unlock higher valuations, making a future acquisition even more costly. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Stablecoin Strategy and Market Expansion Ripple’s enhanced $20 billion bid reflects its broader ambitions in the stablecoin sector. The company launched RLUSD , its stablecoin, in December, and by acquiring Circle, it would immediately expand its influence through USDC, currently the second-largest stablecoin. This would benefit RLUSD, Ripple’s newly launched stablecoin, and XRP by embedding them deeper into mainstream financial ecosystems. Though Circle has not confirmed the $20 billion bid, the implications are significant. Such an acquisition would be one of the largest in crypto history and could shift the balance of power among stablecoin providers. Ripple would gain market share and strategic infrastructure that could enhance its cross-border payment services and digital asset offerings, and increase the adoption of XRP, RLUSD, and Ripple’s payment services.

Despite its strong fundamentals and expanding utility, XRP’s journey to new highs may not be as explosive as the market’s latest underdog. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.025, is flashing the kind of parabolic potential that could see it blitz past $3 long before XRP even closes in on its target. Today’s Phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance has seen high demand, with over 9,300 investors participating and pushing the total funds raised to $7.4 million. Investors who invest at this point can be assured of a 140% return when MUTM tokens list at $0.06 on launch. Investors have less time since over 50% of the phase has already been sold out. Mutuum Finance Presale Garners Strong Investor Support Mutuum Finance’s Phase 4 presale continues to be in great demand by investors, with over $7.4 million and over 9,300 holders. With its current price at $0.025, Mutuum Finance presents a highly rewarding opportunity for early investors who could enjoy a 140% return when the token price hits $0.06 on day one. Specialists put MUTM’s worth at around $3 shortly after launch, and hence, that much more appealing. With Phase 5 introducing the price hike to $0.03, the prospects look good for investors who are entering early in the presale. Mutuum Finance’s recently launched live leaderboard also rewards regular participants with bonus tokens for their long-term holding, reinforcing the holding mentality further. Mutuum Finance’s Lending System The lending system combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Smart contracts govern lending pools and adjust interest rates based on the market, offering stability to lenders and ensuring loans to borrowers. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): The decentralized method dispenses with middlemen and allows for direct connections between borrowers and lenders, offering both parties total autonomy. Security alongside transparency stand as main priorities for the platform through the implementation of open-source smart contracts and third-party audits. Long-term price value accrues from Mutuum Finance tokens because they generate passive earnings as well as experience appreciation and have a buyback system in place to support their value. The support for EVM and non-EVM blockchain protocols will enhance accessibility alongside increasing liquidity potential of the platform. $100,000 Giveaway and Community Incentives to Foster Growth Mutuum Finance is also creating its community through a $100,000 giveaway. Ten users will win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform’s referral system also incentivizes users to bring new joiners to the ecosystem, creating organic growth. Move Over XRP: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could 100x Before Ripple Blinks While Ripple (XRP) continues to chase a potential $7.50 target, its historically glacial climb and regulatory burden may have restive investors waiting. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going at lightning speed, already having raised over $7.4 million from 9,300+ investors, with Phase 4 sold out well over halfway. At just $0.025, early investors are positioned for a 140% gain at launch, with some experts forecasting a surge to $3 shortly after. This is more than hype, it’s a fast-closing window of explosive upside. If you’re serious about riding the next 100x wave, this is your moment. Secure your Mutuum Finance tokens before Phase 4 closes, because by the time XRP stirs, Mutuum Finance may already be rewriting the charts.

Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative Catalysts driving gains in IMX token Web3 gaming engagement climbed in Q1 2025 after a slowdown in the last quarter of 2024. A boost in user activity, interest in games, and user engagement caused native tokens of gaming blockchain platforms to note a rally in their prices. NFT may have lost relevance amidst the market turmoil, barring a few blue-chip projects like Pudgy Penguins, however data gathered by Messari shows that the pullback was modest. IMX announced its plans of merging into the zero-knowledged Immutable zkEVM chain to form a single unit, labeled “Immutable Chain.” The key technical development at a time when Web3 gaming gathers attention in the ecosystem, has acted as a catalyst for IMX price rally. Rising number of token holders drives consistent demand across exchange platforms and supports further gains in the web3 gaming token. Coupled with bullish on-chain and technical activity, IMX is in a position to extend gains. GameFi market insights Messari’s “State of ImmutableX Q1 2025” report notes that the average daily transactions on IMX climbed 5.7% QoQ. Web3 gaming growth supported the rise, IMX notes an underlying network activity resilience even as gaming engagement contracts on competitor platforms. NFT sales volume were hit 1.6% QoQ, the pullback to $78.3 million is considered modest, while in Q4 when ImmutableX’s competitors noted a decline in NFT sales, the platform recorded a 55.3% increase. The development lined up for late 2025, IMX’s merge into the Immutable Chain could act as a key catalyst and support a positive close to the last quarter of 2025. The IMT token’s releases slated for the year include games like Immortal Rising 2, and MARBLEX’s upcoming titles. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has softened its stance on crypto and web3 firms under the Trump administration. The SEC concluded its investigation into Immutable and took no enforcement action. The closing of the Wells Notice issued to the gaming platform serves as a positive development and a likely end to regulatory hurdles faced by the gaming token in 2025.

In an interview on the Kyle Chasse YouTube channel, Hayes says Bitcoin could reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2028. According to Hayes, the potential easing of US monetary policy will positively impact Bitcoin’s price. “…we know you’re going to print more money, we know that Bitcoin does best when money is printed. I don’t know, I can’t tell you what stock is going to do well, that’s hard. But I can tell you where Bitcoin’s going to go.” Hayes says the US budget deficit, which he sees continuing to increase even after the change of administration, will serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin’s potential rise to a price of $1 million. “Biden issued about $7.1 trillion of debt, the Treasury issuance over his term and we got Bitcoin 6x [from around $10,000 to over $60,000]… That’s a $7.1 trillion deficit. The deficit is already expanding under Trump… And if you think about the US population is getting over structurally. So Social Security and Medicare payments will rise structurally. They can’t stop that. The defense budget is going to only increase. They’re going to have to re-shore production, build a bunch more missiles and bullets and all that sort of stuff right. And so again, the deficit is only going one way – it’s going higher… So the things that drive the budget are only going up and interest on the Treasury debt again is expanding exponentially because even if Trump is successful on his plan, which is 3% deficit by 2028, because of where you started with, the size of the debt, your interest costs are still expanding exponentially. So again there’s just no way mathematically, unless they decide we’re going to shut down the government which is not what he’s talking about that they’re going to be able to spend less than Biden.” The BitMEX founder further says the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset will also positively impact the flagship crypto asset. “We now have an ETF, we now have this narrative in an institutional investor’s mind that, ‘Oh, Bitcoin is not just NASDAQ, high beta. It’s actually a hedge against the fall of American exceptionalism, the fall of the American hegemonic empire, maybe I should own some of this. This is going to do well.’” ?

Expert Analysis Sparks Bullish Buzz,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-uptrend-intact-expert-analysis-sparks-bullish-buzz/,"Dogecoin’s price rebounded to $0.186 after declining from $0.185 to $0.15 earlier in the week. The rebound is evidence of buyers coming in on lower prices, a sign some market observers view as continued strength for the meme cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development Analysts Monitor Long-Term Pattern Formation As far as analyst Steph is Crypto is concerned, Dogecoin still tracks what they refer to as a “Legendary trend-line” that extends between three significant price lows over several years. That support line started above $0.001 in early 2020, was again breached above $0.059 in 2024, and most recently broke below to find support around $0.14 in 2025. Each time the price struck this line, it has recoiled higher. Those who remain long on DOGE are “absolute legend,” Steph noted in their review, which gives a long-term price target of $10. That would be over 5,000% gain from present levels. #DOGECOIN road to $10! If you’re still holding $Doge, you’re an absolute legend. pic.twitter.com/ZppO6UTzSK — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 1, 2025 Daily Charts Display More Conservative View Other analysts provide a less aggressive prediction using daily chart trends: Dogecoin tends to rebound from a rising trendline, making a sequence of higher lows. Their findings indicate these rebounds tend to follow false reversals that occur before significant breakout movements. Previous Resistance Levels Become New Support Taking longer periods, another trend can be observed in the price movement of Dogecoin. As per analysis over three-day charts, earlier high values are seen to be acting as support levels subsequently. This came to pass when DOGE broke above $0.097 resistance late in 2023, then retreated to test that same level as support early in 2024. The same thing occurred with the July 2024 high of $0.146, which became a support level in April 2025.

While technical analysts had tested the $0.145 support point in April, they now look at $0.23 as the next level to watch as a resistance point. In case these trends remain consistent, some experts are of the opinion that Dogecoin might hit $0.80, which would be more than its all-time high of $0.73. Although these predictions are largely based on technical chart patterns and not fundamental considerations, the predictability of Dogecoin’s price structure has drawn the interest of some cryptocurrency market observers. The ascending trendline that has stood even during various market cycles is a primary indicator that most traders are monitoring to assess the strength of DOGE’s current position.

Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill on Friday that would have allowed the state to hold the digital asset as part of its official reserves. The legislation, known as Senate Bill 1025, proposed using seized funds to invest in BTC and create a digital assets reserve managed by the state. After passing the state House in a narrow 31–25 vote, the bill reached Hobbs' desk, where it was swiftly struck down. “The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans' retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу,” Hobbs wrote in a statement .

MUTM Shows Early Breakout Signals,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-crypto-to-buy-now-before-april-ends-mutm-shows-early-breakout-signals/,"The post Best Crypto to Buy Now Before April Ends? MUTM Shows Early Breakout Signals appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the month comes to a close, the cryptocurrency market is once again shifting. Investors are scanning the charts for early signs of breakout projects, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as one of the most promising plays before April ends. With strong momentum in its presale, increasing community activity, and a focus on real platform utilities, Mutuum Finance is starting to stand out. For anyone asking what crypto to buy now, MUTM offers a rare combination of early accessibility, solid fundamentals, and major upside potential that makes it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in at the moment. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized finance platform built to support lasting growth and stability. Unlike many speculative projects that rely purely on hype, Mutuum focuses on providing real-world use cases. Its platform enables users to earn passive income on their digital assets, access liquidity without selling holdings, and interact with a future-ready ecosystem. At the center of its ecosystem is the mtToken model. By depositing assets into Mutuum, users receive mtTokens that reflect both their initial deposit and the interest earned over time. The strength of this system lies in its simplicity — users can grow their holdings without the need for constant reinvestment or active yield chasing. Instead, their mtTokens naturally grow in value over time, creating an easy and automated way to build wealth in crypto. Mutuum is also actively working on launching its own overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin is minted directly through the platform, ensuring that every unit is backed by real on-chain collateral. Instead of relying on external stablecoins that may add counterparty risks, Mutuum’s built-in system preserves value inside the platform — strengthening liquidity, minimizing external reliance, and enhancing the overall resilience of its ecosystem. The Mutuum Finance presale has already captured significant attention. To date, it has raised over $7.3 million from a growing base of more than 9,200 holders, with over 432 million tokens sold. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM remains one of the best cryptos to buy now before wider exposure pushes prices higher. As Phase 4 of the presale nears completion, the price is set to rise to $0.03, marking a 20% increase. This incoming price adjustment is creating urgency among early investors who recognize that securing an entry before the next phase could mean locking in strong gains even before the token hits public exchanges. Several key factors are aligning to suggest that Mutuum Finance could be gearing up for a strong breakout. First, there’s the clear and steady whale accumulation happening behind the scenes — a classic signal that informed investors are preparing for a bigger move. Second, Mutuum’s real-world utility makes it more attractive than projects that rely purely on speculative trading. Its stablecoin system, passive income structure, and user-first design provide actual reasons to use and hold the token beyond short-term speculation. Finally, the Mutuum team has ambitious yet achievable goals. They plan to launch a beta version of the platform alongside the token’s official release, ensuring that users can immediately interact with core features. Additionally, the project is undergoing a CertiK audit to strengthen trust ahead of exchange listings — a necessary step that many serious investors look for before backing a new project. The closing days of April could present one of the best entry points for those serious about catching the next wave of DeFi growth. While established projects like Ethereum and Solana remain strong, they no longer offer the same outsized upside opportunities they once did. Newcomers like Mutuum Finance, with strong utility, passive income options, and an active development roadmap, are increasingly where smart money is flowing. For those exploring which crypto to buy today for future growth, MUTM offers one of the strongest setups in the market. As April comes to a close, it’s worth paying close attention to this rising DeFi contender — before the breakout becomes mainstream news.

Over recent months, DOGE has been consolidating within a narrow range of $0.13 to $0.25 , with key support levels at $0.30 and resistance around $0.48 . While analysts debate DOGE’s next move, savvy investors are pivoting to more promising projects like Ruvi , a rising star in the blockchain world offering groundbreaking presale rewards and unparalleled long-term potential. Dogecoin’s Mixed Market Sentiment Despite its rollercoaster performance, Dogecoin still holds onto its position as a top cryptocurrency by market cap, supported by vocal community members and occasional celebrity endorsements. However, its inability to breach critical resistance levels like $0.48 has left investors searching for alternative opportunities. Many are now looking toward Ruvi , which offers tangible rewards and a vision that extends beyond mere hype. Ruvi’s Approach to Blockchain Innovation Ruvi’s platform is setting a new standard in the crypto landscape by combining state-of-the-art technology with real-world applications . Its ecosystem integrates AI features , innovative DeFi tools , and green energy initiatives to solve pressing global challenges. But what truly captures the attention of early investors is Ruvi’s generously structured presale, which allows participants to benefit even before the official token launch. How Ruvi’s Presale Rewards Set a New Benchmark Ruvi’s presale offers are uniquely tailored to reward backers based on their level of commitment. Here’s how some potential investment scenarios could play out: Maximize Value with a Modest Investment If an investor puts in $1,200 during the presale at a rate of $0.01 per token , they would receive 120,000 tokens . Thanks to a generous 60% bonus , they’d gain an additional 72,000 tokens , totaling 192,000 tokens . If Ruvi’s token reaches $2.75 post-launch, the investment could grow to an impressive $528,000 . Achieve Significant Returns with Larger Contributions Investors with deeper pockets can benefit even more. For example, an investment of $10,000 at a presale rate of $0.01 per token nets 1,000,000 tokens , along with a 100% bonus , adding another 1,000,000 tokens for a total of 2,000,000 tokens . If the token hits $4.00 , this would amount to a $8 million payoff . Exclusive Benefits for Presale Investors Beyond financial rewards, presale participants unlock unique privileges such as priority access to platform features , advanced DeFi integrations, and governance rights , positioning them at the forefront of Ruvi’s ecosystem. Why Ruvi Stands Out in a Crowded Market Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on sentiment and unpredictable market shifts, Ruvi offers a more calculated and sustainable approach. With its deflationary tokenomics that include strategic buybacks and burns, Ruvi ensures scarcity and continual value growth. Furthermore, its focus on practical applications like AI-enhanced tools and environmental solutions gives the project real-world utility that appeals to both seasoned investors and newcomers. Seize This Opportunity Before It’s Gone While Dogecoin continues to face resistance and unpredictable price swings, Ruvi’s presale is presenting a rare window of opportunity for investors. With token bonuses, early access to exclusive features, and the potential for exponential returns, Ruvi is not just another crypto project; it’s a revolution in blockchain innovation.

ETH continues to rule market value through its 2025 trade price at $1800. The cryptocurrency market continues operating around the clock and Pepe (PEPE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have entered the scene with investment growth potential that surpasses expectations. Ethereum created the groundwork for these affordable tokens to experience an upcoming massive surge which enables initial investors a chance to win incredible profits. The specific trading features together with intense market interest create an exciting outlook for investors. Pepe’s meme-powered surge The cryptocurrency PEPE (PEPE) has experienced increased popular interest which causes price volatility at $0.00000714 and establishes a market value of $3.01 billion. The number of small traders who made deals valued at less than $1 caused transactions to jump by 67.4% even as the large investor group known as whales indicates there is still plenty of untouched market potential. Five wallets entered the market and acquired 611 billion tokens for $4.28 million through an eight-hour transaction period which signals intensifying enthusiasm. Fibonacci extensions in technical patterns indicate PEPE can experience a 480% to 796% surge by late 2025 set to reach a value of $0.0004264. The price movements of PEPE require strategic planning because the token shows volatility which interacts with a fixed resistance point at $0.00000737. Investors should approach the MUTM structured growth model due to its superior appeal compared to PEPE’s meme-driven strategy because PEPE remains riskier. Mutuum Finance’s presale frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts investor attention since its phase 4 presale began at $0.025 and attracted $7.6 million contributions from 9,400 investors who purchased 440 million tokens. Phase 5 of MUTM presale begins at $0.03 with a 20% increase from phase 4 which provides existing buyers with an instant profit. A Certik team audit of the smart contract will provide transparent results that the platform plans to release across social platforms. The introduction of a new dashboard system featuring the top 50 holders encourages friendly competition because these users receive token bonuses. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as the superior project because of its DeFi utility and systematic tokenomics which surpass the speculative nature of PEPE thus making it a stronger investment. Mutuum Finance’s ROI potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors expect to earn 140% profit because the $0.06 listing price was already accounted for in MUTM tokenomics. The market projection establishes a $2.50 value which indicates a 9,900% increase from its current trading price of $0.025. The lending mechanism coupled with buy-pressure model of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) results in ROI potential that surpasses the anticipated gains of PEPE. Phase 4 sale progress demonstrates an urgent pace because first investors are buying tokens ahead of a planned price hike. Real-world DeFi features such as overcollateralized lending bring stability to the project which meme coin PEPE lacks. Sealing wealth’s future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates superior potential compared to Pepe (PEPE) because it implements a strategic DeFi architecture along with explosive Return on Investment benefits. PEPE’s meteoric rise due to memes attracts investors though its market fluctuations exceed those experienced by Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) rising price trends. The closing phase of phase 4 offers investors a restricted opportunity to become part of the 9,400 active holders who will experience 28x gain potential.

The funds were stolen in a personalized scam that targeted an elderly investor active on multiple exchanges. ZachXBT Begins Freezing Funds From Bitcoin Heist Crypto sleuth ZachXBT announced that he and several collaborators have successfully frozen some of the Bitcoin (BTC) stolen in a $330 million heist that targeted an elderly investor. He also names two potential suspects but added that the investigation is ongoing. The case is a strange one. The target, an elderly Bitcoin whale active on multiple exchanges, acquired his crypto through “interesting” methods. However, the on-chain investigator did not elaborate on the topic further. The on-chain sleuth, one of the crypto industry’s most prominent figures, has made substantial progress in the case. The theft occurred on April 28, with ZachXBT issuing consistent updates about the case’s progress. As of May 3, ZachXBT and his associates, along with other volunteer investigators, have frozen $7 million of the stolen funds. However, over $300 million is still unaccounted for. “So far, $7 million+ has been frozen with the help of CF Investigators, tanuki42_, Binance’s Security team, and myself. Two suspects in the $330 million heist include ‘Nina/Mo’ a Somalian who operates a call scam center in Camden, UK, and an accomplice ‘W0rk’ who assisted with the site/call. They have since deleted social media accounts.” Details Of The Hack The target of the audacious heist was an elderly individual based in the United States. According to ZachXBT, the attackers used social engineering tactics, rendering all security measures ineffective. The attackers used Monero to launder the stolen funds, creating enough trading volume to impact the asset’s price. However, there are several unanswered questions about the heist. For starters ZachXBT did not release any details about the victim, only stating they were a longtime holder active on multiple exchanges. He also claimed that the $330 million came from “interesting” sources but did not provide any details and may never do so. ZachXBT also did not elaborate on the roles his associate investigators were playing in the investigation. However, Binance’s direct participation is noteworthy. The investigator also noted that the victim’s information was likely stolen from private data leaks. Last month, Binance users were targeted using a similar method.

BTC’s price action could signal renewed buying opportunities for traders as bulls eye a move past $100,000. US Unlikely To Add Bitcoin To Reserves: Arthur Hayes BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes the US government is unlikely to add more Bitcoin to its reserves, likely holding on to what it already has. Hayes believes this is due to high debt levels and the stereotype behind “Bitcoin bros.” Hayes added that he found it difficult to imagine a properly elected politician openly announcing the government would print money to buy Bitcoin. “The United States is a deficit country; the only way they can do a Strategic Reserve is not sell the Bitcoin they took from people, fine, that’s 200,000 Bitcoin. It's hard to imagine any “properly elected” politician openly announcing that the government plans to print money to buy Bitcoin, especially when the popular narrative is a bunch of Bitcoin bros going to the club. Is that really what you want people to think about your policy.” President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6 to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a digital asset stockpile. The US holds 198,012 Bitcoin worth over $18 billion. The assets were seized during criminal and civil cases, including BTC seized from the Silk Road and Bitfinex cases. However, industry experts believe if the US purchases Bitcoin, it could create an aggressive domino effect. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of exchange aggregator 1inch, believes if the US begins acquiring BTC , even smaller countries may struggle to purchase the asset. Brown University Enters ETF Space Brown University announced its arrival in the crypto ETF ecosystem with an investment of $4.9 million in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). According to disclosure documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the university purchased 105000 shares as its first quarter 2025 investment. The investment comprises 2.3% of its $216 million equity portfolio. The investment sees Brown University join other established educational institutions that are investing in digital assets through approved investment funds. Hedge funds, pension funds, and university endowments have invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs because they offer a dependable and well-known Bitcoin access method. Brown University has an impressive investment portfolio worth $7 billion, registering an impressive return of 11.3% in 2024. The portfolio is diversified across various asset classes. The university’s investment in Bitcoin ETFs could signal a potential shift in investment strategy. Franklin Templeton Backs Bitcoin DeFi Push The narrative around Bitcoin is quickly expanding beyond its traditional role as a store of value to a potential DeFi asset. Industry players, including Franklin Templeton, view the development as a positive step towards enhancing Bitcoin’s utility without diluting its appeal as a store of value. Kevin Farrelly, Managing Principal of blockchain venture capital at Franklin Templeton, explained during his keynote address at the Bitlayer side event this week, “I don’t think focusing on Bitcoin DeFi will dilute or complicate Bitcoin’s core narrative. Instead, it expands Bitcoin’s utility for a specific type of investor — one with enough technical sophistication to optimize for yield, security, or custom portfolio needs. These users aren’t replacing the 'store of value' thesis; they’re building on it. It's not narrative dilution, it's infrastructure evolution.” Franklin Templeton has invested in Bitlayer, a BitVM serving as Bitcoin’s computational layer while preserving the mainnet’s security. Bitlayer offers lower fees, faster transaction speeds, smart contract functionalities, and advanced DeFi integrations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $90,000 on Friday as bullish momentum intensified. However, the flagship cryptocurrency fell back to $96,369, facing one last resistance level before a potential move to $100,000. All eyes are at this level, which could trigger profit-taking, or act as a springboard towards a new all-time high. One analyst believes the flagship cryptocurrency could hit a new all-time high within the next 100 days. The analyst tied BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), an indicator measuring 30-day market volatility expectations, pointing out that the indicator dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 days. A VIX score below 18 indicates a risk-on environment, favoring assets like BTC . The analyst's model, which had a 95% accuracy, predicted a target of $135,000 within the next 30 days in the VIX remains low. Speaking about Bitcoin’s volatility, Fidelity’s director of global macro, Jurrien Timmer, stated, “Bitcoin is slightly different than gold since it has this Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde personality where you never quite know which Bitcoin is going to show up to the party. Will it be the exponential gold bitcoin (hard money and store of value), or will it be a NASDAQ-like speculative asset?” BTC registered a substantial rise last Monday (April 21), rising nearly 3%. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rallied almost 7%, surging past $90,000 and settling at $93,373. The rally stalled on Wednesday after encountering volatility and selling pressure. Despite this, BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $93,749. The price fell to an intraday low of $91,693 as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, BTC rebounded from this level to claim $94,000 and settle at $94,009. The price continued to push higher on Friday, increasing nearly 1% and settling at $94,776. Source: TradingView Price action turned bearish over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday and fell 0.99% on Sunday to settle at $93,802. The current week started on a bullish note as BTC rose 1.29% to cross $95,000 and settle at $95,010. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as the price fell 0.70% to $94,341. BTC encountered volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $94,160. BTC rebounded on Thursday, rising over 2% to surge past $96,000 and settle at $96,452, but not before reaching an intraday high of $97,406. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose 0.50% to $96,939 after reaching an intraday high of $97,996. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The announcement was made by Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, during a crypto convention in Dubai, where he appeared alongside Eric Trump, according to a report from ABC News . “We are excited to announce today that USD1 has been selected as the official stablecoin to close MGX’s $2 billion investment in Binance,” Witkoff said in a video shared on X (formerly Twitter). “We thank MGX and Binance for their trust in us, and I think it’s only the beginning.” $2B Deal Could Be a Pivotal Moment for Trump-Backed Crypto Venture This deal could mark a major turning point for the Trump-backed venture. World Liberty Financial, which includes Donald Trump and his sons Eric and Don Jr. among its supporters, has drawn scrutiny ever since its launch due to the former president’s previous criticism of cryptocurrencies as a “scam.” The project’s business model has remained vague, but the MGX deal places it at the center of one of the largest crypto transactions of the year. Ethics experts have raised concerns about the potential conflicts of interest posed by Trump’s financial ties to cryptocurrency while maintaining a political presence. “The president is exploiting the loopholes in ethics laws that allow sitting presidents to retain financial interests,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. The White House has not disclosed how Trump’s crypto-related interests are managed. Remember when Republicans lost their minds because Hunter Biden made money from a Ukrainian gas company?

Sun, who has a history of regulatory scrutiny, became one of World Liberty Financial’s largest backers just a day before Trump’s 2024 inauguration, reportedly purchasing $75 million worth of WLFI, another token issued by the company. A month later, a fraud case against Sun was dropped by SEC lawyers under the Trump administration. World Liberty Financial to Integrate USD1 Witkoff also revealed that World Liberty Financial will integrate USD1 natively with the Tron blockchain, founded by Sun. He claimed that the company expects to mint “hundreds of millions to billions of dollars” worth of USD1, which he described as “the most transparent, the most regulated stablecoin in the world,” backed one-to-one with short-term treasuries and cash equivalents. Last week, the Trump Organization said it would begin accepting cryptocurrency payments for property sales at its $1 billion luxury tower in Dubai, deepening its expansion into digital assets and the Gulf region’s high-end real estate market. The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, unveiled earlier this year, is the latest in the family’s partnership with UAE-based Damac Properties. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the media company behind Truth Social, is weighing the launch of a utility token and a digital wallet as part of an expansion of its streaming platform, Truth+.

The company said it secured the funding through a convertible note facility with an institutional investor, with an initial $1 million tranche already committed. The capital will be used solely to acquire TRUMP tokens, making it one of the first publicly listed companies to do so. The decision follows a separate investment in AI-linked FET tokens currently valued at $8 million, which the company says supports AI tools used across its logistics platforms. Buying digital assets for publicly traded companies isn't a new strategy. Michael Saylor championed it with a bitcoin strategy, and others, such as Semler Scientific (SMLR), followed through. Most recently, Cantor (CEP) is making a splash with huge dry powder to do the same. Meanwhile, companies such as Sol Strategies (HODL) and Janover (JNVR) are buying up SOL tokens to give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency. The trend is also picking up in Japan, where hotel firm Metaplanet has recently hit 5,000 BTC on its balance sheet and issued $25 million in bonds to fund additional purchases. Smaller firms, including Value Creation, Remixpoint, NEXON, Anap Holdings, and WEMADE are also accumulating the cryptocurrency. However, Freight's mandate is slightly different: to influence the U.S.-Mexico trade deal amid President Trump's all-out trade war . ""We believe that the addition of the Official Trump tokens are an excellent way to diversify our crypto treasury, and also an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the US,"" Javier Selgas, the company's CEO, said in a press release on April 30. While such a strategy could help a company such as Freight, influencing presidential decisions by buying a memecoin could bring up the question of conflict of interest. Just recently, Trump said he will hold a private dinner with top token holders, drawing outcry from Democratic lawmakers, who cited the president’s involvement with the token as potential grounds for impeachment. On April 25, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) pointed to the crypto project offering its top holders an invitation to a dinner event with President Trump, calling it a clear case of selling access to the presidency. For Freight, whose stock price plunged nearly 90% in the last 12 months and is heavily tied to cross-border trading, it seems this might be the best way to keep share prices afloat. “At the heart of Fr8Tech’s mission is the promotion of productive and active commerce between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is the United States’ top goods trading partner, with Mexico being the leading destination for US exports and the top source for US imports,"" Selgas added. After announcing the move, Freight Technologies’ shares jumped over 111% before the closing bell on Friday. However, in after-hours trading, the stock plunged 21.6%. Freight Technologies’ product lineup includes a suite of applications, ranging from cross-border freight booking to transportation management, all aimed at modernizing the flow of goods in North America. Other companies have made investments in the crypto space linked to the U.S. President. Last month, DWF Labs invested $25 million in the decentralized finance protocol backed by Trump and his family, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), as it moved to establish a physical presence in the U.S. The investment gives DWF Labs a governance stake in the project, which has been accumulating various cryptocurrencies and is set to soon launch a stablecoin backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents, called USD1 . TRUMP tokens are trading at $12.7, up just 0.1% for the day and 42% in the last 30 days.

Two men from Houston have admitted to being part of a scheme to steal new credit cards and bank statements in the mail, reports FOX 26. At least 120 credit cards were stolen in the scheme, with the criminals activating the cards, increasing credit limits and altering account information. This week, 39 year-old Bradley Kane Zarco and 28 year-old Travis Castaneda Qawasmeh pleaded guilty to using the cards to buy retail items, gift cards and withdraw cash over the course of six months. Three others – 43 year-old Christopher McGee, 37 year-old Daniel Sanchez and 64 year-old Omokehinde Muyiwa Oyegoke-Tewogbade have also pleaded guilty in the case. Sanchez was sentenced to 41 months in prison in February, and the other men face up to five years for conspiracy, with Christopher McGee also facing an additional mandatory two-year term for aggravated identity theft.

BTC 7-day volatility hits 563 day low pic.twitter.com/9xvvQ3t6N7 — Vetle Lunde (@VetleLunde) April 30, 2025 Meanwhile, 30-day Bitcoin price volatility against the US dollar has steadily ratcheted down. BTC volatility has been receding since 2011 and since 2021, according to data from BitBo and TheBlock. Low Bitcoin Volatility: Bullish or Bearish for Price? Low volatility can be bearish for cryptocurrencies and stocks. That’s because during bull markets prices tend to swing upward with more volume and correct more suddenly. As a result, some traders may interpret low volatility as a sell or wait signal. But, Bitcoin’s chart technicals achieved this landmark record during a fierce BTC rally on Wall Street funds and crypto exchanges. So, it may be difficult to fit this into the bigger picture as a bearish sign. Instead, low BTC volatility may simply be the result of Bitcoin now having such a high market cap, near the $2 trillion notch to start May, that liquidity runs smoother. Whale-sized participants no longer have the volatile splash effect on the overall market they once had. Fidelity: Many Stocks More Volatile Than BTC Overall, that’s a bullish milestone for Bitcoin. It means the network has grown in capitalization at such a startling pace that now it doesn’t bob up and down so much like a small boat in the ocean. Instead, it moves more like a large, well-keeled, and stately craft. A Fidelity Digital Assets research study from last year pointed out some interesting facts about BTC’s price fluctuations, such as, “Bitcoin is volatile, but less so than many popular mega-cap stocks.” The Boston-based mega investment corporation also said, “Bitcoin is currently less volatile than 33 S&P 500 stocks, and as recently as late 2023, there were 92 S&P 500 stocks more volatile than bitcoin.” The report nailed one projection: “Bitcoin’s volatility has declined and is expected to continue doing so.” Meanwhile, the crypto’s price has been rapidly increasing after the early April low of under $75,000 and is knocking on the $100,000 door.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says it aims to develop a “safe, competitive, and sustainable” digital asset sector. “Long-term confidence in crypto assets depends on clear regulation to promote market integrity and appropriate consumer protection. We are seeking input into how the unique aspects of crypto assets should be considered in our future regulatory regime. We want an open discussion on the features of the future regime, with this latest Discussion Paper (DP) seeking views on how we regulate trading platforms, intermediaries, staking, lending and borrowing, and decentralized finance. We are also seeking feedback on the use of credit to purchase crypto assets.” The regulator says a discussion paper and its proposals were developed after extensive consultation with crypto industry professionals, digital asset consumers and stakeholders in the traditional finance sector. The FCA aims to restrict credit card usage when buying crypto, and earlier this year, the regulator moved to ban digital asset ads, managing to cut the advertisements down by 50%. The financial watchdog says it is now making “good progress” with tech companies in regulating the banned advertisements but is still concerned about the prevalence of scams online.

Speaking during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, Warren said straight up, “What has happened in the last 30, 45 days … is really nothing.” He downplayed the recent volatility that’s shaken up traders and left analysts scrambling for explanations. Warren reminded investors that Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has fallen by 50% three different times in the last sixty years. None of those drops were caused by anything broken inside the business. He said the same thing now—there’s no actual issue. “This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,” Warren said. He didn’t flinch once while saying it. Buffett tells investors to stop freaking out over stocks According to the meeting’s livestream from CNBC, Warren explained that today’s conditions don’t even come close to past crashes. People are acting like the sky is falling, but he said they’re just being overly emotional. “If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15% or not, you need to get a somewhat different investment philosophy,” Warren said. “The world is not going to adapt to you. You’re going to have to adapt to the world.” He gave people a long-term reminder. On his birthday, August 30, 1930, the Dow Jones was sitting at 240. It later dropped as low as 41. But on Friday, it closed over 41,300. That’s the kind of scale Warren was working with. “People have emotions,” he said. “But you got to check them at the door when you invest.” Investors had been rattled over Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which triggered chaos in the markets last month. The S&P 500 dropped into bear market territory on an intraday basis, meaning it fell more than 20% from a recent high. But by Friday, it had pushed through and logged its longest winning streak since 2004. Warren said none of that should be taken as anything new or surprising. He pointed out that some earlier downturns were a lot worse. Buffett slams tariffs and warns about protectionism Warren also came for Trump’s economic approach. Without saying his name, he called out the White House’s decision to slap heavy tariffs on imports, calling it a bad strategy. “Trade should not be a weapon,” Warren said in front of thousands of shareholders in Omaha. “I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, it won’t be at our expense, the more prosperous we’ll become, and the safer we’ll feel, and your children will feel someday.” He warned that tariffs “can be an act of war” and said they’re doing real damage. “Just the attitudes it’s brought out,” he added. He said the U.S. should trade openly and let everyone do what they’re best at. “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world and we should do what we do best and they should do what they do best.” Trump’s government had already slapped 145% tariffs on Chinese imports earlier this year. China hit back with 125% in return. Things got so tense the White House suddenly paused most of the increases for 90 days, except with China, while trying to make deals. Warren didn’t buy into the tough talk. “It’s a big mistake, in my view, when you have seven and a half billion people that don’t like you very well, and you got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they’ve done,” he said. “I don’t think it’s right, and I don’t think it’s wise.” Warren reminded people that the United States started from zero just 250 years ago and became the world’s biggest industrial power. “There’s not been anything like it,” he said. But now, protectionism could chip away at that position. He didn’t offer a plan. He didn’t sugarcoat. He just gave his view. Warren Edward Buffett. Source: Warren Buffett Twitter/X Investors had shown up to the meeting hungry for answers about what’s next. Berkshire controls pieces of a massive mix of American businesses—insurance, energy, retail, transportation, and more. The GDP had just shown its first contraction since 2022, and everyone wanted Warren’s take. Berkshire’s first-quarter earnings report said that tariffs and global politics have added “considerable uncertainty.” The company said it can’t predict the full damage yet. Meanwhile, Warren has been offloading stocks nonstop. He’s been selling for ten straight quarters. In 2024, Berkshire dumped more than $134 billion worth of stock. Most of that came from pulling out of Apple and Bank of America—the company’s two biggest holdings. That selloff left Warren with a record-setting $347 billion in cash by the end of March. He hasn’t said what he plans to do with it. But one thing’s clear: he’s not chasing the hype. He’s not riding the panic. He’s playing his own game.

Sui ( SUI ) token was trading at $3.40 on Saturday, up by 94% from its highest level in April this year. Third-party data shows that Sui has become one of the fastest-growing players in the crypto industry this year. The amount of assets locked in its decentralized exchange network has jumped by 40% in the last 30 days, to $2.45 billion. This growth has made it the 9th biggest blockchain in the industry, bigger than popular networks like Avalanche ( AVAX ), Polygon ( POL ), and Cardano. Further data shows that Sui’s stablecoin market cap has jumped to $897 million, meaning that it may soon cross the $1 billion milestone. The number of stablecoins in a blockchain network is a positive sign as it shows that users are actively interacting with it.

Their total transaction volume stood at over $2.9 billion in the last seven days and $11.2 billion in the previous 30 days. Cetus, Momentum, and Bluefin led the market share in this. Meanwhile, the eight-hour funding rate has turned positive and is pointing upwards, signaling that the price of a perpetual contract is higher than the spot one. It is a bullish sign as it signals that more traders are betting on the price increase.

IOTA Price To Rally As ETH ETF Sees Inflow of 40K,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-referral-program-sends-presale-soaring-to-225m-iota-price-to-rally-as-eth-etf-sees-inflow-of-40k/,"Some projects are gaining ground through tech upgrades, others through renewed investor confidence. The IOTA price has shown real traction ahead of its Rebased upgrade, climbing steadily for over a week and drawing fresh attention from traders looking for smart contract utility and staking options. Meanwhile, institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH) is ticking back up, as the Ethereum ETF space sees inflows for the first time in two months. These signs reflect growing interest in network development and long-term use cases. BlockDAG (BDAG) is gunning to be a top decentralized crypto with a new referral system and a $0.0019 price that’s turning casual backers into early earners. BDAG holders are referring their friends and claiming 25% bonuses. The Presale has soared past $225 million and is speeding up. IOTA Price Maintains Climb Ahead of Rebased Upgrade The IOTA price continues to trend upward as traders anticipate the Rebased upgrade set for May 5. After ten consecutive days of gains, the IOTA price reached $0.2415, its highest level in over two months and 85% above April’s low. The upgrade brings staking, smart contract integration, and improved developer tools, which may further support price growth. A shift to delegated proof-of-stake and partnerships with validators like Ankr and Nansen has brought additional confidence. Analysts now suggest the IOTA price could rally toward the $0.42 range if current support holds. Current indicators and chart patterns continue to keep the short-term IOTA price outlook optimistic as the network prepares for its next major step. Ethereum ETF Inflows Return as Market Sentiment Shifts Institutional sentiment toward the Ethereum (ETH) ETF space may be shifting again after a recent inflow of 40,000 ETH, ending an eight-week streak of outflows. While the volume is relatively modest, this change comes alongside broader market gains and improving sentiment around Ethereum’s upcoming developments. CoinShares noted $183 million in inflows into Ethereum-related investment products last week, reinforcing renewed interest. Analysts are now watching Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and proposed enhancements like EIP-9698, which could significantly improve network scalability. These changes may continue to influence institutional positioning as infrastructure strengthens and long-term investment strategies begin to adjust within the Ethereum ETF space. BlockDAG Referral Program Launched, Be First to Earn! BlockDAG (BDAG) has officially launched its referral program, giving early users a chance to rack up BDAG rewards before prices rise again. Anyone who shares their referral link earns 25% BDAG on confirmed purchases made through it. Each friend who joins gets a 5% bonus on their first buy, creating a simple win-win for both sides. The presale price is currently locked at $0.0019 until May 13, down from the current price of $0.0262 in batch 38. At launch, BDAG is expected to list at $0.05, making it a strong entry point. More than $225 million has already been raised in the presale, with 19.6 billion coins sold. Early backers are already seeing returns as high as 2,520%, and the presale continues to draw interest from those watching for early wins. Even a small buy-in paired with a few shared links can grow into a solid stack of BDAG. The referral setup is simple: log in, copy the link, share it anywhere, and get rewarded once the transaction confirms on-chain. This is a limited window to lock in thousands of coins at under a penny. For those exploring the top decentralized crypto projects with built-in earning potential, BlockDAG’s referral system adds extra fuel to an already strong presale. Timing matters, being early could mean stacking more BDAG before prices move. Timing Is Meeting Opportunity Crypto watchers are getting a mix of updates worth noting. The IOTA price is gaining traction thanks to its upcoming network overhaul, and the Ethereum ETF space is starting to attract institutional flows again, hinting at renewed confidence. Each project offers its own appeal, depending on how long-term or early-stage a holder wants to be. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s referral program gives everyday users an easy way to stack rewards through simple sharing. At $0.0019 until May 13, and with over $225 million already raised, BlockDAG is building strong interest. For anyone eyeing the top decentralized crypto projects, this may be one of the easiest starting points.

44113236,https://nulltx.com/?p=148770,1746291609,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Refer 3 Friends, Earn $3,750 in BDAG – Best Long Term Crypto Opportunity",https://nulltx.com/refer-3-friends-earn-3750-in-bdag-best-long-term-crypto-opportunity/,"Earn $3,750 by Referring 3 Friends: BlockDAG’s Referral Program Could Be the Best Long Term Crypto Move Yet In the world of digital assets, real value is often driven by real people. That’s exactly the foundation of BlockDAG’s explosive growth, and now, they’re giving users a major reason to join the movement. With a limited-time offer, users who refer just three friends to invest in the BlockDAG presale can earn a massive $3,750 in BDAG coins. Better yet, each of those three friends also receives a 5% coin bonus. As the price of BDAG rises rapidly and exchange listings loom, this referral opportunity offers more than hype; it’s a real chance to profit through network-driven momentum. A Reward Model That Works At its core, BlockDAG is proving that crypto success doesn’t always have to come from complex trading strategies or massive capital. Sometimes, it’s about having a community that’s aligned and incentivized. The current referral structure is simple: refer three people who each purchase $5,000 in BDAG during the presale, and you get $3,750 in BDAG rewards. It’s direct, it’s rewarding, and it brings actual utility to a user’s social capital. This is more than just a marketing trick; BlockDAG is using this program to build deeper community engagement. It’s not about vague future promises. It’s about giving users value now, while growing a decentralized network that benefits everyone involved. It’s also a refreshing shift away from expensive influencer campaigns, instead rewarding actual believers who spread the word organically. Timing Is Everything, And the Clock Is Ticking The window of opportunity here is shrinking fast. Right now, BlockDAG is in batch 27 of its presale. The current price per coin is $0.0262, but for those who act before May 13th, the limited-time offer price is just $0.0019. That’s a massive discount and explains why over 19.6 billion coins have already been sold. With $225 million raised so far, investor confidence is clearly high. To put that into perspective, the return on investment since the first batch has skyrocketed by 2,520%. And with exchange listings set to go live on May 13th, there’s a limited window to get in at this price before the rest of the market gets access. The referral program adds an extra layer of urgency and opportunity, especially for those who have a strong network and want to turn it into serious crypto value. The Best Long Term Crypto for Community Builders What makes BlockDAG stand out isn’t just the referral bonus; it’s the broader strategy behind it. Instead of pouring money into traditional advertising, the project is doubling down on community empowerment. That approach makes BlockDAG a strong candidate for anyone looking for the best long term crypto to support or invest in. Why? Because community-driven ecosystems have staying power. They grow organically, they retain loyalty, and they generate lasting value. For those who see crypto not just as a speculative bet but as a space to build and contribute, BlockDAG offers a compelling value proposition. You’re not just earning by holding a coin; you’re actively growing the network and being rewarded for it. That’s exactly the type of coin economy that often builds long-term success. And with its price set to jump post-May 13, early adopters could be locking in one of the strongest opportunities of the year. Final Thoughts: Act Now or Watch It Pass You By The BDAG coin is gaining serious traction, and the numbers back it up. With over $225 million raised, more than 19.6 billion coins sold, and an ROI since batch 1 of 2,520%, the momentum is clear. The special price of $0.0019 is valid only until May 13, when BDAG hits exchanges, likely triggering a rush of public buyers. Whether you’re an influencer, a crypto enthusiast, or just someone with a few engaged friends, this referral program could be your chance to turn social connections into crypto capital. BlockDAG isn’t just growing; it’s inviting its users to grow with it. For those looking for the best long term crypto that blends early-stage opportunity with tangible rewards, this might just be it.

Experts Predict 10,000% Price Increase While Cardano (ADA) Hopes For ETF Approval",https://timestabloid.com/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-be-cryptos-next-100x-gem-experts-predict/,"Cardano (ADA) is stirring excitement in the crypto space with bullish flag patterns pointing to potential surges past $1 in May 2025. ADA’s upcoming ETF approval and ecosystem upgrades build strong momentum. However, while Cardano excels in blockchain protocols, a new contender, Ruvi , is poised to disrupt the industry. Combining blockchain innovation with artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi is creating massive opportunities for early investors. If you’re intrigued by Cardano’s rise, Ruvi offers a chance to join crypto history in the making. Ruvi vs. Cardano: The Features That Set Ruvi Apart Cardano gets praise for its scalability, layered architecture, and growing DeFi adoption, especially with its LAOS upgrades. But while Cardano focuses heavily on protocol improvements, Ruvi goes beyond that by offering real-world AI integrations that create practical, revenue-generating applications. Here’s why Ruvi stands out. Key Differentiators Deflationary Token Setup Unlike ADA, which faces inflation risks, Ruvi maintains a fixed supply of 1.5 billion tokens , driving long-term value as its utility scales. AI-Powered Use Cases With applications in fraud detection, logistics optimization, and creator monetization, Ruvi is solving today’s enterprise-level problems using tomorrow’s technology. Utility Beyond Investment Ruvi isn’t just a token to hold; its AI applications empower businesses, improve supply chains, and expand creator economies, providing ongoing demand for tokens. Cardano may be in the spotlight today, but Ruvi’s unique approach has it positioned as the next big name in blockchain. Why Ruvi’s Presale Offers Incredible Opportunities Timing matters in investments, and Ruvi’s VIP presale structure rewards those who act early. The system is simple but powerful, offering substantial bonuses that amplify token holdings and future returns. Here’s what your investment could look like. $500 Starter Example Investing $500 earns you 50,000 Ruvi tokens at $0.01 each. A 40% bonus adds 20,000 extra tokens , bringing your total to 70,000 tokens . If Ruvi hits $0.75 , your portfolio would surge to $52,500 , reflecting a 10,050% ROI . $5,000 Intermediate Example A $5,000 stake secures 500,000 tokens . Add in Ruvi’s 100% bonus , and your total jumps to 1,000,000 tokens . With a projected valuation at $1.80 , this turns into $1,800,000 . That’s an astonishing return for an early participant. $15,000 Big-League Example For those ready to go all-in, a $15,000 investment delivers 1.5 million tokens , doubled to 3 million tokens with Ruvi’s 100% bonus structure . If Ruvi reaches $2.50 , that initial stake grows to a life-changing $7.5 million . How Ruvi Stacks Up Against Cardano’s ETF Hype Cardano leads in institutional partnerships and DeFi adoption, with analysts predicting up to $1.30 pricing if support levels hold steady. However, the more established it gets, the harder it is for ADA to yield exponential returns, especially with over 35 billion tokens already circulating. Ruvi, still in its nascent phase, offers the possibility of massive multipliers thanks to its smaller cap, robust tokenomics, and broader industry applications. Ruvi isn’t playing catch-up; it’s defining a new path forward with a blockchain ecosystem built on real-world solutions. Why You Can’t Afford to Wait Cryptocurrency rewards early movers who act before the crowd. Ruvi’s AI-enhanced vision and killer presale bonuses make this your chance to secure life-changing gains. With tokens priced at only $0.01 in its presale, missing out means watching others profit while you stay on the sidelines. Learn from missed opportunities in the past, whether it was Bitcoin at $10 or ADA before its $3 peak. The crypto world never sleeps, and neither should bold investors ready to take control of their financial future. Final Call to Action With Ruvi’s presale heating up and Cardano paving the way for crypto’s next chapter, it’s time to make a decision. Will you be a spectator or a participant? The future favors those who act, and Ruvi offers the tools to elevate your portfolio like never before.

Here’s What Just Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-death-cross-denied-heres-what-just-happened/,"Recent movements in XRP’s price action have drawn attention, especially after a bearish signal failed to develop as anticipated. Traders closely watching for a potential death cross on the hourly chart were met with a different outcome, as the asset held steady and avoided a deeper downturn. The last death cross on XRP’s chart formed in March and caused a decline to $1.9166, the asset’s lowest price of 2025. However, the asset’s recent resilience and avoidance of this pattern have shifted focus back to consolidation and the possibility of a future breakout. Death Cross Signal Weakens as Price Stabilizes A death cross typically suggests bearish sentiment, marked by the 50-period moving average crossing below the 200-period moving average. In XRP’s case, this formation began to emerge on the hourly chart, raising concerns among market participants expecting further downside. Source: TradingView However, instead of accelerating lower, the asset began trading in a narrow range, hovering between its hourly 50- and 200-period moving averages near the $2.2 to $2.22 level. The asset’s market cap initially dipped below $130 billion on May 1 after a report of Ripple’s attempt to acquire Circle for $20 billion , but it recovered quickly and is now trading at $2.21, with a market cap of $129.46 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This stabilization has temporarily neutralized immediate bearish pressure. The absence of a sharp decline after the initial setup indicates that sellers may be losing momentum. As a result, traders are now closely observing whether the digital asset will gather enough strength to move decisively in either direction. Daily Chart Reveals Critical Support Retest Zooming to the daily timeframe, XRP showed resilience after a minor slip. On April 30, the asset reached a local low near $2.124 but recovered, pushing back above its 50-day simple moving average, which currently stands around $2.19. This level remains a key area to watch, as it has served as dynamic support during recent price action. If XRP fails to sustain its position above $2.19, renewed selling pressure could drag it back toward the $2.1 to $2 support zone. A breakdown below that range may bring bearish and lower support levels back into focus. The asset is currently above this crucial level, and holding above it could open the door for upward continuation, especially if bullish sentiment builds across the broader market. If XRP maintains its footing above the 50-day SMA, traders may target a climb toward the $2.5 to $2.65 region, with a longer-term objective around $3 .

The bill would mandate the U.S. government to buy a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoins over five years. “I’m particularly pleased with President Trump’s support for my strategic Bitcoin reserve initiative,” said Lummis during her Senate speech. She emphasized that the reserve would help manage the national debt and reinforce America’s leadership in financial technology. The BITCOIN Act: A Path to Crypto Dominance If passed, the BITCOIN Act would render the U.S. the global leader in Bitcoin ownership with about 4.7% of the capped total supply of 21 million BTC. The bill calls for a multi-year plan of purchasing 1 million BTC, significantly more than the current U.S. government holdings of about 198,000 BTC. At current valuations, purchasing the remaining 802,000 BTC would cost about $76 billion. But the real cost may rise very fast because government buying pressure would surely drive the price of Bitcoin up, considering its relatively illiquid market. Bitcoin as a Tool for Economic Empowerment Lummis highlighted the role of Bitcoin as empowering, stating it makes control return to the hands of common workers. “Bitcoin puts the average American and the average worker everywhere in the world in control of their own money,” she stated. She also added that as the usage of Bitcoin is expanded, it strengthens and secures the financial system. Thus, Lummis believes that the U.S. should be leading the way in integrating Bitcoin into its financial system. Strategic Impact and Market Competition Such a strategic reserve of Bitcoin would not just transform U.S. monetary policy but could also create hysterical market activity. Giant players like Strategy, which recently invested $84 million in Bitcoin, can look forward to being contested by the federal government. If the BITCOIN Act becomes law, it would be a bold and historic shift in U.S. financial policy—aligning national security, monetary stability, and innovation with digital assets.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-03 17:10:00

Avalanche’s latest announcement about ramping up its subnet adoption has the blockchain crowd buzzing. Meanwhile, Polkadot’s parachain updates are firing up conversations on Twitter, Discord, and every crypto chat you can imagine. Both of these projects are doing things that even two years ago would’ve sounded crazy. Then there’s Qubetics, sliding into the spotlight like it owns the stage. Unlike older blockchains scrambling to fix what’s broken, Qubetics seems built for the wild future of finance and tech. It’s not just patching up potholes—it’s paving brand-new highways. And that’s got some pretty big names in blockchain sitting up straight. With a presale heating up and its QubeQode ecosystem cooking, it’s fair to say it’s caught the attention of anybody looking for the Best Crypto Presale to Join In May 2025 . But why does Qubetics feel different? Why is it gaining traction when older projects struggle with scalability, user-friendliness, and cost efficiency? Let’s roll through it. Qubetics ($TICS): The Game-Changer Redefining Blockchain Utility Qubetics isn’t just dropping another token into the ocean. It’s tossing a whole cruise ship in. With the 32nd crypto presale stage live, Qubetics has already sold 510 million tokens to over 25,600+ holders, hauling in a wild $16.6 million in the process. Right now, anyone can snag $TICS for $0.2093—a price that feels almost suspiciously low given what’s under the hood. The QubeQode and Qubetics IDE are huge parts of that excitement. These platforms simplify blockchain development for businesses, developers, and even regular folks who just want to tap into Web3 without a PhD in cryptography. Whether it’s building dApps, managing assets, or creating smart contracts, QubeQode turns messy blockchain coding into something that feels, dare it be said, almost easy. Industry analysts have thrown out some eyebrow-raising projections: $TICS at $1 post-presale? That’s a 377% ROI. $TICS at $5? That’s a 2288% ROI. $TICS reaching $15 after mainnet launch? A staggering 7066% ROI. There’s even chatter among experts about $TICS landing somewhere between $10–$15 after full deployment. While it’s smart to keep two feet on the ground, those numbers explain why Qubetics tops every “Best Crypto Presale to Join In May 2025” list right now. The presale success, combined with QubeQode’s real-world business applications, makes Qubetics not just another blockchain—it’s the toolkit tomorrow’s digital economy might depend on. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling Smarter, Not Harder Avalanche has never been about slow and steady. This blockchain network exploded onto the scene boasting insane transaction speeds and crazy-low fees—and it’s living up to that hype in 2025. Recently, Avalanche announced a significant update to its subnet framework, making it even easier for companies to spin up their own blockchains within Avalanche’s network. Think about it like renting an apartment inside a mega-luxury skyscraper—you get privacy, but with all the perks of being connected to a top-tier infrastructure. This move has caught the eye of DeFi builders and even traditional companies flirting with Web3. Major names are setting up shop and creating tailored blockchains that work like custom-fit sneakers for whatever they need—finance, supply chains, gaming, you name it. But Avalanche isn’t perfect. Competition is stiff, and awesome subnets can become fragmented without strong coordination. Still, Avalanche’s constant evolution makes it one of the most exciting L1 players out there. Polkadot (DOT): Tying Blockchain Together Like a Boss Polkadot feels like that friend who knows everybody and can hook you up with anyone you want to meet. Built around parachains—essentially individual blockchains that connect to Polkadot’s central relay chain—it’s designed to solve one of crypto’s messiest headaches: interoperability. In 2025, Polkadot has taken this mission even further. Its recent parachain auctions broke participation records, with more projects than ever trying to lock down a slot. These new chains focus on everything from DeFi innovations to real-world asset tokenization (yeah, think about cross-border real estate deals being handled entirely on-chain). What really sets Polkadot apart is its approach to governance. Instead of hard forks tearing the network apart like messy divorces, Polkadot upgrades itself smoothly through on-chain governance models. It’s like watching a Tesla get an overnight update instead of dragging it to a mechanic. Still, the project does have hurdles. Interoperability is complex, and making sure parachains work seamlessly isn’t always easy street. But if there’s one project stubborn enough and smart enough to pull it off, it’s DOT. QubeQode and Qubetics IDE: Why They’re the Future of Blockchain Development One of the brightest gems inside the Qubetics universe is QubeQode paired with the Qubetics IDE.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, the DAO representatives outlined three major benefits unique to tokenized gold, including 1:1 redeemability for a specific quantity of physical, serialized gold, usage as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and transactional efficiency through on-demand liquidity. ""When you buy an ETF, you are betting on the gold price going up, but you do not own any specific gold bar,"" Song told Cointelegraph. The pair added that the price of gold surged in 2025 due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty, the high level of US government debt , and geopolitical tensions that are reshaping the global monetary order. Gold’s price hits all-time highs against the US dollar. Source: TradingView Related: Geopolitical tensions fuel central bank shift toward gold, crypto — BlackRock exec Macroeconomic uncertainty spikes gold prices, leaves USD in doubt Gold hit an all-time high of $3,500 per ounce in April 2025 amid the trade tariffs announced by United States President Donald Trump that caused turmoil in risk-on asset markets like stocks and crypto. Traders shifted to gold , cash, and other safe-haven assets to weather the extreme volatility caused by the protectionist trade policies and the counter-response from other countries. This rush to gold also caused gold-backed cryptocurrencies such as Paxos Gold ( PAXG ) and Tether Gold ( XAUT ) to spike in price during April 2024. The Volatility S&P Index (VIX) tracks the volatility of the US stock market and surged following Trump’s tariff announcement.

""A stablecoin backed by Gold would out-compete a USD-backed stablecoin in world markets: Russia, China, and Iran should take note,"" Keiser wrote in a March 22 X post . ""The United States dollar has no volatility, but you are guaranteed to lose purchasing power,"" the BTC advocate continued. Gold's current rally could spill over into Bitcoin if investors shift from viewing Bitcoin as a risk asset to more of a store of value in turbulent economic times that is counter-cyclical to the stock market and other speculative investments.

Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $20.52 level by 2027 and above $42.11 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a decreasing phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing value, and so is UNI. The cryptocurrency lost more than 1.58 percent of its value over the last 24 hours, and its price has decreased to $5.186. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $9.72, while the average price is expected to be around $8.10. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.2 and $8.3; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $42.11 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

At the same time, a popular technical indicator has flashed a buy signal, suggesting that BTC’s price could be primed for another run in the short term. Network activity is an important metric that helps determine whether or not the underlying blockchain is being used and to what extent. Although it’s not directly linked to the asset’s price movements, it shows the overall interest in it, and sometimes coincides with said moves. For instance, the active addresses skyrocketed after the US elections, and BTC’s price followed suit. Contrastingly, the activity levels plunged after Trump’s inauguration, as the Bitcoin network was declared a “ghost town,” and the asset’s price followed suit in the following months, dropping from over $100,000 to under $80,000. Now, though, Ali Martinez, the popular analyst on X, outlined a substantial uptick in the number of daily active addresses. His chart shows that the usage has shot up to over 925,000 such wallets, which is the highest amount in six months. 925,914 #Bitcoin $BTC addresses were active in the past 24 hours.

On Saturday, the European defense commissioner called on Spain to raise its defense spending to 3% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Per Trump’s wishes, NATO members, including the entire European Union, should raise their defense spending target above 2% of national output. He even appealed to NATO members to raise their defense spending to as high as 5% of their GDP. Spain spent only 1.3% of their GDP on defense in 2024 The European defense commissioner Andrius Kubilius told the El Pais newspaper that Spain would have to spend at least 3% of its GDP on defense to avert the Russian threat to Europe. He claimed Spain’s government would have to “find a way to increase defense spending in the near future.” Spain’s defense expenditure in 2024 accounted for 1.3% of its GDP, the lowest any NATO member spent that year. Spain, however, did promise that it would meet NATO’s defense target expenditure of 2% of GDP this year, a goal it had originally set for 2029. The target change, however, did raise alarm, especially for the far-left Sumar party, the junior partner with the Socialists in Spain’s coalition government who disagree with the idea. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez declared a €10.5 billion investment plan last month to ensure the country fulfills its spending obligations. He stated that the plan would focus on telecommunications, cybersecurity, and acquiring military equipment . He explained that he saw the need for Spain to raise its defense budget, especially since Europe’s adversaries are expanding their arsenal to more than just missiles. Drawing from the Ukraine war, he pointed out that their “enemies” were using unmanned drones and paramilitary groups to disrupt supply chains, sever gas pipelines, and damage undersea cables. They also allegedly weaponized social media platforms to spread propaganda and disinformation and launched AI-driven cyberattacks on Ukraine. He added, “In a world that’s dominated by uncertainty, Europe is hope, and it is certainty – and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defense systems because, given what’s going on, it’s obvious that only Europe will know how to protect Europe. And Spain will contribute to protecting Europe.” Moreover, he also argued that they would stand with Ukraine and that his country would fulfill its obligations to ensure the safety and security of Europe. He even asserted that his investment plan and increased defense spending would not burden nationals; there would be no tax rise or deficit increases due to it. The Sumar party, however, is still opposed to the plan, calling it “incoherent” and “absolutely exorbitant.” Donald Trump asked NATO allies to raise their defense budgets Barely a month after Trump assumed office, he began pressuring his NATO allies to raise their defense budgets, claiming the US had been left to foot most of the defense burden for far too long. He urged NATO members to raise their defense spending to 5% of their GDP. Responding to Trump’s request, NATO secretary general Mark Rutte encouraged other member states to increase their defense spending. He called for them to meet the 2% target by the summer before they can take on a higher target since they have to spend above 2% of their output.

Price action surged impressively, reflecting strong demand and heightened investor attention. Movements during these time frames underscore vigorous market participation and dynamic shifts in sentiment.

Trading now occurs within a range of $0.005 to $0.015, with immediate resistance spotted at $0.02 followed by a second resistance near $0.03. Bulls currently drive the price upward, although momentum indicators hint at caution with an RSI at 68.20. The trend remains short-term and somewhat uncertain, suggesting traders look for dips near the lower range to enter and profit from potential upward movements past key resistance levels. Pepe's Surge and Key Levels Offer Intriguing Trading Angles PEPE recent performance shows a strong month with a 21.44% increase alongside a modest 4.93% gain over the past six months. A one-week drop of 5.40% reflects short-term volatility without erasing the upward trend seen over the last month. Price movements suggest Pepe experienced dynamic shifts involving both strong rallies and minor corrections, emphasizing its sensitivity to market momentum. Current trading levels show activity between $0.00000647 and $0.00001057. A support point exists near $0.00000404 while resistance emerges at $0.00001223 and extends to $0.00001633. RSI near 56.55 hints at slight bullish pressure despite a modestly negative momentum indicator. Price action remains mixed, inviting traders to consider positions within these defined levels. Bonk Price Surge and Key Support Levels Set the Stage Bonk experienced a notable monthly gain of 65.70%, while the six-month performance showed a moderate increase of 1.42%. A recent decline of 8.06% in one week suggests a brief pullback, even as the overall trend remains bullish.

Priced at no more than a fraction of a cent, the price packed upwards up to a peak of $0.00008845, giving those that caught it early over 1000x returns. The frenzy of the community whipped its new fans to heights of trading excitement the world has never seen. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings similar hype to the market. Currently, it features its Phase 4 of 11 presale stages while bringing like $7.4 million raised, including 434 million tokens sold to 9300 holders. It is priced at $0.025, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors eager to invest early in high-yield DeFi opportunities, similar to Cardano’s (ADA) early master-plan growth. Shiba Inu’s Wonder Ride Shiba Inu (SHIB) rode on the wings of rampant social media for a lot of time in 2021, turning small change into money that could change lives. Shiba Inu, however, was not accompanied by any real useful services, and this was a community-driven scheme to drive high slippery prices. Here we are talking about something completely opposite; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a truly decentralized lending platform, which prioritizes the real financial applications over transient hype. Those who buy in at $0.025 in phase 4 – currently under 55% filled – stand to gain a profit of 20% when the price increases to $0.03 in phase 5. With MUTM, there is no speculation but structural tokenomics will deliver immediate returns in a SHIB-like manner. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an entirely different story: it promises stability combined with growth potential. Consistent Rise with Cardano Cardano (ADA) could be mentioned when people talk about a patient and careful approach to the project. For years, Cardano’s scalability and smart contracts have been the focus of the most patient growth in price that is known to attract long-term investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now making the real noise with its faster-paced opportunities. Phase 4 is nearly sold out at $0.025 per token; thus guaranteeing investors’ 140% profit once it posts at $0.06. Following the estimates from analysts, the price at launch is expected to be at $2.5, or a multiplication of 9900% ROI. To inflame demand, the team launched a dashboard featuring the top 50 holders and rewards with bonus tokens for every rank maintained. Urgency has been set for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), way ahead of ADA’s gradual rise. Mutuum Finance’s Rising Tide Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently undergoing a smart contract audit by Certik, and results will soon be shared on the social platform to strengthen investor confidence. The buy and distribute model, in which platform revenue repurchases MUTM tokens for stakers, creates a viciously high demand. Promisingly, phase 4 is moving fast and is getting sold out. Now we have investors entering at the bottom price before the 20% rise to $0.03 in phase 5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is truly brilliant in its planning. Combined with the proposed incredible post-launch price of $2.5, it provides a defining edge for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a DeFi leader that buzzes like SHIB in 2021, but with fundamentals. Closing the Circle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leveraging the electric enthusiasm of Shiba Inu’s 2021 run while mirroring Cardano’s disciplined growth. With a 140% gain on listing and the potential for a 9900% return on investment at $2.5, this is a major juncture for the project. Get started with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today and get in early on this DeFi trend; don’t miss it.

Despite facing resistance at this level, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Bulls are slowly regaining control, and many analysts believe that a breakout could be imminent if the price pushes above the current range. Price action is showing signs of strength, supported by a gradual increase in volume and reduced selling pressure from short-term holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Long-Legged Doji On Monthly Chart – Reversal Or Just A Pause? One of the most compelling signals of a potential rally comes from on-chain activity. According to top crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales accumulated over 410 million ADA throughout April—a decisive vote of confidence from large holders. Historically, such aggressive whale accumulation has often preceded major price moves in Cardano. This growing interest among institutional and high-net-worth investors could help fuel the next leg up for ADA, especially if broader market conditions remain favorable. With the crypto market heating up again and Bitcoin pushing toward new highs, altcoins like Cardano may soon follow. All eyes are now on whether ADA can reclaim $0.75 and build momentum for a sustained rally. Cardano Gathers Strength As Whales Drive Accumulation Cardano has quietly gained over 40% in value since its early April lows, reclaiming a key place in the spotlight as bullish momentum builds. Currently consolidating below the $0.75 resistance, ADA has shown resilience amid broader market uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds. While financial markets remain on edge due to trade tensions and recession fears, the crypto space has found renewed energy, and Cardano appears to be one of the beneficiaries. For ADA, the key lies in holding current support levels and making a clean push above resistance. A breakout above the $0.75–$0.80 range could open the door to a strong rally, potentially targeting psychological levels like $1.00 if the broader market cooperates. This bullish outlook is reinforced by compelling on-chain data. Martinez shared data revealing that whales accumulated over 410 million ADA in April alone, a clear sign of growing confidence among large holders. Historically, such accumulation patterns have preceded strong upward movements for Cardano. The scale of buying in recent weeks signals that influential players are positioning for a continuation of the rally. As Bitcoin and Ethereum push into higher levels, altcoins like ADA are poised to follow. If Cardano can reclaim higher ground and sustain momentum, it could soon emerge as a leader in the next phase of the market cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Long-Legged Doji On Monthly Chart – Reversal Or Just A Pause? ADA Price Holds Steady As Bulls Eye Key Resistance Cardano is currently trading at $0.69 after several days of tight consolidation between the $0.67 support and the $0.75 resistance zone. Despite market-wide volatility, ADA has managed to maintain its footing above the key $0.66 level — a support that continues to preserve the bullish structure in the short term. To confirm a full-fledged rally, bulls must reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA) around $0.77. This technical level has acted as a ceiling since the last major pullback and now serves as the primary upside hurdle. A successful break above it could ignite fresh buying momentum and open the path toward the $0.85–$0.90 range. Until then, ADA remains in a neutral-to-bullish zone. The $0.66 support is critical — a breakdown below it could flip short-term sentiment and invite deeper corrections toward the $0.60 region. However, holding this level would maintain a higher-low structure and signal underlying strength. Related Reading: HYPE Confirms Strength With Solid Throwback Response – Bullish Reversal? With the broader crypto market showing signs of recovery, Cardano’s ability to hold support while gradually pressing against resistance could set the stage for a breakout.

With Bitcoin on the road to $100K once again and Ethereum R1 launch this month fueling optimism, the stage is set for innovative projects to shine. Among them, Dawgz AI stands out, merging artificial intelligence with meme-driven community engagement on the Ethereum blockchain. Why crypto presales are gaining traction in 2025 Crypto presales offer early access to tokens at discounted prices, often before they hit exchanges. Previous presales have delivered significant returns for early investors, with some tokens surging over 100x post-launch, and this summer, history might repeat itself. According to DeFiLlama , DeFi protocols have secured over $101 billion in total value locked (TVL) as of the time of writing, signaling robust market growth. Crypto Presales tap into this momentum, giving investors a chance to back projects with high growth potential. The appeal lies in accessibility. Unlike traditional venture capital, anyone can join a presale with a compatible wallet, leveling the playing field. However, not all crypto presales are equal. Security, transparency, and real-world utility are important, inspiring greater investor confidence. What makes the best crypto presale stand out? To identify the best crypto presale , consider these factors: Technology and Innovation: Projects integrating AI or novel blockchain solutions often lead the pack. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, has emphasized that scalable, utility-driven projects are key to crypto’s future. Community Engagement: Strong communities drive adoption. Tokens with active social media presence see higher trading volumes post-launch. Tokenomics: Clear allocation for mining, staking, and liquidity ensures long-term stability. Balanced tokenomics reduces dump risks. Security: Projects with audited contracts by reputable firms like SolidProof are preferred. Crypto scams have been increasing in unaudited projects, and no one wants to risk their hard-earned money. The rise of AI in crypto: A game-changer for Presales AI is transforming crypto and the tech world at large, from predictive analytics to automated trading. AI-driven trading algorithms can process huge amounts of market data in real-time, enabling faster and smarter trading decisions compared to traditional methods. Unlike energy-intensive mining, which relies on computational power to validate transactions, AI focuses on optimizing investment strategies. For instance, AI can predict market trends by analyzing historical data and social sentiment, a capability that’s particularly valuable in volatile crypto markets. In 2025, projects leveraging AI are already gaining traction for their ability to simplify investing while maintaining robust security measures. AI-powered projects are attracting both retail and institutional investors, signaling a shift toward smarter blockchain applications. This trend is why Dawgz AI is generating buzz. Its platform uses AI algorithms to analyze market trends in real-time, aiming to optimize returns for token holders. The platform’s security is strengthened by a SolidProof audit, completed on June 4, 2024, ensuring its Ethereum-based smart contract is robust, potentially retaining investor trust during market dips. Dawgz AI: A closer look at its potential Dawgz AI isn’t just like other meme coins that have been surfacing and disappearing in the crypto market. Built on Ethereum, Dawgz AI combines AI-driven trading with a community-centric approach. Its platform encourages users to create and share memes across social media platforms, fostering engagement that can drive viral adoption. Some crypto enthusiasts noted that community-driven tokens often outperform purely technical projects in early trading volumes. The token’s staking option is a standout feature. Holders can stake $DAGZ for rewards, with staked tokens unlocking seven days post-presale. This incentivizes long-term holding, reducing sell pressure. Dawgz AI’s roadmap: Puppyhood: Concept development and presale launch. Growing the Pack: Community building and exchange listings. Big Dog Stage: Global outreach and AI algorithm enhancements. Alpha Dog Status: Mainstream adoption and sustainable growth. Dawgz AI is gaining traction as a top contender in the crypto presale this summer, combining AI-powered trading with a vibrant meme-focused community. Its presale has already raised over $3.4 million, with a current token price of $0.004. However, the next price increase to $0.00438 is due in a few days. Why now is the right time to invest in a crypto presale The market conditions in 2025 seem to be favoring early movers. Bitcoin’s rally past $96,000, as per CoinMarketCap , has lifted altcoins, capitalizing on this rally. Presales thrive in such environments, but the good part is that they offer a low entry point before tokens list on exchanges. Presale tokens launched during bull runs often see 50-100% price spikes within weeks of listing. Dawgz AI’s presale is timed perfectly. It has a total supply of 8,888,888,888 DAGZ tokens, where 30% is allocated to presale, 20% to staking rewards, and 10% to liquidity pools, ensuring market stability. With the next price increase approaching soon, now can be the best time to buy $DAGZ. Conclusion As summer 2025 approaches, the crypto market is presenting more opportunities. The best crypto presale could be the key to unlocking significant returns, and Dawgz AI is positioned to lead the charge. Its blend of AI innovation, blockchain security, and community hype offers a clear shot. With the presale nearing its next price increase, now is the time to act. Claim your $DAGZ and join a community set to redefine meme coins. Frequently asked questions Which presale crypto is best? Dawgz AI stands out as a top crypto presale in 2025 due to its AI-powered trading algorithms and strong community backing. Its audited smart contract and clear tokenomics make it a compelling choice for investors seeking long-term growth. What is the next 1000x crypto? While no crypto guarantees 1000x returns, Dawgz AI’s innovative AI integration and meme-driven hype position it as a strong contender. Its presale structure and Ethereum backing could drive significant value this summer. Is buying presale crypto worth it? Yes, presale crypto like Dawgz AI offers early access at lower prices, with potential for high returns. Its audited contract and staking rewards add value, encouraging long-term holding. What is the best upcoming crypto to buy? Dawgz AI is a promising upcoming crypto in 2025, blending AI and blockchain to offer real utility.

The data shows that MELANIA developers have sold 9.99 million MELANIA over the past eight days, worth $4.65 million, both via DCA and one-sided liquidation. In total, since March 16, developers have sold tokens to raise approximately 170,000 SOL, worth $23 million.

From historical surges to early-stage hype, the question isn’t just about what to buy, but when to enter. And right now, smart investors are laser-focused on the moment—and the momentum. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is already showing signs of early dominance. With strong organic growth and ongoing analyst chatter, it’s proving to be more than another fleeting trend. It’s quietly becoming a serious contender—and the markets are noticing. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Steam While Others Stall Not every token deserves your attention—but this one does. MAGACOINFINANCE is building with consistency: growing wallet adoption, investor retention, and traction across key channels. MAGACOINFINANCE is taking a focused, execution-driven approach—building a utility-first, community-backed ecosystem. That alone sets it apart from countless short-cycle projects looking for quick exits. And now, with XRP also back in the spotlight following bullish ETF sentiment, both tokens are positioned to benefit from a broader shift toward early-entry, high-conviction investments. Other Solid Projects—But With Limited Early Entry: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains a force in decentralized trading—but its upside is now baked into its size and market maturity. Polkadot continues to innovate around cross-chain tech, but it’s on a slower-growth path tied to infrastructure. Bitcoin Cash has use-case strength in peer-to-peer payments, yet its best moments may be in the rearview. Litecoin, though a staple of low-cost, high-speed transactions, is no longer an emerging opportunity. These tokens are battle-tested, but no longer early plays. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers ground-floor exposure—something XRP had in its early years and could now be seeing again with renewed energy. Final Thought Can $750 become $1.2 million ? With the right token and the right entry, history says it’s possible. Both MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and XRP have the structure, sentiment, and setup to deliver on that kind of vision.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana and Litecoin show bullish signs, but new token Remittix could outperform both in the payments space. Table of Contents Solana’s on-chain demand is heating up Litecoin stealthily builds a fee economy Remittix introduces utility lacking In Sol and Litecoin How the three tokens could work together Things to watch for this quarter The next bull run needs fuel—Remittix delivers it with every bridge fee burned Solana is at around $151.27, and Litecoin is at approximately $89.04. Both assets look set to move higher, but a newer payments-first token, Remittix (RTX) , is quietly gaining traction, and most analysts think it might beat the two old-timers. You might also like: XRP price could fall below $1.50 in April, investors turn to hyped crypto Remittix Solana’s on-chain demand is heating up Solana’s active addresses have increased more than three times since January, and DEX trading volumes reliably exceed $3 billion. Firedancer, an upgrade to the network later this year, should place throughput into the hundreds of thousands of TPS. If developers can meet those objectives, traders are looking for Solana to regain the $200 level that broke its late-2023 advance, then to drive to $260, where the 1.618 Fibonacci extension lies. Network fees remain under a cent, a marketing boon for memecoin initiatives and NFT stores that thrive on fast turnover. Because staking returns exceed 7 % APY, off-the-beaten-path SOL is evaporating on exchanges, an indicator of weakening sell pressure down the road. Litecoin stealthily builds a fee economy Litecoin’s May 2023 halving reduced block rewards to 6.25 LTC and pointed miners in the direction of fee income. The transition has increased competition for block space, with a consistent increase in average fees without compromising user adoption. Hash-rate expansion surpasses Bitcoin’s on a percentage rate and Glassnode indicates long-term holders hold a record 38 million LTC, an indication that the believers are storing coins. Halving-to-halving charts indicate that the next impulse wave may arrive in the range of $140 to $170. Break of February’s $113 swing high would confirm the move and return momentum funds into the trade. Remittix introduces utility lacking In Sol and Litecoin Solana and Litecoin are both excellent payment rails, but neither has a real-time crypto-to-fiat off-ramp built into its tokenomics. Remittix does. Remittix helps users send BTC, ETH, XRP or even SOL and LTC into the Remittix engine and receive local bank deposits in minutes. Each swap burns some of RTX and divides the fee among stakers. At $0.0757, RTX has already raised $14.69 million and sold 530 million tokens, but the number of daily active users is small enough that fresh adoption is asymmetric upside. If price only increases to $0.75 a mid-cap valuation, the return is a whale versus a move of SOL $150 to $300 or LTC $90 to $180. How the three tokens could work together A diversified scheme might invest fresh funds 40% in SOL for extremely quick smart-contract exposure, 30% in LTC for settlement cash security, and 30% in RTX for super-growth capability. Keeping RTX earns bridge-fee rewards automatically, a source of income neither Litecoin nor Solana pays in their native currency. Imagine a Filipino solo developer who collects fees in USDC on Solana, swaps into RTX, and receives pesos into her bank account before lunchtime. That free flow is stoking endogenous demand for each of those three coins but consumes RTX to do so and takes it out of supply while ratcheting up its price impact. Things to watch for this quarter Solana’s next generation of catalysts works well together. Firedancer public test-net is almost done, Worldpay will settle USDG on the chain, and prior experience suggests another memecoin mania tends to arrive after throughput bumps up higher. Taken together, those events could send activity and price well out ahead of current levels. Litecoin is quietly accumulating its own triggers. Fresh payment-provider plans across Latin America ought to be propelling practical adoption, and Taproot acceptance has now breached the 50% mark, a level at which will unleash smart-contract tooling as well as other fee revenue streams for miners. Remittix also has a busy roadmap. Management anticipates a determination on its European e-money license within months, and the imminent Solana Pay hook will enable millions of wallets to bridge value into fiat corridors.

ETH price fractal from 2019 hints at bottom The ETH/BTC pair, currently trading near 0.019 BTC, is edging closer to 0.016 BTC — the exact level it reached in September 2019 before rallying nearly 450% over the following year. ETH/BTC weekly performance chart. Source: TradingView The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI) , long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines. In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse . As of 2025, the pair is down over 80% from its 2021 peak, weighed by skepticism over Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) , rising competition , and Bitcoin’s growing dominance as an institutional asset. In response to the growing concerns, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed new architecture and protocol-wide standards to make Ethereum simpler, faster, and as maintainable as Bitcoin within five years. Related: Ethereum to simplify crosschain transactions with new token standards One analyst called Buterin’s proposal “the most bullish thing for ETH.” The bullish hopes come as ETH/BTC attempts to break free from its multi-year “bearish parabola.” This resistance curve has been instrumental in limiting the pair’s upside attempts since December 2021 but showed signs of exhaustion as of May 3. Edit the caption here or remove the text “We might see an end of this bearish parabola,” wrote chartist Jimie . He noted that if the curved resistance holds, ETH/BTC could drop toward 0.016 BTC — the same level where it bottomed in September 2019 before rallying by roughly 450%. Flush ETH and buy Bitcoin, says Adam Back Skeptics like Bitcoin’s proof-of-work pioneer, Adam Back, argue that Buterin is overlooking deeper design flaws while proposing to simplify Ethereum in the coming years. Back criticizes Ethereum’s account-based system, saying it adds unnecessary complexity compared to Bitcoin’s simpler UTXO (unspent transaction output) model . He argues this growing complexity increases technical risks and makes Ethereum harder to scale and secure. Source: X/Adam Back He also warns that Ethereum’s shift to PoS has concentrated power among insiders by redirecting miner rewards to large tokenholders. “At this point, just flush ETH before it hits zero and buy Bitcoin,” he wrote, suggesting no upgrade can fix what he views as Ethereum’s flawed foundation.

The prohibitions are part of Epic Games’ court case against Apple for restricting its app on the American market. Epic Games is a well-known company that produces the game Fortnite. The US District Judge further stated that the tech giant willfully ignored the court injunction of 2021. Apple used its dominant app market share to limit crypto apps from making money. The new prohibitions may enable crypto developers to engage in a fairer market. The court argued that Apple engaged in anticompetitive pricing practices, and despite being ordered to cease what they were doing in 2021, continued to defy the court’s order. The court concludes that Apple has continued interfering with competitive practices and further damaged other businesses, such as crypto startups. Apple was interfering with app developers’ ability to communicate with customers and was further charging fees for services that were on third-party websites. The court further stated that there was no going back on defying a court order and that Apple needed to cease what they were doing immediately. Crypto apps will benefit from the court ruling because they can experiment more freely with different business models without suffering draconian Apple fees. Due to these changes, a great crypto bull run may occur. Regardless of whether developers prefer Android to iOS, a large market share of Apple-supported apps exists. Apple actively impeded the growth of crypto apps, therefore bottling up a great amount of potential that may very well be released now. Such anticompetitive practices hampered NFT markets because they often include various monetary practices outside of an app. Things were so bad for Apple users that they could only browse NFTs on their phones and would have to find other means to buy their favourite non-fungible tokens. The court has reiterated its previous judgment that Apple should not engage in anticompetitive practices, such as issuing fees for consumer purchases outside of the apps. The ruling also disallows Apple from monitoring developers’ purchases or requiring them to report their dealings with clients outside of the app. Apple is also disallowed from restricting link usage for particular categories. Apple has since changed many of its guidelines and seems to be irritated by the court meddling in its affairs. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said the ruling was a huge developer victory. Sweeney pointed out that developers can now use their payment service alongside Apple’s app. This is a massive bonus for crypto companies wishing to provide iOS services without paying Apple a fee. Customers will also benefit, according to Sweeney, because the savings will be passed on to consumers. Sweeney concludes that Apple must compete in the market like everyone else. Crypto services should also get a fair go regarding payment services. Apple shouldn’t be allowed to create a business simply by blocking other competing companies. Sweeney also pointed out that competition is good for business because the best product will get the customers, while the less-than-great product will lose customers.",Cryptocurrency|News|Apple|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-03 17:47:43

Long-term traders are positioning for the next leg of inflows with over-the-top accumulations. Amid growing skeptics waving warning signs, the wider market looks steady, with increasing interest from institutional investors. BTC Whales Are Poised For New All-Time High After the asset’s recovery above the $90k, traders have intensified efforts to reclaim previous levels. Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $108k before a shocking nosedive to $78k due to negative macro sentiments heightened by the United States’ trade policies . While fears of these factors still exist, trades are pushing through with strong demand. On-chain data shows crypto whales purchased over 43,100 BTC worth approximately $4 billion since the asset began its rebound. Initial massive buys were recorded on April 13, leading to a rise in short-term inflows. Although the majority of wallets were long-term holders, a decent number of short-term investors flooded the market. This synergy heightened bullish demand, taking the assets past multiple resistance levels. On the flipside, profit-taking surged but was soon eclipsed by massive whale numbers. The drop in centralized exchange balances indicates long-term stability despite hiccups linked to profit-taking. According to several traders, the next key resistance is $97,530, a psychological level that could unlock a new price rally. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit an all-time high, igniting a new frenzy among holders. This metric values Bitcoin at the price it was last sold and not the current market value. “This provides a more realistic view of the “invested value” in Bitcoin by market participants, filtering out the noise from lost coins or coins held for extended periods without movement. It offers a more stable and accurate measure of overall market sentiment and the cumulative behavior of holders.” Arthur Hayes Makes Bullish Projection Digital asset executive Arthur Hayes has contributed to increasing upward sentiment after sharing his future market outlook. The former BitMEX CEO stated that Bitcoin’s price could hit $1.5 million by 2028 based on growing US macro factors. A possible rise in US dollar liquidity could trigger inflows to digital assets. Several institutions have also made huge Bitcoin price projections , citing global fiscal tensions and recent increasing Tradfi appetite.

You might also like: XRP flashes bullish signals as EMA’a cross: are bulls in control? ‘Explain what the law is’ Alderoty says the SEC has finally acknowledged what the crypto industry has long argued. Enforcement actions cannot be brought without first establishing clear regulatory guidelines. “You can’t bring enforcement actions for violating the law without first explaining what the law is,” he emphasized. Alderoty pointed to the absence of clear laws, rules, and regulations regarding cryptocurrency in the U.S. In the newest Crypto In One Minute, Ripple's Chief Legal Officer @s_alderoty explains why the SEC dropped its appeal against Ripple in March 2025, and where the US is going with smart crypto regulation on the horizon: https://t.co/HJ4wTBWDmx 🔒 Protecting consumers 🟢… pic.twitter.com/KD9bi66sGI — Ripple (@Ripple) May 2, 2025 Throughout its legal spat, Ripple maintained that the SEC was attempting to regulate through enforcement rather than proper rulemaking. The case began in December 2020 and centered on whether XRP should be classified as a security. It became one of the crypto industry’s most closely watched cases. With the legal obstacles now cleared, Alderoty shared Ripple’s forward-looking strategy. “We’re going to clean up the mess, we’re going to get out of the courtroom, we’re going to get back to running business,” he said. The company plans to work with Congress to bring smart crypto regulation that “protects consumers, protects the integrity of the market, keeps bad actors out, and most importantly, allows innovation to flourish.” In 2023, the court gave Ripple a partial win: institutional sales were legal, but XRP sales on public exchanges did violate securities laws. Ripple originally set aside $125 million in escrow for potential penalties, which CEO Brad Garlinghouse promised to take back. “I think it’s just evidence that the former [Gary] Gensler SEC was on the wrong side of the law. And thanks to the new leadership at the SEC and in the White House,” Garlinghouse recently told Fox Business. The timing of this legal resolution aligns with Ripple’s aggressive expansion plans. The company recently completed its largest acquisition with the purchase of Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Alderoty’s and Garlinghouse’s comments come as the SEC finds itself under new leadership. Trump appointee Paul Atkins is now chair, and the agency’s withdrawal of all crypto enforcement cases is a recognition that its approach to cryptocurrency oversight has fundamentally changed. It’s worth noting that Ripple supported President Trump by donating millions to his presidential campaign and at least $5 million in XRP tokens to the inauguration on Jan. 20.

As traders break down Cardano’s support levels and Solana’s supply clusters, much of the discussion stays focused on price action without real-time application. Cardano moves within its long-term range, while Solana tests resistance near heavy trading volumes, both critical points but tied mainly to future expectations. On the other hand, Unstaked coin offers immediate functionality: a platform where users deploy AI agents that actively create engagement and generate rewards. This is not just about holding a token, it is about applying it. Real use from the beginning is crucial for anyone considering what crypto to invest in. Cardano Retreats into Key Multi-Year Range Cardano price movements show a slide back into a long-standing trading range, signaling that bullish energy has faded after failing to break strong resistance levels. The current action sees Cardano testing the lower side of this important channel, which has often served as a support base. Technical analysis supports this view, with a drop below $0.45 potentially opening the door to deeper losses. Volume trends and RSI levels also show decreasing buying strength, raising the chances of slower recovery. However, this period of consolidation could give better insight into whether bulls can regain control or if further declines are likely. As a result, traders are keeping a close watch around the $0.40 to $0.42 zone, an area where past recoveries have started. Ultimately, Cardano’s next significant move will likely be shaped by how this support holds. This Cardano price analysis highlights the need for stability as momentum fades. Solana Approaches Major Supply Zone Challenge Solana’s price movement is nearing an important technical level as it enters a region packed with historical trading activity. Data shows a large amount of volume between $162 and $165, turning this band into a possible hurdle for price growth. Many holders bought near this range, and as prices revisit it, selling pressure could build up. Right now, action around this heavy supply area is critical. A clear move above would suggest returning buyer confidence, while rejection might lead to short-term corrections as sellers exit their positions. Given the volume clustered here, this zone carries significant weight on market behavior in the near future. In short, Solana’s price environment is approaching a defining moment that could influence whether momentum continues or reverses. Unstaked Stands Apart: Real Functionality in a Meme-Driven Market In a crypto space crowded with meme coins and speculative bets, Unstaked’s $UNSD offers a different direction, built on real utility and ownership from the start. Instead of offering promises of future tools that may never arrive, $UNSD delivers working solutions immediately. Through its platform, users can create, tailor, and launch smart social agents that drive community engagement and track on-chain activity. These agents do not just post content; they learn, adapt, and evolve independently, adding value through actions that can be verified. Another important difference with Unstaked is its contribution-based rewards system. Rather than giving rewards to passive holders, it compensates real engagement. Owners of AI agents that prove active participation earn $UNSD directly, encouraging a results-driven environment. This answers a growing concern among crypto buyers asking what crypto to invest in when utility matters more than speculation. Currently, in presale stage 2, $UNSD is priced at $0.006695. With a target launch price of $0.1819, early participants could see up to 2,700% potential gains. More importantly, buyers get access to real tools right away, a rare feature for a presale project. Why Utility and Timing Make the Case for $UNSD Market conditions change, but real functionality remains the key. While Cardano struggles near old support lines and Solana tests supply-heavy resistance zones, both still depend on future events to rebuild momentum. Unstaked, on the other hand, offers immediate action. Its presale does not just sell hope but grants access to live AI agents designed to create real, measurable impact. Being able to launch and earn from day one after the launch, puts $UNSD in a different category from tokens still waiting to deliver. Unstaked creates a strong argument for those asking what crypto to invest in by combining utility, timing, and real participation.

On Friday, he published a long proposal calling for Ethereum to cut out its over-complicated guts and move closer to the clean structure of Bitcoin within five years. “Ethereum wants to be the world’s ledger,” Vitalik wrote, pointing to its role as a base layer for crypto, finance, governance, authentication, and records. But to actually get there, he said the chain has to be both scalable and resilient — and right now, it’s too complex to handle that. The Fusaka hard fork is supposed to increase L2 data space by 10x. Ethereum’s 2026 roadmap promises to boost L1 data capacity to match. The network already switched to proof of stake, improved client diversity, and is working on ZK verifiability and quantum resistance. But Vitalik said none of that matters if the core protocol stays bloated. “We need to shine a light on the importance of simplicity,” he wrote. He pointed to Bitcoin’s design — blocks, hashes, proof of work, and nothing more — as the model Ethereum should follow. Vitalik pushes for a simpler Ethereum consensus layer Vitalik said Ethereum can get there by rewriting its consensus layer. He wants to replace the current beacon chain with something called 3-slot finality, which would remove slots, epochs, committee shuffling, and other moving parts. “You could build this in 200 lines of code,” he wrote . He said it offers strong security and removes a lot of bloat from the system. The smaller validator sets also make the fork choice rule simpler. He said Ethereum should use STARK-based aggregation so anyone can be an aggregator without needing special trust or overpaying for bitfields. The cryptography is complicated, but it’s boxed in and doesn’t screw with the whole system. That opens the door to a simpler peer-to-peer layer. Validator functions — like entry, exit, withdrawal, key changes, and inactivity leaks — should be rebuilt to reduce the line count and make system guarantees easier to read. Vitalik said the best part about consensus is it’s not tightly connected to the execution layer, so it can evolve without breaking contracts. But the real mess, he said, is the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Vitalik wants to kill the EVM and move to RISC-V Vitalik said the EVM is stuffed with outdated crap. He called it an over-engineered 256-bit machine optimized for crypto tricks that nobody uses anymore. He admitted most of the complexity came from his own choices. The fight to remove the SELFDESTRUCT opcode was a waste of time. So was the whole EOF debate. His solution: skip the small upgrades and just replace the EVM. He proposed switching to RISC-V or another VM like Cairo — the same ones being used by Ethereum’s zero-knowledge proof systems. “Succinct data shows this could boost efficiency by 100x,” he said. Simpler specs would mean faster execution and fewer bugs. Developers would get more options. Solidity and Vyper would compile to new VMs, and devs using normal programming languages could write Ethereum contracts for the first time. Most precompiles could be scrapped, except maybe for elliptic curve ops. Vitalik admitted that RISC-V won’t be ready tomorrow. While waiting, he wants to pass quick upgrades to the current EVM, such as raising contract size limits and adding new DUP/SWAP opcodes. But the real goal is to replace the entire thing. His plan comes in four steps. First, every new precompile must come with an onchain RISC-V version. Second, developers should be allowed to write contracts in both RISC-V and EVM. Third, Ethereum would do a hard fork to remove precompiles and replace them with RISC-V contracts. Fourth, the EVM would get re-implemented inside RISC-V and run onchain as a contract interpreter. Vitalik said Ethereum also wastes time using different tools for the same job in different places. He pointed to erasure codes, which are needed for data availability, P2P broadcasts, and history storage. All three should use the same code. The same goes for serialization formats — Ethereum should move fully to SSZ, which is already in use in the consensus layer and works inside smart contracts. He said Ethereum’s Merkle tree also sucks. The current hexary structure makes block proving hard. Switching to a binary tree with a better hash would make proving faster and cheaper. That same binary tree should be used for both execution and consensus. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The question on everyone's mind is whether May will see these coins break through and kickstart a significant price rally. The article delves into the factors driving potential growth and what could signal a strong upward trend for these cryptocurrencies. Kaspa Price Dynamics: Volatile Month and Six-Month Correction Kaspa showed strong momentum in the past month with a nearly 60% gain, contrasting with a roughly 7% drop over the last six months. The one-week performance fell around 2.6%, highlighting short-term adjustments against a longer-term correction. Price action over these periods indicates bursts of investor enthusiasm that were later tempered by overall market sentiment, reflecting rapid moves followed by stabilization. Current trading levels place the price between $0.059 and $0.115, with immediate resistance near $0.140 and support around $0.027. Bulls are active within this range, but no clear trend has emerged. Traders might consider breakouts above $0.140 or look for buying opportunities if support holds at $0.027, keeping an eye on momentum indicators and RSI around 63. Quant (QNT) Market Surge: Rising Momentum and Key Levels Quant has shown notable strength with a 26.74% rise in the past month and a solid 49.29% jump over six months. A one-week increase of 12.47% adds to the picture of steadily growing value. Solid past gains and steady upward performance signal an overall bullish trend, with price action clearly reflecting mounting market interest. Current prices vary between roughly $63 and $82. Resistance lies near $89 and $108 while support is positioned at $51 and $32. A rising RSI near 68 indicates that bulls dominate the scene. Trades may focus on buying near support levels and taking profits as resistance zones are tested. Conclusion KAS and QNT are at crucial resistance points. Breaking these levels could signal the start of a significant rally. Both coins have shown strong performance recently, suggesting positive momentum. A successful break might attract more attention and investment, reinforcing their upward trends. Monitoring the price action closely can provide insights into potential future movements.

The market frenzy over memes produced an incredible proportional growth that sent its market capitalization toward $1.6 billion in less than three weeks while making investors into millionaires. Such remarkable profit potential has become limited. The DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has obtained prominent attention after launching onto the market. The token presale stands in phase 4 while offering $0.025 tokens subject to a future possible 2,400% ROI. Belief in the planned investment approach could transform $250 into $55,000 by 2025. Pepe’s meme-fueled surge Pepe (PEPE) builds its value through continuous positive social interactions from its community users. Virtual popularity drove the impressive 2023 gains of the project but it lacked genuine use functions to support its market value. The price went from its peak to reach $0.0000072 during February 2025 which confirmed the volatile nature of meme coins. The platform lost $15 million in stolen funds during August 2023 due to a wallet system breach that damaged user confidence. Market prediction models show only a 10x potential rise for Pepe (PEPE) which would establish its price at $0.000097 thus challenging investors to obtain another hundredfold rally. The speculative direction of Pepe leaves damage control challenging due to its high risk of price fluctuations between large and sudden swings. Mutuum Finance’s strategic ascent Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes an alternative route through the cryptocurrency market. Phase 4 of Mutuum Finance’s presale campaign succeeded in filling 57% as it accumulated $7.6 million through 9,400 holder purchases of 440 million tokens. The token price will rise from $0.025 to $0.03 during phase 5 of the presale according to current plans which will give existing investors immediate profit. The tokenomics generate a 140% return on investment when tokens list at $0.06. The market analysts predict MUTM tokens will rise by a staggering 13,900% to reach $3.50 after their launch event. A $250 initial investment now would transform into $55,000 worth of value thus surpassing Pepe’s declining market performance. The team stands near completion of the Certik audit which will be announced via social channels to build up investor trust. Innovative lending and rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an advanced decentralized finance platform which unites peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending services. The platform operates through a secure overcollateralized system and enables mtToken users to earn interest on their deposited funds. The platform uses revenue stream procurement to repurchase tokens which benefits stakers and maintains token value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently launched a new interface that presents the current top 50 token holders who access additional rewards by preserving their position. Investors experience FOMO during phase 4 since they want to secure the best price before the upcoming increase. Sealing the DeFi advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a beacon of calculated growth in a volatile crypto market. The structured presale system along with its unique lending model of Mutuum Finance ensures enduring value while Pepe succumbs to transient market trends. The entry price at $0.025 under phase 4 will cease to exist as the countdown intensifies. A $250 investment in Mutuum Finance potentially amounts to $55,000 upon the expiry of this year. Potential investors should check Mutuum Finance official platforms to participate in the presale process leading up to the price increase in phase 5.

Analysts are highlighting several digital currencies that could offer massive returns. Among them, XRP, ADA, SOL, and LINK are drawing attention, each with unique strengths. Yet, the spotlight also falls on a buzzing newcomer, Codename:Pepe. This token aims to carve a niche with its AI-driven features. Codename:Pepe is gaining interest for its innovative approach, blending humor with cutting-edge technology. Modeled after a well-known meme coin success, it promises significant potential propelled by community support. It operates as an undercover agent of the crypto world, leveraging AI to navigate meme coin unpredictability. With a limited presale, early participation might be rewarding. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount XRP and Its Role in Modern Finance Ripple (XRP) is a decentralized network designed for financial services, allowing fast and cost-effective transfers of both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. It is notable for its native cryptocurrency, XRP, which supports rapid and secure transactions through a unique consensus protocol. Ripple’s network can process up to 1,500 transactions per second, offering scalability and efficiency. XRP’s price has been influenced by various factors, including legal disputes and market sentiment. Its legal battle with the U.S. SEC has impacted its market performance, but a recent court ruling has brought some relief, resulting in a price increase. Despite these challenges, XRP’s technology continues to excel in delivering quick transactions and fostering partnerships with banks and financial firms, reflecting its utility and position in the financial sector. As regulations evolve and adoption grows, XRP’s future in enabling efficient global transfers remains notable. Overview of Cardano (ADA) and its Market Dynamics Cardano is a decentralized blockchain network introduced in 2017. It operates on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, which is designed to be more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work system used by networks like Bitcoin. Cardano is intended to enhance the security and scalability of blockchain networks while minimizing environmental impact. ADA is the native token of Cardano, playing roles in transactions, staking, and as a medium of exchange within its ecosystem. Known as one of the first blockchains built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano aims to support decentralized applications with scalability and security. Currently, Cardano ranks as one of the significant cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its price has experienced considerable fluctuations, with its all-time high being $3.10 in September 2021. Various predictions suggest diverse potential paths for ADA’s future value. Some expert price predictions indicate possible growth scenarios tied to market events like Bitcoin halvings, while others offer more conservative views. ADA’s market position and ongoing network developments maintain interest among investors, developers, and users. However, the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility makes precise future valuations challenging. Solana: A High-Speed Blockchain Platform Solana is a blockchain platform developed in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko. It addresses scalability and performance limitations associated with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Known for its speed, Solana processes over 50,000 transactions per second with minimal fees. This efficiency is achieved through its unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism, along with proof-of-stake and other technical innovations. Solana launched its mainnet beta in March 2020, quickly drawing attention from developers and investors due to its capabilities. Its network supports various decentralized applications (dApps) and ensures interoperability with other blockchains. The native token, SOL, plays several roles within the Solana ecosystem. It is used for transaction fees, governance, and as part of the platform’s services. Solana saw rapid growth, reflected in its significant market capitalization and rising token value. However, while Solana has shown strong potential, it faces challenges such as network outages and intense competition from other blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Despite these issues, Solana’s speed, scalability, and interoperability continue to garner interest, making it a noteworthy player in the blockchain domain. Chainlink: Oracle Network and Cryptocurrency Chainlink is a decentralized network that connects off-chain data to smart contracts via oracles. Smart contracts need real-world data, and Chainlink provides this data securely and accurately. The network uses multiple oracles to prevent a central failure point. This setup ensures constant data availability and reliability. Chainlink’s native token, LINK, is used within this ecosystem. It serves as payment for data services and as a staking token for becoming an oracle operator. Since its inception in 2017, Chainlink has emerged as a key player in the oracle sector, significantly impacting decentralized finance (DeFi). The market position of LINK is notable, with a significant market capitalization. Chainlink reached a peak value of $52.88 in May 2021, though it has not returned to that level since. The LINK token’s price fluctuates, reflecting broader market conditions and crypto trends. The expanding DeFi ecosystem demands reliable oracle services, keeping Chainlink prominent. Observers like Michael van de Poppe anticipate positive growth, with expectations of significant price increases. Others, such as TheNewsCrypto, present more cautious long-term projections. Current price predictions for LINK vary, highlighting the unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets. Conclusion As the market surges, established coins like XRP, ADA, SOL, and LINK may see modest growth but offer limited short-term gains. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto stands out as a unique opportunity, using real artificial intelligence to navigate the chaotic meme coin market for maximum profits. By combining a community-driven approach with advanced AI-powered trading signals and automated trading, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself to deliver exceptional returns. Securing a stake in this innovative project could unlock significant rewards as it disrupts the market and outperforms traditional altcoins.

This striking disconnect between XRP’s utility and its market price has prompted fresh analysis from the popular crypto commentary account All Things XRP, which outlined a compelling argument on X as to why that gap may not last much longer. HOW IS XRP’S UTILITY REFLECTED IN ITS PRICE? It moves billions. Powers global banks. Settles in seconds. And yet, its price doesn’t reflect any of that. Let’s break down why utility isn’t priced in… yet. pic.twitter.com/5YBd0fyNer — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 2, 2025 The Utility-Price Disconnect XRP has been a cornerstone of Ripple’s payment infrastructure for years, prized for its speed, scalability, and minimal transaction costs. However, its market value has remained relatively stagnant, leading many investors to ask: why hasn’t its utility been reflected in its price? According to All Things XRP, the answer lies in the mechanics of how XRP is currently being used by institutions. A significant volume of XRP transactions, particularly those involving banks and large financial institutions, occurs over-the-counter (OTC). This method allows entities to trade large quantities of XRP directly, bypassing public exchanges. As a result, even though XRP facilitates substantial value transfers across borders, that demand does not translate into visible price pressure on the open market. In essence, XRP is being used, but that usage is invisible to everyday traders and investors. Institutional Pipelines and What Comes Next What makes this moment pivotal is what’s on the horizon. Ripple recently acquired prime brokerage platform Hidden Road, a firm responsible for moving over $3 trillion in yearly volume. If even a modest portion of that transactional flow begins to route through the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in a public, exchange-visible manner, the resulting demand could shift the price dynamics dramatically. As All Things, XRP noted, “That’s real demand hitting real exchanges. The price impact? Potentially explosive.” ETF Approval and Liquidity Surge The broader crypto market is also anticipating a shift in how institutional investors can access XRP. Analysts now estimate there is an 85% chance of an XRP futures ETF being approved in 2025. Should this materialize, Wall Street and other major financial players would be able to gain exposure to XRP through regulated investment vehicles. Such developments historically result in massive liquidity increases—an essential ingredient for upward price movement. The role of speculation here cannot be ignored. Traders are well aware of XRP’s growing list of partnerships, CBDC initiatives, and now the possibility of ETF listings. As All Things XRP emphasized, “Speculation is the bridge between utility and price. That bridge is being built right now.” XRP as Financial Infrastructure A key distinction highlighted in the thread is the difference between XRP and other digital assets like Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is primarily viewed as a store of value, XRP is rapidly evolving into a financial infrastructure. Teucrium’s CEO recently asserted that XRP’s real-world utility already surpasses that of Bitcoin. As markets mature and move toward utility-driven value assessments, assets like XRP that serve a tangible function may begin to see their prices better reflect their significance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This is further underscored by the growing belief that liquidity drives network value. As XRP becomes increasingly critical to global payment systems and on-chain liquidity improves, market forces will eventually align price with utility. The Changing Logic Around XRP One of the most commonly cited critiques of XRP is that Ripple could still operate without it. While technically true in today’s OTC-dominated environment, All Things XRP argues that such logic breaks down as more use cases begin to leverage public rails. As institutional demand starts appearing on public markets, XRP’s utility will become more visible, and its price will no longer be insulated from that activity. A Tipping Point Approaches All indicators suggest that XRP may be nearing a tipping point. With infrastructure, regulatory clarity, institutional momentum, and speculative interest all converging, the disconnect between XRP’s real-world utility and its market price looks increasingly unsustainable. As All Things XRP concluded, “XRP’s price is lagging utility. That gap won’t last forever. The world is slowly starting to value utility. XRP might just be the first to prove: Real use = Real price movement.” For those watching the digital asset space, XRP remains one of the most compelling case studies of how real-world utility may ultimately become the defining driver of value in the next phase of the crypto market.

This overexposure wasn’t planned. It just happened, slowly and quietly, over years of defaulting to America every time the rest of the world looked shaky. But now, with Donald Trump back in the White House and global markets looking unstable, that old habit is becoming a liability. For decades, putting money in the US was the safest bet you could make if you managed big portfolios. Fabiana Fedeli, chief investment officer for equities at M&G Investments, said , “When you didn’t know where else to go, the US was the choice.” She explained that no one ever got fired for leaning too hard into US stocks. That’s how safe the play used to be. But now, as countries like Turkey and the UK face consequences from their own weird economic experiments, the US is doing the same. And the damage hits harder because US assets make up the largest part of most major portfolios. Wall Street’s dominance starts to raise alarms The conversation now is about what the new “neutral” exposure should look like. Everyone wants to know the same thing—what’s too much? The way things are, about 70% of the average developed market index is made up of US companies. This makes sense if the US is delivering big returns and staying politically stable. But things have changed. The tech sector—which has been the main driver of those returns—was built on the same global trade that Trump is now trying to roll back. Global competitors are catching up. At the same time, political chaos and weak institutions are starting to scare investors. European money managers, who used to be the most aggressive about chasing the US market , are finally stepping back. That fear is starting to show. After a sharp drop in the markets last summer, concern about concentrated US exposure exploded. Société Générale is now pushing what it calls the “Great Rotation,” a move away from US assets and toward other regions. And it’s not just talk. George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said, “The flow evidence so far points to an, at best, very rapid slowing in US capital inflows and, at worst, continued active disinvestment from US assets.” He added that foreign investors are now basically on a “buyers’ strike,” judging by how little they’re putting into US-heavy ETFs. Global investors search for the new normal The real issue is that no one agrees on what the right level of US exposure should be. Fabiana said her clients in Europe and Asia are not asking if they should rebalance—they’re asking how. She said American investors are still focused on their own backyard and assume everything will go back to normal soon. She doesn’t believe that’s going to happen. She also suggested a different strategy. Instead of tracking market size, some think exposure should reflect how much each country contributes to global GDP . That would drop the US allocation to about 25%, maybe 30% if you shave off part of China’s share due to its poor accessibility. But even Fabiana admitted, “It’s unlikely to go to 30 per cent in my lifetime.” That change would require a total overhaul of how capital is managed globally. A more realistic target might be 55%, based on Société Générale’s estimate that US companies generate about that much of the world’s earnings. Maybe a bit higher, because the US market is more liquid. But that’s still a big drop from the current 70%. Any serious move away from the US won’t happen overnight. No one expects a massive sell-off. The change will likely come from where new investment money goes. If it starts flowing into Europe, Asia, or emerging markets instead, the balance will change over time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The current fourth phase of the presale for Mutuum Finance is at $0.025 per token, having raised $7.4 million thus far, with more than 434 million tokens sold to 9,300 holders. The rediscovered demand arises from the unique lending model and structured tokenomics of the project, which promises a 140% return on the $0.06 listing price. Phase 4 is filling up by 55%, prompting investors to rush and purchase tokens before the next 20% price increase to $0.03 in phase 5. But why are the whales making this bold move? Fading momentum for Cardano Cardano (ADA) is slowly losing its upward momentum. Trading above $0.70 and tripping on a 12% rise in the last seven days, a cooling signal is emanating softly from ADA. It is here that the BBTrend indicator was on the move from 13.27 to 7.55, indicating a cooling momentum. The Directional Movement Index is showing a low-17.14 marking trend strength, where the buyers and sellers seem to be stuck in a stalemate. ADA is hovering over the critical $0.69 support price level, with a very real prospect of falling should the bulls fail to act. The whales have turned towards projects with a reasonably clear growth trajectory like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), offering ground utility and structured returns, sensing such indecision. Solana’s uncertain edge While decidedly impressive, Solana (SOL) has fared less favorably in recent times, losing about 16% in value over 30 days. In holding above near $145 support level, SOL’s bullish structure shows cracks. The BBTrend indicator fell from 10.43 to 4.06-Indicating tiredness of the bullish momentum. Despite leading in DEX volume and blockchain revenue, prediction signs are showing flat Ichimoku Cloud lines are indicative of a possible stall. Distrustful of such consolidation periods, a movement from the whales towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensued, lured by the rapid sell-out of its presale and expected price growth. The real-world DeFi applications of MUTM compared to Solana’s reliance on ecosystem supremacy provides a rationale for the shift in strategy. Mutuum Finance’s rising tide As of now, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is much on the buzz, with phase 4 presale being filled at an ever-increasing amount to 55% sold-out. Investors buying in at the price of $0.025 can make a gain of 20% as the price will be increased to $0.03 in phase 5. The tokenomics stand to guarantee investors a whopping 140% upon listing at the price of $0.06, and analysts predict that the price will go zooming to $2.50 to offer a massive 9,900% return on the investment. Recently, the team started a dashboard that gives insights into the 50 largest holders and rewards will be issued to hold the positions via bonus tokens. This creative way gives the investor hope and thus stimulates demand as the presales continue to rush in. The Future Is Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accordingly on a long-term course in building trust, which is undergoing a smart contract audit by Certik. The announcement will come as soon as the audit is completed, so that investor confidence will be built. This shows that the security of MUTM is important, making it stand out from the tens of thousands of speculative tokens. With the closing of phase 4 nearing, the urgency to enter at current prices increases. Whales have this window in their sights and are actively siphoning funds from ADA and SOL to put into these promising returns.

Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction also shows signs of a rally after a 13% rise, with a possible climb to $0.27 if it breaks $0.2106. The technical picture is improving, but not everyone is staying updated. That’s where Web3 ai ($WAI) steps in. It gives fast, simple alerts without adding clutter. Everything is mobile-ready, easy to set up, and built for users who prefer not to stare at charts all day. It tracks your positions, blocks out the noise, and notifies you only when something important changes. This ai coin presale is now live at $0.0003, with a launch price of $0.005242. That’s a projected return of 1747%. While ADA and DOGE are trending, Web3 ai helps users stay ready for what comes next. ADA Price Gain Continues as Technical Trends Stay Strong Cardano’s ADA is moving higher again, holding above $0.63 after recent pullbacks. Analysts Crypto Patel and Javon Marks see strong chart setups pointing toward further gains. Patel highlights an ascending channel, with ADA respecting support near $0.45 and facing resistance near $2.92, suggesting a longer-term target of $5. Marks adds that a bullish flag pattern is forming, pointing to a possible 354% rise from recent lows, targeting $2.91. Other short-term indicators like the MACD and Bollinger Bands also support a rising trend. Derivatives data shows open interest at $639 million, with a long-to-short ratio of 1.33, reflecting steady interest. These factors are helping push the current ADA price gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction Eyes Key Breakout Zone Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 13% recently, breaking above $0.1808 and drawing attention during a broader meme coin rally. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction now points to a possible move toward $0.27, but it depends on clearing the $0.2106 level. Patterns like the falling wedge and a breakout over the 50-day SMA are supporting the current trend. Still, a few signs suggest caution, as some technical indicators show overbought conditions. Elon Musk has also stepped back from public DOGE involvement, though market momentum continues. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction also takes into account the wider meme coin space, with SHIB and PEPE also gaining. If the current pace holds, this forecast could come closer to reality soon.

This marks the first time the academic institution has sought exposure to the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Brown University’s Bitcoin ETF Position Add Brown University to the list of institutional investors taking a shine to Bitcoin. A new 13F-HR filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission shows the university owned 105,000 shares of IBIT, worth roughly $4.9 million, as of March 31. The IBIT shares were not listed in the previous quarter’s filing. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is credited with rekindling the spot BTC ETF movement, after the SEC time and again rejected such products since 2013. These novel investment products give traditional investors access to Bitcoin without the hassle of buying and storing it themselves. Pundits believe the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marks one of the most successful financial product launches in history. Notably, IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, with a staggering $57 billion in assets under management. Crypto Adoption Hits Universities It’s worth mentioning that Brown is not the first university to have exposure to Bitcoin. The University of Austin (UATX) partnered with Bitcoin services company Unchained in May 2024 to launch a $5 million Bitcoin endowment. Then, in October of the same year, Atlanta-based Emory University disclosed ownership of more than $14 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Showcasing the growing appetite for digital asset exposure, increasingly more institutional funds, publicly listed companies, and nation states are racing to gain access to the apex crypto. The Bitcoin price soared above $97,500 on Friday for the first time since February, rebounding from a local low around $75,000 in early April.

While the broader cryptocurrency market experienced a more substantial rally, largely driven by Bitcoin’s ascent toward $95,000, SHIB still managed to maintain upward momentum. This market-wide recovery added approximately $270 billion to the global crypto market capitalization, representing a 10.31% increase in April. Although Shiba Inu’s gains were more limited compared to some top assets, the token’s rebound had a significant impact on investor portfolios. 109 Million-Dollar Wallets Added in One Month According to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu saw the number of addresses holding at least $1 million worth of SHIB rise substantially throughout April. At the beginning of the month, 751 addresses fell into this category. By April 30, this number had grown to 860—a net increase of 109 new millionaire wallets in a single month. This surge reflects either an appreciation in the value of previously held tokens, additional accumulation, or a combination of both. This means 796 addresses held between $1 million and $10 million in SHIB, an increase of 107 addresses, and 64 wallets held more than $10 million, up from 62 at the start of the month. Possible Drivers Behind the Growth Two primary factors appear to have influenced the increase in SHIB millionaire addresses. One is the token’s 7% price increase, which likely elevated some existing holders’ portfolios above the $1 million threshold. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For example, with SHIB trading at $0.00001355 near the end of April, an investor with 73.8 billion tokens would see their holdings valued at approximately $1 million. At the start of April, when the price was around $0.00001237, the same amount of SHIB would have been worth about $912,915, below the millionaire mark. The second factor is likely increased accumulation during the month. On-chain data indicates that addresses holding between 10 billion and 100 trillion SHIB added roughly 210 billion tokens in April, bringing their collective total to 541.28 trillion SHIB. Though modest in percentage terms, this accumulation trend suggests growing interest among mid- to large-scale investors during the rebound. Implications for SHIB’s Investor Base The rise in millionaire wallets suggests renewed investor confidence in Shiba Inu following its recovery. While SHIB’s growth in April was outpaced by broader market movements, the consistent accumulation and increase in high-value holdings point to ongoing engagement with the asset. These trends may serve as indicators of Shiba Inu’s future momentum and the strategic behavior of its wealthier investors.

He said it straight to a packed arena that gave him a standing ovation. Warren has been running the company for 55 years, longer than any other chief executive of a S&P 500 company. He said it’s time. The board will now prepare to appoint Greg Abel as the next CEO. Warren confirmed that he will stay close and “hang around,” but Abel will be the one making final decisions. Warren will not sell his shares. He said that keeping all his shares is not emotional, it’s because he believes Berkshire will actually perform better under Greg’s management. “The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,” Warren said. document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VLL8vjpvljS9jy7b.mp4 Buffett and Abel meet board to decide future roles Warren and Greg told Becky Quick from CNBC after the meeting that the company’s board will meet on Sunday to figure out what Warren’s formal role will be. Right now, Warren is still both chairman and CEO. Whether Greg gets both titles or just CEO is still up in the air. Warren made all of this official during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, which drew around 40,000 people. The event also marked his 60th year leading the company. Hillary Clinton was in attendance. Warren didn’t endorse anyone in politics after her. He stopped doing that in recent years to avoid harming Berkshire’s businesses with controversy. At the same meeting, Warren didn’t hold back when asked about President Donald Trump’s trade policies. He warned the crowd that using trade as a weapon could bring real global consequences. “Trade should not be a weapon,” Warren said. “There’s no question that trade can be an act of war.” He said Trump’s heavy use of tariffs has made other countries angry, and that could create instability. Warren put it this way: “It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done.” He said countries should be focused on doing what they’re best at and trading freely. “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he told the crowd. He also said the world becomes safer when more countries are prosperous. Berkshire holds cash as Buffett waits for right price Warren told shareholders that Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on $347.7 billion in cash. He said he doesn’t see many investments he understands or finds attractive right now. So the company is holding the money. But he believes a time will come when that cash will be needed. He said when that time comes, Berkshire will be “bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.” Warren also spoke about the country’s long history of change. He said the United States has gone through many revolutions since its beginning, and while equality didn’t come early, he remains optimistic about the country’s future. “If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said, ‘You could be in the United States,’” Warren said. When it comes to Greg Abel, shareholders didn’t seem worried. Steven Check, who runs Check Capital Management, said Greg is already proven. He said the businesses under Berkshire’s umbrella mostly run on their own and Greg won’t get in their way. “I think we’ll get a more hands-on manager and that could be a good thing,” Steven said. “But he also knows that those managers enjoy the freedom to run their businesses and Abel isn’t going to do anything to turn them off.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In March, Lummis (R-WY) introduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act in the Senate. If passed, the bill would establish a decentralized network of Bitcoin vaults operated by the Department of the Treasury, and it would implement a one-million-unit BTC purchase program so the US government could control approximately 5% of the top crypto asset’s supply. Lummis said in a speech this week that she’s “particularly pleased with President Trump’s support” of her BITCOIN Act. “The BITCOIN Act is the only solution to our nation’s $36 trillion debt. I’m grateful for a forward-thinking president who not only recognizes this but acts on it.” The Wyoming senator, a longtime BTC advocate, says the potential legislation would secure the country’s position as “a global leader in financial innovation.” “As Bitcoin comes into more usage, its use makes the whole system more secure, more robust and more capable of serving our needs all over the world.

BarriC, who reportedly purchased XRP at just $0.10, stated that he remains committed to holding the asset for much higher price targets, despite its prolonged struggle to gain traction beyond the $2 mark. I didn’t buy $XRP at $0.10 To be completely shaken out at $2 I bought #XRP at $0.10 to be able to take profits when $XRP hits $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 And to be able to hold until $XRP hits $1,000 That’s my plan And no one will be able to deter me from that plan — BarriC (@B_arri_C) April 30, 2025 Recent Price Trends Fuel Investor Frustration Over the past few months, XRP has failed to break past the $2.30 range, frustrating many investors who had anticipated continued gains following its rally in late 2024. In April, the asset experienced a significant dip to $1.61, triggering concerns that further declines could follow. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency rebounded, stabilizing around the $2 threshold. Despite this recovery, the price has not significantly increased, leading to heightened anxiety among holders. In response to growing uncertainty, BarriC has reaffirmed his long-term outlook. According to him, short-term price fluctuations are not a valid reason to exit a position in an asset purchased with a long-term strategy. For him, XRP’s current valuation still represents an accumulation opportunity, not a reason for panic. Profit Targets: From $2 to $100 and Beyond The investor has also shared specific price targets that guide his investment strategy. He originally aimed to secure profits incrementally, beginning at $2, then $5, and later $10. However, he remains focused on even more ambitious milestones, such as $20, $50, and eventually $100 per coin. He has expressed confidence that the asset will continue to grow significantly in value over the coming years. To illustrate this potential, BarriC pointed out that a $1,000 investment at $0.10 would grow to $1 million if XRP were to reach $100 per token. Based on this outlook, he continues to advise other XRP investors to maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term price stagnation or market corrections. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Will XRP Reach $500 or $1,000? BarriC believes XRP could reach prices as high as $500 or even $1,000 per token by 2033. While these targets may appear overly optimistic to some, he remains firm in his projections, claiming that current prices will eventually be seen as low in retrospect. Industry analysts, however, are more conservative in their expectations. Forecasts from crypto exchange platform Changelly suggest that XRP could reach $500 by 2040, requiring up to 15 years of growth. The firm does consider $1,000 a possible long-term goal, though not likely before the late 2030s. Meanwhile, independent analysis from Telegaon presents an even more cautious outlook, with a projected maximum of $160 by 2040 and $285 by 2050. Despite differing market projections, BarriC’s message to the XRP community remains consistent; he plans to remain invested for the long haul and encourages others to focus on the bigger picture, not just temporary market conditions.

According to il Capo, the Bitcoin (BTC) price seems to have found a local top between $96,000 and $98,000, while the analyst thinks that Ethereum (ETH) looks bullish both in terms of its own price and its performance relative to BTC. Additionally, il Capo claimed that the Solana (SOL) ecosystem altcoins and a few other altcoins, which he did not specifically name, have bullish potential. In his statements a few days ago, il Capo argued that a new bull movement was likely as long as the Bitcoin price remained above $92,000.

When the BTC price experienced a major decline and fell to around $ 15,000, il Capo said that the bear market was not over and that he was waiting for the $ 12,000 level after the BTC price recovered and approached $ 30,000.

Speaking in a recent YouTube Short, Jeremie suggested that XRP could climb to $24 within the year, representing a significant jump of approximately 972% from its current trading price of $2.21. If XRP were to achieve this target, its total market capitalization would rise dramatically from $131.35 billion to roughly $1.4 trillion. This projection assumes the token’s circulating supply stays fixed at around 58.44 billion coins. U.S. Government Engagement Cited as Key Driver Jeremie attributed his outlook to increasing signals of support for XRP from officials in the United States. According to him, federal-level recognition and regulatory developments could play a critical role in influencing the asset’s future price. One example he referenced is the mention of XRP in discussions surrounding a potential U.S. cryptocurrency reserve. Additionally, Jeremie noted the ongoing negotiations between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to bring an end to their longstanding legal dispute. These factors, he argued, could enhance investor confidence and strengthen XRP’s position in the digital asset space. Jeremie Reaffirms Bitcoin Loyalty Although Jeremie outlined a scenario in which XRP reaches $24, he was careful to clarify that he does not recommend holding the asset. He emphasized his continued preference for Bitcoin, urging investors to consider shifting any XRP holdings into BTC. Jeremie has previously referred to XRP as a “banker coin” due to its adoption by financial institutions for cross-border payment solutions. He remains critical of XRP’s alignment with traditional banking systems, arguing that supporting such a project could contradict the decentralized ideals of cryptocurrency. In his view, Bitcoin remains a superior option for those seeking an asset independent of traditional financial infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While optimistic about XRP’s possible rise, Jeremie cautioned viewers not to interpret the forecast as a certainty. He described the $24 price point as a strong possibility rather than a guaranteed outcome and encouraged investors to manage their exposure to XRP with caution. Jeremie’s estimate aligns with earlier projections from other crypto commentators. Popular analyst EGRAG has also forecasted that XRP could surpass $24, even suggesting the potential for much higher targets such as $110. However, EGRAG did not provide a specific timeline for this scenario. Meanwhile, crypto platform Changelly offered a more conservative timeframe, suggesting XRP could reach $24 by February 2031, six years later than Jeremie’s forecast. Their analysis reflects a broader market sentiment that, while bullish on XRP’s long-term value, remains cautious about near-term explosive growth.

While many traders keep an eye on Ether’s next move, a younger rival, Lightchain AI , is gathering pace. Its early-stage token sale has already collected more than $19.6 million at a starting price of $0.007125 per token. With older chains facing traffic and fee headaches, Lightchain AI offers a system built for speed and privacy, and it is winning support. Investors wanting to spread risk beyond long-running brands now view Lightchain AI as a target for fast growth. Whether Ether rises with it or the newcomer steals the show is the debate shaping the new market cycle. Explosive Growth Potential of Ethereum – Key Factors to Monitor Why will Ethereum grow in 2025? What factors is it goingto depend on? The U.S. SEC’s stamp of approval for spot Ether ETFs has cleared the way for huge institutional investment, with estimates of as high as $15 billion in inflow in 18 months. These could send ETH prices above $5,000. Its core technology advancements, particularly the Dencun upgrade, have increased scalability and decreased transaction fees, making Ethereum more attractive for decentralized applications. Demand is expanding in the NFT and DeFi space. Investors are predicting that the value of ETH will rise between $5000 – $10,00 this year. It would, of course, depend on the bullish market conditions and the rate of adoption. Lightchain AI- Attracting Investors Everywhere Lightchain AI has seen rapid success during its presale, drawing significant interest from major investors. By uniquely merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, the platform stands out from traditional projects. The main focus of Lightchain AI is on AI-driven computations and security. It aims to allow businesses to make use of AI while keeping their data secure. It is a new approach that is very appealing to institutional investors who want advanced solutions focusing on privacy. The platform’s ability to deliver scalable, privacy-focused tools for AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) further enhances its value. With growing interest from large-scale investors, Lightchain AI is positioned for remarkable growth, making it a project to keep on your radar. ETH vs. Lightchain AI – Where Should Investors Focus? People weighing Ether and Lightchain AI in 2025 face a choice between proven strength and possible high reward. Experts think ETH could trade between $5,000 and $6,500 by December, thanks to ETF demand and a mature code base. Returns may be steadier but not explosive. Lightchain AI , on the other hand, is a very new project. Tokens initially sold at $0.007125, and the project raised more than $19.6 million. Some projections see the price climbing toward $5 by late 2025. In short, Ethereum offers a reliable, slower climb, while Lightchain AI carries a bigger upside and higher risk. Splitting funds between the veteran and the newcomer could give holders exposure to both safety and expansion. The ongoing Lightchain AI sale continues, leaving room for those who want an early entry price below future targets. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-03 19:00:00

Still flying under the radar but rapidly gaining traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention from investors who’ve seen this setup before — low entry, strong tokenomics, and a clear path to breakout. And now, with realistic projections pointing to a 3500% ROI , the numbers are starting to tell a compelling story: a $500 investment today could be worth $25,000 or more by the end of 2025 . A Forecast That’s Turning Heads MAGACOIN FINANCE is not yet on major exchanges. That alone places it in a rare early-stage category — the type of access point that historically delivers the most explosive returns before public hype catches on. Current projections based on listing targets, price trajectory, and early accumulation behavior suggest: Expected ROI: +3400% to +3500% from current levels Potential Return: up to $3250% , depending on early entry bonuses and stage pricing In pure numbers, that means even a small $500 position could scale to $17,000–$25,000 based on prevailing models. And for many risk-tolerant investors, that’s more than enough reason to take a second look. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Taken Seriously Several fundamentals are helping MAGACOIN FINANCE cut through the noise: Still trading under $0.07 , with upside before exchange listings No VC overhang , which prevents early sell-offs Community-driven momentum that’s accelerating organically Clean tokenomics built for supply scarcity and long-term upside Unlike many high-promise tokens that rely on short-term influencer hype or meme-fueled volatility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on a structure designed to scale — without compromising early investor integrity. Still Early — But Not for Long With its market presence expanding and word-of-mouth beginning to spread across analyst circles and private communities, MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be entering the next phase of exposure. For those who understand how huge crypto returns are made, the setup is familiar — and the opportunity window is still open. For investors who’ve been waiting for a serious altcoin play with actual ROI mechanics, this may be the moment. A $500 risk today could become a portfolio-defining move by next year.

Dollar Has No Ceiling,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-infinity-venture-capitalist-says-cryptos-value-vs-dollar-has-no-ceiling/,"The dollar is weakening this year. As reported, the US dollar index declined 7% year-to-date, one of its worst openings in recent history. The dollar index measures the value of the dollar against six other major foreign currencies. As tensions between the US and several countries have increased on the trade front, worries regarding the long-term strength of the dollar are beginning to emerge.

Venture capitalist Tim Draper indicated that Bitcoin may serve as an insurance policy against the failure of fiat currencies. He thinks the digital currency will keep appreciating in value relative to the US dollar, particularly as international confidence in fiat currencies falters. In a comment he made on the X platform, he said Bitcoin “might be worth an infinite amount of USD.” Bitcoin might be worth an infinite amount of USD. During the Civil War, the south’s Confederate Dollar went through hyperinflation. After starting 1:1 with USD, it ended the war at over 10 million to 1. People lost faith and scrambled to trade their cash in for USD. But now… pic.twitter.com/qRTEKl4VkU — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) May 1, 2025 Draper likened Bitcoin’s present surge to a change in monetary behavior. He pointed out that during uncertain times, individuals will shift their funds towards the assets that make them feel more secure. While gold has played that function previously, Draper stated that Bitcoin is starting to fill the position because of its digital format and convenience. A Civil War-Era Analogy Raises Eyebrows To illustrate his argument, Draper referred to American history. He cited the Confederate States of America, which had printed its own paper money during the Civil War in 1861. Initially, it was pegged at a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar. But towards the end of the war, the Confederate dollar had disintegrated, exchanging at over 10 million to 1 compared to the US dollar. Draper explained this illustrates how quickly a currency can disintegrate when trust is lost. He cautioned that something like that can happen again if individuals, businesses, and even governments lose faith in the stability of the current system. In his opinion, Bitcoin stands to gain from that change. Bitcoin Versus Gold In A Changing Market Gold will usually be the first safe haven when there are financial pressures, but Draper believes that it is no longer number one. He noted that gold has issues such as huge storage fees and physical movement. Bitcoin, however, is a purely online existence and can easily transfer quickly across borders. Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development He also stated that Bitcoin possesses special strengths—like limited supply and autonomy from central banks—that make it more attractive than conventional assets. These characteristics, Draper explained, are becoming increasingly difficult to overlook as the global financial system comes under greater stress. Governments Start To Take Notice Draper claims that even some governments are seeking to find out if they should keep Bitcoin reserves. That marks a shifting sentiment towards how cryptocurrencies are perceived, not only among private investors but also public institutions.

Pi Network is finding renewed traction with real-world utility plans, while Avalanche’s Visa-backed payment integration is giving AVAX momentum. But Cold Wallet offers something fundamentally different: privacy by default. At a time when on-chain tracking and user profiling are growing concerns, Cold Wallet ’s architecture centers on zero-knowledge proofs and institutional-grade anonymity. Among these developments, it stands out not for hype, but for solving a real and rising need. For those tracking the popular crypto coins with lasting value, Cold Wallet deserves attention. Fresh Momentum Builds Around Pi (PI) Token Update The latest Pi (PI) Token Update points to a potential recovery as the project shifts focus toward real-world applications. As a result, with more users completing KYC verification and transitioning to the mainnet, the network is entering a phase where actual token utility will drive demand. To support this, developers are emphasizing merchant integration and dApp adoption to support a functional ecosystem, aiming to create organic value beyond speculation. Consequently, this shift could influence supply and circulation, gradually increasing buying pressure. Furthermore, the team’s updated roadmap outlines clear milestones, including enhanced accessibility and decentralized app deployment, which are seen as key drivers of long-term sustainability. In turn, early adopters now have better clarity on how and when their tokens become transferable, boosting community engagement. Taken together, this Pi (PI) Token Update marks a strategic effort to align token utility with broader ecosystem growth. If all goes to plan, Pi could see improved sentiment and stronger positioning in the months ahead. Avalanche (AVAX) Bullish Trend Accelerates with Real-World Utility Boost The Avalanche (AVAX) Bullish Trend is gaining traction following the launch of the Avalanche Card, a Visa-backed payment solution developed in partnership with Rain. Specifically, this new feature allows users to spend AVAX, USDC, and USDT directly from self-custody wallets at any Visa-accepting location, bypassing conversion fees and improving AVAX’s practical use. Simultaneously, this development coincides with a technical breakout from consolidation, with indicators like the 20-day and 50-day EMAs forming a bullish crossover. At this point, analysts highlight $22.8 as the next critical resistance. If surpassed, a successful breach could open the path toward $28 and potentially $37 in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, institutional activity on Avalanche is also strengthening the AVAX outlook, with tokenization efforts supported by major players such as BlackRock and Citibank. Along with that, combined with over $1.2 billion in total value locked, these elements support continued upward momentum and position AVAX firmly within the current Avalanche (AVAX) Bullish Trend. Early Buyers Are Still Getting $CWT at a 99.5% Discount Cold Wallet is drawing attention as one of the most structurally undervalued opportunities among popular crypto coins. Currently, in presale stage 2, the $CWT token is priced at just $0.00714, while its confirmed launch price is $0.3571, representing a discount of over 98%. However, beyond the numbers lies a utility-driven value proposition. Unlike many wallets that compromise on security in favor of ease of use, Cold Wallet is designed with privacy as its foundation. Through zero-knowledge proofs, it enables anonymous transactions, hidden balances, and IP-free Web3 interactions, all while remaining user-friendly. For this reason, this privacy-first architecture appeals to both institutional players and retail users seeking secure entry into decentralized finance. Looking ahead, with a roadmap that includes multi-chain support, governance features, and upcoming exchange listings, Cold Wallet is building long-term infrastructure, not short-term hype. According to analysts watching presale flows and architectural development, a 50x return is a conservative floor, not a stretch target. While more popular crypto coins lean into speculation over substance, Cold Wallet is gaining ground by delivering a product users will need when privacy matters more than ever. Ultimately, for early buyers still accessing presale pricing, the window to capture the lowest valuation tier is closing, and the upside potential is built directly into the project’s fundamentals. Utility Over Hype Real growth often begins where speculation ends. Pi’s shift toward functionality and Avalanche’s payment expansion are clear signs of maturing crypto narratives. Yet, Cold Wallet moves beyond upgrades by building a system where privacy is embedded, not optional. Its approach isn’t reactionary; it’s foundational. As regulatory focus tightens and users grow more cautious about data exposure, the demand for privacy-first solutions will only increase. Among popular crypto coins, Cold Wallet positions itself as one of the few designed for that future. The technology is ready, the presale is live, and the purpose is clear; that’s what makes it matter.

This surge is due to the expanding market caps of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which have fueled capital inflows into the broader crypto ecosystem. Bullish Indicator For BTC According to the April 30 report , USDT’s market cap rose by $2.5 billion, while USDC’s increased by $1.2 billion in the past week. Combined, the duo had a $3.7 billion rise in market cap, marking the strongest weekly growth in stablecoin supply since February 9. Over the past 30 days, these figures have climbed even higher. USDT has added $5.3 billion while USDC surged by $6 billion in the same period. Both stablecoins are expanding above their 30-day moving averages. Historically, this pattern has coincided with periods of increased liquidity and stronger performance in the broader crypto market. Specifically, this trend is a bullish indicator for Bitcoin (BTC). Market sentiment has also improved with these liquidity changes. The Bitcoin Bull Score Index, which tracks investor sentiment and market strength, rose from 20 last week to 50 this week, with the new score placing the market in neutral territory. According to the analytics firm, the metric’s increase shows the impact of rising stablecoin liquidity on Bitcoin’s recent move above key on-chain resistance levels. However, the index remains below 60, the level typically associated with sustained price rallies. The flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded strongly over the past three weeks, rising by more than 25% from its April 9 low of just under $74,000 to over $96,500 in early May. On the other hand, Bitcoin advocate Robert Breedlove recently pointed to the average miner cost of production as a potential sign that the asset is nearing the start of a bull run. He noted that this metric, often seen as the market’s break-even line, has historically marked cycle bottoms and is once again indicating a possible price floor. USDT Lags, USDC Hits Exchange High Despite the record-breaking levels, USDT liquidity on crypto exchanges has not fully recovered. The total amount of the digital asset held on exchanges is currently $38 billion. This is 12% lower than its February 21 high of $43 billion. On the other hand, USDC balances on exchanges have reached $6.5 billion, their best level since March 2023. Exchange-based stablecoin reserves are important because they can be used quickly for trading and investment, helping support price activity in digital assets.

This development raises questions about whether artificial superintelligence alliance will follow a similar upward trend. Readers will find insights on potential coin growth and market behaviors in this article. Dive in to discover which cryptocurrencies are primed for a breakout. Uptrend Momentum Amid Recent Volatility RENDER past performance shows a notable one-month climb of nearly 44% alongside a more modest 7% gain over the past six months. Weekly gains of approximately 7% have added to the overall positive picture. Price movements reflect active trading and steady improvement over time, with the asset showing resilience and a willingness to push higher despite earlier fluctuations. A balanced mix of upward momentum and temporary stagnation has characterized recent activity. The current price sits between $3.06 and $5.32, comfortably above the support level of $1.65 while still below the first resistance at $6.18. Bulls appear to be calling the shots with rising momentum, though the trend remains range-bound without a clear breakout. Trading within these levels could favor buying opportunities near support and cautious profit-taking near resistance. FET Price Dynamics: Rally Sparks Caution Amid Mixed Trends FET strong price movement defined the past month with a notable surge contrasted by a significant drop over the last six months. Recent activity suggests a volatile period where gains were short-lived amidst longer-term corrections. Price action appears choppy with fluctuations reflecting a mix of bullish interest and previous selling pressure, indicating unresolved long-term hesitation. Current pricing ranges between approximately $0.454 and $0.915, while resistance stands near $1.09 and a second resistance at $1.55. Bears and bulls are in a struggle over a sideways trend that lacks clarity. Traders might seek opportunities if prices test the $1.09 level for potential breakout trades or consider cautious entries should the low support at $0.17 hold, prompting careful strategies in these volatile conditions. Conclusion Render has shown a strong upward trend, catching the market's attention. This move has raised questions on whether FET will follow a similar path. Investors are watching closely, looking for signs of parallel growth. Both assets have unique strengths and potential. Observing the market's response to Render's performance could provide clues about FET's future. The link between their movements might offer valuable insights for making informed decisions.

The latter recently moved to a three-year high, as measured by the net minting volume for tokens backed by the precious metal. Over $80 million worth of these tokens were minted over the past month, according to data from rwa.xyz . That boost helped push the sector’s market cap up 6% to $1.43 billion. Meanwhile, monthly transfer volume rose 77% to $1.27 billion, marking a sharp resurgence of interest in digital representations of the precious metal. The rise in token activity mirrors a broader trend in the gold market. The World Gold Council’s latest report shows that total gold demand in the first quarter of the year reached 1,206 tonnes—a 1% year-over-year increase and the strongest first quarter since 2016. The surge came despite a slowdown in central bank purchases, which fell to 244 tonnes, down from 365 tonnes in the fourth quarter. Gold ETFs played a central role in the shift. Investment demand has more than doubled to 552 tonnes, suggesting investors are moving into the precious metal, a move central banks are known for historically. Those inflows helped push the average quarterly price of gold to a record $2,860 per ounce, up 38% from the previous year. Yet the price dipped 2.35% last week, after rising 23.5% year-to-date, while risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, rose. Spot gold is currently trading at $3,240. While traditional gold demand, such as jewelry, saw a downturn—dropping to pandemic-era lows—bar and coin demand stayed elevated, especially in China.

Bitcoin has recently crossed the $94,000 level and is heading toward its all-time high. In previous cycles, similar moves have led to strong rallies in the altcoin market.

By July 1, 2027, the EU will ban privacy tokens and anonymous crypto wallets . Digital assets like Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Dash will no longer be allowed across the region. This decision is part of the newly adopted Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR). This new rule aims to stop illegal financial activity and bring more transparency to the crypto industry. Privacy Coins Faces a Full Ban Under New EU Law The EU’s updated AMLR leaves no room for crypto assets that hide user identities. Article 79 of the regulation bans the use and storage of anonymous crypto tokens. The ban does not just target the tokens themselves. It also applies to any wallet or account that hides who owns it. Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs), exchanges, and financial institutions must stop supporting these assets. The move follows recommendations in the European Crypto Initiative’s new AML Handbook , which calls for strict oversight of anonymous financial tools. The EU is banning privacy coins to close a big gap in its old rules. It believes these cryptocurrencies allow people to avoid the transparency rules that apply to banks and traditional finance systems. A New Authority Will Enforce The New Rules The EU is establishing a new office called the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) to enforce these new rules. Starting in July 2027, AMLA will supervise at least 40 crypto service providers across several EU countries and ensure the new regulations are followed. Alongside the ban, stricter transaction rules will also take effect. Any crypto transfer over 1,000 euros will require complete identity checks for the sender and the receiver before completing the transaction. These new rules ensure that crypto follows the same standards as banks. The EU hopes this will help stop financial crime and clarify crypto rules. It is also part of a bigger plan, following the earlier Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), to create one set of digital finance laws for all EU countries. Crypto Market Reacts to the News After the EU’s announcement, the prices of privacy coins dropped sharply. Monero dipped by 7.2% and Zcash by 5.8%. This shows investors are moving money from coins that will soon be banned. Also, crypto companies plan to adjust their services, and some are considering moving to countries with flexible rules. Some people strongly disagree with the EU’s decision. Critics argued that the ban could hurt people who need financial privacy, especially in strict countries. However, the EU asserted that the rules are necessary to stop crime and make all financial services follow the same rules.

Ethereum ( ETH ) traded around $1,837 at last check on Saturday, while Ripple ( XRP ) was stuck at $2.20. Yet, both prices were much higher than their respective year-to-date lows. The two have a market cap of $220 billion and $150 billion, respectively. Chart patterns show that the XRP price may go parabolic soon, while Ethereum may crash to as low as $1,000. Ethereum price technical analysis Ethereum price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum price formed a double-top pattern at $4,086, with a neckline at $2,140, the lowest level on Aug. 5 last year. A double-top often leads to a strong, bearish breakout. The price target of this pattern is estimated by measuring the distance from the double-top to the neckline. In this case, the distance is about 47%. Measuring this distance from the neckline brings the target price at $952. The case for a bearish breakout is strengthened because it has struggled to cross the resistance at $2,000 and has formed a rising wedge, which is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines. Ethereum’s market cap will be about $120 billion if it drops to the psychological point at $1,000. You might also like: Red alert: Ethereum price crash to continue as rare pattern forms XRP price has bullish patterns XRP chart | Source: crypto.news The XRP token has also formed two chart patterns that may lead to a strong bullish breakout over time. It has formed a giant bullish pennant pattern on the daily chart. This pattern has a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. A bullish breakout normally happens when these two lines are about to converge. XRP has also formed a falling wedge pattern and has remained above the 100-day moving average. These signs point to an eventual rebound, with the next target being the year-to-date high of $3.4. Such a move will push its market cap to almost $200 billion. Fundamentally, XRP has more catalysts than Ethereum. The SEC is likely to approve a spot XRP ETF later this year, while the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin is gaining market share as its market cap rose to over $293 million. Therefore, if the ETH and XRP patterns work out, there is a likelihood that XRP will become the second-biggest cryptocurrency by the end of the year.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Glover said that holding onto the BTC carries several benefits including, price appreciation, tax deferment, and the potential to make extra revenue by lending out BTC held in corporate treasuries . The executive added: ""If you are mining, you are generating all this Bitcoin. You understand the thesis behind Bitcoin and why it is likely going to continue to appreciate in the future. You do not want to sell any of your Bitcoin."" This debt-based approach is similar to companies like Strategy, which issue corporate debt and equity to finance Bitcoin acquisition and profit from the diverging fundamentals of BTC and the fiat currencies the corporate capital raises are denominated in. BTC mining hashprice, a metric used to gauge miner profitability, has collapsed as ever-increasing computing resources are deployed to secure the network. Source: Hashrate Index Bitcoin-backed loans could be a valuable lifeline for miners struggling in the highly competitive industry, which is facing increased pressure due to the ongoing trade tensions brought on by the Trump administration's protectionist trade policies and macroeconomic uncertainty. Related: Riot Platforms secures $100M ‘Bitcoin-backed’ loan from Coinbase Trade war places even more pressure on beleaguered mining industry The Bitcoin mining industry is characterized by high competition and capital costs that increase over time as more powerful computing resources are used to mine blocks and secure the network. US President Trump's sweeping trade tariffs have cast a cloud over the already competitive sector, raising fears that import duties will raise the cost of mining equipment , like application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), to unsustainable levels. Mining firms collectively sold over 40% of their mined supply produced in March 2025 amid the heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and fears that the ongoing trade tensions will cause price increases across the board. According to TheMinerMag , this 40% sell-off marked the reversal of a trend that began post-halving, in April 2024, and represented the highest monthly BTC liquidation among miners since October 2024.

Whales accumulate, price rebound",https://crypto.news/cardano-price-coiled-spring-pounce-whales-start-buying/,"Cardano price continued to consolidate this week, but the ongoing whale accumulation and its technical pattern points to a rebound. Cardano ( ADA ), the popular layer-1 network, was trading at $0.70 on Saturday, a level it has remained at in the past few days. There are signs that whales are starting to accumulate as they expect the price to rebound in the coming weeks. Santiment data shows that the amount of ADA coins held by whales with between 10 million and 100 million coins has jumped to 12.8 billion, up from 12 billion in January. Similarly, whales holdin between 100 million and 1 billion coins have boosted their holdings to 3.14 billion from 2.6 billion in March. This accumulation trend may continue as sentiment in the crypto industry improves. Cardano whale action | Source: Santiment Retail and whale demand is also visible in staking data. According to StakingRewards , investors have added 307 million ADA tokens worth $215 million in the last 30 days. You might also like: S&P 500 climbs toward historic streak as jobs data, China talks boost sentiment There are three main potential reasons for this accumulation. First, market participants expect that Bitcoin ( BTC ) price will keep rising, with Standard Chartered seeing it hitting $200,000 in Q4. A strong Bitcoin surge often leads to more altcoin gains. Second, there are signs that the SEC, under Paul Atkins, will approve spot Cardano ETF, a move that may lead to more institutional demand. This demand will be much higher if the SEC allows these ETFs to offer staking features. Third, there are hopes that Cardano’s integration with Bitcoin will help to supercharge its assets in the decentralized finance industry. This integration will help Bitcoin holders to generate a monthly return. Cardano price technical analysis ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that ADA price has held steady at a crucial resistance level in the past few days. It is consolidating at the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The coin is also hovering slightly below the upper side of the falling wedge chart pattern. A wedge happens when there are two descending and converging trendlines. It often leads to a strong bullish breakout over time. Such a move would push Cardano price to $1.176, the neckline of the double-bottom pattern at $0.513. A double bottom is also one of the top bullish signs in the market.

Currently running its phase 4 presale at a price of $0.025, 55% of the tokens for this celebration have been claimed so far, indicating firm interest. Potential excitement on the parts of investors is being generated by the unique lending model and tokenomics framework of this project. With the imminent phase 5 price increase of 20% to $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seems destined to bring a revolutionary change in the crypto market. Its practical outlook toward decentralized finance has attracted a great deal of attention, translating into considerable profits for early investors. A Dual Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is disrupting the DeFi space by embedding a dual lending model of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer modes. To lend and earn upon assets deposited in pools—like USDT—the lender receives interest in the form of mtTokens: for example, mtETH or mtDAI are worthfully easing. On the other hand, a borrower would take a loan against collateral locked by him at an amount more than that of the loan so that stability is secured, that is, while taking a $5,000 loan, the collateral in ETH must be worth $7,000. This further bullish feature of its business model served to minimize the chances of default, thereby enhancing the trust of lenders. This P2P model allows for negotiation between both parties directly; thereby allowing funds to be lent on very odd assets, such as Dogecoin, which offer no value to traditional pools. Such a mode of essential freedom is defining accessibility in DeFi. Tokenomics Driving Demand The tokenomics are driving investor enthusiasm to a fever pitch regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Buyers now in phase 4 at $0.025 will profit 20% in phase 5 at $0.03. An additional 140% return can be expected at the rate of $0.06 upon listing, with analysts estimating that following the launch, expectations will rest at $2.50, giving rise to a staggering 9,900% ROI. At the heart of this buy-and-distribute system is the repurchase of MUTM tokens using revenue generated on the platform and their redistribution to mtToken stakers. This creates boundless buy pressure, fixing the value. Just recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) deployed a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding specific top holders with bonus tokens for retaining their position and thereby incentivizing loyalty. Security Coupled with Community Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on its way to securing the smart contracts through a CertiK audit, the outcome of which will be communicated through its social accounts. This openness will instill confidence in investors. The platform is doing great community engagement through a promotion event where $100,000 is offered as a giveaway in which 10 winners receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. The urgency is further compounded by the instinctive Phase 4 sell-out, with 55% already gone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) runs uniquely at what the crypto market really wants now: an actual utility-focused project that houses real-life financial instruments. With the innovation and stability that its value proposition covers, the perception of DeFi lending is drifting ever so much. Redefining DeFi Horizons Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reshape the way crypto and DeFi lending and borrowing work by developing solutions to real-life problems, rather than speculative hype. With its dual-lending model, tight tokenomics, and unique stance on security, the stage is now set for Mutuum to lead the pack in the crypto race come 2025. With phase four fast nearing completion and a price jump of 20% slated to follow, early opportunities for investors are now almost gone. Thus, the anticipated post-launch evaluation of $2.50 is a case for really huge returns. All investors that are interested to make a say in the future of DeFi wisely and quickly have to come on board! Visit the official website for more information.

After weeks of choppy price action and fading selling pressure, bulls are gradually regaining control, pushing ETH into a more bullish short-term structure. Momentum is building as Ethereum stabilizes above the $1,800 level, and technical indicators suggest a breakout may be forming. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Long-Legged Doji On Monthly Chart – Reversal Or Just A Pause? Adding to the growing optimism, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a consistent flow of ETH out of centralized exchanges—an indicator often associated with accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. Over the past week alone, net outflows have exceeded $380 million worth of Ethereum, reinforcing the view that investors are preparing for a move higher. Still, the key resistance at $2,000 remains a psychological and technical barrier. A confirmed push above this level could trigger a broader altcoin rally and signal the start of Ethereum’s next leg up. Until then, the market remains cautiously optimistic as bulls test the upper limits of this consolidation zone, looking for the momentum needed to escape it. Ethereum Faces Critical Test Amid Accumulation Trend Ethereum continues to face headwinds as it trades more than 55% below its December highs, hovering beneath the $2,000 resistance zone. While the broader crypto market shows signs of revival, ETH remains locked in a critical battle between supply overhead and renewed buying interest. The recent price structure shows some bullish development in lower time frames, as buyers attempt to build momentum. However, strong resistance levels still loom, and failure to break through could trigger a fresh move into lower demand zones around $1,700 or even $1,500. Despite these technical challenges, on-chain data paints a more encouraging picture. According to IntoTheBlock, centralized exchanges have seen net Ethereum outflows of roughly $380 million over the last seven days. This steady reduction in exchange-held ETH suggests a growing trend of accumulation, often interpreted as investors moving coins to cold storage rather than preparing to sell. This behavior typically reduces sell-side pressure and can lay the groundwork for more sustainable rallies. Market sentiment remains mixed. Some analysts argue that Ethereum is gearing up for a breakout, with shifting momentum hinting at an imminent surge. Others remain cautious, warning that macroeconomic uncertainty and fragile investor confidence could still pull ETH into a deeper correction. The coming days will be crucial in defining Ethereum’s trajectory. Related Reading: SUI Hype Grows As Price Action Points To A Rally: $4 Level In Focus ETH Price Analysis: Testing Key Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,837 after several days of consolidation just below the $1,850 level. As seen in the daily chart, ETH has been attempting to form a short-term bullish structure after rebounding from April lows near $1,550. The price has steadily climbed but now faces significant resistance near $1,850—a level that has acted as both support and resistance in previous months. Volume has been relatively stable but not convincingly high, indicating that bulls are gaining control but lack strong momentum to break through. The 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,271 and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,456 remain distant overhead targets. These levels represent key longer-term resistance, and reclaiming them would be a major bullish signal. Related Reading: HYPE Confirms Strength With Solid Throwback Response – Bullish Reversal? For now, ETH must close decisively above $1,850 to validate this short-term trend reversal. A failure to do so may result in another retest of support around $1,700 or even lower, particularly if broader market sentiment shifts. However, the price holding above recent swing lows and forming higher lows signals that bullish pressure is building gradually. A breakout above $1,850 would open the door to a move toward the $2,000–$2,200 zone.

The premier cryptocurrency has since made a return near $98,000, flirting with the highly coveted $100,000 level to kick off the weekend. Since losing the $100,000 price mark in early February, BTC has struggled to put up any major positive run in the past three months. The latest on-chain data suggests that the dream of reclaiming a six-figure valuation might truly be on, with the Bitcoin price looking to resume its bull run. What Negative Funding Rates Mean For BTC Price? In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha revealed that the Bitcoin funding rates on Binance have witnessed a significant decline in the past few days. The “funding rate” indicator is a metric that measures the periodic fee exchanged between traders in the derivatives (perpetual futures) market. A high or positive funding rate signals that the long traders (investors with buy positions) are paying a fee to short traders (investors with sell positions). This direction of the periodic payment typically indicates a dominant bullish sentiment in that particular market. On the flip side, when the funding rate metric has a negative value, it implies that investors with short positions are paying traders with buy positions in the derivatives market. This funding rate trend signals that the market is being dominated by the bears. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin funding rate on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has fallen into a deeply negative territory around -0.0008%. This development reflects a significant shift in the current market sentiment and dynamics . In their Quicktake post, Taha attributed the recent decline in the funding rate to the aggressive selling by the Bitcoin retail traders. The on-chain analyst then correlated the selling pressure to fear amongst market participants rather than “fundamental weakness.” Taha noted that when the funding rates become too negative, the Bitcoin market often becomes susceptible to a short squeeze, where short traders are forced to cover their positions due to rising prices — fueling a further upside move. Moreover, extremely low funding rates have been historically correlated with local price bottoms, preceding bullish trend reversals. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,950, reflecting a 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Suppose BTC’s recent bullish momentum and the latest on-chain observation are anything to go by, there is a strong chance of the premier cryptocurrency making a return above $100,000 this weekend.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Funding Rate|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-03 20:00:21

Experts Are Betting on Ruvi AI (RUVI) to Reach $1 And turn $1,000 into $100,000",https://timestabloid.com/avalanche-avax-price-prediction-could-it-reach-50-experts-are-betting/,"Avalanche (AVAX) is heating up in the crypto scene this May 2025, with the launch of MapleStory N on its Henesys subnet and a bullish breakout signaling potential for a massive rally toward $50. Analysts are watching AVAX closely as its ecosystem sees unprecedented growth and demand. But as investors focus on Avalanche, there’s a rising star quietly making noise in the crypto world. Enter Ruvi —a revolutionary cryptocurrency leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to redefine utility and drive massive returns for early adopters. If you’ve been on the sidelines, now is the time to act. Ruvi’s VIP presale offers jaw-dropping bonuses, giving investors the chance to multiply their portfolios before the token even hits the mainstream. Here’s why Ruvi could become the headline-grabber of 2025. Avalanche’s Buzz vs. Ruvi’s Breakthrough Avalanche is basking in the spotlight, rallying with the support of initiatives like MapleStory N and a surging Total Value Locked (TVL) which now stands at $1.29 billion. But even with its groundbreaking developments, AVAX remains focused on scalability and gaming-specific applications. Meanwhile, Ruvi offers broader utility, blending blockchain’s transparency with AI’s problem-solving power to bring real-world use cases to sectors like logistics, finance, and creator-driven economies. What Makes Ruvi Stand Out? Deflationary Supply Dynamics While Avalanche relies on its ecosystem to fuel token demand, Ruvi ensures value appreciation by capping its total token supply at 1.5 billion . This scarcity-driven model is a recipe for long-term growth as adoption grows. AI-Powered Ecosystem Ruvi introduces practical AI integration into its model, offering features like advanced fraud detection and predictive analytics to businesses. Avalanche may dominate gaming, but Ruvi is designed to reshape industries on a larger scale. Unparalleled Earning Potential While Avalanche holders hope for a possible 100% rally, Ruvi’s presale gives early investors access to even bigger gains through unique bonuses and low entry prices. Don’t Miss Ruvi’s VIP Presale Imagine locking in an investment when it’s most affordable and watching it skyrocket. Ruvi’s presale ensures maximum rewards for those who get in early, providing incredible bonuses that make every dollar count. $500 Starter Example Invest $500 in the Ruvi presale , and receive 50,000 tokens at $0.01 each. With a 40% bonus , that’s an additional 20,000 tokens , for a total of 70,000 tokens . If Ruvi reaches $0.80 , your holdings grow to a whopping $56,000 . That’s 11,200% ROI on a small initial stake! $10,000 Serious Investor Example A $10,000 investment secures 1,000,000 tokens , plus an incredible 100% bonus , which adds 1,000,000 tokens for a total of 2,000,000 tokens . If Ruvi hits $1.75 , your investment turns into an astounding $3,500,000 . Where else can you find returns like that? $15,000 High-Roller Opportunity For those aiming big, a $15,000 investment buys 1.5 million tokens . Combined with Ruvi’s 100% VIP bonus , your holdings double to 3 million tokens . At a future valuation of $2.50 , this multiplies to a jaw-dropping $7.5 million . This is generational wealth in the making. Why Ruvi Offers More Than Just Gains Ruvi isn’t just another token; it’s a dynamic solution to global challenges. Its AI-powered infrastructure seamlessly provides businesses with tools they can actually use, ensuring high demand and long-term holder rewards. While Avalanche is creating ripples in the GameFi sector, Ruvi is building a multi-industry platform poised to dominate. Time Is Running Out The crypto market rewards those who act decisively and punishes hesitation. With tokens priced at $0.01 during the presale, every passing day means fewer chances to lock in life-changing returns.
