Per an official Central Bank notice and a report from the Russian media outlet RBC , the bank has put its proposal up for public discussion. It will invite comments on the plan until June 15. Russian Stablecoins Plan According to the draft proposal, the bank wants to let Russian legal entities that do not meet the criteria of “qualified investors” to acquire “foreign digital rights.” The bank said that trading in these assets should be allowed “without any restrictions.” The USDC market cap over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) RBC wrote: “Some cryptocurrencies, in particular stablecoins , may fall under the bank’s definition” of foreign digital rights. However, the same media outlet pointed out that the rule change would likely not open the door for Russian firms who wish to trade coins like USDT and USDC. In mid-May, the bank updated its requirements for overseas assets allowed to circulate on the Russian market . The new requirements expressly outlaw assets that are underpinned by “securities issued by unfriendly issuers.” They do, however, make an exception for firms who use USDT and USDC as a payment tool in in cross-border trade deals. US Treasury Bill Reserves: A Problem for Russia? Tether’s reserves are reportedly mainly comprised of cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and US Treasury bills. Source: @OllieF/Dune Circle, the USDC operator, also holds much of its reserves in the form of short-dated treasuries held in regulated, sanctions-compliant domestic banks. However, the proposed rule change would open the door for Russian firms to do stablecoin-powered business with BRICS nations and other Moscow allies. Following the most recent BRICS Summit, held in Kazan, Russia, in October 2024, a number of tech players in India and elsewhere announced stablecoin plans for the bloc. BRICS players have also floated the idea of creating a gold-backed stablecoin that would do away with the need for dollar-denominated trade. Beijing and Hong Kong have also talked up the idea of adopting stablecoins that do not make use of USD-related assets.

DFAs Rule Change Imminent The size of Russia’s digital financial assets (DFAs) market is also continuing to increase. The bank’s latest plans also propose lowering the threshold for market entry. At present, qualified investors can only spend a maximum of 600,000 rubles ($7,570) per year on DFAs. But the bank wants to almost double this limit.

The document stipulates that all Russian legal entities will be able to acquire DFAs without any restrictions, regardless of whether or not they have qualified investor status. The bank noted that this will allow firms to use DFAs more actively. The regulator suggested this move could help firms solve commercial issues. If the proposal does not receive major objections, the bank could turn its proposal into binding guidelines for the domestic banking sector. These could come into force before the end of the month, the Central Bank explained.

While your focus might often be on Bitcoin charts and altcoin trends, major macroeconomic reports like the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book can significantly influence the landscape of the crypto market . Understanding these reports is crucial for navigating the current economic climate. The latest Beige Book has just landed, offering a snapshot of economic conditions across the Fed’s 12 districts. The headline finding? A slight decrease in overall economic activity . But what does this detailed report from the Federal Reserve truly tell us, and why should you care if you’re invested in digital assets? Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book Before diving into the specifics, let’s clarify what the Beige Book is. Published eight times a year, roughly two weeks before each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Beige Book provides anecdotal information on current economic conditions by district. It’s compiled from reports by Reserve Bank contacts, gathered through interviews with business contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources. Think of it as a qualitative report offering on-the-ground insights that complement the quantitative data the Fed analyzes. It covers various sectors, including consumer spending, manufacturing, real estate, and labor markets. The Federal Reserve uses this information to help inform its monetary policy decisions, making it a closely watched report by economists and market participants alike. Decoding the Findings: What Did the Report Reveal About Economic Activity? The key takeaway from the recent report is the slight decline in overall economic activity . This isn’t a widespread collapse, but rather a subtle cooling reported across several regions. Here’s a breakdown of the general picture: Overall Trend: Most districts reported either no change or slight declines in activity. This suggests a broad-based, albeit gentle, slowdown rather than an isolated issue. Mixed Regional Performance: While the national picture showed a slight dip, the report highlighted variations. Some regions noted improved conditions or positive outlooks, while others saw activity soften further or expressed concerns about the future. This divergence indicates uneven economic performance across the country. Sector-Specific Weakness: Certain sectors might be experiencing more pronounced slowdowns than others, although the initial summary points to a general moderation rather than deep distress in any single area. This reported dip in economic activity is a signal that previous economic momentum might be fading, which has direct implications for employment, consumer spending, and overall business health. Inflation Watch: What Does the Beige Book Say About the Inflation Rate? Another critical component of the Beige Book is its assessment of prices and wages, which provides insight into the current inflation rate . The latest report suggests that inflation is expected to continue at a moderate rate. Why is this significant? It indicates that while inflation may have peaked from its highest levels, it hasn’t yet fallen back to the Fed’s target rate. The persistence of a moderate inflation rate means: The cost of goods and services is still rising, albeit perhaps at a slower pace than before. Businesses may still face pressure from higher input costs, potentially impacting their profitability. Crucially, it suggests that the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation is not yet over. This persistent moderate inflation rate complicates the Fed’s job. They are balancing the goal of bringing inflation down with the risk of causing a significant recession by tightening monetary policy too aggressively. The Beige Book’s qualitative data on price pressures provides valuable context for this delicate balancing act. How Does This Economic Picture Impact the Crypto Market? Now, let’s connect the dots to the world of digital assets. The findings in the Beige Book have several potential implications for the crypto market : Risk-Off Sentiment: A reported decline in economic activity can fuel concerns about a potential recession. In such an environment, investors often become more risk-averse, pulling money out of assets perceived as riskier, which can include cryptocurrencies. Fed Policy Expectations: The Beige Book is a key input for the Federal Reserve’s decision-making. If the economic slowdown becomes more pronounced, it could signal that the Fed might pause or even reverse its interest rate hikes sooner than previously expected. Conversely, persistent inflation might necessitate continued tightening. Changes in expected Fed policy can cause significant volatility in the crypto market . Inflation Hedge Narrative: The continued forecast of a moderate inflation rate could potentially reinforce the narrative for assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. However, this narrative has been tested during recent tightening cycles, and crypto has often traded more like a risk-on tech asset. Liquidity: Monetary policy directly impacts liquidity in the financial system. If the Fed continues to drain liquidity (e.g., through quantitative tightening or high interest rates), it can reduce the capital available to flow into speculative assets like crypto. A slowing economy might influence the pace of this liquidity drain. Understanding the nuances of reports like the Beige Book helps crypto investors anticipate potential shifts in market sentiment and macro drivers. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the Beige Book’s insights into slowing economic activity and persistent inflation rate concerns, what steps can crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Don’t just follow crypto news. Pay attention to major economic reports and central bank commentary. The Federal Reserve is a major player influencing global liquidity. Understand the Macro Link: Recognize that the performance of the crypto market is increasingly tied to broader macroeconomic conditions and central bank actions. Assess Risk Tolerance: A slowing economy can increase market volatility. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance, especially if you anticipate further economic headwinds. Diversify (Wisely): Consider how different assets in your portfolio might perform in various economic scenarios (slowdown, persistent inflation). Watch Fed Communication: The next FOMC meeting will be crucial. The Beige Book provides context for the decisions that will be made regarding interest rates and monetary policy. Challenges and Opportunities The slight decline in economic activity presents challenges, such as potential recession risks and continued market uncertainty. However, it also presents potential opportunities. If the economy slows significantly, it could eventually lead the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy, which has historically been a tailwind for risk assets, including the crypto market . The persistence of the inflation rate remains a challenge, forcing the Fed to maintain a cautious stance. Navigating this environment requires patience and a clear understanding of the forces at play. Conclusion The Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book offers a valuable, albeit slightly concerning, look at the U.S. economy. The report of a slight decline in overall economic activity , coupled with expectations for a moderate inflation rate , paints a picture of an economy that is cooling but still facing price pressures. These factors are highly relevant to the crypto market , influencing everything from investor sentiment to expectations around future Fed policy. While the Beige Book doesn’t offer specific crypto trading signals, it provides essential context for the macroeconomic environment in which digital assets operate. Staying informed about these reports and understanding their potential impact is a key part of navigating the complexities of the current market landscape.

The landscape of Bitcoin investment is constantly evolving, and according to a prominent voice in the sector, the timing might be better than ever. Hunter Horsley, the Bitwise CEO , recently shared his perspective, suggesting that conditions are aligning favorably for those looking at Bitcoin. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley’s Take on Reduced Crypto Risk Hunter Horsley, the head of Bitwise Asset Management, a leading crypto asset manager, has made a notable statement regarding the current state of the market. Speaking with CNBC, Horsley indicated that he believes now represents an opportune moment for investors interested in Bitcoin. His conviction stems from a perceived “substantial” reduction in the overall crypto risk associated with the asset class. Investing inherently involves taking on some level of risk. However, Horsley’s point, as reported by The Daily Hodl, is that the most significant, foundational risks that once characterized the flagship cryptocurrency have considerably diminished. This shift, in his view, fundamentally alters the risk-reward profile for potential investors. Why is Crypto Risk Perceived as Lower Now? While the original report doesn’t detail every reason behind Horsley’s assessment, market observers point to several factors that contribute to a potential reduction in crypto risk compared to previous cycles: Market Maturity: The infrastructure around Bitcoin, including exchanges, custody solutions, and analytical tools, is far more developed than it was years ago. Institutional Adoption: Increased participation from large financial institutions, corporations, and even governments adds stability and legitimacy to the market. Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): While still evolving globally, there is increasing clarity and frameworks being developed in various jurisdictions, reducing uncertainty. Reduced Existential Threats: Early concerns about the fundamental viability or security of the Bitcoin network have largely subsided. This combination of factors suggests a market that, while still volatile, may present fewer unknown unknowns than in its nascent stages, potentially lowering the barrier for Bitcoin investment . Unlocking the Bitcoin Opportunity: Before Mainstream Recognition? Horsley’s comments highlight a specific window he sees opening. He suggests that the current environment presents a strong Bitcoin opportunity for those who get involved before Bitcoin achieves full mainstream recognition and widespread adoption. This perspective implies that while risk has decreased, significant growth potential remains before the asset becomes a standard component of every investor’s portfolio. This isn’t to say that volatility is gone. Price swings are still a characteristic of the crypto market. However, the argument is that the underlying systemic risks have lessened, making the speculative risk potentially more palatable for certain investors seeking exposure to this asset class. Navigating the Path Ahead: Considerations for Bitcoin Investment For individuals considering Bitcoin investment based on views like those of the Bitwise CEO , it’s crucial to approach it with a clear strategy. While the perceived reduction in crypto risk is a positive signal, it doesn’t eliminate the need for due diligence. Key considerations include: Investment Horizon: Are you investing for the short term or long term? Bitcoin has historically performed well over multi-year periods. Risk Tolerance: Despite reduced foundational risk, market price volatility remains high compared to traditional assets. Portfolio Allocation: How much of your overall investment portfolio are you comfortable allocating to a high-growth, high-volatility asset like Bitcoin?

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 319,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the memecoin SPX6900 ( SPX ) igniting steep surges based on the principles of the Elliott Wave theory, an advanced technical analysis approach that tries to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally, with wave three representing the longest and steepest upside move. Says Bluntz, “SPX looks insane in my opinion, it looks like the entire price action from the March lows is all 1-2s and hasn’t even had a wave three yet, setting the stage for a full-blown parabola later.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that SPX will rally to $2.20. At time of writing, SPX is worth $1.10. The analyst is also bullish on dogwifhat ( WIF ), another Solana-based memecoin. The trader predicts that WIF will hit $1.25 in the near term. “What a move on WIF already, well and truly reclaimed the range, and looking impulsive in my opinion, I think this pullback was a wave four low.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $0.97. Looking at the broader altcoin market, Bluntz believes that one group of coins has the potential to outperform all other tokens. “When the real altcoin bid returns, memes are always the strongest. It really doesn’t matter how badly you want fundamentals to matter, it won’t, because at the end of the day, it’s all vaporware anyway, and we all know it.” But beyond the crypto market, the trader says he has his eye on silver, an asset that he thinks can shatter its all-time high of around $50. “Silver/gold ratio looks like it’s starting to roll over with silver in USD gearing up finally for a major breakout. Relative to gold price action, $75 silver not outside the realm of possibility in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, silver is worth $34.50.

Dogecoin Slows & Ethereum Whales Pause,https://thecoinrise.com/unstaked-raises-over-9m-as-whales-dive-in-dogecoin-slows-ethereum-whales-pause/,"Money in the crypto market is flowing in new directions as momentum builds. Ethereum (ETH) whale activity is starting to slow, and Dogecoin (DOGE) seems to have lost its recent push upward. Meanwhile, Unstaked is surging ahead. With $9 million raised and over 1 billion coins sold, it’s gaining strong attention from top-tier wallets as the presale nears the $10 million mark. At a time when the market seeks the next major crypto trend, Unstaked is standing out in a big way. Combining AI-based tools, fair entry pricing, and a high-profile $1 million giveaway, Unstaked’s presale has gone well beyond typical early-stage crypto launches. It’s pulling in serious capital and interest from large-scale players. ETH Whales Hold Steady as Price Lingers Around $2,545 Ethereum has settled near $2,545, roughly 7% below its recent high. Though it’s been climbing gradually since April, new data shows large holders are not aggressively buying. Whale wallets have grown from 102 million ETH to 103.5 million, just a 1.5% increase since March. Still, Ethereum is supported by continued institutional interest, with $2.7 billion entering ETH funds in just the past week. Total value locked now sits at $132 billion, and $408 billion in value has been bridged across blockchains. However, activity on-chain hints that whales are now more cautious. Despite a bullish formation, there’s no breakout past the $2,730 Fibonacci barrier yet. In this cautious environment, presales like Unstaked, with lower entry and bigger growth chances, are gaining strong momentum. DOGE Drops Back to $0.21 Despite Bullish Setup DOGE continues to capture attention in the meme coin space, now trading at $0.21. Its price chart features patterns like a broadening wedge and multiple bull flags. Historically, these signals rapid moves, and many believe DOGE could hit $0.95 or even $1.00 if resistance is cleared. Still, despite the setups, DOGE has slipped 4% today and is now below a key ceiling. The outlook depends on the third quarter of 2025, when some expect the final bullish wave to kick in. For now, some major players are moving funds elsewhere. While DOGE holders wait for that next big move, others are turning to presales like Unstaked for quicker potential returns, and that’s where Unstaked is gaining ground. Unstaked’s Growth: Whales Back AI Utility and Presale Potential While established cryptos look for signals, Unstaked is executing a clear plan. In stage 18 of its presale, it’s currently priced at $0.010743, heading toward a launch price of $0.1819. That price difference shows a possible return of over 28x for early buyers, making it far more appealing than matured options like ETH or DOGE. Yet, the appeal isn’t just the price. The project’s strong utility focus is drawing serious attention. Unstaked is working on launching AI agents that will be live after the presale ends, supporting platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, and Discord. These agents aim to deliver useful content, automate tasks, and support social engagement in real-time. A key feature coming post-launch is the Custom Agent Marketplace. Here, users can design, trade, or customize AI bots, making it a useful tool for creators, community leads, and brands. Fair access is another highlight. There are no private token allocations, which keeps the process open for all. At launch, Unstaked will also ensure strong liquidity and adopt community governance, giving $UNSD holders the power to shape future updates. Its $1M giveaway is also getting attention. The campaign will select 20 winners, who will win $50,000 each. Entry is simple: share posts, refer others, and hold $UNSD coins. The giveaway has gone viral on social platforms, giving Unstaked organic reach that even major cryptos can struggle to match. Unstaked isn’t just topping presale numbers, it’s capturing attention, community interest, and major wallet activity. Summing Up! There’s still plenty to watch in the market as 2025 approaches. Ethereum whales show long-term strength, but new moves have slowed. DOGE is holding on to bullish hopes, though its next breakout remains uncertain. Unstaked, on the other hand, is already showing signs of leading. With more than $9 million secured, over 1 billion coins sold, and a full plan in motion, it’s attracting serious funds typically tied to the top names. For those navigating the market for the next breakout crypto , Unstaked is no longer a secret, it’s one to watch.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially confirmed a significant development: the formal acknowledgement of an application for a Spot SUI ETF . This move, reported by BWE News via X, marks a crucial procedural step forward for the potential launch of an exchange-traded fund that would directly hold SUI tokens. What Does the SEC Acknowledgment Mean for the SUI ETF? For those unfamiliar with the regulatory process, the SEC’s acknowledgement is not an approval. Think of it as the SEC saying, “Okay, we’ve received your homework.” It signifies that the application has been formally filed and has entered the regulatory review pipeline. The specific application acknowledged comes from 21Shares, a prominent player in the crypto asset management space known for filing various crypto ETF proposals. Here’s a simple breakdown of what this initial SEC step entails: Formal Filing: The application meets the initial requirements for submission. Beginning of Review Period: It triggers official timelines for the SEC to review the proposal. Public Record: The application becomes part of the public record, allowing for transparency and potential public comments. Not Approval: Crucially, this does not indicate anything about the likelihood of the SUI ETF being approved or rejected. This acknowledgement sets the stage for a potentially lengthy and complex review process, similar to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF applications in the past. The Path to a Spot SUI ETF: What Happens Next? Following the acknowledgement, the application for the Spot SUI ETF enters a defined timeline under SEC rules. The initial period for the SEC to make a decision (approve, disapprove, or delay) is typically 45 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register. However, the SEC has the authority to extend this period multiple times, often leading to review processes that can take several months. Key stages in the SEC review process often include: Initial Review: SEC staff examine the filing for compliance with securities laws. Public Comment Period: The public is invited to submit comments on the proposal. These comments can influence the SEC’s decision-making. Amendments: The applicant (21Shares in this case) may need to file amendments to address SEC questions or concerns. Decision Points: The SEC faces statutory deadlines to either approve, disapprove, or further delay the decision. The outcome is far from guaranteed. The SEC has historically been cautious with crypto products, particularly those directly holding underlying assets, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the maturity of the underlying market. However, the recent approvals of Bitcoin spot ETFs have set a precedent that proponents hope will pave the way for other digital assets like SUI . Why a Spot SUI ETF Matters: Potential Benefits and Challenges for SUI The prospect of a Spot SUI ETF is significant because it could bridge the gap between traditional finance and the SUI ecosystem. An ETF structure allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of SUI without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the private keys of the cryptocurrency itself. This accessibility is a major draw for institutional investors and retail investors who prefer using traditional brokerage accounts. Potential Benefits: Increased Accessibility: Opens the door for a broader range of investors, including those in traditional financial markets. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased investment inflows could boost the liquidity of the SUI market. Potential Price Impact: Higher demand driven by ETF investment could positively influence the price of SUI . Market Legitimacy: An SEC-approved ETF could lend greater credibility and legitimacy to the SUI network in the eyes of mainstream finance. Easier Portfolio Diversification: Provides a straightforward way for investors to add SUI exposure to diversified portfolios. Potential Challenges and Risks: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s approval is not guaranteed and depends on evolving regulatory perspectives. Market Volatility: SUI’s price, like other cryptocurrencies, is subject to significant volatility, which an ETF would reflect. Competition: The broader Crypto ETF market is becoming more competitive, potentially diluting focus. Underlying Asset Risk: Risks associated with the SUI network itself (e.g., technical issues, adoption challenges) would still impact the ETF’s performance. Understanding these potential upsides and downsides is crucial for anyone following the development of the SUI ETF . Comparing SUI’s Journey to Other Crypto ETF Efforts The filing and acknowledgement of a Spot SUI ETF application is part of a larger trend in the financial industry seeking to package cryptocurrencies into familiar investment vehicles. Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in early 2024 after years of applications and rejections, marking a watershed moment. Applications for Ethereum spot ETFs are currently under review, with decisions expected in the coming months. SUI’s application follows this pattern, indicating growing interest in bringing a wider array of digital assets into the regulated ETF structure. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have first-mover advantage and larger market caps, the filing for SUI suggests that issuers like 21Shares see potential investor demand and are proactively seeking regulatory pathways for newer, prominent blockchain networks. This broader context of Crypto ETF development highlights a maturing market and increasing institutional comfort levels, albeit under strict regulatory scrutiny. Navigating the Future of SUI Investment: Actionable Insights For investors and market participants, the SEC’s acknowledgement of the SUI ETF application is a development to watch closely. While it doesn’t require immediate action, it’s an opportunity to become informed. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor SEC Updates: Keep an eye on official SEC announcements and filings regarding the 21Shares SUI ETF application. Pay attention to deadlines and requests for comments. Understand the Asset: If you are considering investing in SUI, whether directly or potentially via an ETF, ensure you understand the SUI network, its technology, use cases, and risks. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments, including through ETFs, carry significant risk. Evaluate if this aligns with your investment goals and risk profile. Diversification: Remember that any single asset, including SUI, should likely be part of a diversified investment strategy. The road to an approved SUI ETF is likely to have twists and turns, but this initial step by the SEC is undeniably noteworthy. Summary: A New Horizon for SUI? The official acknowledgement by the SEC of 21Shares’ application for a Spot SUI ETF is a procedural but symbolically important event. It signals that SUI is now formally on the regulatory radar for a potential ETF product, placing it alongside larger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have gone through or are undergoing similar processes. While approval is far from certain and the review period could be extensive, this development opens the door to increased mainstream accessibility and potential institutional interest in SUI. It’s a positive indicator of the growing maturation of the crypto market and the persistent efforts to integrate digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. The coming months will be critical in determining the fate of this application and its potential impact on the future of SUI investment.

Recently, cloud mining platform Bitfufu shared its operational report for May, revealing significant figures regarding its Bitcoin mining output and asset management. Bitfufu’s May Performance: What the Numbers Show Bitfufu, a prominent name in the cloud mining space, officially announced details of its May performance via its website. The report highlighted two key figures that caught the attention of the market: the total amount of Bitcoin mined during the month and the portion of that mined Bitcoin that was sold. According to Bitfufu’s announcement, the platform successfully mined a total of 400 BTC throughout May. This figure represents the aggregate output from the mining power hosted and managed by Bitfufu during that period. Alongside this impressive mining output, the company also reported selling 178 BTC from its reserves or recent mining production. As of the close of business on May 31st, Bitfufu maintained a substantial reserve of Bitcoin, holding a total of 1,709 BTC. These numbers provide a snapshot of Bitfufu’s operational efficiency, its strategic decisions regarding liquidity versus holding assets, and the scale of its mining operations. Let’s break down the key figures from Bitfufu’s May report: Total BTC Mined in May: 400 BTC Total BTC Sold in May: 178 BTC Total BTC Held as of May 31st: 1,709 BTC These figures are crucial for understanding the company’s activity and how it navigates the dynamic crypto market . Understanding Bitcoin Mining Output Mining 400 BTC in a single month is a significant achievement in the current Bitcoin mining landscape. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive process that involves using powerful computers (mining rigs) to solve complex mathematical problems. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the next block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin (the block reward) plus transaction fees. The amount of Bitcoin a mining operation can produce depends on several factors: Hashrate: This is the total computing power the operation contributes to the network. A higher hashrate increases the probability of solving blocks. Network Difficulty: This adjusts approximately every two weeks to ensure that blocks are mined roughly every 10 minutes. If more miners join the network, difficulty increases, making it harder to find blocks. Block Reward: This is the amount of new Bitcoin awarded for mining a block. This amount halves approximately every four years (known as the Bitcoin halving). The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, reducing the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Efficiency of Mining Hardware: Newer generation mining rigs are more energy-efficient, allowing miners to produce more Bitcoin for the same operational cost. Electricity Costs: This is the primary operational expense. Lower electricity costs mean higher profitability and potentially more resources dedicated to mining. Bitfufu’s ability to mine 400 BTC in May, following the April halving, suggests a substantial operational scale and potentially efficient hardware and energy sourcing. This level of output positions them as a significant player in the global Bitcoin mining sector. Analyzing Bitfufu’s BTC Holdings and Sales Strategy One of the most interesting aspects of a mining company’s report is its strategy regarding mined Bitcoin. Miners face a constant decision: sell mined BTC immediately to cover operational costs and realize profits, or hold onto the BTC (HODL) in anticipation of future price increases. Bitfufu’s report shows they mined 400 BTC and sold 178 BTC in May. This indicates a strategy that balances realizing immediate value with accumulating assets. Selling 178 BTC likely helps cover significant operational expenses such as electricity, hosting fees, and maintenance. Mining operations have high fixed and variable costs, and selling a portion of mined assets is a common practice to ensure financial stability and fund ongoing operations or expansion. Simultaneously, holding 1,709 BTC as of May 31st demonstrates a strong conviction in the long-term value of Bitcoin. By retaining a significant portion of their mined BTC (or previously acquired BTC), Bitfufu is positioned to benefit from potential future increases in Bitcoin’s price. This level of BTC holdings provides the company with significant exposure to the performance of the underlying asset it helps produce. Mining companies’ selling pressure can sometimes influence the crypto market , particularly during periods of low liquidity. However, the sale of 178 BTC by Bitfufu in the context of the overall daily Bitcoin trading volume is relatively small and unlikely to have a major impact on the global market price. It is more indicative of Bitfufu’s internal financial management and strategic outlook. The Cloud Mining Model: Bitfufu’s Core Business Bitfufu operates primarily as a cloud mining platform. This model allows individuals and institutions to participate in Bitcoin mining without needing to purchase, set up, and maintain their own mining hardware. Users essentially rent hashing power from Bitfufu’s data centers for a specified period. Benefits of the cloud mining model for users include: Accessibility: Low barrier to entry compared to buying expensive mining rigs. No Hardware Management: Users don’t deal with installation, heat, noise, or maintenance issues. No Electricity Concerns: The cloud provider handles the significant electricity costs and infrastructure. For Bitfufu, the cloud mining model means managing large-scale data centers, acquiring and maintaining vast numbers of mining rigs, securing reliable and cost-effective electricity, and providing a stable platform for users. The 400 BTC mined in May represents the total output generated by the hashing power across their facilities, which is then distributed among their cloud mining clients and potentially allocated to Bitfufu’s own operations, depending on their business model and contracts. The health of a cloud mining platform like Bitfufu is closely tied to its operational efficiency, the profitability of mining (driven by Bitcoin price, difficulty, and electricity costs), and its ability to attract and retain users. Reports like the May performance update offer transparency into the operational success that underpins their service. Bitfufu’s Strategy in the Broader Crypto Market Context Bitfufu’s May performance occurred within a dynamic crypto market . May saw fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price, continued adjustments post-halving, and evolving sentiment regarding macroeconomic factors and institutional adoption. A mining company’s decision to sell or hold BTC is often influenced by market conditions: High Prices: Miners may sell more BTC when prices are high to maximize revenue and secure profits. Low Prices/High Costs: Miners might be forced to sell more BTC, even at lower prices, to cover rising operational costs, especially electricity, which can be a significant challenge. Market Sentiment: Bullish sentiment might encourage holding, while bearish sentiment could lead to more selling to reduce risk. Bitfufu’s decision to sell 178 BTC while holding onto a much larger amount (1,709 BTC) suggests a balanced approach, adapting to the current market environment while maintaining a long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin. Their substantial BTC holdings are a key asset that appreciates with the market, while the sales ensure liquidity for ongoing business needs. Monitoring the reports of major mining companies like Bitfufu provides valuable data points for anyone interested in the infrastructure layer of the crypto market . These reports offer insights into the production side of Bitcoin and how key industry players are positioning themselves. What Can We Learn? Actionable Insights Bitfufu’s May report offers several takeaways: Large-scale Bitcoin mining operations remain highly active and productive, even after the halving event. Companies like Bitfufu employ strategic asset management, balancing the need for liquidity (selling BTC) with long-term investment (holding BTC). The size of a company’s BTC holdings is a significant indicator of its balance sheet strength and long-term market view. Operational reports from mining companies provide transparency into the health and scale of the mining sector, which is a foundational part of the crypto market . For investors or those considering cloud mining, understanding the provider’s operational performance and financial strategy, as demonstrated by Bitfufu’s report, is crucial for assessing risk and potential returns. Conclusion: Bitfufu’s Steady Hand in a Volatile Market Bitfufu’s May operational report paints a clear picture of a large-scale cloud mining operation actively contributing to the Bitcoin network. Mining 400 BTC demonstrates significant operational capacity, while the strategic decision to sell 178 BTC highlights prudent financial management aimed at covering costs and ensuring liquidity.

The total crypto market cap dropped 3 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $3.4 trillion on Wednesday, during the late North American trading session. Dogecoin price dropped around 3 percent to retest the support level of around $0.187 at the time of this writing. Nonetheless, the top memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $28 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of around $748 million, has recorded a 10 percent gain in the past four weeks. Dogecoin Network Thrives on Institutional Demand As a veteran altcoin secured through the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, the Dogecoin network has continued to attract more institutional investors. As Coinpedia previously reported, the odds of a spot Dogecoin ETF approval in the United States before the end of this year remain very high. According to Polymarket , the odds of the U.S. SEC approving a spot DOGE ETF before the end of this year stands at 51 percent chance, up 15 percent in the past 24 hours. Some of the fund managers seeking to offer spot DOGE ETFs in the United States include 21Shares, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Rex Shares among others. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin network received a boost after the Coinbase-backed Base network announced the launch of a wrapped DOGE, thus enhancing the memecoin’s adoption via DeFi and smart contracts. Midterm Targets for DOGE Price Dogecoin price has continued to signal bullish sentiment amid the rising calls for the onset of an altseason 2025.

From a Trump-backed ETF filing to Russia’s push against the U.S. dollar and Binance’s explosive growth, global forces are aligning in Bitcoin’s favor. At the same time, BTC is squeezing inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, hinting at a breakout. This article examines the political, macroeconomic, and technical factors influencing the next move in Bitcoin’s price prediction. Trump-Backed Bitcoin ETF Could Stir Bullish Momentum Bitcoin remains stable around $104,814, with daily trading volume exceeding $43.7 billion; however, several developments suggest the next move may not be as quiet. A significant catalyst emerged on June 3, when Yorkville America Digital filed a Truth Social-branded Bitcoin ETF through NYSE Arca, backed by the Trump Media & Technology Group.

Advocating for national currencies and decentralized systems, Lavrov’s message was clear: economic sovereignty depends on abandoning dollar hegemony. Russia’s move aligns with the efforts of BRICS and ASEAN to explore alternatives, such as blockchain and digital assets. In this context, Bitcoin’s role as a neutral settlement asset becomes more compelling. Macro trends strengthening BTC: Growing geopolitical resistance to dollar dominance Centralized networks are losing credibility Decentralized assets are gaining traction in emerging markets For Bitcoin, this could translate into broader international adoption, particularly in trade settlement and reserve diversification—both of which support long-term price appreciation. Binance Hits 275M Users, Fueling Crypto Accessibility On June 2, Binance announced that it now serves 275 million registered users, representing an increase of 80 million since January 2024. That’s an average of 156,000 new users per day—a sign of accelerating global crypto adoption. 275 million strong and growing.

Bitcoin Teeters at $105K: Triangle Squeeze Signals Imminent Breakout The Bitcoin price prediction is neutral, as BTC is currently locked in a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 2-hour chart, trading just below the resistance level at $105,344. Price action has formed a tightening range of lower highs and higher lows since late May, suggesting an imminent breakout. Technicals reveal weakening bullish momentum: Price is struggling below the 50-period EMA MACD is fading, with a bearish crossover Failed breakout near $106,767 formed a shooting star candlestick Trade Setup: Bearish case : A break below $104,500 could trigger moves to $104,098 and $102,111 Bullish case : A confirmed close above $105,344 could lead to retests of $106,767 and $107,811 Traders should watch for a confirmed 2-hour candle close outside the triangle to validate the move. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.78M Cap as 61% APY Staking Draws Yield Hunters With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $6,801,303 out of its $7,789,647 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002545 is expected to rise once the cap is met. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand.

45526202,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=740884,1749082646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45526202.jpeg,Ripple CTO’s alarm over Trump wallet reveals crypto's trust crisis,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-cto-warns-of-crypto-trust-crisis/,"The official X accounts of Magic Eden and TrumpMeme recently posted announcements promoting a new crypto product called the ‘Trump Wallet’. They described it as the official wallet for Trump supporters to join the $TRUMP crypto and access features like promised sweepstakes and future rewards. The company behind this new wallet , FightFightFight LLC, quickly caught people’s attention because it helped launch the “Official Trump Coin” earlier this year. Things got even more interesting when people discovered that FightFightFight’s parent company, CIC Digital LLC, has direct links to the Trump Organization. This connection made it seem like the wallet might be officially approved by, or at least connected to, the Trump brand. However, A few hours after the news came out, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump made strong public statements denying any connection to the wallet, with Donald Jr. claiming the Trump Organization had “zero involvement.” Similarly, Eric Trump warned the Magic Eden team to be careful about using the Trump name without permission. He suggested they might take legal action against the people behind the project for using the Trump brand without approval. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, shared his thoughts on X and called the situation “very bizarre.” He noted that the TrumpMeme account promoting the wallet belonged to the same company that launched the Trump Coin, which is something the Trump family had never publicly rejected before. Schwartz wondered if someone had hacked the accounts that posted about the wallet, but he quickly said that probably wasn’t the case. Instead, he asked a bigger question: “What is going on here?” This case isn’t just about one wallet that might be linked to the Trump brand. The real problem is this shows the crypto community that companies can easily create products that seem official. Influencers and platforms can spread the news fast without checking the facts, and regular users often struggle to tell what’s real and what’s fake. Lack of transparency and accountability in Web3 enables confusion and scams Crypto and Web3 often claim that cutting out middlemen and central control gives users more freedom. However, it also makes it harder to know who’s really behind a project and who should be held responsible when things go wrong. Unlike traditional companies where owners and executives are known and legally accountable, Web3 projects can launch with anonymous teams, fake names, or loosely connected groups, making it difficult for users to identify who actually controls the assets. The Trump Wallet incident clearly shows several groups were involved in creating the wallet, including FightFightFight LLC and companies tied to earlier Trump crypto projects. Still, the branding was confusing, and the message wasn’t clear. If users can’t trust what they see on the blockchain or social media, even when it looks official, it’s hard to know what’s real. Blockchains should offer transparency, but that promise means little if the people behind the projects stay hidden, give false information, or deny involvement. Sadly, this kind of confusion is common in crypto, as many tokens, wallets, and projects use the names or pictures of famous brands or people without getting their permission, causing scams and spreading misinformation. Are weak rules letting fake crypto projects grow? In the United States, regulators like the SEC and CFTC have struggled to agree on who should oversee crypto assets, leaving the industry stuck in a state where no one agency takes full responsibility. Without clear rules, crypto projects like the Trump Wallet can operate in a legal gray area because no one checks who is behind them confirms if they are real, or enforces rules to protect investors and users. In traditional financial markets, pretending to be a famous brand or person is a serious crime and usually leads to fast legal action. But in the crypto world, legal protection is weaker and slower. The technology is still new and complex, and regulators are still figuring out their roles. Transparency isn’t optional; It’s the foundation David Schwartz didn’t directly accuse anyone of fraud in the Trump Wallet case, but he clearly showed that when people don’t know what’s real, they feel unsure and hesitate to invest. The biggest issue wasn’t whether the Trump Wallet was real, fake, or just misunderstood; rather, users had no clear way to tell the difference, leaving them confused and at risk. The crypto community believes transparency should be the foundation of every project. They want tools and systems that show who runs a project by verifying identities on the blockchain. Additionally, they support regular open audits to show how money is being used and clear statements about who owns the rights to any names or brands involved. These steps would reduce confusion, protect investors, and help build a safer, more trustworthy crypto space where people can invest confidently, not fearfully.

The financial world often sends us mixed signals, and today was no exception as the US Stock Market closed with varied results across its major indices. While you might be primarily focused on the crypto market, understanding the pulse of the traditional stock market is absolutely critical. Why? Because these markets don’t exist in isolation. What happens in the stock market, especially with key indices like the Nasdaq, can often provide valuable insights into broader investor sentiment and economic health, which ultimately influence the cryptocurrency landscape. Understanding the Latest US Stock Market Performance Let’s break down the numbers from today’s closing bell. The three major indices painted a picture of divergence: Index Today’s Change S&P 500 +0.01% Nasdaq Composite +0.32% Dow Jones Industrial Average -0.22% As you can see, the S&P 500, representing the performance of 500 large companies listed on U.S. exchanges, finished essentially flat, showing neither significant gains nor losses. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite managed a modest gain, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States, registered a slight dip. This kind of mixed Stock Market Performance is often more complex to interpret than a broad rally or sell-off. What Drove This Mixed Stock Market Performance Today? Trying to pinpoint exact reasons for a mixed market day can be challenging, as numerous factors are always at play. However, we can look at potential influences that might contribute to such divergent movements: Sector Rotation: Sometimes, investors move money between different sectors of the economy. Today’s action might suggest some rotation, perhaps into technology and growth stocks (benefiting the Nasdaq) and out of more traditional industrial or value stocks (impacting the Dow). Economic Data Releases: Any economic reports released during the day could have influenced specific sectors or overall sentiment. Data on inflation, employment, or consumer confidence can cause investors to reassess their positions. Company-Specific News: Earnings reports or significant news from major companies within each index can heavily sway its performance, especially for indices like the Dow which is less diversified than the S&P 500. Interest Rate Expectations: Shifting expectations about future interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve can impact different types of stocks differently. Growth stocks on the Nasdaq can be particularly sensitive to rate changes. Understanding these underlying dynamics is key to making sense of the overall Stock Market Performance . Nasdaq’s Gain vs. Dow’s Dip: Decoding Key Market Trends The divergence between the Nasdaq ‘s gain and the Dow’s loss is particularly noteworthy. The Nasdaq is heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies. A positive day for the Nasdaq often indicates investor confidence in the future growth prospects of these innovative firms. Conversely, the Dow is more representative of ‘old economy’ industrial giants. Its slight decline could signal caution regarding more traditional economic sectors or specific headwinds faced by its constituent companies. This split performance could be indicative of subtle shifts in Market Trends . Are investors favoring growth over value? Is there specific positive news impacting the tech sector that isn’t affecting industrials? Or is it simply day-to-day volatility amplified by low trading volume? Analyzing the sector performance within each index would provide a clearer picture of these emerging trends. Why US Stock Market Movements Matter to Crypto Investors You might be asking, “Why should I care about the US Stock Market when I’m focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum?” It’s a great question! While crypto is a distinct asset class, it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. There’s a noticeable correlation, particularly between the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the crypto market. Here’s why this connection exists: Risk Sentiment: Both tech stocks (especially high-growth ones) and cryptocurrencies are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets. When investors feel optimistic about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, both markets tend to perform well. Conversely, in times of uncertainty or fear, investors often pull back from riskier assets, impacting both tech stocks and crypto. Macroeconomic Factors: The same macroeconomic forces driving the Stock Market Performance – inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, economic growth – also influence the crypto market. Central bank policies, for instance, affect liquidity and investor appetite for risk across all asset classes. Institutional Adoption: Many institutions that invest in cryptocurrencies also have significant exposure to traditional financial markets. Their overall portfolio performance and risk management decisions can influence their crypto allocations. Monitoring the Market Trends in stocks can therefore offer clues about the prevailing risk sentiment and macroeconomic environment, which are crucial inputs for understanding potential movements in the crypto market. Navigating These Market Trends: Actionable Insights So, what can you take away from today’s mixed close? Stay Informed: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Keep an eye on major stock indices like the S&P 500 , Nasdaq, and Dow. Understand what drives their movements. Analyze Correlation: Observe how the crypto market reacts to significant moves in the stock market, especially the Nasdaq. While not always perfectly correlated, patterns often emerge. Watch Economic Data: Pay attention to major economic indicators like CPI (inflation), jobs reports, and FOMC announcements. These impact stocks and, by extension, can influence crypto. Understand Sector Performance: A mixed day like today highlights that different parts of the economy and market are behaving differently. This nuance is important. Diversification is Key: This applies to both traditional and crypto portfolios. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and understand how different assets might perform under varying market conditions. Today’s Stock Market Performance serves as a reminder that the financial world is interconnected. While crypto has its unique drivers, it is increasingly influenced by the broader economic and market landscape. In conclusion, the mixed close in the US Stock Market today – with the S&P 500 flat, Nasdaq up, and Dow down – reflects a nuanced picture of current investor sentiment and potential sector rotation. For those focused on cryptocurrencies, understanding these Market Trends is not just academic; it’s a valuable tool for assessing the overall risk environment and potential future market movements. Staying informed across all major financial markets provides a more complete perspective.

The firm cited limited near-term upside after the stock rally caused by the announcement of a power purchase agreement (PPA). Constellation shares plummeted 2.6% in premarket trading on Wednesday by 08:21 GMT. Citi analyst Ryan Levine argued that the Meta deal marked a significant shift in the power contracting landscape but also prompted a reassessment of valuation assumptions.

The firm also said the agreement was priced in the range of $70 to $95 per megawatt-hour. The investment bank acknowledged that the deal adds approximately $12 per share of value versus a no-deal scenario but does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power. Levine also noted the lack of a geographic proximity requirement as a notable feature of the deal. “This deal has broad implications on the power markets as it signals future contracting activity.” -Ryan Levine, Wall Street Analyst at Citi. Levine argued that much of the benefit from such agreements is priced into the stock, which has surged since Citi’s prior upgrade in April. The analyst also raised the price target on Constellation Energy shares to $318 from $232 to reflect the increased scarcity value of the firm’s existing nuclear feet and the potential for additional data center deals. Citi’s valuation assumes that ~70% of CEG’s existing nuclear plants with licenses expiring before 2045 could secure similar data center deals at around $80/MWh. The investment bank also believes there will be an uplift in EV/EBITDA multiples to reflect their increased scarcity value. Still, with Constellation’s shares closing at $313.42 on June 3, the implied return is just 2%, including dividend yield. Levine said there’s a balanced risk to the upside and the downside for CEG. He also sees a high-risk classification of the stock due to volatility in power prices, policy uncertainty, and execution challenges related to plant restarts. GuruFocus research company noted that the one-year price targets offered by 13 analysts showed the average target price of the energy company is $307.44, with a high estimate of $385.00 and a low estimate of $184.05. The average target indicates a 1.79% drop from the current price of $313.03. Based on the consensus recommendation from 17 brokerage firms, Constellation’s average brokerage recommendation is currently 2.0, indicating outperform status. The rating scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 shows Strong Buy, and 5 denotes Sell. The analytics firm also estimated that the GF Value for Constellation in one year is $106.54, suggesting a downside of 65.96% from the current price of $313.03. GuruFocus uses GF Value to estimate the fair value at which the stock should be traded. The firm noted that it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and future estimates of the business’ performance. Citi downgrades Constellation Brands Citigroup also downgraded the outlook for Constellation Brands from Buy to Neutral. The firm noted in March that the 2,106 funds or institutions reporting positions in Constellation represent a decrease of 4 owner(s) or 0.19% in the last quarter.

These include Binance’s rising market dominance, renewed accumulation by long-term holders (LTH), and significant BTC withdrawals from major crypto exchanges. Bitcoin Showing Signs Of Renewed Strength At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading in the mid-$100,000 range – approximately 6.1% below its latest all-time high (ATH) recorded on May 22. The flagship cryptocurrency has declined more than 3.5% over the past seven days amid renewed concerns over global trade tensions and tariffs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? However, according to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, several bullish signals have emerged since the start of June. Most notably, the LTH Net Position Realized Cap recently crossed the $20 billion threshold, reflecting increased confidence among seasoned investors. For context, LTHs are entities that have held BTC for over 155 days. Often referred to as “smart money,” these investors typically follow long-term strategies and are less likely to sell during short-term market corrections. The Realized Cap metric tracks the total value of BTC held by LTHs, based on the price at which coins were last moved. A rising value in this metric implies accumulation by long-term investors – behavior that historically precedes bullish continuation phases. Meanwhile, major exchanges such as Kraken and Bitfinex have witnessed substantial BTC outflows. Over two consecutive days, more than 20,000 BTC exited these platforms – marking one of the largest short-term withdrawal spikes in recent months. Such major Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are considered bullish because they signal that investors intend to hold their BTC in private wallets rather than sell it, reducing the available supply for trading. This supply contraction can create upward pressure on price, especially when demand remains steady or increases. At the same time, Binance has strengthened its lead in spot market dominance. Since early June, its share of BTC spot trading volume has increased from 26% to 35%, signalling growing market activity. This uptick aligns with BTC testing key resistance levels. Taha remarked: The convergence of rising exchange dominance, long-term holder confidence, and supply tightening paints a bullish picture for Bitcoin. While short-term corrections are possible, the underlying demand and reduction in available BTC on exchanges suggest that the uptrend is far from over. BTC Benefitting From Neutral Funding Rates, Low Selling Pressure Recent on-chain data shows that the BTC derivatives market has undergone a complete reset, with its funding rates now hovering around zero, not showing any directional bias. Similarly, selling pressure on BTC has remained subdued, evident from low Binance inflows.

According to the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , a truly massive amount of Bitcoin has just changed hands. We’re talking about 8,022 BTC , a sum that translates to a staggering $843 million based on current market prices. The significant part of this transaction isn’t just the sheer volume or value, but its origin and destination. The funds were moved out of a wallet associated with the major cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase , and sent to an ‘unknown new wallet’. What Exactly Did Whale Alert Report About This BTC Transfer? For those keeping an eye on large crypto movements, Whale Alert is the go-to source. Their automated system constantly scans various blockchains, reporting transactions that exceed a certain threshold. In this case, the 8,022 BTC transfer was far above that threshold, triggering an immediate alert across their platforms. Here are the key details of the reported transaction: Amount: 8,022 BTC Approximate USD Value: $843,000,000 Source: Coinbase (identified as a wallet associated with the exchange) Destination: Unknown New Wallet Reported By: Whale Alert This type of alert is crucial because large movements of cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin , can sometimes signal potential market shifts or strategic moves by major players, often referred to as crypto whale s. Why Track Crypto Whale Activity? Do These Big Moves Matter? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ refers to individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Because they hold such significant portions of the total supply, their actions – buying, selling, or transferring large sums – have the potential to influence market dynamics. Tracking their movements provides insights, although interpreting them is often challenging. Think of it this way: if a regular person buys or sells a few hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin , it has virtually no impact on the global market price. But when an entity moves $843 million worth of BTC , it catches everyone’s attention. Why? Because it represents a substantial shift in where a large chunk of the asset is being held. Potential reasons for such large transfers include: Moving funds from an exchange to cold storage for security. Preparing for a large Over-The-Counter (OTC) trade that doesn’t go through a public exchange order book. Internal transfers by an exchange or large institution. Consolidation of funds by a large holder. Preparing to sell a significant portion (though transfers *to* exchanges are often more indicative of this). Understanding the potential motivations behind these large Bitcoin movements is key to interpreting their significance, though without more information about the destination wallet, it remains speculative. Decoding the ‘Unknown Wallet’: What Could This Destination Imply? The destination being an ‘unknown new wallet’ is perhaps the most intriguing part of this 8,022 BTC transfer. Unlike a transfer to a known exchange wallet or a recognized institutional address, an ‘unknown new wallet’ doesn’t immediately reveal the recipient’s identity or intentions. Here are a few possibilities when funds move to an unknown new wallet: Cold Storage: One of the most common reasons for moving large amounts of crypto off an exchange like Coinbase is to place it into cold storage – wallets that are not connected to the internet. This is considered a highly secure way to hold large sums and is a standard practice for long-term holders and institutions. Over-The-Counter (OTC) Desk: Large trades often occur off public exchanges via OTC desks to avoid causing significant price volatility. A transfer to an unknown wallet could be the first step in an OTC transaction, where the buyer’s wallet receives the funds directly from the seller’s controlled address (which might have originated from Coinbase ). New Institutional Player: This could represent a large institution or fund making a significant initial purchase of Bitcoin and moving it to their own controlled wallet for secure custody. Consolidation/Restructuring: An existing large holder might be moving funds as part of a strategy to consolidate wallets, set up new security protocols, or prepare for other internal financial operations. Without further on-chain analysis or external information, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact reason. However, the move *from* Coinbase suggests the funds were previously held on the exchange, which is common for both retail and institutional users. Coinbase : A Hub for Major Bitcoin Transfers? Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally, particularly popular in the United States. As such, it frequently serves as an on-ramp and off-ramp for both individual and institutional investors. Seeing a large transfer originate from Coinbase is not inherently unusual. Large investors and institutions often use reputable exchanges like Coinbase to acquire their Bitcoin holdings. The subsequent transfer off the exchange is often a security measure (to cold storage) or a step towards a different type of transaction (like OTC). The significance here lies more in the *size* of the transfer ($843 million is substantial by any measure) and the *destination* being an unknown new wallet, which adds an element of mystery and fuels speculation about the identity and intentions of the crypto whale involved. What Could This Massive Bitcoin Move Mean for the Market? Interpreting the market impact of a single large transaction is tricky. While a transfer *to* an exchange wallet might sometimes signal an intent to sell, a transfer *from* an exchange to an unknown wallet is often viewed neutrally or even positively, as it could indicate accumulation for long-term holding or secure storage rather than immediate selling pressure. Here’s a balanced view of potential market implications: Reduced Immediate Selling Pressure: Moving BTC off an exchange typically reduces the amount available for immediate sale on the open market, which could be seen as a mildly bullish or neutral signal. Potential Institutional Activity: Given the size, this move could be related to institutional investment, which is generally viewed positively for the long-term health and adoption of Bitcoin . Increased Speculation: The mystery surrounding the ‘unknown wallet’ can lead to speculation within the crypto community, potentially causing short-term reactions based on rumors or theories. Business as Usual for Whales: It’s also possible this is simply a routine large-scale asset management maneuver by an existing crypto whale , with no immediate market-directional intent. Ultimately, while Whale Alert provides valuable transparency by highlighting these large movements, the true impact on the Bitcoin market will depend on subsequent actions taken by the owner of the unknown wallet. Summary: The $843 Million Question The transfer of 8,022 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown new wallet, valued at approximately $843 million, is a significant event in the world of cryptocurrency, duly reported by Whale Alert . While the sheer size of the transaction highlights the presence and activity of crypto whale s, the destination wallet’s anonymity leaves room for interpretation. This move could signal anything from enhanced security measures via cold storage to potential institutional involvement or preparation for an OTC trade. For now, it remains a mysterious transfer, reminding us of the large players operating behind the scenes in the dynamic Bitcoin market.

A hearing focused on the Crypto Market Structure Bill before the House Financial Services Committee became the stage for a heated exchange, bringing the topic of Trump Crypto activities squarely into the spotlight. Democratic lawmakers voiced significant concerns, suggesting potential conflicts of interest and corruption tied to former President Donald Trump’s increasing involvement with digital assets. This confrontation underscores the growing role of Political Influence Crypto plays in shaping policy debates. Why Are Democrats Concerned About Trump Crypto? During the crucial hearing discussing the future framework for US Crypto Regulation , several Democratic representatives turned their attention from the specifics of the Crypto Market Structure Bill to the actions of former President Trump. The core of their criticism centered on the perceived ethical implications of a potential presidential candidate actively engaging with and promoting cryptocurrency-related ventures. According to reports, including one from The Block, New York Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks was among the prominent voices raising these concerns. The argument posits that as someone who could potentially return to the highest office, Trump’s personal financial interests in cryptocurrency, whether through holdings, endorsements, or related businesses, could improperly influence policy decisions affecting the entire digital asset market. This raises questions about transparency and the potential for private gain to conflict with public duty, a common theme in discussions surrounding Political Influence Crypto . Specific points of contention often include: Personal Holdings: Allegations or evidence of significant personal investments in specific cryptocurrencies or crypto companies. Business Ventures: Activities like launching NFT collections or making public statements that could directly benefit his own or affiliated crypto projects. Policy Stance: Whether recent shifts in his public statements about crypto are influenced by personal financial stakes rather than a comprehensive view of market stability or consumer protection. These criticisms reflect a broader Democratic push for stricter ethics rules and greater scrutiny of how personal wealth and business ties intersect with political power, particularly in nascent and rapidly evolving sectors like cryptocurrency. How Did Republicans Defend Trump’s Crypto Stance? Unsurprisingly, Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee swiftly came to the defense of former President Trump. They characterized the Democrats’ criticisms not as legitimate concerns about conflicts of interest or corruption related to Trump Crypto , but rather as a politically motivated attack designed to undermine a potential political opponent. Republican lawmakers argued that the hearing, intended to focus on the technical and regulatory aspects of the Crypto Market Structure Bill and the future of US Crypto Regulation , was being used as a platform for partisan political theater. They contended that raising accusations of conflict of interest without concrete proof during a legislative hearing was inappropriate and distracted from the important work of crafting effective digital asset legislation. Their defense often highlighted: Lack of Evidence: Challenging Democrats to provide specific, actionable evidence of illegal or unethical behavior directly linking Trump’s crypto activities to corrupt political actions. Political Timing: Pointing out that these criticisms arise as Trump becomes more vocal and seemingly more favorable towards the crypto industry, potentially appealing to a growing segment of voters interested in digital assets. Support for Crypto: Framing Trump’s recent engagement with crypto not as a conflict, but as a positive sign that a major political figure is acknowledging and potentially supporting the industry, which they argue is beneficial for innovation and the economy. This Republican response underscores the deep partisan divide that characterizes much of the debate surrounding US Crypto Regulation and highlights how quickly discussions about digital assets can become entangled in broader political battles and accusations of Political Influence Crypto . Understanding Trump’s Past and Present Trump Crypto Activities To fully grasp the context of this political clash within the House Financial Services Committee , it’s helpful to look at the evolution of Donald Trump’s public stance and activities regarding cryptocurrency. His position has shifted considerably over time, contributing to the current debate over Trump Crypto and its potential influence. Historically, Trump expressed significant skepticism towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In 2019, he stated he was “not a fan” of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, citing their volatility and calling them “not money.” He even suggested they were based on “thin air” and could facilitate unlawful behavior. This early stance aligned more with traditional financial views that saw cryptocurrencies as threats to the dominance of the U.S. dollar. However, this view appears to have softened, particularly in recent years. Trump has launched several series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have generated significant revenue and kept him relevant in the digital asset space. More recently, he has made public comments that appear far more favorable to the industry. For example, he has suggested that he would not stand in the way of crypto adoption and has even commented positively on Bitcoin mining, suggesting it could be an important defense against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This pivot is significant. It moves him from an outwardly hostile position to one that seems to embrace certain aspects of the digital asset ecosystem. For Democrats, this shift, coupled with his business activities like NFTs, fuels concerns that his potential policies on US Crypto Regulation could be shaped by personal financial gain. For Republicans, it’s seen as a pragmatic evolution, recognizing the growing importance of crypto and potentially positioning him favorably with voters interested in financial innovation and less government intervention in this space. This dynamic illustrates the complex interplay of personal interests, political strategy, and Political Influence Crypto . What Does This Political Clash Mean for US Crypto Regulation? The heated exchange at the House Financial Services Committee hearing is more than just political bickering; it has tangible implications for the future of US Crypto Regulation . The partisan divide highlighted by the debate over Trump Crypto activities makes it more challenging to pass comprehensive legislation like the Crypto Market Structure Bill . Here’s how this political tension impacts regulation: Increased Partisanship: Any bill touching on crypto can easily become a political football, with lawmakers focusing on scoring points against the opposition rather than finding common ground on regulatory frameworks. Slower Progress: Consensus becomes harder to build. Bills may stall in committee or face significant opposition on the floor if they are perceived as benefiting one political side or being influenced by inappropriate Political Influence Crypto . Uncertainty for the Industry: The lack of clear, bipartisan consensus on how to regulate crypto creates uncertainty for businesses operating in the U.S. and potential investors. Focus Shifts: Debates can veer away from the core technical and economic issues of crypto regulation towards ethics, campaign finance, and personal conduct of politicians involved with crypto. While the Crypto Market Structure Bill aims to provide much-needed clarity, the political backdrop, amplified by controversies like the one surrounding Trump Crypto , adds layers of complexity that could delay or alter the final shape of US Crypto Regulation . The debate over Political Influence Crypto is now an undeniable factor in the legislative process. Challenges and Criticisms in the Political Crypto Debate The discussion at the hearing, and the broader debate around Trump Crypto , highlights several challenges inherent in regulating a novel technology like cryptocurrency, especially when intertwined with high-stakes politics: Defining Conflicts of Interest: In a new asset class, drawing clear lines between personal investment, business promotion, and political action can be difficult. What level of crypto engagement constitutes a conflict for a politician? Lack of Precedent: Regulatory bodies and lawmakers are still grappling with how existing laws apply to digital assets. Adding political ethics concerns further complicates this. Public Perception: Highly publicized political spats, regardless of their merit, can shape public perception of both crypto and the political figures involved. Accusations of corruption related to Political Influence Crypto can damage the reputation of the industry itself. Speed of Innovation vs. Pace of Legislation: The crypto market evolves rapidly, while the legislative process is slow. Political infighting further delays the ability of US Crypto Regulation to keep pace. Critics argue that focusing too heavily on individual politicians’ crypto holdings distracts from the need for robust, market-wide regulations that protect consumers and ensure financial stability, which is the stated goal of bills like the Crypto Market Structure Bill . However, proponents of scrutiny argue that understanding the role of Political Influence Crypto is essential to ensuring fair and unbiased regulation. Potential Outcomes and Actionable Insights What can we expect from this ongoing political friction surrounding Trump Crypto and US Crypto Regulation ? The path forward remains uncertain, but several potential outcomes are possible: Increased Scrutiny: We may see more calls for transparency regarding politicians’ crypto holdings and transactions. Delayed Legislation: Partisan battles could slow down the passage of key bills like the Crypto Market Structure Bill , leaving the industry in a state of regulatory limbo. Campaign Issue: Crypto’s role, and politicians’ stances and involvement with it (including Trump Crypto activities), could become a more prominent issue in future elections. Focus on Ethics Rules: There might be pushes for new ethics guidelines specifically addressing digital asset ownership and promotion by elected officials. For those involved in the crypto space, watching these political developments is crucial. Understanding the various viewpoints within the House Financial Services Committee and the broader political landscape provides insight into the potential direction of US Crypto Regulation . Engaging with policymakers and advocating for clear, effective regulation remains important, perhaps even more so when Political Influence Crypto is a point of contention. Ultimately, the debate over Trump Crypto highlights the growing maturity (or perhaps, growing pains) of the cryptocurrency industry as it becomes a significant factor in mainstream politics. How lawmakers navigate the intersection of personal finance, business interests, and public policy in the digital asset age will have lasting implications for the market’s future. In summary, the recent hearing on the Crypto Market Structure Bill before the House Financial Services Committee brought simmering tensions regarding Trump Crypto activities to the forefront. Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and corruption, while Republicans defended against what they termed baseless political attacks. This clash underscores the significant role Political Influence Crypto now plays in shaping the debate around US Crypto Regulation , creating both challenges and uncertainty for the industry’s future in the United States. The path to clear, bipartisan regulation remains steep, paved with political challenges and competing interests.

The Ethereum Foundation , a key entity supporting the Ethereum ecosystem, has taken a significant step towards ensuring its long-term sustainability by publishing a new treasury policy . This move signals a commitment to responsible financial stewardship and enhanced blockchain transparency for the community. What is the New Ethereum Foundation Treasury Policy? At its core, the new policy outlines clear guidelines for managing the foundation’s assets. The primary goals appear to be creating a robust financial buffer and setting limits on annual expenditures to ensure resources are available for future development and ecosystem support, regardless of market volatility. Key aspects of the announced policy include: Operating Expense Buffer: The policy targets maintaining a buffer sufficient to cover approximately 2.5 years of the foundation’s operating expenses. This substantial buffer provides a safety net, allowing the EF to continue its work supporting Ethereum development and research even during prolonged market downturns or unforeseen circumstances. Annual Spending Cap: A crucial element is the introduction of an annual spending cap. Initially, this cap is set at 15% of the total treasury assets. This measure prevents excessive spending in any single year, ensuring that the treasury is conserved over time. Planned Reduction of Spending Cap: Demonstrating a long-term vision, the policy includes a plan to gradually reduce the annual spending cap from 15% to 5% over the next five years. This phased reduction suggests a strategic shift towards even greater fiscal conservatism and asset preservation as the ecosystem matures. These measures collectively aim to create a predictable and sustainable financial framework for the foundation’s operations and initiatives. Why is a Robust Treasury Policy Crucial for Ethereum Finance? Understanding the significance of this policy requires looking at the unique nature of funding in the crypto space and the role of entities like the Ethereum Foundation . Unlike traditional companies with revenue streams or venture-funded startups, the EF primarily relies on its existing treasury, which often consists significantly of Ether (ETH) and other crypto assets. The value of these assets can fluctuate dramatically with market cycles. A well-defined treasury policy offers several critical benefits: Stability: A large operating buffer provides stability, ensuring that essential functions like core protocol research, developer tooling, and ecosystem grants can continue uninterrupted, even during bear markets when asset values might be low. Predictability: Capping annual spending introduces predictability in how resources are utilized, allowing for better long-term planning and allocation of funds to strategic priorities. Trust and Confidence: Clear financial policies and reporting enhance trust within the community and among stakeholders. It shows responsible management of the funds intended to support the public good of the Ethereum network. Resilience: The policy builds resilience against market volatility, reducing the risk that the foundation would need to drastically cut back operations or sell assets at unfavorable times. By implementing these measures, the Ethereum Foundation strengthens its position as a reliable steward of resources dedicated to the network’s advancement. How Does This Policy Enhance Crypto Governance and Transparency? Beyond just financial management, the new policy has significant implications for crypto governance and the broader goal of blockchain transparency . A key detail mentioned in the announcement, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X, is the commitment to regular financial reporting. The finance team will provide quarterly and annual financial reports to the Foundation’s Board and management. While the extent to which these reports will be made public is not explicitly detailed in the initial snippet, the act of formalizing internal reporting is a step towards greater accountability. Historically, the EF has published annual reports detailing its activities and finances, and this new policy likely formalizes the internal processes that underpin those public reports. Enhanced transparency in how a major non-profit organization supporting a decentralized network manages its funds is vital for several reasons: Accountability: It holds the foundation accountable to the community it serves and the principles of decentralized governance. Informed Community: Provides the community with insights into the financial health and priorities of the foundation, allowing for more informed discussions about ecosystem development and funding needs. Setting a Standard: As a prominent entity in the space, the EF’s commitment to clear financial policies and reporting can set a positive example for other organizations and DAOs within the crypto ecosystem. This focus on structured reporting aligns with the broader ethos of openness often associated with blockchain technology. Understanding the Numbers: Buffer and Spending Caps Let’s break down the numbers mentioned in the policy: Operating Expense Buffer: 2.5 Years This means the EF aims to hold enough liquid assets (or assets easily convertible to cover expenses) to fund its operations for two and a half years without needing to generate new income or rely heavily on asset appreciation. This is a significant buffer, especially compared to many traditional non-profits or even corporations, and reflects the volatile nature of the crypto market where funding sources can be unpredictable. Annual Spending Cap: 15% (Reducing to 5%) The 15% cap on total treasury assets is a strong control measure. If the EF had a treasury worth $1 billion, the maximum they could spend in a year would be $150 million. This prevents rapid depletion of funds. The plan to reduce this to 5% over five years is even more conservative. In the same $1 billion example, the annual spending would eventually be capped at $50 million. This long-term reduction indicates a strategic shift towards ensuring the treasury can sustain the foundation’s activities for many years, potentially decades, into the future. These specific targets demonstrate a calculated approach to managing Ethereum finance , balancing the need to fund current initiatives with the imperative to preserve capital for the long haul. What are the Potential Challenges or Considerations? While the policy is largely seen as a positive step, implementing and adhering to such strict guidelines can present challenges: Balancing Conservation and Innovation: A very low spending cap, especially the future 5% target, might make it challenging to fund large, ambitious, or unexpected projects that could significantly benefit the ecosystem but require substantial upfront investment. The EF will need to carefully prioritize spending within these limits. Market Volatility Impact: While the buffer helps, the spending cap is based on a percentage of the treasury’s value, which is tied to volatile crypto assets. In a prolonged bear market, the absolute dollar amount available for spending (15% or 5% of a smaller number) could shrink significantly, potentially impacting the scale of funded activities. Defining ‘Operating Expenses’: The policy hinges on the definition of ‘operating expenses’. Clarity is needed on what falls under this umbrella versus strategic investments, grants, or ecosystem support, and how these are budgeted within the cap. Navigating these challenges will require careful planning and potentially flexible interpretation within the policy’s framework, always keeping the long-term health of the Ethereum network in mind. Actionable Insights for the Community What does this new policy mean for developers, users, and stakeholders in the Ethereum ecosystem? Increased Confidence: The policy should instill greater confidence in the financial stability and longevity of the foundation supporting core Ethereum development. Look for Future Reports: Keep an eye out for future annual reports from the Ethereum Foundation. These reports are likely to provide more detailed insights into how the treasury is being managed according to this new policy, offering concrete examples of spending and asset allocation. Engage with Governance Discussions: While the EF is not a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the typical sense, its actions influence the ecosystem. Understanding its financial health and policies is crucial for participating in broader discussions about ecosystem funding, priorities, and crypto governance . This policy is not just an internal accounting matter; it’s a public statement about the foundation’s commitment to responsible growth and resilience for the benefit of the entire network. A Step Towards Sustainable Growth The Ethereum Foundation’s new treasury policy marks a significant step towards ensuring the long-term financial health and stability of a crucial entity in the Ethereum ecosystem. By targeting a substantial operating buffer and implementing strict annual spending caps that will become even more conservative over time, the foundation is prioritizing resilience against market fluctuations and sustainable growth. Coupled with a commitment to regular financial reporting, this policy enhances blockchain transparency and strengthens trust within the community. While challenges in balancing conservation with the need for innovation will remain, this structured approach to Ethereum finance provides a solid framework for navigating the future. It underscores the maturing nature of the ecosystem and the importance of prudent financial management for supporting a global, decentralized network.

The IPO values Circle at around $6.8 billion and nearly $8 billion on a fully diluted basis when options and other securities are included. Shares are set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL from Thursday, marking a moment of reckoning for the crypto industry. Its underwriters are JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. The IPO was so heavily oversubscribed. More than 25 times as many shares were ordered as available, according to people familiar with the matter. This suggests increasing confidence in the stablecoin world sector as it progresses towards regulatory clarity in the United States. Of particular note, ARK Invest (under the guidance of Cathie Wood) has indicated that it would buy up to $150 million in Circle shares. A second large backer, BlackRock, is expected to buy about 10 percent of the IPO shares. BlackRock also oversees Circle’s $53.3 billion Reserve Fund, which underpins over 90% of USDC’s reserves. Circle expands USDC’s market reach Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) is now the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, behind Tether (USDT). According to the company’s website data , about $61 billion was in circulation as of May 29. This is roughly equivalent to 29% of the entire stablecoin market, according to CoinMarketCap. Stablecoins are digital currencies typically pegged to the value of the dollar. They are used to make payments, remittances, trade, or aDeFi (alternative decentralized finance) services. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are volatile, stablecoins are designed to provide stability in price — a challenge easy to understand why those stablecoins are so popular. USDC circulation had in the past deteriorated during the crypto winter but picked up again in 2024 as markets and investor sentiment stabilized. Circle’s financial health has since improved. In 2024, Circle generated $1.68 billion in revenue and $156 million in net income, according to the filings for the IPO. Many of those dollars were income from U.S. Treasuries, which back USDC. However, high distribution costs — which included big payments to strategic partner Coinbase — dinged overall profit. Nonetheless, the IPO is a milestone that has put Circle in the crypto space and made it a significant player in global financial infrastructure . Lawmakers push to regulate stablecoins The timing of Circle’s stock market debut couldn’t be more opportune. In the U.S., lawmakers are mulling legislation to create a stablecoins regulation system. The GENIUS Act would codify reserve requirements, auditing, and transparency best practices — effectively legitimizing stablecoin issuers such as Circle. Making matters right, President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration is on the rebound. Trump has signaled his interest in digital assets, pledging to scrub rules that are stalling growth and innovation. At the same time, the largest American banks and other financial companies are all reportedly considering issuing stablecoins. In a sign of big banks’ increased focus on cryptocurrency, a clutch of large American banks and financial institutions is said to be in discussions to launch a stablecoin of their own, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday — a development that could add a note of legitimization while also upping the ante for rivals. But Circle is out of the gate. Its close relationship with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and its early cooperation with regulation orders have made it a potential model for stablecoins regulation. The successful IPO delivers a message to regulators, investors, and the larger financial world: stablecoins are not simply crypto experiments but are increasingly central to modern finance.

Ethereum remains a pillar of the crypto investment world, fueling DeFi, NFTs, and smart contract ecosystems. As bullish sentiment grows, attention is also shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency that’s generating serious buzz during its presale. If ETH does hit $10K, analysts suggest MUTM could surge past the $5 mark, making it a candidate for the next big crypto story of the year. For those scanning the market for the best crypto coin to buy, this pairing of legacy dominance and emerging potential is impossible to ignore. Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $10,000 Milestone Amid Bullish Momentum The current price of Ethereum (ETH) is about $2,493.15, down by 1.13% from where it was yesterday. Nevertheless, ETH has retained its status over $2,400, indicating continuity. It is expected by analysts that Ethereum will increase by around 4x to $10,000 in value by the end of year 2025. The strong view stems from Ethereum’s major contribution to decentralized finance (DeFi), more companies learning about blockchain technology and the switch to Ethereum 2.0 for enhancing scalability and lowering transaction fees. Because of its reliable fundamentals and possible future growth, Ethereum is a good crypto choice for investors. At the same time, alternative cryptos like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are being noticed and could bring big returns for investors. Phase 4 Sells Out — MUTM’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale, following a sell-out of Phase 4. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their estimated listing price of $0.06, which is a potential 100% gain for early investors upon the token’s launch. With over $9.9 million raised and a growing community of 11,600+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key pillars of the ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of Mutuum Finance. If Ethereum (ETH) reaches $10,000 by 2025, the ripple effect across the DeFi sector could be massive, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands to benefit in a big way. With real utility, audited smart contracts, and a growing base of 11,600+ investors fueling a $9.9 million presale, MUTM is gaining serious momentum. Currently priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 and set to launch at $0.06, projections suggest it could soar to $5 if the bull market intensifies. As ETH drives the next wave of DeFi adoption, MUTM may emerge as one of the highest ROI altcoins of the cycle.

If so, you’ll want to pay attention to recent developments from the heart of U.S. financial power. The U.S. Treasury digital assets discussion is heating up, signaling a significant focus on this evolving sector at the highest levels. What Happened at the FSOC Meeting on Digital Assets? Recently, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) convened for a meeting hosted by none other than U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. This wasn’t just any routine meeting; a key item on the agenda was the in-depth discussion surrounding digital assets. According to reports, the FSOC received a crucial briefing on the ongoing work of a dedicated working group focused specifically on digital asset-related matters. The FSOC, established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, is tasked with identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States. Its involvement underscores the growing recognition that digital assets, while offering potential innovation, also present complex challenges and risks that require careful consideration and oversight. Key points discussed during the FSOC meeting crypto briefing included: An overview of current digital asset market trends and developments. Potential risks digital assets could pose to financial stability. Progress made by the interagency working group on digital assets. Strategies for addressing identified risks while fostering responsible innovation. This meeting highlights the collaborative effort across various U.S. regulatory bodies, coordinated under the Treasury’s leadership, to get a handle on the digital asset space. Why is Crypto Regulation U.S. a Top Priority? The United States has long been a global leader in financial markets and technological innovation. As digital assets gain traction, policymakers are grappling with how to integrate them into the existing financial framework without stifling innovation or compromising stability and consumer protection. This makes crypto regulation U.S. a critical and complex undertaking. The discussions at the Treasury-hosted FSOC meeting revolved around dual objectives: Strengthening U.S. Leadership: Ensuring the U.S. remains at the forefront of digital asset innovation and technology. This involves creating an environment where businesses can build and grow, attracting talent and investment. Providing Regulatory Clarity: Establishing clear rules of the road for the digital asset industry. Uncertainty can hinder growth and expose investors and consumers to unnecessary risks. Achieving these goals requires a delicate balance. Overly burdensome regulations could push innovation overseas, while insufficient oversight could lead to systemic risks or harm to market participants. What Does Janet Yellen’s Focus on Crypto Mean? Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen crypto commentary and her active role in convening these discussions signal the administration’s serious and sustained attention on the digital asset sector. As the head of the Treasury and chair of the FSOC, Secretary Yellen is at the nexus of U.S. financial policy and stability efforts. Her emphasis on this topic suggests: Digital assets are no longer a niche topic but a mainstream financial consideration. The administration is actively seeking to understand the complexities and potential impacts of this technology. There is a concerted effort to develop a coordinated regulatory approach across different agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve, etc.). Secretary Yellen has previously spoken about the need for careful regulation to address risks like illicit finance, financial stability, and consumer protection, while acknowledging the potential benefits of the underlying technology. Seeking Digital Asset Regulatory Clarity: The Path Forward One of the most frequently cited needs from the cryptocurrency industry is digital asset regulatory clarity . Businesses, developers, and investors are often uncertain about how existing laws apply to digital assets or what new rules might be implemented. This uncertainty can create hurdles for innovation and adoption. The discussion at the FSOC meeting specifically highlighted the importance of providing this clarity. What does that entail? Aspect of Clarity Why it’s Needed Asset Classification Is a digital asset a security, commodity, or something else? Different classifications trigger different regulatory frameworks. Jurisdiction Which regulator (e.g., SEC, CFTC, state regulators) has authority over different types of digital asset activities? Consumer Protection Clear rules are needed regarding disclosures, fraud prevention, and handling customer funds. Market Integrity Rules to prevent market manipulation, insider trading, and other illicit activities are crucial for trust. The ongoing work of the digital asset-related working group, briefed to the FSOC, is likely focused on developing recommendations and coordinating efforts to provide this much-needed clarity. This could involve new guidance, updated regulations, or even legislative proposals. Strengthening U.S. Leadership in the Digital Asset Sector The goal of strengthening U.S. leadership in the digital asset sector isn’t just about regulation; it’s also about fostering an environment where innovation can thrive responsibly. This involves: Investing in research and development. Attracting and retaining talent. Ensuring access to capital for promising projects. Creating a predictable legal and regulatory environment that encourages legitimate businesses. Policymakers recognize that digital assets and the underlying blockchain technology have the potential to reshape various industries beyond finance. By taking a proactive approach, the U.S. aims to capitalize on these opportunities while managing the associated risks. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Crypto? The U.S. Treasury and FSOC discussions are a clear signal that the federal government is committed to developing a comprehensive approach to digital assets. While the path to full regulatory clarity may be long and complex, these high-level meetings indicate progress is being made behind the scenes. For the crypto industry and investors, this means continued attention on policy developments is essential. Clarity, when it arrives, is generally viewed as a positive step for the long-term maturation and stability of the market, potentially paving the way for greater institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance. The dialogue among regulators, while sometimes perceived with apprehension by the crypto community, is a necessary step in integrating this new technology into the global financial system in a safe and responsible manner. The focus on both leadership and clarity suggests a desire to harness the potential while mitigating the pitfalls. Conclusion The recent meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, hosted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, underscores the significant and ongoing attention being paid to digital assets at the highest levels of the U.S. government. Discussions centered on the work of a dedicated digital asset working group, with a clear focus on strengthening U.S. leadership in the sector and providing much-needed regulatory clarity. This proactive engagement from the U.S. Treasury digital assets front is a crucial step towards establishing a stable and predictable environment for the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in the United States.

But neither may offer the unique entry window currently open with Web3 ai. TRUMP Coin’s momentum hinges on volatile political cycles and meme coin sentiment. Solana, backed by a $1 billion institutional filing, is riding a wave of high-cap confidence. Web3 ai, however, delivers something different, an actual product ecosystem powered by AI, not just speculation. With $WAI still priced at just $0.000402 and a 1,747% upside locked in, investors aren’t just chasing hype, they’re buying into infrastructure. Among the noise, Web3 ai offers clarity, real utility, and unmatched upside. Analysts Predict $TRUMP Coin Could Reach $100 by End of 2025 The $TRUMP coin, launched in January 2025, has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts from CoinDCX suggest that, driven by increased adoption and favorable regulatory developments, the coin’s price could surpass the $100 mark by the end of 2025. Currently trading around $11, $TRUMP has experienced substantial volatility, including a notable crash that saw its value drop by nearly 80% from its peak. Despite this, the coin maintains a market capitalization exceeding $2.2 billion, positioning it among the top meme coins. The coin’s performance is closely tied to political developments, particularly the policies of the Trump administration, which has shown a pro-crypto stance. However, the speculative nature of meme coins and their susceptibility to market sentiment necessitate caution. Investors considering $TRUMP should be aware of its inherent risks and the factors influencing its price movements. Solana’s $275 Target: Why Analysts Are Bullish on SOL’s Future Solana (SOL) is drawing significant attention from investors, with Standard Chartered forecasting its price to reach $275 by the end of 2025 and potentially $500 by 2029. This optimistic outlook is bolstered by institutional interest, notably SOL Strategies Inc.’s filing of a $1 billion shelf prospectus aimed at expanding its Solana holdings. The firm has already acquired over 420,000 SOL tokens, valued at approximately $100 million, indicating strong confidence in Solana’s long-term prospects. Despite recent price fluctuations, analysts suggest that if SOL can reclaim the $167 support level, it may set the stage for a rally towards the $172–$182 range. For investors seeking exposure to a blockchain platform with growing institutional backing and ambitious price targets, Solana presents a noteworthy opportunity. 1,747% Upside? Why Web3 ai’s $0.000402 Token Is the Cheapest It Will Ever Be Web3 ai is becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales this June, and the reason is simple: math. The $WAI token is currently in Stage 7 of its presale, priced at just $0.000402. The confirmed listing price? $0.005242. That’s a 1,747% built-in upside for anyone buying before launch. This isn’t a vague projection, it’s baked into the tokenomics. What’s driving the FOMO? Timing. Once the presale ends, Web3 ai’s full suite of AI-powered tools, ranging from auto-trading assistants to risk analyzers, will go live. Every action in the ecosystem will require $WAI. That means real demand from real users. Over $7 million has already been raised, and the price continues to rise with each new stage. This is not a hype-driven meme coin. It’s a tech-driven ecosystem designed for utility, built by people who understand crypto traders’ needs. The tools are coming. The demand is coming. And the price is still under half a cent, for now. When the listing hits and the platform activates, those buying today could be looking at one of 2025’s smartest early entries. Time is running out. Why Web3 ai May Be the Only Crypto in This Trio Built for Real-World Utility and 100x Growth Whale investor behavior may drive short-term hype, and coin analysis continues to fuel retail curiosity, but traders seeking smarter positioning are shifting to Web3 ai. The platform doesn’t depend on politics like TRUMP or institutional filings like Solana, it offers tools that solve real market problems. With AI utilities going live post-listing and over $7 million raised in presale, $WAI’s foundation is already set. TRUMP Coin may hit $100 and Solana may climb to $275, but Web3 ai’s token, still under half a cent, could be the one that 100x’s. In a market full of speculation, Web3 ai is delivering signal over noise.

The simple yet infuriating mobile game captured the world’s attention before disappearing almost as quickly as it arrived. Now, it’s poised for a dramatic return, not just on your phone screen, but within the revolutionary world of Web3. This isn’t just a nostalgic re-release; the iconic game is making an exciting leap into Flappy Bird Web3 , aiming to blend its classic appeal with the innovative potential of decentralized technology. According to a report by Decrypt, the entity behind this ambitious project, the Flappy Bird Foundation, has announced its plans to integrate the beloved (and sometimes hated) game into the Web3 ecosystem. Their stated goal is to combine the familiar, engaging elements of traditional gaming with the unique advantages offered by Web3, particularly focusing on IP licensing and on-chain asset management. This move signals a growing trend of established brands exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology. What Does Flappy Bird Web3 Mean for Gamers? For many, the concept of Web3 gaming is still relatively new or associated primarily with ‘play-to-earn’ models. While earning potential can be a part of it, Web3 integration often goes deeper, offering players true ownership of in-game assets, transparent economies, and a stronger voice in the game’s development or ecosystem. For Flappy Bird, which was known for its simple mechanics and high difficulty, bringing it into Web3 could unlock several new dimensions: Digital Ownership: Imagine owning unique skins, pipes, or even characters as NFTs. These aren’t just cosmetic items tied to a single account; they are verifiable assets on the blockchain that players can truly own, trade, or potentially use across different platforms if compatibility is built. Community & Governance: Web3 projects often empower their communities. While details are sparse for Flappy Bird Web3, this could potentially involve community input on future updates, features, or even the direction of the ‘Flappy Bird Foundation’. Interoperability (Potential): The concept of bringing Flappy Bird assets ‘on-chain’ via an IP protocol suggests a future where these digital items might interact with other Web3 platforms or games, although this is highly speculative at this stage. New Monetization Models: Beyond traditional ads or in-app purchases, Web3 allows for royalties on secondary sales of NFTs, token-based economies, and other innovative ways for both developers and players to benefit. This transition isn’t just about adding a crypto layer; it’s about reimagining the relationship between the game, its intellectual property, and its player base within a decentralized framework. The idea of leveraging IP licensing within Web3 suggests that the foundation might be looking to allow others to build upon the Flappy Bird universe using the on-chain assets, creating a broader ecosystem. Exploring the Core of Blockchain Gaming At its heart, blockchain gaming utilizes distributed ledger technology to bring transparency, security, and ownership to the gaming experience. Unlike traditional games where your purchased items exist only within the game’s central server and can be revoked or lost if the game shuts down, blockchain allows these items to be recorded on an immutable ledger. This gives players verifiable proof of ownership. Key elements of blockchain gaming include: Feature Traditional Gaming Blockchain Gaming Asset Ownership Centralized (Owned by company) Decentralized (Owned by player via blockchain) Economy Closed, controlled by developer Often Open, player-driven markets possible Transparency Limited High (Transactions on public ledger) Interoperability Rare Potential (Assets usable across games/platforms) The Flappy Bird Foundation’s plan to launch an ‘IP protocol’ to bring assets on-chain is a critical piece of this puzzle. This protocol would likely define how Flappy Bird’s distinct elements (characters, obstacles, environments, etc.) are tokenized and managed on a blockchain, potentially setting standards for how third parties could license and use these assets in other Web3 projects, all while maintaining the integrity of the core IP. Why Crypto Games Are Attracting Big Names The move by Flappy Bird isn’t happening in a vacuum. The broader landscape of crypto games has seen significant investment and interest over the past few years. While some early iterations faced criticism for being overly focused on earning rather than gameplay, the technology and design principles are evolving rapidly. Established gaming giants and independent studios alike are exploring NFTs, tokens, and decentralized structures. The appeal lies in: New Revenue Streams: Beyond initial sales and in-game purchases, developers can earn royalties on secondary market transactions of NFTs. Increased Player Engagement: Ownership and potential earning opportunities can create highly engaged and loyal player bases. Community Building: Web3 tools facilitate strong community governance and participation. Innovation: The technology allows for entirely new gameplay mechanics and economic models not possible in traditional gaming. For Flappy Bird, a game that thrived purely on its simple, addictive mechanic and viral spread, adding a Web3 layer could reignite interest and create a sustainable ecosystem around its powerful brand recognition. It moves from being a transient mobile app to potentially a persistent digital universe where its elements have tangible value and utility. Is NFT Gaming the Right Fit for Flappy Bird? A key component of bringing assets on-chain often involves Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). In the context of NFT gaming , these unique digital tokens represent specific in-game items, collectibles, or characters. For Flappy Bird, this could translate into: Collectible Bird Skins: Limited edition or rare visual variations for the bird. Unique Pipes: Pipes with distinct designs or perhaps even subtle in-game effects (though gameplay balance would be crucial). High Score Trophies: NFTs awarded for achieving certain milestones or high scores. Environmental Assets: Tokenized backgrounds or themes. The success of NFT integration will depend heavily on how it’s implemented. Simply slapping NFTs onto existing mechanics without adding real value or utility to the player experience often falls flat. The Flappy Bird Foundation’s focus on an ‘IP protocol’ suggests a more structured approach, potentially ensuring that these assets are not just collectibles but functional elements within a future ecosystem built around the Flappy Bird IP. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Flappy Bird Web3 While the prospect of Flappy Bird in Web3 is exciting, it’s not without its hurdles. The Web3 gaming space is still maturing and faces challenges: User Experience: Integrating blockchain wallets and understanding concepts like gas fees can be complex for mainstream gamers. Market Volatility: The value of in-game assets (NFTs, tokens) can be highly volatile, impacting the game’s economy and player sentiment. Public Perception: Some traditional gamers are skeptical or outright hostile towards NFTs and blockchain in games, often citing concerns about speculation, environmental impact, and perceived ‘cash grabs’. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto and NFTs is still evolving globally. Balancing Economics and Fun: Designing a game that is both enjoyable to play and features a sustainable Web3 economy is difficult. The game must be fun first, with Web3 elements enhancing, not replacing, the core gameplay loop. The Flappy Bird Foundation will need to navigate these challenges carefully. Their approach of combining traditional gaming strengths with Web3 benefits, and focusing on an IP protocol, suggests an attempt to build a sustainable model. The success will likely depend on creating a seamless user experience, designing valuable and desirable on-chain assets, and effectively communicating the benefits to a potentially skeptical audience. Actionable Insights for Fans and Investors For those interested in this development, here are some things to consider: Follow Official Announcements: Keep an eye on the Flappy Bird Foundation’s official channels for details on the IP protocol launch and future plans. Understand the Technology: If you’re new to Web3, take time to learn about blockchain, NFTs, and how digital wallets work. Assess the Value Proposition: When assets or tokens are released, evaluate their utility within the game’s ecosystem and the broader IP protocol, not just speculative potential. Be Mindful of Risks: The Web3 space is speculative. Only invest what you can afford to lose, whether in tokens or NFTs associated with the project. Focus on the Game: Ultimately, the long-term success will hinge on whether the core Flappy Bird experience remains engaging and whether the Web3 elements genuinely enhance it. This venture represents a fascinating case study: a globally recognized, albeit simple, IP entering a complex and rapidly evolving technological space. The ‘IP protocol’ concept is particularly intriguing, potentially setting a precedent for how other classic IPs could be brought into decentralized ecosystems. Conclusion: A New Flight Path for Flappy Bird The announcement that Flappy Bird is entering the Web3 space marks a significant moment, bridging a beloved piece of mobile gaming history with the future of digital ownership and decentralized ecosystems. By planning an IP protocol to bring its iconic assets on-chain, the Flappy Bird Foundation is aiming to create a new paradigm for the game, one where players might have tangible ownership and the IP can potentially flourish in new, community-driven ways. While the journey into blockchain gaming presents challenges, the potential for innovation, renewed engagement, and creating a lasting digital legacy for Flappy Bird within the Web3 universe is undeniable. It’s a bold flight into uncharted territory, and the world will be watching to see if this pixelated bird can successfully navigate the pipes of the decentralized web.

The committee oversees commodities and futures regulation and will hold a hearing to evaluate Quintenz’s nomination as chair of the powerful financial regulatory agency. Quintenz is a former CFTC commissioner, having served on the committee from 2017 to 2021. His nomination comes during a period of great change for the commission. Two commissioners, Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero, resigned their positions in late May. That has left the five-member panel with only two confirmed commissioners as of June 1. Rostin Behnam, the previous chairman, left in February. The CFTC is overseen by acting Chairwoman Caroline Pham and Commissioner Kristin Johnson. But both have publicly declared their plans to depart, Pham for a private-sector position and Johnson to step down later this year. That’s because Quintenz’s confirmation could lead to a wholesale change in leadership at the CFTC. Crypto ally moves to lead CFTC Quintenz is a known proponent of cryptocurrencies. In 2021, he joined Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto-focussed venture arm, a16z Crypto , as head of policy. In that role, he advocated for lighter regulation of the digital asset industry and regularly took the position that it was the CFTC’s job, not the SEC’s, to take the lead on regulating cryptocurrencies. He is one of the types in the crypto world who think our current regime, especially from the SEC, is too harsh. The industry is receptive to a Quintenz-led CFTC, seeing him as someone who gets both innovation and markets. If he is confirmed, Quintenz will probably weigh in on issues such as decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto derivatives, prediction markets, and clearing systems involving blockchains, all of the topics the CFTC is currently evaluating. His stewardship could influence how US policy evolves in response to the rapidly changing world of digital finance, such as potential legislation around stablecoins and digital commodities. While he has the backing of the crypto world, Quintenz’s nomination isn’t without controversy. He filed financial disclosures before the hearing reflecting holdings valued at about $3.4 million in crypto and industry-related companies. Ethics watchdogs have sounded the alarm about how this stake could influence his neutrality if he were to be confirmed. There’s a particular concern about his board seat with Kalshi, a prediction market platform that recently tussled with the CFTC over its pursuit to offer contracts linked to US elections. Quintenz has recused himself from some CFTC cases related to Kalshi but has not agreed to take himself out of Kalshi cases in the future. Critics say this could undermine trust in the commission’s independence and objectivity. Trump seeks to reshape CFTC leadership If confirmed by the Senate, Quintenz would be the only sitting commissioner named by Trump. However, with Pham and Johnson due to step down, the president was given the opening to nominate as many as four new commissioners. That would empower the president to have broad control over the CFTC’s leadership for the first time in his current tenure. No more than three commissioners can be members of the same political party under CFTC rules. Because Quintenz is a Republican, Trump would have been allowed to nominate two more Republicans and two Democrats to complete the panel. Each nominee would still need to be confirmed by the Senate. This remolding of the CFTC could dramatically change the regulatory philosophy of the agency. The commission has long been seen as more tech and innovation-friendly than the SEC and could lean even further in that direction under Trump’s picks. This shift could affect not just the crypto markets but also futures, options, and swaps — pillars of the United States’ financial infrastructure.

Smart Money Loads Up On Calls",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-130000-in-september-smart-money-loads-up/,"Singapore-based trading desk QCP Capital says the options market is sending an unmistakable signal: large players are quietly positioning for a break to $130,000 by the end of Q3, even as spot Bitcoin languishes near $105,000. $130,000 Bitcoin Bets Heating Up In a note to clients on Wednesday, the firm highlighted “a surprise uptick in job openings” that lifted risk appetite across equities, nudging the S&P 500 toward the psychologically charged 6,000 mark. “A steady NFP would cement the Fed’s narrative of a resilient labour market, reinforcing expectations that rates will remain on hold,” QCP wrote, adding that front-end Bitcoin volatility has already “slipped below 40 vol” as traders park on the sidelines before Friday’s payroll print. Despite the calm surface, options flows tell a livelier story. “September $130K calls were lifted at 47 vol,” QCP observed, pointing to “pockets of topside interest heading into Q3.” With the one-month volatility term structure now flatter than at any point since May, opportunistic funds have found it inexpensive to buy long-dated vega while selling short-dated gamma. The dynamic mirrors a broader decline in equity volatility—VIX is plumbing its own three-month lows—and has left Bitcoin’s implied curve looking “wholly normalised,” QCP noted, with skew suggesting “little directional conviction” in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch That benign backdrop may not last. The desk warned that tariff frictions and Washington’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” could roil macro data just as the US debt-ceiling saga re-enters the headlines. “In the absence of a clear catalyst, BTC is unlikely to break materially out of its current range,” the note said, but Q3 “could prove more challenging” as fiscal risks and trade tensions “introduce potential headline volatility.” China has already flashed early signs of stress: futures volumes in 10- and 30-year Chinese government bonds have fallen to their lowest levels since February, a fact QCP attributes to “broader risk aversion and sidelined positioning.” Meanwhile, markets await any progress on an anticipated Xi-Trump dialogue—an event that could shift sentiment on tariffs. For now, however, Bitcoin remains pinned. Spot has hugged the $105,000 handle for five straight sessions, open interest is light, and realized volatility has compressed into a mid-teens annualized band—conditions that historically precede a sharp expansion. Whether that expansion resolves higher or lower hinges on the very catalysts traders are bracing for: payrolls data, central-bank rhetoric, and the tariff announcements that dominated headlines earlier in the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3–5 Year Holders Slow Selloff—Waiting for Higher Prices? Yet the willingness of sophisticated desks to pay up for September upside is hard to ignore. A cluster of large prints in the $130,000 strike, executed at implied vols roughly seven points above the prevailing curve, suggests at least some investors expect Bitcoin to test new highs before month-end September. QCP stops short of endorsing the trade outright but underscores the asymmetry: “With vols crushed and skew flat, the cost of owning topside gamma has rarely looked this attractive,” the firm writes. That calculus—cheap optionality against a potentially volatile macro backdrop—explains the growing divergence between spot lethargy and options optimism. If the payroll report arrives soft, the Fed pivot narrative could re-ignite; if tariff negotiations sour, Bitcoin’s digital-gold appeal may resurface. Either path feeds volatility, and volatility is precisely what long-vega buyers are banking on. At press time, BTC traded at $104,648.

For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Macro Events and Vitalik's Bold Plan to 10x Ethereum Layer 1 Could Propel ETH Past $3000: OKX's Lennix Lai ETH traders are eying $2600 as Asia begins its business day, but OKX's Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai sees an easy path for the token to hit $3000 if Vitalik Buterin can get rid of Ethereum's reliance on Layer-2s. Layer 1 refers to the main blockchain infrastructure, such as Ethereum itself, while Layer 2 solutions are secondary systems built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and speed up transactions. ""Vitalik’s pivot to scale Ethereum Layer 1 by 10x will be a game-changer, shifting focus away from heavy reliance on Layer 2 solutions like sharding,"" Lai said in a note to CoinDesk, referring to recent comments Buterin made at ETHGlobal Prauge . ""On our platform, ETH perpetual futures made up 44.2% of trading volume over the past 7 days, showing us that sophisticated investors are closely tracking this evolution,"" he continued. Lai points to this week's key macro events, like the ECB's rate decision and U.S. jobs data, as factors that could significantly impact risk-on appetite, potentially pushing ETH past $3,000 short-term, though Ethereum’s long-term success hinges on Vitalik's ambitious roadmap. Elsewhere, CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model bot highlights Ethereum's resilience above critical support at $2,600, driven by institutional inflows nearing $1.2 billion and significant whale buying, positioning ETH for a possible altcoin rally. Hashed CEO Simon Kim Says Korea Election Boosts Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI Simon Kim, the CEO of Korea's largest crypto fund Hashed, believes crypto has become a critical force in South Korean politics, and it's going to be business as usual for the industry under the country's new left-leaning President Lee Jae-myung. ""Officially, crypto is more popular than the stock market in Korea,"" Kim said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. He pointed to data showing 16.29 million daily active crypto traders compared to 14.24 million active equity traders , noting that political parties now see supporting crypto as essential to winning elections. South Korea’s crypto policies also continue to be closely tied to U.S. regulatory developments, according to Kim. ""All the Korean politicians are following the U.S.,"" he explained, noting how American institutions and regulators are guiding global standards. Kim added that Korea’s previously set crypto capital gains tax policy, scheduled to begin in early 2027 , remains unchanged. Kim expects Lee's administration to develop stablecoin policy, as they currently account for about one-tenth of Korea’s crypto trading volume. Issuing a stablecoin in Korea might be complicated because the Korean won is a tightly controlled onshore currency with strict capital restrictions, making it challenging to integrate into borderless crypto markets. Kim said that in his conversations with some policymakers, they say there is ""no kind of benefit to adopting stablecoin won in the Korean market,"" given its advanced payments ecosystem. But stablecoins are here to stay, as Kim says they already account for one-tenth of trading volume in the country, and there's a growing recognition that they need to be safely integrated into the economy, where they can be taxed. ""Stablecoins are not just a payment network,"" he said. ""It's building a unique digital platform enabling smart contracts and making an autonomous economy."" Beyond crypto, Kim expects Lee’s administration to pursue substantial investment in artificial intelligence. Yet Kim expressed skepticism about plans to create a sovereign generalized AI platform comparable to U.S. giants like OpenAI. Instead, he argued Korea’s strength is in ""physical AI"", building specialized solutions tailored to sectors where Korea excels, including semiconductors, electronics, and advanced manufacturing. “I believe the new administration has some sense that we have unfair advantages in the physical AI ecosystem. That's the point I'm very excited about,” he said. News Roundup Circle Prices IPO at $31 Per Share Circle priced its IPO at $31 per share, surpassing the anticipated range of $24 to $26, raising approximately $1.1 billion and valuing the stablecoin issuer at around $6.9 billion, CoinDesk previously reported . The offering included about 34 million shares, significantly more than the initially planned 24 million, indicating strong market demand. Trading under the ticker ""CRCL,"" Circle will debut Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, marking a major milestone after a previous failed SPAC attempt in 2021. As issuer of the USDC stablecoin, Circle's listing arrives amid renewed legislative interest in digital assets and potential regulatory clarity, potentially strengthening investor confidence amid recent crypto volatility. Trump's Crypto Connections Under Scrutiny as US Congress Debates Crypto Regulation Bill U.S. House Republicans are advancing legislation to regulate crypto markets through the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, CoinDesk previously reported , holding two hearings Wednesday in preparation for a potential committee markup next week. Republicans argue the bill urgently addresses the crypto industry's demand for clear regulatory frameworks to prevent innovations from moving offshore, highlighting the risk of the U.S. falling behind Europe and Asia in crypto oversight. Democrats, however, criticize the legislation as rushed, complex, and lacking sufficient consumer protection, particularly citing unresolved conflict-of-interest concerns related to President Donald Trump's personal cryptocurrency business activities. Democrats insist the bill needs stringent safeguards and transparency measures, as Representative Jim Himes emphasized, to secure bipartisan support, while Republicans largely dismiss these allegations as politically motivated distractions. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin saw notable volatility, swinging 1.67% amid significant institutional withdrawals, struggling to hold support above $105,000 as trade disputes heightened market uncertainty. ETH: Ethereum surged 4%, rebounding from a strong support near $2,590 driven by institutional buying and whale accumulation, forming a potential base for an upward breakout. Gold: Gold rallied over 0.80% to $3,382, recovering from a $3,343 low after weaker U.S. economic data and escalating US-China trade tensions boosted safe-haven demand Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped 0.39% at the open amid mixed Asia-Pacific trading, driven by concerns over a cooling U.S. job market S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed modestly higher at 5,970.81 Wednesday, supported by tech shares despite concerns over weak hiring data and escalating trade tensions.

While the long-term trend remains bearish, some short-term relief has appeared over the last few days. Let’s break down what’s happening with XRP right now. XRP Still in a Pullback Phase Currently, XRP is holding onto a support area between $2.10 and $2.15. This zone has attracted strong buying pressure, offering temporary stability after a series of bearish moves. However, unless the price manages to push past certain resistance levels, the risks for XRP remain on the downside. XRP price prediction The immediate resistance stands between $2.30 and $2.34. If XRP can break through this level, the next hurdles are placed at $2.44 and then between $2.56 and $2.62. These are crucial areas to watch because a breakout above them could change the entire direction of XRP’s price trend. Is a Bearish Pattern Forming? If XRP gets rejected at the resistance between $2.30 to $2.34, it risks forming a head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. This is a bearish sign and could drag XRP’s price well below $2. To avoid this, XRP needs to close candles above $2.34, and ideally above $2.44. If that happens, it might even hint at a bigger bullish pattern called an inverse head and shoulders, which could lead to higher prices. That said, there’s an important safety net for XRP bulls. As long as the price holds above the support zone between $1.21 and $1.55, the long-term bullish case remains intact. A fall below this area, however, would mean that a bigger correction is still unfolding. What’s the Bigger Picture? On a longer time frame, analysts are tracking XRP’s movement using Elliott Wave Theory. According to this, XRP might currently be in a fifth wave to the upside, aiming for much higher targets like $5.65 — but only if the market gains bullish momentum and breaks into new all-time highs.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 01:58:46
45529585,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=740899,1749088738,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45529585.jpeg,IG group's crypto launch could increase risk while expanding access,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-ig-groups-crypto-push-expand-access/,"IG Group is the first publicly listed company in the UK to let people buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies directly on its trading platform. The company’s decision allows the everyday investor to easily trade digital assets on a more transparent and regulated platform than many crypto exchanges. However, critics say the venture could expose people to more risks than wins because digital assets have unstable prices and don’t include investor protections. This begs the question of whether IG Group’s launch will make UK finance available to more people and encourage the safe use of the assets or whether it will cause potential losses for investors who don’t fully understand the risks involved. Why did IG Group launch crypto trading now? Until recently, IG only allowed its UK customers to trade digital assets through CFDs, which meant investors never owned the actual coins but only speculated on price movements. These restrictions were set in place by UK regulations that banned crypt CFDs for retail clients to protect them from high risks. IG has now partnered with Uphold to let users buy, sell, and hold over 30 real digital assets directly within IG’s existing trading platform instead of just betting on prices. The service is less risky than CFDs because it doesn’t involve borrowing money to amplify gains or losses. The user experience allows investors to manage their crypto alongside other accounts, such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), without a separate app or platform because Uphold handles the transaction processing, pricing updates, and securely storing digital coins. IG timed its launch perfectly as UK regulators started introducing cryptocurrency laws. The company wants users to view it as a trusted and regulated way for everyday investors to join the crypto market without leaving a familiar platform. Can IG make crypto investing easier for everyone? People in favor of the launch say IG’s move to offer trading through a well-known, regulated, and publicly listed company will convince investors they are dealing with a reliable and transparent business that follows strict rules to protect consumers. IG’s UK managing director, Michael Healy, describes the company as a “grown-up business,” highlighting how this new service could attract first-time investors looking to explore digital assets without feeling overwhelmed or exposed to the unnecessary dangers found on less-established platforms. Investors will also willingly pay upfront because IG charges a clear and straightforward fee of 1.49% on crypto trades without any hidden costs that could raise suspicions. This new service represents a moment when cryptocurrency finally enters the mainstream financial world to satisfy investors who want safe, simple, and regulated ways to buy, sell, and hold digital coins. IG’s new crypto service could lure investors into high-risk trades Some analysts warn that IG’s new service might expose investors to greater risks because cryptocurrency is highly volatile, and previous market crashes prove how investors can lose billions of pounds instantly. IG may be a regulated and trusted company, but its partner, Uphold, isn’t covered by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). For this reason, users may have no legal protection or compensation and could lose all their money if something goes wrong, like a hack, technical failure, or insolvency. The launch might also encourage inexperienced or newer investors to jump into speculative trading simply because they trust IG’s strong brand and assume this means their crypto investments are completely safe. However, the truth is that crypto markets can shift dramatically in minutes, and prices can collapse as quickly as they rise. Critics fear that IG’s trusted brand might convince people to take risks they don’t fully understand. When losses inevitably occur because they’re common in crypto, it could damage individual investors’ confidence and shake trust in the broader financial system. IG’s launch could change how the UK handles crypto IG Group’s decision to allow everyday traders to buy, sell, and hold real crypto tokens through a well-known and regulated provider helps normalize the idea that digital assets have a legitimate role in personal finance. The company’s success will attract more traditional financial systems to build similar services that are transparent, secure, and aligned with regulatory expectations, which could set new standards for responsible crypto activities. The move could also convince policymakers that crypto isn’t a high-risk sector run by offshore actors but an asset that serious, regulated institutions can actually manage safely. The stakes are still high because any mishaps could shake investor confidence in IG’s new product and the entire idea of regulated crypto access, forcing the public to question whether traditional financial institutions can manage such a volatile asset class. Political leaders could also face pressure to crack down harder or delay regulation if there’s media attention around investor losses or customer complaints. In the worst-case scenario, the industry IG is trying to elevate could suffer a reputational hit that sets back years of progress. Instead of encouraging thoughtful, inclusive innovation, a misstep could revive old fears that crypto is simply too risky for the average person, no matter who offers it.

On June 4, the foundation unveiled a new plan outlining how to invest its reserves, fund DeFi protocols, and develop privacy standards that align with Ethereum’s core principles of neutrality and self-sovereignty. The more influence it has globally, the more attention it receives from institutions, and this change is encouraging a more stable and organized way for capital to engage with ETH. The foundation’s treasury and multi-year reserve spending policy are linked to operating expenses through a prescribed formula. The foundation has taken a big step away from its historically more laissez-faire approach to capital by introducing specific rules regarding the sale of Ethereum, the holding of stablecoins, and how on-chain investments will be made. EF’s new strategy allows for exposure to on-chain opportunities, increasing income Ethereum Foundation’s new strategy is pushing for more direct treasury management , which needs to balance yield generation, risk, and ideological mandates. At the same time, the growth has led to additional complexity, volatility, and management responsibility. It is expected that there will be a big impact not only on Ethereum itself but also on the network community due to the security vulnerability to which the network was recently vulnerable. The Foundation has created a 2-variable treasury function for risk, reckoning fiat reserves, which are 2.5 years of the runway by a 15% stable annual cost. That gives an amount of ETH that can be safely sold to fiat or stable assets. Treasury operations will become more counter-cyclical, with stronger help during market declines and a balanced approach during rising markets. Although Ethereum is still the main part of the treasury, the new guidelines from EF allow for increased exposure to on-chain opportunities like staking, lending, tokenized real-world assets, and select DeFi protocols. EF describes privacy as “a critical civil liberty” in an increasingly surveilled financial space One of the policy’s most shaping features is the codified determination towards privacy, which the Foundation characterizes as “a critical civil liberty” in a more and more surveilled financial environment. The guidance demonstrates a growing concern among the Ethereum community at the emergence of KYC-gated apps, centrally controlled user interfaces, and an overly heavy reliance on off-chain legal cushions. Using a new internal system named “Defipunk,” EF will assess possible DeFi partners based on several factors: open access, self-storage of assets, open-source licenses, and technical privacy features such as transaction protection. Protocols that do not fully meet the standards can still be accepted, but they must show real progress toward those goals. This is a unique attempt by institutions to introduce ethical guidelines into decentralized finance, an industry that usually focuses more on incentives than on moral principles. However, it could also leave EF at odds with US and European regulation trends, where authorities have increasingly turned toward a preference for transparency and adherence to the law over priority given to the availability of cryptographic privacy. The same standards will apply to EF’s internal operations. Treasury deployment-focused staff are anticipated to work with privacy-preserving technology solutions and contribute to open-source infrastructure, partly to shield them from ideological alignment.

XRP has a 98% chance of ETF approval by December 2025 on Polymarket. Meanwhile, Hedera made waves in Europe with a 100% physically backed ETP. But in the background, a lesser-known altcoin is turning the heads of serious backers. Qubetics ($TICS), a next-gen Layer 1 blockchain, is building more than hype. It’s solving development bottlenecks, and the crypto world is now noticing it as the top cryptocurrency to buy. At the center of this momentum is Qubetics’ AI-driven QubeQode and its built-in IDE, a powerful toolset designed to eliminate the usual headaches associated with building smart contracts. This feature alone is attracting a wave of developers, entrepreneurs, and early buyers who understand that the real value of blockchain lies in usability. Let’s break it all down about the top cryptocurrency to buy today. QubeQode and Qubetics IDE: Power Tools for Developers Developers face a steep learning curve when building on-chain. Whether writing secure smart contracts, optimizing gas fees, or handling cross-chain functionality, the process is time-consuming and error-prone. Qubetics changes the game with QubeQode—a drag-and-drop development interface layered with AI suggestions and real-time code optimization. Unlike standard IDEs, QubeQode empowers users at all skill levels to generate production-ready smart contracts, detect bugs instantly, and deploy applications without mastering Solidity or Rust. It removes barriers that have held back thousands of developers from entering the space. Picture a small business owner launching a tokenized loyalty program in hours instead of weeks, or a freelance developer building a cross-chain voting dApp without touching a single line of code. That’s the kind of transformation Qubetics is gunning for. It’s not just about ease of use. The AI layer embedded in the IDE continuously learns from existing smart contract deployments to suggest best practices, enforce security audits, and even benchmark gas efficiency. With Qubetics , the blockchain backend finally meets the simplicity of modern software tools. For serious builders, this is a significant draw. Only 10M Tokens Left: Is Qubetics Still a Top Cryptocurrency to Buy? Stage 37 of the Qubetics crypto presale is almost closed. The price is $0.3370, and just 10 million $TICS remain before the 20% jump to its $0.40 listing value. With over 515 million tokens sold and $17.7 million raised, scarcity is climbing fast. Out of the total supply, only 1.36 billion tokens now exist—down from 4 billion initially—with 38.55% allocated to the public. The tokenomics speak for themselves. Analysts forecast a sharp surge once Qubetics hits exchanges. Community members who joined at Stage 1 at $0.01 are sitting on a jaw-dropping 3270% gain. But it’s not over yet. With the listing price on the horizon, buyers at $0.3370 can still expect strong ROI potential. Here’s a simple scenario: A $6500 entry at the current stage would net roughly 19,292 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics hits $1 post-launch, that’s $19,292—a 196.65% return. At $5, the same stash hits $96,460. And if projections for $10 or $15 at mainnet materialize, that’s $192,920 to $289,380. Not hype—just math. So while headlines mention TFs and ETPs, Qubetics is quietly making its soon-exploding crypto presale one of the most strategic entry points in the market and the top cryptocurrency to buy today. XRP ETF Approval Odds Hit 98%, But Short-Term Uncertainty Lingers Despite delays from the SEC, Polymarket data shows a 98% chance of XRP gaining ETF approval by December 2025. Still, short-term odds have dipped, with July predictions falling to 19%. The SEC has yet to issue decisions on proposals from 21Shares and Franklin Templeton, now slated for review in June. However, the launch of XRP futures in May and its leading number of ETF filings among altcoins suggest strong institutional interest. Buyers still face regulatory overhangs and timing risks. HBAR Goes Institutional in Europe with New 21Shares ETP On the other side of the Atlantic, 21Shares launched the Hedera ETP (HDRA) on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. This gives investors direct exposure to HBAR without touching crypto wallets. It’s a significant step toward institutional adoption, especially as U.S. investors await SEC decisions on spot HBAR ETFs, expected by June 11. The ETP also helps validate Hedera’s growing enterprise appeal, offering asset managers and retail participants a way to gain regulated exposure to the protocol. Conclusion: A New Front-Runner in the Race for Utility With XRP inching toward ETF approval and HBAR landing European institutional access, mainstream interest in digital assets is alive and well. But for those hunting for the next breakout play, Qubetics stands apart. The combination of real utility through QubeQode and smart tokenomics makes $TICS the top cryptocurrency to buy before its listing. While others wait for regulators to act, Qubetics buyers are already locking in value. Based on expert predictions and current market behavior, Qubetics may be the strongest high-upside entry in the crypto presale arena. The window isn’t closed—but it’s narrowing fast. Join the Qubetics crypto presale now, while the odds remain in your favor.

Qubetics is still in presale and focuses on development tools, AI integration, and real-world token utility, unlike XRP and HBAR, which are already on the market. How much can be earned with a $6500 Qubetics entry? At $0.3370, $6500 yields 19,292 tokens. At $10-$15 post-launch, this could grow to $192,920 to $289,380. Is it too late to join the Qubetics presale? No, only 10M tokens are left at the current price, making this one of the last chances before the listing.

Expert Says SEC Dropped Appeal, 60-Day Delay Could Follow Ripple",https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-lawsuit-end-when-expert-says-sec-dropped-appeal-60-day-delay-next/,"The post XRP Lawsuit End When? Expert Says SEC Dropped Appeal, 60-Day Delay Could Follow Ripple appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s now been 20 days since Judge Analisa Torres denied both Ripple and the SEC’s joint request for an indicative ruling in their long-running legal battle. To keep it simple, the court basically told both sides they didn’t follow the proper legal procedure when asking for that specific relief — meaning their motion was procedurally improper. The judge’s message was clear: if jurisdiction were restored to her court, she’d reject the request as it stands. In legal terms, it means Ripple and the SEC used the wrong rule of civil procedure to file this motion. The obvious next step would be for both parties to refile the same request correctly under the right rule. But here’s where it gets interesting — they haven’t. Why Haven’t Ripple and the SEC Refiled the Motion Yet? Attorney Fred Rispoli said that it’s been 20 days and still no new filing from either side. The delay is raising eyebrows because a crucial deadline is fast approaching. On June 16, both parties have to file a status update with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. And whether or not a new motion is pending in Judge Torres’ court by then will dramatically affect what happens next. 20 days later, no refile yet by SEC and Ripple in district court and the June 16 deadline for the status update in the 2nd Circuit looms large. Expect the refile before Judge Torres to happen by then. If there is nothing pending before Torres when the parties file the…1/3 https://t.co/XSq3uYC0Bj — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 4, 2025 If nothing is filed before Judge Torres by June 16, the Second Circuit will have only the judge’s earlier denial to work with, meaning the appeals process would likely restart and proceed as scheduled. If, however, a new and properly filed motion is sitting on Judge Torres’ desk by then, the Second Circuit might pause things again for another 60 days to wait and see what happens. What’s the Next Step in This Legal Drama? The bigger question many in the XRP community are asking is: why this holdup? Judge Torres essentially told both Ripple and the SEC they need to get back on the same page, fix their filing mistake, and humbly request the relief they’re after. As Rispoli put it — Ripple and the SEC need to “get on all fours and beg for relief.” Ripple likely has no issue doing this if it means putting the legal fight behind them. But how much public backtracking or legal groveling is the SEC willing to tolerate or be authorized to do? That remains unclear. And with just 12 days to go before the June 16 deadline, time is running out. Did the SEC Drop Its Appeal? Adding to the confusion, one XRP holder speculated that perhaps the SEC would just drop its appeal altogether and leave Ripple to deal with its cross-appeal, which isn’t something the SEC can control. Attorney Rispoli responded by clarifying that the SEC has, in fact, already dropped its main appeal. What’s left now is Ripple’s cross-appeal, which relates to issues like the fine and the injunction.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 02:43:47

On-Chain Metrics Hint at What’s Coming Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pullback-or-setup-on-chain-metrics-hint-at-whats-coming-next/,"Bitcoin is experiencing a short-term price decline. In the past 24 hours, the asset has fallen by approximately 9.3% to a trading value of $105,062. This pullback places Bitcoin roughly 8% below its all-time high recorded last month. The dip comes amid broader market volatility, but on-chain indicators and exchange data suggest deeper structural trends that may influence the next phase of Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Recent market analysis points to renewed accumulation among long-term holders, a spike in exchange withdrawals, and rising spot trading activity on Binance. These developments are being interpreted as signals of underlying strength despite recent price weakness. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha has provided a detailed breakdown of these emerging patterns, offering a perspective on how long-term dynamics may be shaping Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3–5 Year Holders Slow Selloff—Waiting for Higher Prices? Binance Trading Volume Rises, Long-Term Holders Accumulate Since early June, Binance has seen its share of Bitcoin spot trading volume increase from 26% to 35%, positioning it more firmly as the dominant platform in the market. This increase in trading activity has occurred as Bitcoin approaches and tests key price levels. According to Taha, this surge may indicate renewed interest from retail and institutional traders alike, particularly as volatility draws more short-term market participants to major exchanges. In addition to exchange volume shifts, on-chain data reveals growing confidence among long-term Bitcoin holders. The Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap, a metric that reflects the value of coins held by entities with a holding period of over 155 days, has returned above $20 billion. Historically, this type of accumulation pattern has preceded periods of price expansion, as long-term investors tend to hold through corrections and avoid frequent selling. The rise in LTH realized cap suggests these entities are not exiting positions during this market dip, which may reduce available supply and support future upward movement. Bitcoin Large Exchange Withdrawals Signal Tightening Supply Beyond trading activity and holder behavior, Taha pointed out that another notable trend is emerging on centralized exchanges. Over a two-day period, Kraken and Bitfinex recorded net Bitcoin outflows exceeding 20,000 BTC, among the largest short-term withdrawals in recent months. Such movements are often interpreted as signals of investors shifting assets into self-custody, possibly in anticipation of long-term holding or strategic redeployment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go ‘Bananas’ If Price Closes Above This Level, Top Analyst Says Combined, the rise in Binance’s market share, increased LTH accumulation, and exchange outflows present a picture of a market undergoing structural positioning rather than widespread exit activity. While the short-term price trend reflects a pullback from recent highs, the simultaneous withdrawal of supply and steady long-term holder confidence could act as foundational elements for potential future growth.

TRUMP coin price has dropped 15 percent following a sharp round of selling, with over 40 percent of holders either exiting or cutting down their holdings. On the other side, Cardano (ADA) price prediction has taken a bullish turn, thanks to growing chatter around a possible ETF approval that could attract major institutional investors. While TRUMP struggles and Cardano waits on regulatory action, Unstaked is making quiet, steady progress. Its presale is in stage 18 with a price of $0.010743, and it’s targeting a post-launch value of around $0.1819. With more than $9 million already raised, Unstaked is proving that strong fundamentals and real-world utility can drive serious investor interest. TRUMP Coin Dips 15% After Holders Pull Out TRUMP Coin saw a 15 percent drop after the GALA event led to a wave of selling. Blockchain data confirms over 40 percent of wallets either fully exited or reduced their exposure. This has raised red flags about confidence in the meme coin’s future. Though the TRUMP Coin gained attention with political themes and hype-driven interest, the recent drop signals weakening support. Volume has dropped significantly, and some analysts warn that unless a fresh story or big update arrives, the coin could struggle to regain traction. For those tracking meme coins, TRUMP’s short-term performance may reveal if this decline is just a dip or the start of a deeper downtrend. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction Rises With ETF Anticipation Cardano (ADA) is setting up for a potential breakout, as anticipation builds around a spot ETF proposal. ADA is hovering near $0.58, approaching a key resistance level it has failed to break for several weeks. Analysts are noticing bullish patterns on the charts and a rise in trading activity, pointing to growing investor interest. If an ETF gets the green light, it could lead to a surge in institutional demand, sending ADA beyond the $0.65 mark. In the meantime, investors are watching support at $0.54 and resistance at $0.60 closely. With strong long-term fundamentals, higher developer activity, and increasing retail engagement, Cardano looks ready to move if the ETF comes through. Unstaked’s AI Bots Across Multiple Platforms & A $9M Presale Time and reach are everything in crypto marketing. But managing platforms like X, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit can quickly become overwhelming and inefficient. That’s where Unstaked steps in with intuitive drag-and-drop AI agents that handle content creation, replies, and user engagement across ten or more networks, all from one centralized and intelligent dashboard. Currently priced at $0.010743 in its crypto presale stage 18, Unstaked is targeting a launch value close to $0.1819. This pricing structure sets up a compelling 2,700% potential return for early participants. With more than $9 million already raised, buyers aren’t just betting on a new token, they’re investing in a functional, time-saving platform that delivers measurable results for real-world use. Rather than bouncing between apps or hiring a full marketing team, users can manage outreach and audience growth through a single, streamlined system. Whether you’re a solo founder, a Web3 startup, or a growing marketing agency, Unstaked is designed to significantly improve efficiency and impact. At under a penny per token, this could be one of Q2’s smartest operational crypto investments. Ignore it, and you may be stuck switching tabs while others scale seamlessly with AI. Wrapping Up The TRUMP coin price keeps falling as initial excitement fades. Without clear use or further development, the token risks becoming just another meme project that couldn’t sustain its momentum. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) price prediction remains hopeful but depends heavily on an ETF decision, which could take time and is out of the project’s hands. Unstaked, however, is already providing value. Its AI bots let users manage multiple platforms without needing multiple tools, making it more than just another presale token. At its current price, it’s a full-featured productivity asset wrapped in a crypto format. In a market full of hype, Unstaked is focused on real delivery. That difference might be what helps it outperform others in the months ahead.

Coinbase may still stand tall as the poster child of exchange-driven adoption, but its growing vulnerabilities expose a systemic flaw. Users are still being asked to trust a third party with their assets, privacy and safety. In a post-Coinbase world, this trust model is no longer sustainable. The next chapter of crypto centers around non-custodial infrastructure – models that return control to the user without sacrificing security, usability or speed. The ‘not your keys, not your coins’ ethos is evolving from a rallying cry into an architectural blueprint for the next generation of crypto platforms. The trust crisis and its ripple effects Recent events, like the estimated $300 million in phishing-related losses on Coinbase as highlighted by investigators like ZachXBT, means centralized platforms are being pushed to serve as banks, tech firms and compliance officers all at once. But in doing so, they inherit the worst vulnerabilities of each model. The trust users place in these intermediaries becomes a single point of failure, exploited not just by hackers but by misaligned incentives and opaque systems. We are now seeing users, especially the next wave of adopters, demanding platforms that work like Coinbase but without the custody. They want seamless on/off ramps, intuitive UI and fast swaps – but without giving up sovereignty over their funds. What a post-Coinbase model looks like Most so-called ‘non-custodial’ platforms still expect users to jump through hoops just to do the basics. Meanwhile, centralized giants like Coinbase built empires by prioritizing ease of use over core crypto principles. That tradeoff is no longer acceptable. The real opportunity now is to build platforms that don’t ask users to choose between control and convenience. Crypto should be as simple as swapping tokens in seconds. No logins, no account creation, no handing over your identity to a black box. Most fiat on-ramps still funnel users through third parties that operate like banks in disguise. The future is wallet-native – not broker-driven. We need KYC (know your customer) and payments infrastructure that supports sovereignty not platforms that treat users like liabilities to be monetized. And let’s kill the fantasy that users are going to ‘bridge’ and ‘wrap’ and ‘unwrap’ every time they move across chains. No one has time for that. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos – they should all work from one interface. No jargon, no jumping through tabs. If your product still requires a tutorial, it’s not ready for mass adoption. Lastly, security can’t mean telling people ‘don’t forget your seed phrase’ and calling it a day. That’s lazy. Non-custodial platforms must bake in real protection – recovery options, phishing defense, smart defaults – without turning every user into their own IT department. We cannot afford to be rebranding the old playbook anymore. The real shift is happening – i n tools that feel as seamless as Coinbase but don’t ask you to hand over your keys, your data or your trust.

The price is trading below $0.70 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $0.6840 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it dips below the $0.650 support zone. Cardano Price Dips Further In the past few days, Cardano saw a fresh decline below the $0.750, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA even declined below the $0.70 level to enter a bearish zone. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $0.6840 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The bears even pushed the price below the $0.70 level.

The first resistance is near $0.6825 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7026 swing high to the $0.6626 low. The next key resistance might be $0.6920. If there is a close above the $0.6920 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.7350 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.750 in the near term. Another Decline In ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.6825 resistance level, it could start another decline.

Sygnum Bank’s June 2025 Monthly Investment Outlook attributes the asset’s positive momentum to its growing appeal as a safe haven and broader institutional adoption, which are now driving a structural reduction in liquid supply. Bitcoin Demand Shocks Over the past 18 months, Bitcoin exchange balances have fallen by one million BTC, which represents a 30% drop, largely due to increased holdings by ETFs and other acquisition vehicles. These instruments are funneling capital from traditional equity and fixed income investors into the crypto space. The decline in exchange balances is viewed as a bullish signal, which points to a shift toward long-term holding behavior. With more institutional products entering the market and some governments considering adding Bitcoin to their reserves, Sygnum stated that it sees potential for demand shocks and upside volatility. These factors, the bank argued, set the stage for a possible continuation of the current bull cycle. As institutional adoption drives Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, developments on the government front suggest an expanding role for the asset at the state and national level. Global Interest in Bitcoin Reserve Adoption Grows Three US states have recently passed bills supporting the inclusion of Bitcoin in government reserves, with New Hampshire becoming the first to sign such a bill into law. Texas is likely to follow, as the state’s governor has publicly backed the initiative. International interest is also growing. Pakistan’s government and the Reform UK party – currently leading in British election polls – have both announced plans to explore central bank Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, policy think tanks in China have floated similar proposals, and unconfirmed reports suggest quiet accumulation may already be underway. While no official Bitcoin purchases have begun under these approved frameworks, analysts at Sygnym suggest that actual acquisitions could become a major price catalyst. The combination of increased demand and the strong signaling effect of state and national entities entering the market may drive broader institutional interest and accelerate Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption.

Lummis pushed back. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Lummis told Bloomberg the military thinks having Bitcoin on hand matters. She said it could be a tool in the economic contest with China. Some see that as a bold step. Others say it’s risky. Military Backs Bitcoin Reserve According to the senator, military leaders say Bitcoin could help in an economic showdown. They see it as a way to hold value if traditional assets get hit by sanctions or big moves from other nations. She spoke about weapons and ammunitions being part of national security, but she added that a Bitcoin reserve is also vital. Some military voices have warned that future conflicts won’t just be fought on battlefields. Money and digital assets could play a key role too. Legislative And Executive Moves Based on reports, Lummis introduced a bill to have the US buy and hold 1 million BTC. That would mirror what countries do with gold. The idea is to pull funds from the Treasury or Federal Reserve rather than use new budget money. It has not moved far in Congress. Still, US President Donald Trump issued an order on March 6, 2025, to set up a Bitcoin reserve plus a digital asset stockpile for other coins. He said the government would use assets seized in civil and criminal actions to start the fund. That means some 200,000 BTC the government already has could be part of it. Lummis Sees Bitcoin Price Rising In The Next Decade Lummis unveiled a proprietary model forecasting a dramatic rise in Bitcoin’s price over the next decade, citing factors such as its fixed supply, growing institutional adoption, and expanding network effects. Analysts caution that such long-term forecasts hinge on unpredictable factors like regulatory shifts, technological breakthroughs, and market sentiment, any of which could derail even the most optimistic projections. She also praised Trump for pushing simple rules for crypto and for using digital coins as part of national strategy. Trump’s family runs a DeFi platform, a stablecoin project, and even some meme coins. Lummis thinks everyone will end up in the crypto economy sooner or later. Related Reading: $500M Bet On Solana: Education Platform Aims To Supercharge Its Treasury Skeptic Voices And Uncertain Path Jamie Dimon disagrees. He calls the Bitcoin reserve a waste of resources. Other experts worry about Bitcoin’s ups and downs. They say a strategic reserve shouldn’t ride on something that can swing 20% in a single day. Some economists at top universities give zero support to borrowing money to build a crypto stash. They argue it doesn’t make sense against the US’s nearly $36 trillion national debt. For now, the bill to buy 1 million BTC sits in committee.

Tron (TRX), Toncoin (TON), and Cardano (ADA) are moving through unstable phases. Tron stays steady with signs of strength, Toncoin is forming a pattern hinting at a breakout, while Cardano is looking for support in a downtrend. While these well-known names face ongoing price shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is steadily gaining traction. It has become one of the most popular cryptos right now, showing solid momentum and growing attention. With clear interest from the community, BlockDAG’s position is hard to overlook. Below is a breakdown of how other top players are doing and why BlockDAG’s entry at $0.0018 could prove to be a rare advantage in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0018 Entry Draws Heavy Interest Across Crypto Circles BlockDAG is becoming a widely followed name among the most popular cryptos right now. With more than $285 million in presale funds and 21.9 billion BDAG coins already sold, it has made a clear impact. Its limited-time $0.0018 entry price offers a path to a 2,678% ROI based on the confirmed launch price of $0.05. But it’s the technical setup that adds more weight. BlockDAG (BDAG) offers full EVM compatibility, allowing Ethereum-based apps to transition directly into its system. This opens the door for easy expansion in Web3, NFTs, and DeFi. Its dual-layer blockchain and DAG model supports large-scale activity without clogging the network, solving a common issue seen elsewhere. The network’s GO LIVE reveal on June 13 will announce 20 exchange listings at once, bringing global recognition to the project. On the same day, the $0.0018 entry expires. For those following the most popular cryptos right now, BlockDAG’s low price and exchange exposure make it a standout option in 2025. 2. Tron (TRX): Holding Firm Through Changing Market Conditions Tron (TRX) is staying stable despite the wider market’s uncertain pace. At $0.2705, it holds above $0.26, supported by lower risk indicators like Beta and VaR. These show less exposure to sudden price shifts. It has moved ahead of Cardano in terms of market cap and now ranks ninth overall. Tron also leads in stablecoin volume, handling more daily USDT transfers than Ethereum. Experts project prices between $0.2645 and $0.6133 for 2025, with an average around $0.4426. Though not part of the top crypto presale trend, Tron’s steady performance keeps it on the radar of those favoring stable, proven platforms. 3. Toncoin (TON): A Technical Setup Worth Watching Toncoin (TON), now priced at $3.21, has risen 2.68% over the last day. It has been holding a range between $2.20 and $3.50 after reaching over $5 earlier in the year. Technical patterns suggest a triangle setup, often linked to a future breakout. Projections place its June 2025 price between $2.23 and $3.18, with a mid-range estimate near $2.53. Though not among the most popular cryptos right now in presale circles, Toncoin’s technical signals make it a strong mid-term option for those tracking potential breakouts. 4. Cardano (ADA): Waiting for a Turn in Sentiment Cardano (ADA) is priced at $0.6949, showing a small 2.38% daily climb. It recently slipped below the $0.72 support level, keeping the tone cautious. Forecasts range from $0.7029 to $0.9169 for June, with an average projection of $0.7758. However, ADA’s low momentum is still a concern despite its robust base technology. While it doesn’t carry the short-term appeal of the most popular cryptos right now, Cardano stays relevant for long-term followers due to its solid fundamentals and active development. Final Call! Tron, Toncoin, and Cardano are continuing their separate growth tracks, each with their own strengths. But when it comes to real-time traction, BlockDAG is clearly ahead. With $285 million raised in presale, 21.9 billion coins sold, EVM-ready architecture, and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG has what it takes to be among the most popular cryptos right now. Its hybrid structure and fast onboarding features provide key value to developers. For those seeking strong 2025 upside, BlockDAG’s current price may offer one of the last early access points before broader exposure takes hold. With all major signals pointing forward, it’s becoming a central name in conversations around the most popular cryptos right now .

Ripple Co-founder Could Be Worth $2.7 Trillion, 500K Millionaire Boom Predicted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently trading at $2.20, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours and about 4% over the past week. But zooming out, the picture looks brighter as it has surged over 300% in the past year. While some experts have made unrealistic predictions of it hitting $1,000, others remain divided on how high XRP can go. According to a viral post doing rounds on X (formerly Twitter), Chris Larsen, the co-founder of Ripple, owns around 2.7 billion XRP. If XRP ever reaches $1000 per coin, his net worth could skyrocket to $2.7 trillion. This would make him the first trillionaire in history, far ahead of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. But Larsen would not be the only one to be on the XRP rich list. If XRP holders do not sell their coins, it could give birth to new ultra-wealthy individuals. There could be around 300 to 500 new billionaires, 10,000 people with over $100 million, 100,000 with over $10 million, and about 500,000 new millionaires. XRP is never going to $1000 $10 is possible. $100 is unlikely. $1000 will never happen. — Matthew Turner (@MbtHawk) June 5, 2025 What It Would Take for XRP to Rewrite Financial History? However, many claim that this is extremely unlikely in the short term. XRP would need to jump nearly 50,000% to hit $1,000. Some experts like Matthew Brienen and Patrick Bet-David believe it’s possible due to XRP’s role in global payments. However, it is doubtful if it will ever reach that level, even in 25 years. If XRP hit $1,000 with its current supply of about 58.4 billion tokens, its total market value would be around $58.4 trillion. That is way more than the value of gold (about $22.4 trillion), Apple (around $3 trillion), Bitcoin ($1.7 trillion), and the entire crypto market ($2.7 trillion). XRP would be worth more than all of them combined, which shows just how unlikely that price is. XRP Price Prediction (Short-term) XRP is currently trading at $2.20. Most oscillators are neutral, with only momentum suggesting a buy. All short- to medium-term moving averages are signaling sell, except the 200-period EMA. It recently bounced back from a low of $2.07, but it could not rise above the resistance at $2.27. Key support levels to watch are $2.22, $2.07, and lower zones around $1.92, $1.85, and $1.61. Although price faces some downward pressure, the rising trading activity and liquidations in the derivatives market hint at a possible recovery ahead. XRP isn’t hitting $1,000 or even $100 anytime soon. Some say $4 or even $10 might be possible. And $1,000 is just off the table. Also, there is always this question looming- “What if Larsen decides to sell a big chunk?” That could cause the price to drop quickly and create a lot of market chaos.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 04:09:07

However, if you are just starting, it is always helpful that you find the necessary steps that you can follow to activate the code without breaking a sweat. Down below, you can find a dedicated step-by-step guide on how to do it. Head over to Stake.com: First things first, head over to Stake website as you will need to create an account to claim Stake.com bonus codes. Click on the “Register” button : In the top right corner, you are going to find a blue “Register” button. By clicking on that, a pop-up will appear with certain information that you will have to fill in. Provide necessary information: Type in the required information such as email, username, password, and date of birth. With that out of the way, do not click the green “Continue” button just yet. Check the “Code(Optional)” Box: By clicking on the mentioned box, a new text bar is going to appear where you can type in any of the codes we provided you with above.

Make a deposit and enjoy your bonus: To activate this bonus, you will have to make a minimum deposit of $50. Terms and Conditions for Stake.com Codes Let’s not forget to mention the fact that every Stake.com promo code comes with certain terms and conditions that you will have to follow. In most instances, there are unified sets of rules. However, certain requirements such as rollover vary based on the bonus in hand. Bet multiplier: When claiming Stake.com promo codes, you should pay attention to the bet multiplier. For example, the majority of bonuses on this crypto casino come with a maximum bet of 1% of the deposit amount. Learn more about bets on https://cs2lords.com/ Minimum deposit to activate the bonus: If you are claiming a deposit offer on Stake, then you need to be aware of the minimum deposit that is required to trigger the bonus. For example, if you use the code “ HELLA200 ”, a minimum deposit of $50 is required. Bonus eligibility: Some bonuses are location-specific. For example, players that are coming from Brazil can use the code “ HELLABR ” while European players will not be able to use this bonus code. The maximum amount of bonus funds players can claim: When claiming deposit offers, make sure that you go over the terms and conditions to find out the maximum amount of bonus funds that you can get for yourself and decide whether that suits you or not. Timeframe: There are two sides to this. First and foremost, every bonus comes with an expiration date. Some last longer, while unique and exclusive ones have shorter timeframes. It is also important to mention that you have a pre-determined number of days to fulfill all requirements otherwise the bonus will be forfeited. Wagering Requirements for Stake.com Wagering requirements, also known as rollover requirements is a phrase commonly used in bonus terms and conditions. It revolves around the number of times a player will have to wager bonus funds that he received through a promotion or a bonus. There are several reasons why gambling sites enforce this rule so strictly. The first reason is based on preventing money laundering. On top of that, we all know that gambling sites do not like to lose money voluntarily, and with wagering requirements, they can prevent players from depositing funds, using deposit bonuses, and withdrawing both deposit funds and bonus ones. Wagering requirements for Stake.com codes can be explained with a small and simple guide. During the sign up procedure, you used the code “ HELLA200 ”. Once the account is created, you decide to make a $100 deposit. In the bonus terms, you are eligible for a 200% additional funds allocation which means that you are starting your venture with $300 in total. To meet wagering requirements, bonus funds will have to be wagered 40 times. To put things into perspective, simply multiply $200 in bonus funds that you received from Stake with 40. In total, you will have to play through $8,000 to withdraw bonus funds. Tips for Using Your Stake.Com Promo Codes To get the most out of Stake.com promo codes, we are going to provide you with tips and guidelines that you can use to determine what type of bonus suits you the best. Without further ado, let’s jump right into this one. Determine which bonus suits you the best: Our list of Stake.com promo codes provides you with all sorts of bonuses. It is up to you to decide which one suits you the best, so take your pick and do not forget that these codes are one-and-done. If you did not use the code during sign up, there is still a chance for you to claim it: If you missed out on using the code during the sign up process, you still have 24 hours to activate the welcome offer in the Options menu, under the “Offers” tab. Maximizing the bonus: If you are not on a tight budget and you are interested in claiming a welcome deposit bonus, then do not shy away from making a bigger deposit to claim the highest possible amount of bonus funds. Find out which games make the biggest contribution toward required rollover: In the terms and conditions, you will find a section revolving around which games provide the most toward rollover requirements. For a fact, we can tell you that 50-50 games like roulette will often count only 5% towards the wagering requirements. Exclusive codes provide the most bang for your buck: Always be on the lookout for unique bonus codes that will go above and beyond to make sure you get the biggest possible reward when creating an account with Stake. Mistakes to Avoid When Using Your Stake.com Promo Code If you are just starting and you never used the Stake.com promo code before, then these are the mistakes you need to avoid so the entire deposit, play, and withdrawal process can go smoothly. Ensure that you meet the rollover requirements before withdrawing: The biggest mistake you can make is withdrawing funds from the account before the rollover requirements are met. If you do this, bonus funds will be forfeited automatically. Carefully choose the games you play: Not all of the games provide the same value toward wagering requirements. For example, table games like roulette and blackjack will not count fully towards the rollover. Be aware of the time limit before the bonus is forfeited: You will have a pre-determined amount of time to meet all of the requirements for bonus funds to be withdrawn. Keep that in mind and make sure that you do not go over the time limit as you will be stripped of the bonus funds. If you use multiple accounts to claim a bonus, you will get banned from the platform: You can’t create multiple accounts from the same IP address. This is all addressed in the terms and conditions and if the platform catches you in the act, all of the created accounts will be closed immediately.

XRP XRP, Solana’s SOL SOL and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB shed 1.5%, while Tron’s TRX TRX was the only major token in the green with a 1.9% bump. “Recent macro and policy conditions have created uncertainty in risk-on assets, which is reflected in the current Bitcoin price,” said Anna Liu, CEO of HashKey Tokenization, said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. “While we believe there will likely be volatilities in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, we remain positive on BTC as a strategic asset for investors in the longer term,” she added, noting that recent inflows into BTC and ETH ETFs show institutions are still exploring crypto allocations despite short-term headwinds. Market sentiment remains in the greed zone, with the crypto fear and greed index at 62, though it has lost a few points in the last day. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, said bitcoin’s rebound from near $103,000 on May 31 signals the beginning of a potential upward movement. “Potentially, this momentum could take the market to new highs above $130K,” he said. However, Ether ETH continues to battle resistance at its 200-day moving average. A break above $2,700 could serve as an important indicator of renewed optimism, Kuptsikevich added.

What was once pitched as a bipartisan attempt to bring order to the crypto sector has become the focus of intense scrutiny over President Donald Trump’s personal investments and public involvement in the industry. At the same time, Trump’s nomination of former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz to chair the agency has further amplified concerns about the direction and impartiality of US crypto oversight, leaving both regulatory proposals mired in ethical and political uncertainty. Trump’s Crypto Ties Spark Deep Divisions in Congress Over CLARITY Act Tensions flared during a US House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) hearing on June 4, as lawmakers clashed over the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act—a proposed bipartisan bill aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The session was dominated not by policy specifics, but by heated concerns about President Donald J. Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto space. Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the committee’s ranking member, pulled no punches as she accused the president of exploiting the crypto industry for personal gain. She alleged that Trump’s business dealings—including a high-profile dinner with meme coin investors who paid a reported $148 million for access—cast a shadow over his administration’s support for the bill. Rep. Maxine Waters addressing US lawmakers (Source: House Financial Services Committee ) A President's Wallet Under Scrutiny At the heart of the controversy is Trump’s increasingly visible presence in the digital asset world. Waters and other Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform reportedly backed by Trump’s inner circle, and his ongoing investments in meme coins and stablecoins. Waters claimed the lack of language in the bill prohibiting self-dealing by government officials could effectively allow Trump to “put [Americans’] money in his digital wallet.” In May, she introduced a bill designed to explicitly ban the president, vice president, and members of Congress, as well as their families, from owning or promoting crypto investments while in office. The timing was pointed. Her bill dropped the same day Trump hosted the now-infamous “meme coin dinner” at one of his golf clubs, where he addressed attendees from behind a lectern emblazoned with the US presidential seal—a move the White House later dismissed as a “personal engagement.” The CLARITY Act, introduced by House Republicans on May 29 with support from three Democratic co-sponsors, was initially positioned as a long-awaited bipartisan solution to the regulatory gray zone surrounding digital assets. The bill aims to delineate the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), create clearer definitions of digital assets and digital commodities, and establish investor protections for tokenized markets. Yet critics argue that the bill’s timing, content, and lack of enforcement mechanisms raise questions about who it really serves. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, called to testify during the hearing, voiced deep reservations about the bill’s political context. “We cannot tell now to what extent is the president doing something because it’s in America’s best interest or because it’s helping promote his personal enrichment,” he said. “We have to address this. I don’t see how we can move forward and try to create a framework for this industry if we don’t do that.” Massad’s comments echoed broader concerns voiced by lawmakers on both the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees, with Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) from the latter stating that Trump is making the effort to pass crypto legislation a lot more difficult. GOP Seeks Regulatory Clarity, Avoids Trump Topic House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R-Ark.) emphasized the bill’s core purpose: to provide regulatory certainty and foster innovation within US borders. “Currently, there is no federal framework for digital assets,” Hill noted. “The SEC and CFTC do not have clear jurisdictional boundaries over digital assets, leaving investors and entrepreneurs in a state of uncertainty and often discouraging innovation.” Republican lawmakers largely avoided direct references to the president’s crypto dealings during the hearing. Most expert witnesses also steered clear of the topic in their opening statements, including former SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman and Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer Katherine Minarik. Only Massad confronted the issue head-on, tying Trump’s involvement in crypto to a broader erosion of public trust and national security concerns. The CLARITY Act is only one of several crypto-related bills under consideration. In the Senate, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act—focused on regulating payment stablecoins—has already cleared a crucial committee vote. However, it too faces resistance from lawmakers demanding provisions to insulate crypto policy from Trump’s direct and indirect involvement. Even with bipartisan framing, both the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts face uphill battles unless carveouts are introduced to mitigate perceived conflicts of interest and establish stricter ethical boundaries for public officials. The current political environment, where digital asset legislation intersects with presidential business interests, is unprecedented in the history of US financial policymaking. While many in the crypto industry are eager for clear rules to emerge, others fear that regulation drafted under the cloud of self-enrichment could prove both ineffective and damaging. A Moment of Reckoning for Crypto Policy As the US races to catch up with Europe and Asia in regulating digital assets, questions of integrity and motive loom large. Lawmakers are being asked to define the future of an industry worth trillions, even as some fear that very process may be compromised by the influence of the nation’s highest office. Whether the CLARITY Act becomes law—or gets buried under ethics investigations and political fallout—will likely set the tone for how America approaches crypto regulation in the Trump era. Brian Quintenz Poised to Reshape CFTC Leadership as Trump’s Pick Moves to Senate Hearing Meanwhile, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner Brian Quintenz is now at the center of a significant regulatory shake-up, as President Trump’s nomination of the crypto-friendly policymaker to chair the CFTC has been formally scheduled for Senate review. The US Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry will hold a hearing on June 10 to consider Quintenz's appointment, which could trigger a sweeping reconstitution of the agency’s leadership. The CFTC, responsible for regulating US derivatives markets and increasingly influential in crypto oversight, has found itself in a transitional moment. With the departure of Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero at the end of May, only two of the five commissioner seats are currently occupied—by acting chair Caroline Pham and Commissioner Kristin Johnson. Both remaining commissioners have announced plans to exit later this year, paving the way for President Trump to fully remake the commission with a new slate of appointments. If confirmed, Brian Quintenz would become the first full-time CFTC chair under Trump’s current administration. The former commissioner is well known for his pro-innovation stance and for advocating the need for clear regulatory guidelines in digital asset markets. Since leaving the CFTC in 2021, Quintenz has served as the global head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z Crypto fund, where he played a key role in shaping Web3 lobbying efforts. Ahead of the hearing, Quintenz disclosed financial holdings in several crypto and financial market firms totaling approximately $3.4 million, raising potential conflict-of-interest questions. Observers note that these disclosures will likely be scrutinized during the confirmation process, though his experience and connections in both traditional finance and digital asset spaces are expected to be significant assets in leading the CFTC through a critical phase of industry evolution. Still, critics of the nomination argue that close ties to the crypto industry could compromise the agency's independence, especially as the CFTC’s jurisdiction over crypto derivatives, spot markets, and stablecoins continues to expand. On the other hand, industry insiders view Quintenz’s experience and policy clarity as much-needed attributes for an agency navigating a fast-changing financial ecosystem. CFTC Faces a Leadership Vacuum The potential confirmation of Quintenz could usher in one of the most dramatic leadership resets in the CFTC’s history. Since the departure of Chair Rostin Behnam in February, the commission has operated with interim leadership under Caroline Pham. With Mersinger and Romero stepping down, the panel has lost critical institutional memory and regulatory continuity. Acting chair Pham has announced her intention to return to the private sector after Quintenz’s potential confirmation, and Kristin Johnson has stated she too will depart by the end of the year. This exodus would effectively leave President Trump with the ability to nominate all five CFTC commissioners within a single year—an unprecedented opportunity to steer regulatory policy in a new direction. According to statutory rules, no more than three of the five commissioners may be from the same political party. With Quintenz as a Republican, Trump is expected to nominate two additional Republicans and two Democrats to maintain the mandated political balance. Each nominee must secure a majority Senate vote to be confirmed for a full five-year term or to serve the remainder of an existing term. The ripple effects of this leadership transition are already being felt. Summer Mersinger, who had been a strong voice for market structure modernization and DeFi clarity, was named CEO of the Blockchain Association on June 2. The organization is one of Washington’s most vocal crypto advocacy groups, signaling that Mersinger’s influence in shaping digital asset policy will continue outside government. Meanwhile, Christy Goldsmith Romero—who often took a more cautious stance on digital assets—has hinted that she will become more engaged in crypto policy efforts in a non-regulatory role. The move leaves a gap in the CFTC’s internal ideological diversity, as newer commissioners will likely reflect Trump’s deregulatory, pro-innovation preferences. Trump’s Long-Term Strategy? The prospect of Quintenz chairing a Trump-aligned CFTC as early as 2026 has sparked both anticipation and controversy. Supporters say that his return could provide long-term strategic vision and overdue clarity on crypto regulation, particularly in areas where the CFTC’s role overlaps with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Critics, however, worry that a complete leadership reset could tilt the agency too far in favor of industry interests, especially during a period of growing retail and institutional participation in digital markets. Nevertheless, for a White House that has increasingly leaned into the crypto sector—championing new spot ETFs, encouraging stablecoin innovation, and even pushing for a “strategic Bitcoin reserve”—Quintenz’s confirmation would mark yet another milestone in aligning US financial oversight with the priorities of the digital age. If all goes as expected at the June 10 hearing, Brian Quintenz may soon return to the CFTC—this time at its helm, and at the heart of the United States’ evolving digital financial architecture.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-05 05:30:00

The two held in-depth discussions on cryptocurrency adoption , focusing on potential collaboration between the United States and El Salvador in advancing BTC and digital asset initiatives. The meeting reflects growing efforts to shape international economic policy through joint strategies centered on Bitcoin and blockchain innovation. Bukele and Bo Hines spur the importance of collaborative Bitcoin actions Bo Hines emphasized a mutual commitment to strategic alliances supporting common goals of increased financial coordination. He praised El Salvador’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin, aligning with its earlier government policies and reaffirming its position as a global leader in the crypto space. The most immediate effect is an increased interest in the sovereign accumulation of Bitcoin and its potential effects on economic policy. Bo Hines appreciated the crypto’s transformative role in changing finance, specifically giving a shout-out to El Salvador for leading the change. El Salvador’s transformative role in cryptocurrency occurred in 2021 when President Bukele announced converting Bitcoin into legal currency . This led to a remarkable short-term increase in the digital asset’s price. It also led to current discussions focused on whether state-supported cryptocurrency can succeed. In an X post , Bo Hines mentioned having a great meeting with Bukele. He revealed that they talked about innovations in digital assets and their shared goal of shaping the future of global finance . Bo Hines acknowledged that President Bukele was making significant changes in the beautiful country of El Salvador. Bo Hines also highlighted that the federal government plans to keep all the current Bitcoin and will continuously work to gather more for a strategic reserve. The crypto community seems to have responded cautiously and positively after the meeting with some pundits, calling it a strategic partnership for future policy definition. The crypto world is still waiting for more details of the collaboration. Analysts in the market also noted continued support for sovereign Bitcoin strategies as they anticipate formal commitments toward reserve allocations. Bukele and Bo Hines pledged to make a mark in the finance world with BTC, the clearest sign yet of Bukele’s rapacious drive in El Salvador. According to data from CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,999.59, reflecting a 0.70% decrease in the past 24 hours. Analysts anticipate that the adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve could shape global financial Following analysts from reliable sources, further advocacy of BTC as a strategic reserve could potentially shape global financial and regulatory trends. According to analysts, President Bukele and Bo Hines’ meeting could spur other countries to consider similar policies that may influence technological evolution and market penetration through cryptocurrency solutions. Additionally, it underlines the remarkable power of Bitcoin to drive the future of financials. Just a day earlier, on June 4, Bo Hines welcomed Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), at the White House. They talked about cooperation on Bitcoin and digital assets. Pakistan is planning to build a cryptocurrency reserve. This meeting came on the heels of an announcement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who appointed Bilal Bin Saqib as Special Assistant on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. The move signals a broader trend of countries embracing crypto through coordinated, cross-border efforts. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Recent reports suggest BlackRock made a significant sale of Bitcoin, subsequently using a portion of the capital to acquire Ethereum (ETH). This potential shift in portfolio allocation by a major institutional player like BlackRock warrants a closer look, sparking debate within the Institutional Crypto space. What Does Recent BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Activity Show? According to reports from The Crypto Basic, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock recently engaged in notable trading activity. The report indicates a sale amounting to $561 million worth of Bitcoin. While the scale of this reported sale is substantial, the subsequent purchase focused on Ethereum. The same data suggests BlackRock purchased 27,241 ETH through Coinbase. At the time of the reported transaction, this Ethereum acquisition was valued at approximately $69.25 million. Crucially, The Crypto Basic highlighted that this $69.25 million figure reportedly matched the value of the net outflow of Bitcoin from addresses associated with BlackRock’s spot BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , IBIT, over the preceding two days. It’s important to note the distinction between the reported $561 million Bitcoin sale and the $69.25 million ETH purchase value. The report implies the $69.25 million ETH buy coincided with and equaled the value of recent net outflows from IBIT, suggesting a possible reallocation of capital, though not necessarily that the entire $561 million sale directly funded only the reported ETH purchase. Why Would BlackRock Consider Such a BlackRock Ethereum Purchase? The reported acquisition of a significant amount of Ethereum by an entity linked to BlackRock raises questions about the motivations behind such a move. While BlackRock is a major holder of Bitcoin through its highly successful IBIT fund, adding Ethereum to its portfolio, even in a smaller initial amount relative to its BTC holdings, could signal evolving institutional perspectives on digital assets beyond just Bitcoin. Several factors might influence an institutional player’s decision to buy Ethereum: Diversification: While both are cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum serve different primary functions. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold or a store of value, whereas Ethereum is the backbone of a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi. Adding ETH provides exposure to this different facet of the crypto market. Belief in Ethereum’s Ecosystem: Institutions may see long-term value in the growth and adoption of the Ethereum network and its smart contract capabilities, which power innovative financial and technological applications. Yield Opportunities: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, institutions can potentially earn yield through staking, a feature not available with Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism. Future Growth Potential: Some analysts believe Ethereum’s utility-driven nature could offer different growth trajectories compared to Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. This move, if part of a broader strategy, could indicate BlackRock exploring ways to offer clients exposure to the wider digital asset landscape, potentially anticipating future demand for diverse crypto products beyond a single asset like Bitcoin. Analyzing Bitcoin vs Ethereum for Institutional Portfolios For large institutions like BlackRock, the decision to allocate capital between Bitcoin vs Ethereum involves weighing different characteristics and risk profiles. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Narrative Store of Value, Digital Gold Programmable Blockchain, Fuel for dApps/DeFi Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Supply Capped (21 million) Issuance reduced significantly post-Merge, deflationary potential under certain conditions Ecosystem Focus on monetary policy, Layer 2 scaling (Lightning) Vast ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, dApps, Layer 2 scaling solutions (Optimistic/ZK Rollups) Regulatory Clarity (Relative) Generally viewed as a commodity in the US Status debated, some uncertainty remains Potential Yield None inherent (can lend) Staking yield available While Bitcoin offers a clearer, more established narrative as a digital reserve asset, Ethereum presents exposure to the innovation happening in decentralized finance and Web3. An Institutional Crypto strategy might involve holding both to capture different market dynamics. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market Analysis? Any significant move by a player as large as BlackRock is closely watched and analyzed within the Crypto Market Analysis landscape. While the reported ETH purchase value of $69.25 million is modest compared to BlackRock’s multi-billion dollar Bitcoin holdings via IBIT, the symbolic significance is potentially large. Validation for Ethereum: It could be interpreted as another step towards institutional acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate investment asset, potentially paving the way for future institutional inflows or even an eventual spot Ethereum ETF (though regulatory hurdles remain significant). Shifting Narratives: It might signal a growing institutional interest in the utility aspect of crypto, moving beyond just the store-of-value narrative dominated by Bitcoin. Market Sentiment: Positive sentiment around institutional adoption, especially from a name like BlackRock, can influence broader market perception and potentially attract further investment. However, it’s crucial not to overstate the impact of a single reported transaction. The $69.25 million ETH purchase represents a small fraction of BlackRock’s overall digital asset exposure through IBIT. Market participants should view this data point as one piece of a larger puzzle regarding institutional digital asset strategies. Challenges for BlackRock Ethereum Holdings and Other Institutions Despite the potential upsides, holding Ethereum comes with its own set of challenges for institutions: Regulatory Uncertainty: Unlike Bitcoin, the regulatory status of Ethereum in key jurisdictions like the United States is less clear. There is ongoing debate about whether ETH should be classified as a security or a commodity, which impacts how it can be offered and held by regulated entities. Technical Complexity: Engaging with Ethereum’s ecosystem, including staking for yield, involves technical infrastructure and expertise that differs from simply holding Bitcoin. Market Volatility: While both assets are volatile, ETH’s price can be influenced by factors specific to its ecosystem’s growth and challenges, adding another layer of complexity. These challenges are likely reasons why institutional adoption of Ethereum in regulated products like ETFs has lagged behind Bitcoin. Actionable Insights from the Institutional Crypto Landscape For individual investors watching these institutional moves, the reported BlackRock activity offers a few insights: Pay Attention to Diversification: Institutions often diversify their holdings. Consider how both Bitcoin and Ethereum might fit into your own investment strategy based on your goals and risk tolerance. Stay Informed on Regulation: Regulatory developments, particularly regarding Ethereum, will likely be a major catalyst or impediment for future institutional adoption. Understand the Use Cases: Appreciate the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum beyond just price action. Their underlying technologies and ecosystems drive their long-term value propositions. While you shouldn’t blindly follow institutional trades, understanding their strategies can provide valuable context for your own market analysis. Summary: A Glimpse into Evolving Institutional Strategies The report detailing BlackRock’s sale of Bitcoin and subsequent purchase of Ethereum provides a fascinating glimpse into the evolving strategies of major financial institutions in the digital asset space. While the reported ETH purchase amount is relatively small compared to their vast Bitcoin holdings via the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , IBIT, the move signals potential interest in diversifying into Ethereum. This development is a key data point for anyone conducting Crypto Market Analysis and watching the broader trend of Institutional Crypto adoption. As the digital asset landscape matures, we may see more institutions exploring assets beyond Bitcoin, potentially reshaping the dynamics between Bitcoin vs Ethereum in institutional portfolios and the market at large.

The venture capitalist has been sticking to his earlier price prediction of $250,000 for Bitcoin, although this time, he listed several factors that would drive the price up. He said that the world’s largest crypto might surpass “infinite against the dollar,” a prediction that he already made last month . The US dollar wouldn’t exist in 10 years, as Bitcoin would replace it, he added. “On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year,” he wrote on X, Wednesday. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: → General optimism… pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 Tim Draper first predicted this level in 2018, originally targeting 2022. The timeline did not materialize as 2022 was a brutal year for crypto, defined by the collapse of FTX exchange and a deeper winter market. Trump Trade Deals, Regulatory Frameworks, Web3 Apps to Foster BTC Price: Tim Draper The American billionaire listed several major factors that would push the price of Bitcoin to that level of his prediction. He stated that there is “general optimism” as President Trump continues to work out trade deals. A significant catalyst emerged recently, when Trump’s Media & Technology Group announced that it is one step closer to launching its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund . Another factor highlighted by Tim Draper includes incoming crypto regulatory frameworks in the US. On May 19, the U.S. Senate took a key step toward regulating stablecoins by advancing the GENIUS Act with a bipartisan vote of 66-32 . On the other hand, Republican lawmakers are pushing forward with the ‘ Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 ,’ backed by bipartisan support. This comprehensive bill is aimed at establishing clear rules for the US crypto market. Tim Draper noted that Web3 apps built on the Bitcoin blockchain is another factor that would drive BTC price up. “Plus banks are adding it to their offerings. Even longtime holdout JPMorgan plans to offer it soon,” he wrote. Businesses Explore Bitcoin, Bringing it to Mainstream Draper stressed that Bitcoin is an “extremely low risk” asset when compared to other cryptoassets and stocks as “people believe in it.” “It’s earning the title of a store of value,” he said, adding that businesses are piling in, exploring the asset in many ways and bringing it mainstream. Per Bitcoin Treasuries , Saylor’s Strategy tops among companies holding BTC, with more than 580,000 BTC, valued at $61 billion. Additionally, “Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum,” said Tim Draper. “The smart money sees what comes next.” The post Billionaire VC Tim Draper Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $250,000 This Year appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Tim Draper,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-05 05:42:52

We should be in the final year of the four-year trend, but corporations are buying more than ever, they said, adding that the asset price is “boring people.” While Bitcoin typically experiences explosive growth in its “third green year,” 2025 has seen more measured movements with sideways trading. However, this signals a crucial transition rather than a broken cycle, the analysts argued. Bitcoin Cycle Pattern Shift Under the surface, “a massive shift is playing out,” they said, adding that some long-time holders are cashing out above $100,000. Still, there are new buyers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitcoin treasury companies , and corporations building strategic long-term positions, and “they’re not here to sell.” “People less committed to the long term are exiting… and a whole new class of investors is entering,” said Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor. This represents a “rotation into stronger hands” from individual speculators to institutional allocators who view Bitcoin as a permanent balance sheet asset. Something strange is happening with this Bitcoin cycle. We should be in the final year of the 4-year trend. Corporations are buying more than ever. But the price? It’s boring people. Here’s why we could be witnessing the final Bitcoin rotation before everything changes. pic.twitter.com/rcJWLFQZjP — Swan (@Swan) June 4, 2025 The analysts also highlighted a generational wealth transfer, with Millennials entering peak earning years and choosing Bitcoin over traditional assets like their predecessors chose gold or stocks. Combined with concerning macro signals such as a weakening dollar amid rising bond yields, this creates conditions for potential explosive price movement as the tradeable supply shrinks , they stated before concluding this was a “final rotation” and adding: “So if you’re selling now, understand this: You’re likely handing your Bitcoin to an institution or entity that plans to hold it indefinitely.” Glassnode echoed the sentiment, stating that entity-adjusted unspent realized price distribution “shows a clear institutional skew in the Bitcoin market over the past 6 months.” Entity-adjusted URPD shows a clear institutional skew in the #Bitcoin market over the past 6 months.

If Pi breaks above this resistance, it could rise. Pi coin may continue to trade sideways unless there are positive catalysts. Analyst Dr Altcoin predicts that it could fall to $0.40 if the core team does not address these issues.

As AI’s influence continues to grow, impacting sectors like finance and cryptocurrency, platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are rolling out significant updates aimed squarely at the enterprise user. These new ChatGPT business features signal a strong move towards making AI an indispensable part of the daily workflow, offering powerful new capabilities for accessing, analyzing, and utilizing company data. Expanding Reach with ChatGPT Integrations One of the most impactful additions to ChatGPT for business users is the introduction of robust integrations with popular cloud storage services. This allows ChatGPT to access and process information stored within an organization’s existing files and documents. Imagine being able to query your company’s entire knowledge base just by asking ChatGPT. The newly added connectors include: Dropbox Box SharePoint OneDrive Google Drive This capability is a game-changer for tasks requiring access to internal data. For instance, a financial analyst could leverage ChatGPT to sift through company reports, presentations, and spreadsheets stored in Google Drive or SharePoint to quickly draft an investment thesis, citing specific documents. OpenAI emphasizes that these integrations respect existing organizational access controls, ensuring data security and compliance. Seamless Workflow: AI Meeting Recording and Transcription Meeting management has become a central focus for productivity tools, and ChatGPT is now stepping into this arena with its own AI meeting recording and transcription features. This brings a crucial, table-stakes functionality to the platform, allowing users to capture meeting audio and convert it into text. Beyond simple transcription, the feature offers intelligent capabilities: Generates concise notes with timestamped citations linking back to the original audio. Suggests actionable items identified during the discussion. Allows users to query the meeting notes, just like they can query integrated documents. Enables conversion of action items directly into a Canvas document, OpenAI’s tool for collaborative projects. This move positions ChatGPT in direct competition with established players like Zoom and ClickUp, as well as newer entrants like Notion, which have also integrated similar AI-powered meeting summarization features. The ability to easily search meeting content and turn discussions into tangible tasks significantly streamlines post-meeting workflows. Driving Deeper Insights with Advanced Research For professionals needing to conduct thorough research leveraging various data sources, ChatGPT is enhancing its capabilities with new deep research connectors. Currently in beta, these integrations connect ChatGPT to specialized tools and platforms, enabling more comprehensive data analysis. Initial beta connectors include: HubSpot Linear Select Microsoft tools Select Google tools By pulling information from these sources, combined with web data, users can instruct ChatGPT to prepare detailed research reports. This is particularly valuable for market analysis, project planning, or customer insights. Furthermore, OpenAI is introducing support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing users to connect ChatGPT to other compatible tools specifically for deep research purposes. MCP support is available for Pro, Team, and Enterprise users, while the standard connectors are accessible to all paid users. How Do These Updates Position OpenAI Enterprise? The introduction of these comprehensive ChatGPT integrations and features underscores OpenAI’s clear strategy: to make ChatGPT an indispensable tool within the enterprise workspace. By integrating with core business applications and workflows – from document management and meeting collaboration to deep research – OpenAI is embedding its AI directly into the operational fabric of companies. This aggressive push positions OpenAI enterprise offerings strongly against emerging competitors in the AI productivity space. While startups are also developing AI-powered office tools, OpenAI benefits from a significant first-mover advantage and a massive existing user base. The company recently reported that three million companies are already utilizing its enterprise-focused products, a substantial increase from earlier figures. This rapid adoption rate suggests that businesses are eager to incorporate powerful AI capabilities into their daily operations, and OpenAI is well-positioned to capture this demand with its expanding suite of tools. Boosting Overall AI Productivity Tools These updates are not just about adding features; they represent a significant leap forward for the category of AI productivity tools as a whole. By combining conversational AI with direct access to organizational data and workflows, ChatGPT is becoming a central hub for information retrieval, analysis, and action within a business. The ability to seamlessly transition from searching documents to summarizing meetings to generating research reports within a single interface powered by AI fundamentally changes how knowledge workers can operate. For businesses operating in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, where data analysis and rapid decision-making are crucial, these advanced AI tools offer compelling advantages. Streamlining research, improving communication through better meeting management, and making internal data instantly accessible can provide a competitive edge. The growing interest in AI within the crypto space is also evident in dedicated events like Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, highlighting the convergence of these technologies. A Compelling Step Forward OpenAI’s latest update for ChatGPT business users is a significant step towards creating a truly integrated AI assistant for the workplace. The introduction of cloud storage connectors, AI meeting recording, deep research capabilities, and MCP support addresses key business needs, making it easier for teams to access information, collaborate effectively, and gain deeper insights from their data. As AI continues to mature, these types of integrations will become increasingly vital for businesses seeking to enhance efficiency and unlock new levels of productivity.

As a result, K Wave’s stock jumped 162% after announcing a $500 million crypto-focused share issuance. While this growing wave of corporate Bitcoin accumulation mirrors Metaplanet and Strategy’s playbook, Standard Chartered warned of potential risks, including valuation bubbles and future sell pressure if prices fall. Semler Scientific Bets Bigger on Bitcoin Medical technology company Semler Scientific continued to double down on its Bitcoin investment strategy with a new $20 million purchase of 185 BTC between May 23 and June 3. This latest acquisition brings Semler’s total Bitcoin holdings to 4,449 BTC, which was bought at an average price of $107,974 per coin. As of June 3, the company’s total investment in Bitcoin reached $410 million, with a market value of roughly $472.9 million. This is a 26.7% increase since Semler began accumulating the cryptocurrency in May of 2024. The new investment was disclosed in a June 4 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company previously added $50 million to its Bitcoin treasury in May and reported a separate $10 million BTC acquisition spread between February and April. Semler Scientific YTD stock price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite these purchases, Semler’s strategy has not resulted in a strong boost in investor confidence. Year-to-date, the company’s stock is down 33%, according to Google Finance. Still, since its initial Bitcoin strategy pivot announcement on May 29, 2024, its share price managed a modest 16% recovery. This could mean that investor sentiment remains cautious but somewhat responsive to Bitcoin’s performance. Across the broader market, firms betting on Bitcoin reserves are experiencing mixed results. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has seen its share price climb 33% in 2025, while Japan-based Metaplanet’s stock soared by an impressive 265%. Bitcoin itself experienced a lot of volatility this year. While it is up 11.8% year-to-date and reached a record high of $112,000, it also faced sharp pullbacks by dipping below $77,000 due to macroeconomic concerns and trade tensions. BTC holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that around 3.4 million BTC are currently held in various treasuries. Exchange-traded funds and public companies account for the majority of these holdings, followed by national governments. K Wave Media Stock Soars on Bitcoin Pivot Meanwhile, South Korean entertainment powerhouse K Wave Media also recently took a bold leap into the world of digital assets by unveiling a major Bitcoin-centric strategy funded through a large securities purchase agreement. According to a June 4 announcement , the company secured a deal with Bitcoin Strategic Reserve KWM for the sale of up to $500 million in ordinary shares. The proceeds of this sale will be earmarked for building a crypto treasury heavily focused on Bitcoin. Co-interim CEO Ted Kim explained the philosophical foundation behind the move, and stated that embedding Bitcoin into the company's core strategy reflects a commitment to decentralization, agility, and creating future-facing value. This pivot is very similar to the playbook of Japanese firm Metaplanet, whose share price skyrocketed after adopting a similar Bitcoin reserve model. The influence of these kinds of firms seems to be reshaping corporate finance in Asia, with K Wave Media now aiming to position itself as the “Metaplanet of Korea.” K Wave Media stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Market reaction to the announcement was very quick. After the announcement was made, K Wave Media’s stock surged by 162% on Nasdaq, reaching $5.04. This means that there is certainly some investor enthusiasm around the company’s new direction. Since then, the company’s stock dropped back to a price of $4.48. The proceeds from the share issuance will be directed primarily toward the purchasing, long-term holding, and yield optimization of Bitcoin, though the company also indicated potential interest in other cryptocurrencies. Beyond treasury accumulation, K Wave Media’s broader vision includes operating Bitcoin Lightning Network nodes and investing in the infrastructure that is necessary to reward on-chain activity and drive decentralization. Overall, these moves aim to deepen the company’s integration into the Bitcoin ecosystem and further solidify its digital asset footprint. Part of K Wave’s announcement In addition to its crypto treasury initiative, K Wave Media also plans to leverage the funding for mergers and acquisitions to boost its core entertainment and K-POP ventures. The fusion of digital assets with cultural exports places K Wave Media at the forefront of a growing list of public companies that are embracing Bitcoin as a strategic financial reserve. Standard Chartered Warns of Bitcoin Treasury Risks The trend of publicly traded companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset continues to grow as there are now 61 firms holding a combined 673,897 BTC, or 3.2% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. This is according to a report by Standard Chartered. The data was shared on June 3 by the bank’s global head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, and it revealed both the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin accumulation and the emerging risks tied to this strategy. Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin report Kendrick explained that while corporate Bitcoin treasuries are currently contributing to buying pressure, they could eventually become a source of downside price risk and increased volatility. One of the reasons for this is that 50% of these companies purchased Bitcoin at an average price of more than $90,000. This is far above the average acquisition price of Strategy’s massive 580,955 BTC reserve, which was obtained at around $70,023 per coin. If Bitcoin experiences another extended downturn, many of these new holders could find themselves underwater, which could trigger sell pressure. Standard Chartered’s analysis also pointed out that 58 of the 61 companies studied have net asset value (NAV) multiples above 1. This means that their market valuation exceeds the value of their underlying assets. While this may currently be sustained by market inefficiencies like regulatory limitations and institutional hesitance, Kendrick warned that once these inefficiencies diminish, the valuations could adjust unfavorably. Interestingly, Kendrick also shared that “Strategy imitators” have greatly increased their pace of acquisition by doubling their collective holdings from under 50,000 BTC to about 100,000 BTC in just two months. Though Strategy itself added 74,000 BTC during the same period, the volume and speed of purchases from new entrants caught his attention. New companies continue to join the movement. On June 3, Canadian renewable energy firm SolarBank disclosed its Bitcoin treasury plans, including the opening of a Coinbase Prime account for custody and stablecoin services. On the same day, Paris-based Blockchain Group announced a $68 million Bitcoin acquisition, and Norwegian brokerage K33 revealed a $6.2 million raise to purchase BTC in late May. Although Standard Chartered’s study included 61 public companies, the broader data from BitcoinTreasuries.net suggests over 124 companies are currently holding Bitcoin. This includes a growing number of international firms seeking to emulate Strategy’s high-profile approach. Despite the concerns that were raised, people like Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, remain steadfast. Saylor insists that even in a scenario where Bitcoin’s value drops by 90% for several years, Strategy’s capital structure will remain resilient enough to withstand the downturn. Similarly, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao weighed in on the topic by saying that while adopting Bitcoin carries risks, the greater risk lies in avoiding risk altogether.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-05 05:52:31

On June 3, the Cardano price tried to break out of the region, but bulls failed to sustain the uptrend. The price of Cardano has bounced off the $0.68 level and is trying to go up again. If successful, the Cardano price could skyrocket to $1 in the coming weeks. Lucky notes the Cardano price might rally to $1.6 in the coming weeks. The analyst thinks that the Cardano price is ready for a big move very soon. According to CoinMarketCap data, the ADA price has dropped 9.9% on the weekly timeframe. It is also down 7.8% on the biweekly chart, signifying strong bearish pressure. Ripple (XRP) Price Eyes Breakout as Double Bottom Pattern Gains Strength The Ripple price is on the verge of confirming a powerful bullish pattern, says top analyst Egrag Crypto. He says a strong close above $2.30 on the 3-day chart and a close above the 21 EMA would confirm a double-bottom formation. This is a pattern that often leads to a major upside for the Ripple price. The Ripple price could target some key levels at $2.50, $2.65, and even $3.00 in the short term if confirmed. Bulls have been defending the crucial support zone at $2.07, and the price of Ripple has shown resilience. Holding above this level maintains the bullish structure and sets the stage for further Ripple price momentum. The XRP price has been building strength, and this technical setup could act as the trigger for the next surge. Presently, the Ripple price has been on an uptrend since the start of the month. The Ripple price has risen from $2.10 to $2.28, according to CoinMarketCap data. Unilabs (UNIL): Harnessing AI to Revolutionize DeFi Investment Unilabs (UNIL) is a cutting-edge DeFi platform that combines AI with blockchain technology to offer investors a smart, automated way to grow their crypto portfolios. Unilabs uses advanced AI algorithms to continuously monitor market conditions, social sentiment, and on-chain data, optimizing asset allocations across multiple investment funds for maximum returns and minimized risk. The platform has four AI-managed funds: the AI Fund focuses on promising AI and tech projects, the BTC Fund invests in Bitcoin and related assets, the Real-World Assets (RWA) Fund tokenizes traditional assets for diversified exposure, and the Mining Fund invests in crypto mining ventures for steady yield. The multi-fund structure enables the investors to have different risk appetites and market opportunities, all managed by AI. Unilabs’ AI engine acts as an autonomous portfolio manager, making real-time adjustments based on rigorous data analysis, reducing emotional bias and guesswork that often plague investors. This level of automation makes Unilabs attractive to both seasoned traders and newcomers seeking passive income streams. Presently, Unilabs’ crypto ICO is ongoing raising north of $2.2 million, and the UNIL token is trading at $0.0062. Experts predict that if Unilabs captures just 0.1% of the DeFi space, which is projected to surpass $232 billion by 2030, its token price could soar to $0.5, representing a massive return for early investors. The Top Crypto Coins To Watch in June The Cardano price is looking at a rally above $1.00, while Ripple could soar to $3.00. However, Unilabs could offer higher returns based on its low market cap. Its AI-powered portfolio management and passive income generation are unparalleled in the DeFi market. Early investors in Unilabs could benefit from huge returns as the project continues to grow.

The police also revealed that the breach cost the hosting company over $4.5 million in damages. After gaining access to the accounts, the suspect allegedly deployed unauthorized virtual machines and crypto miners using the company’s servers, which is commonly referred to as cryptojacking.

According to the authorities, the individual has gained access to the servers of those firms since at least 2018. The threat actor allegedly changed locations to avoid being tracked down. The Ukrainian authorities revealed that he lived in the regions of Poltava, Zaporizhzia, and Dnipropetrovsk during the past years. “In particular, the defendant illegally gained access to over 5,000 customer accounts of an international hosting company that provides server rental services for the operation of various websites and online platforms.” – Ukraine’s National Police . The police found that the perpetrator began unauthorized deployment of virtual machines using the company’s server resources after gaining access to the accounts. Authorities also revealed that the suspect utilized the accounts to mine digital assets on the hosting provider’s servers, resulting in damages estimated to be approximately $4.5M. The police also seized computer equipment, mobile phones, bank cards, and other forms of physical evidence during the raid at the individual’s residence. A preliminary examination of the confiscated materials validated that the suspect maintained multiple accounts on hacker forums. The authorities revealed that the seized evidence links the hacker to stolen email credentials and cryptocurrency wallets that held the illegally mined digital assets. The materials also included software scripts used for launching and managing mining activity as well as tools for conducting data theft and remote access. The individual now faces charges under Part 5 of Article 361 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which could bring a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment plus three years of probation to engage in certain activities deemed risky. The culprit could also face a ban on holding certain positions, such as those in IT and communications, or engaging in certain activities where the convicted person could access communication systems or networks for up to three years. Ukrainian police said a pre-trial investigation is still underway, and new evidence may add more charges to the suspect. Europol teams up with Ukrainian police to arrest cryptojacking suspect In January last year, the Ukrainian authorities and Europol also made a joint arrest of an individual in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, suspected of involvement in a complex cryptojacking scheme. The police revealed that the 29-year-old allegedly hacked accounts to create 1 million virtual servers, allowing him to mine over $2 million worth of digital assets illegally. The police stated that the suspect hacked 1,500 accounts belonging to an unnamed company’s clients, using a technique known as brute force – self-developed software for automatic password selection. The suspect then used the compromised accounts to gain access to the cloud computing provider, secretly infecting the company’s server with malicious software. The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation revealed that an unnamed cloud provider helped with the investigation, ultimately leading to the individual’s identity and location. The individual approached Europol in January 2023 with crucial information about compromised cloud user accounts. According to the government agency, authorities searched three properties to gather evidence against the suspect, and the arrest took place after months of investigations. Europol said it set up a command post that supported the Ukrainian National Police from Europol’s headquarters. Europol warned cloud users to implement robust security practices to protect themselves against cloud cryptojacking. The government agency also recommends regular security updates and patches, as well as the use of cloud security services and tools provided by cloud service providers to enhance security.

The cryptocurrency has been rejected from this area since last month’s market recovery, failing to continue its bullish rally. As its price continues its sideways trajectory, an analyst suggests that a 15% move is coming. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Face ‘One Last Speed Bump’ Before Rally To $140,000 – Analyst Ethereum Price Compressing Within Key Levels Since its early May breakout, Ethereum has been trading between the $2,475-$2,680 price range, failing to turn the range’s upper boundary as support for nearly a month. Amid last week’s market pullback, the cryptocurrency retraced around 11% from its three-month high of $2,788 to the range’s lower boundary, bouncing from this area on Monday. At the start of the week, ETH reclaimed the $2,500 mark and continued its recovery rally toward the $2,600 resistance. On Wednesday, the King of Altcoins saw a 3.2% daily surge toward the local range high resistance before retracing to the $2,635 level. Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted the cryptocurrency’s recent performance, affirming that Ethereum is “showing confidence” by staying inside a key formation in the daily timeframe. According to the chart, Ethereum has been forming an ascending triangle since the May rally, with the upper line around the $2,680-$2,700 mark. Moreover, ETH’s price has been compressing between the support and resistance lines, suggesting a potential 15% move if the price breaks out of the pattern. Runefelt forecasted a surge toward the $3,100 level if the Altcoin reclaims the crucial resistance level. However, if the price is rejected once again from this level, the analyst considers that Ethereum could drop to the $2,300 support zone. Crypto Bullet pointed out a similar pattern on multiple ETH charts, suggesting that a 15%-20% breakout is imminent for the cryptocurrency. Per the post, the ETH Dominance is “about to break out” from an ascending triangle pattern in the 12H chart, while the ETH/BTC and ETH/USD trading pairs are nearing the upper boundary of a one-month symmetrical pattern. ETH Preparing For Liftoff? Analyst Crypto Jelle asserted that once ETH reclaims the major resistance area, between $2,680-$2,850, “everything flies higher.” Notably, a reclaim of this zone would send the cryptocurrency above its multi-year ascending support trendline, which was along amid the Q1 2025 retraces, and set the stage for a surge toward the cycle highs. Meanwhile, Ted Pillows noted that ETH’s performance this cycle resembles Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action in 2020. According to the analyst, Ethereum has formed four consecutive 2-week candles since the April 7 bottom, which mimics BTC’s movement after the March 2020 crash. “The similarities between BTC 2020 and ETH 2025 are just mind-blowing,” he stated, suggesting that Ethereum could reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months if it continues to follow BTC’s 2020-2021 trajectory.

The AI Journaling App Rosebud has successfully closed a Seed Funding round, securing $6 million to significantly enhance its platform focused on self-reflection and personal development. What is the Rosebud App and How Does AI Help? At its core, the Rosebud App is designed to be more than just a digital diary. It leverages sophisticated AI technology to act as a personalized mentor. Users input their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through journaling. The AI then analyzes these entries over time, identifying recurring themes, patterns, and potential areas for growth. Instead of just storing text, the AI provides insightful questions, gentle guidance, and prompts to encourage deeper self-understanding. The company’s mission is to emulate the supportive role of a human mentor, helping users to understand themselves better, build positive habits, and track their personal goals effectively. Since its launch, the platform has seen considerable engagement, with users having journaled over 500 million words and spending more than 30 million minutes interacting with the app. This usage demonstrates a clear demand for tools that facilitate self-exploration. Behind the Rosebud App: Founders and Vision Rosebud was founded in 2023 by Chrys Bader and Sean Dadashi. Bader, a Y Combinator alumnus, previously co-founded the app Secret. Dadashi holds a degree in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley. Their paths crossed in a men’s group, and their shared experiences with personal therapy and coaching sparked the idea for Rosebud. They recognized that personal growth is highly individual. As Bader explained in an interview, people have different emotional languages and communication styles. AI offers an unprecedented ability to provide personalized support at scale. One user might benefit from validation and a gentle approach, while another might prefer a more direct, challenging style. AI allows the app to adapt its interaction style based on the individual’s shared content, offering a level of personalized coaching that was previously difficult to scale. Scaling AI Personal Growth: How the Funding Will Be Used The $6 million Seed Funding round was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from notable investors including 776, Initialized Capital, Fuel Capital, Avenir, and Tim Ferriss. This investment is earmarked for several key areas as Rosebud seeks to scale its impact: Expanding the current team, particularly hiring engineering and product talent to enhance the app’s capabilities. Investing further in proprietary memory technology that allows the AI to better understand and reference a user’s long-term journey. Building out new features within the app to offer more tools for personal development. Increasing marketing efforts to reach more users seeking AI Personal Growth tools. Exploring partnerships with schools, businesses, and clinics to make the AI Journaling App more widely accessible. The founders emphasize that Rosebud is not intended to replace professional therapy but rather to broaden access to quality mentorship and self-reflection tools. The Future of AI Mentorship Looking ahead, Bader and Dadashi envision Rosebud evolving into a long-term partner for users on their personal journeys. This includes developing strategic, long-term engagement plans tailored to significant life events. For example, if a user is preparing for fatherhood, the app could curate personalized content, journaling prompts, and resources relevant to that specific milestone. Dadashi highlighted the transformative potential of AI Mentorship : the ability for everyone to have access to something that genuinely thinks about their well-being and is aligned with their aspirations. Having benefited from mentorship himself, he sees AI as enabling this valuable support system to be universally available in a way that was previously impossible. The Rosebud App operates on a freemium model. Basic journaling features are available for free. A premium subscription, priced at $12.99 per month, unlocks advanced features such as long-term memory recall by the AI and alternative interaction modes like voice and call options. The app is accessible via web browsers and is available on both iOS and Android platforms. Conclusion Rosebud’s successful $6 million Seed Funding round underscores growing investor confidence in the intersection of AI and personal wellness. By leveraging AI to provide personalized insights and guidance, the AI Journaling App is positioning itself as a significant tool for AI Personal Growth and accessible AI Mentorship . As the company expands its team and technology, it aims to make the benefits of structured self-reflection and personalized support available to a broader audience, helping individuals navigate their journeys toward becoming their best selves.

The proceeds from this financing will be used to support the company’s Bitcoin (BTC)-focused digital asset reserve strategy, working capital, and M&A activities, as well as expanding its content production and K-POP businesses. As part of the strategic plan, K Wave will invest the majority of the funding raised for the purpose of long-term holding of Bitcoin under certain restrictions and optimization of returns. Thus, K Wave will become one of the first public media companies in the world to integrate BTC directly into its core fund management.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/june-10-could-cement-xrp-as-radical-form-of-commodity-money-heres-what-is-coming/,"In a recent tweet, crypto researcher SMQKE highlighted the upcoming review of the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on June 10. He pinpoints why the bill is vital for XRP and related cryptocurrencies. The Act, introduced on May 29, seeks to shift regulatory oversight of most cryptocurrencies from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by classifying them as “digital commodities.” If passed, this legislation will significantly reshape crypto regulation, with possible implications for assets like XRP. The CLARITY Act also mandates brokers to segregate customer funds and disclose any conflicts of interest, reinforcing investor protections while transitioning regulatory jurisdiction. Market participants and legal observers, particularly those focused on XRP, which has long been at the center of regulatory ambiguity, closely watch its possible passage. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which will finally classify qualified cryptocurrencies as commodities, is set to be considered on June 10th by the House Financial Services Committee. Remember, “XRP IS A RADICAL FORM OF COMMODITY MONEY”. XRP was once advertised as… pic.twitter.com/fCAne4Bhxl — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 3, 2025 XRP’s Origins and Design Support Commodity Classification In the same tweet, SMQKE shared two documented sources emphasizing XRP’s classification as a commodity. One of them, a published excerpt from 2013, describes XRP as “a radical form of commodity money” and further states that XRP “is like gold in your hands.” The description highlights that XRP was designed to be the most liquid asset on the XRP Ledger. The excerpt also reiterates that XRP has no central issuer, cannot be frozen, and can be transferred between any two addresses, further distancing it from the characteristics of securities and reinforcing its commodity-like nature. The other image attached to the tweet outlines the intent behind the CLARITY Act and reinforces that cryptocurrencies meeting certain criteria would be reclassified as commodities under the CFTC’s oversight. According to SMQKE, XRP fits this definition and should be treated accordingly under the proposed legislation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Garlinghouse: XRP Exists Independently of Ripple The regulatory case for XRP as a commodity has been further bolstered by statements from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. As reported in a previous article by Times Tabloid and recently resurfaced by crypto commentator Xaif, Garlinghouse emphasized that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) predates Ripple itself. In the shared post, Garlinghouse is quoted stating, “Certainly, we are an interested party in the success of the XRP Ledger, for sure—we own a lot of XRP. However, it’s like saying Exxon owns a lot of oil. That doesn’t make oil a security. Oil, of course, is classified as a commodity.” Garlinghouse’s comparison directly addresses one of the central legal debates around XRP—whether its relationship with Ripple , the company, renders it a security. His assertion that XRP exists as a neutral digital asset, much like a natural resource, lends further weight to its treatment as a commodity. This position is consistent with arguments made during Ripple’s ongoing legal battles with the SEC. Implications for XRP’s Regulatory Future The timing of this debate is critical. The CLARITY Act, by proposing a legislative framework that distinguishes digital assets based on their structure and use, could help end years of legal and regulatory confusion surrounding XRP. SMQKE’s tweet aligns with a growing narrative in the crypto space that XRP, due to its decentralized origins, design as a medium of exchange, and absence of issuer-based control, belongs in the category of digital commodities.

One of the top contenders making waves is Remittix (RTX) . Backed by real-world use cases, a fast-growing presale, and game-changing PayFi infrastructure, Remittix is emerging as a serious rival. With deep-pocket investors already accumulating, RTX now ranks among the best crypto to buy for those eyeing the next explosive breakout. XRP’s big bet: Can Ripple’s real-world deals push the token toward $10? XRP’s price action has remained shaky throughout the year, struggling to hold momentum after hitting a $3 peak in January. As of June 4th, XRP is trading at $2.23, facing pressure from mild bearish sentiment. However, this trend may be shifting. XRP continues to hold above its 200-day Simple Moving Average, which is often considered a sign of brewing upside potential. Traders and analysts are watching closely, expecting a potential rebound if current support levels stay intact. Source: CoinMarketCap The renewed bullish sentiment isn’t just technical—a series of major developments from the Ripple Foundation are driving it. One of the biggest headlines is the $100 million XRP buy-in from BitGo on behalf of energy firm VivoPower. That’s not all. Ripple’s strategic partnership with Dubai’s land department is live, enabling real estate tokenization worth $16 billion. Investors can gain exposure to premium properties for as little as $500, signaling Ripple’s deeper push into real-world assets. Additionally, the SEC has started reviewing WisdomTree’s XRP ETF proposal. This move could help legitimize the token further in traditional finance. While hitting $10 remains speculative, it’s clear XRP is no longer just a payment token—it’s becoming a major infrastructure player. Remittix is leading the charge in crypto-to-fiat innovation Remittix is quickly becoming the breakout name in PayFi, catching the attention of crypto investors looking for real utility. The RTX token is at the heart of its ecosystem, selling at $0.0781 during presale. Analysts predict a staggering 200x growth once it lists. This isn’t just hype. Remittix is solving a long-standing problem in global finance: how to move from crypto to local currency without stress, delay, or high costs. Source: Remittix.io Its standout feature is the PayFi protocol, a blockchain-based system that allows users to send crypto and receive fiat directly into bank accounts. With support for over 30 fiat currencies and compatibility with 40+ crypto assets—including stablecoins—Remittix is built for mass adoption. Even those unfamiliar with crypto can use it easily, making it perfect for freelancers, migrants, startups, and global businesses. For enterprises, the Remittix Pay API offers unmatched flexibility, allowing businesses to accept crypto and settle in local currencies. The merchant portal adds complete control over conversion timing and payment methods, and supports 50+ trading pairs. On the tech side, Remittix is already running on Ethereum smart contracts, with its non-custodial wallet entering beta in Q3 2025. Conclusion The presale numbers speak volumes: over $15.5 million raised, nearly 20,000 investors onboard, and more than 541 million RTX tokens sold. Remittix is building the infrastructure for tomorrow’s borderless payments. With momentum accelerating, this could be a great chance to get in early on the best crypto to buy now.

For those following the convergence of AI and user-generated content, especially within platforms that could eventually intersect with Web3 concepts or the creator economy, Snap’s latest move is noteworthy. The company, known for its innovative approach to AR, has just launched standalone versions of its Lens Studio , bringing powerful AR creation tools to more people than ever before. This development democratizes AR creation , moving it beyond the domain of professional developers. Introducing Lens Studio: Simplified AR Creation for Everyone Snap’s announcement on Wednesday marked the release of a dedicated Lens Studio iOS application and a complementary web-based tool. These new platforms are specifically engineered to lower the barrier to entry for creating augmented reality Lenses for Snapchat. Previously, Lens Studio was exclusively available as a desktop application, primarily utilized by professional developers and experienced creators. The core idea behind these new tools is simplicity and accessibility. Snap aims to enable individuals of varying technical skill levels to design and publish their own AR experiences directly from their mobile devices or web browsers. This expansion is a clear signal of Snap’s commitment to fostering a broader community of AR creators. What Can You Do with the New Lens Studio Tools? The new iOS app and web tool pack several engaging features designed for ease of use: AI Effects Generation: Users can now generate unique AI-powered effects directly within the app using simple text prompts. This allows for rapid prototyping of creative ideas. Bitmoji Integration: Easily add your personalized Bitmoji avatar into Lenses, enabling more personal and expressive creations. Imagine your Bitmoji dancing in your living room or reacting to your surroundings. Trending Templates: Access and customize a library of trending templates, providing a starting point for popular Lens styles and making it simple to put your own spin on what’s popular. Simple Editing: The interfaces are designed to be intuitive, allowing users to manipulate elements, add effects, and refine their Lenses without needing extensive technical knowledge. While the professional desktop version of Lens Studio will remain the go-to tool for complex and advanced AR projects, these new accessible tools are set to dramatically increase the number of people actively creating Snapchat AR Lenses . Snap’s Vision for Snapchat AR and Creator Growth Snap has long been recognized as a leader in the augmented reality space, largely thanks to its pioneering work with AR filters and Lenses on Snapchat. The company has built a substantial ecosystem, currently boasting over 400,000 professional AR developers. However, with the introduction of these simplified tools, Snap is clearly targeting a much larger audience – anyone with a creative idea and a smartphone. This strategy contrasts with moves by some competitors; notably, Meta shut down its Spark AR platform last year, which had allowed third parties to build AR effects for its platforms. By opening up AR creation tools, Snap is doubling down on its belief in the potential of augmented reality and the importance of a vibrant creator community. Snap’s investment in AR is not limited to beginner tools. The company recently released advanced tools for professionals, including features specifically designed to enable the creation of Bitmoji games within Lenses. These include turn-based systems for interactive gameplay and customizable character controllers, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with Snapchat AR . Why This Matters for the Creator Economy and Beyond Democratizing AR creation has several implications: Increased Content Volume: More creators mean more Lenses, offering Snapchat users a wider variety of experiences. Diverse Perspectives: Accessibility allows people from all backgrounds and skill levels to contribute their unique creative visions. Innovation from the Edge: Simple tools can sometimes lead to unexpected and innovative uses of the technology by non-traditional creators. Potential Monetization Pathways: As the AR creator ecosystem grows, Snap may explore new ways for creators to earn revenue from their popular Lenses, further fueling the creator economy. This move aligns with broader trends in the digital economy where user-generated content and creative tools are becoming central. While not directly tied to cryptocurrency, the principles of decentralized creation and empowering individuals resonate with themes in the Web3 space. As AR technology matures, its integration into virtual worlds or decentralized platforms could become more pronounced. Conclusion: A Bold Step for AR Accessibility Snap’s launch of the Lens Studio iOS app and web tool represents a significant step towards making augmented reality creation accessible to everyone. By combining simple interfaces, powerful AI effects generation, and integration with popular features like Bitmoji, Snap is inviting a new wave of creators to shape the future of Snapchat AR Lenses . This initiative not only strengthens Snap’s position as an AR leader but also signals a clear commitment to building a large, diverse, and active community around augmented reality experiences. As these tools become more widely adopted, we can expect to see an explosion of creative and personalized AR content, further blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds.

A new treasury policy has been introduced to manage funds more carefully and stay better prepared for the challenges ahead. New Focus: DeFi, Yield, and Transparency Under this new plan, EF will tie its operating costs and runway to its ETH holdings, with regular reassessments. EF’s Hsiao-Wei Wang said the current treasury gives the Foundation about 2.5 years of runway, stressing the need for more deliberate capital deployment moving forward. As part of this shift, EF will now use its treasury assets across audited DeFi protocols like Aave, earning yield and engaging directly with the Ethereum ecosystem it once kept distance from. According to OAK Research, this is a bullish development for ETH, as it reduces the need to sell tokens while supporting secure, open-source dApps . EF has already lent ETH and borrowed $2 million in stablecoins from Aave and may explore RWAs via platforms like Securitize.

It’s also considering diversifying fiat reserves into low-risk instruments like Treasury bills and bonds. To maintain community trust, EF will publish quarterly reports detailing asset performance, positions, and major events, adding transparency after recent Ether sales stirred backlash. Laying Groundwork for Ethereum’s Future With ETH still 46% below its 2021 high and lagging behind BTC and SOL, this revamped strategy signals EF’s long-term commitment. By directly supporting “Defipunk” principles and ecosystem builders, the Foundation appears to be setting the stage for Ethereum’s next growth chapter. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

For those watching the crypto space and broader tech industry, the battle for supremacy in the AI Hardware Market is a major theme. Recently, semiconductor giant AMD made a significant move that could reshape this landscape. Understanding the Challenge: Tackling Nvidia AI Dominance For years, Nvidia has held a commanding lead in the AI hardware sector, particularly with its GPUs that have become the standard for training and deploying complex AI models. A significant challenge for competitors like AMD is that much of the existing AI software ecosystem is heavily optimized for Nvidia’s architecture. This creates a high barrier to entry for developers looking to use alternative hardware, even if those alternatives offer strong performance. AMD’s latest strategic move directly addresses this challenge. By acquiring Brium, an AI software optimization startup, AMD aims to make it easier for AI software to run efficiently on its own hardware, thereby chipping away at Nvidia’s entrenched position. What is Brium and How Does it Help with AI Software Optimization ? Brium, though seemingly operating in stealth mode until this announcement, focuses on a critical area: enabling AI inference across diverse hardware. Inference is the process where a trained AI model uses new data to make predictions or decisions. While AI training is computationally intensive, inference is where AI models are widely deployed and utilized. Brium’s technology is designed to help retrofit or adapt AI software that might have originally been built and optimized for one type of hardware (like Nvidia GPUs) to function effectively on others, including AMD’s offerings. Their own blog post highlighted this industry challenge, noting that while AMD’s Instinct GPUs offer strong performance, harnessing it can be difficult because workloads are typically tuned for Nvidia. This acquisition is fundamentally about bridging the software gap. By improving AI Software Optimization for its own chips, AMD makes its hardware a more viable and attractive option for developers and companies building and deploying AI applications. AMD’s Broader AMD AI Strategy The Brium acquisition isn’t an isolated event; it’s part of a larger, deliberate AMD AI Strategy focused on building an open, high-performance AI software ecosystem. This is AMD’s fourth acquisition in the AI software space within the last two years, demonstrating a clear pattern of investment in this critical area. Previous acquisitions include: Silo AI (July 2024): Focused on custom AI solutions and services. Nod.AI (October 2023): Specializing in AI model optimization and deployment. Mipsology (August 2023): Known for its AI inference acceleration technology. While AMD frames this strategy around fostering openness, it’s also a pragmatic approach to gain market share. By making their hardware easier to use with existing and future AI software, AMD directly competes for workloads currently running primarily on Nvidia hardware. Implications for Semiconductor Competition The rivalry between AMD and Nvidia is a defining feature of the modern Semiconductor Competition . While they compete across various markets, the AI sector has become arguably the most important battleground due to explosive growth in AI adoption. Nvidia’s lead in AI hardware is significant, driven by both their powerful chips and the robust CUDA software platform that developers rely on. AMD’s approach with acquisitions like Brium, coupled with its investment in open-source initiatives like ROCm, aims to provide a compelling alternative. By improving software compatibility and performance on AMD hardware, the company hopes to persuade more customers to diversify their AI infrastructure away from a single vendor. The success of AMD’s strategy will depend on how effectively Brium’s technology can be integrated and how widely developers adopt AMD’s platforms for AI workloads. If successful, it could lead to increased competition, potentially benefiting consumers and businesses through more hardware options and innovation. Summary: A Strategic Play in the AI Hardware Battle AMD’s acquisition of Brium is a strategic move aimed squarely at reducing Nvidia’s substantial lead in the AI hardware market. By acquiring expertise in AI software optimization, AMD is tackling one of the biggest hurdles to wider adoption of its own AI chips: software compatibility. This fits into AMD’s broader strategy of building an open AI ecosystem through targeted acquisitions. The outcome of this intensified semiconductor competition in the AI space will be crucial for the future of artificial intelligence development and deployment.

Our primary… pic.twitter.com/jrXFFwnMBA — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) June 4, 2025 WazirX Repayment Hopes Dashed The plan, which aimed to begin creditor payouts by April 2025, had previously received initial court approval in January following a devastating $230 million hack linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. WazirX had proposed a path to recovery that included launching a decentralized exchange (DEX), issuing recovery tokens, and buying back tokens to support liquidity. However, with the court’s recent decision, the repayment timeline has collapsed, leaving creditors in limbo. WazirX Shifts Base to Panama Following the Singapore court’s rejection of its restructuring plan, WazirX is now relocating operations to Panama and rebranding under a new entity. Recently, the exchange shared redacted legal documents with users via email, revealing that its parent company, Zettai, is setting up a subsidiary called Zensui Corporation in Panama. The move signals a strategic shift as WazirX attempts to reset its crypto services under a new jurisdiction, possibly to regain operational flexibility and distance itself from ongoing legal and financial challenges. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : WazirX Rebrands as Zensui After Moving from Singapore to Panama , Legal Limbo and Risk of Liquidation The Singapore court’s refusal now threatens to push WazirX into liquidation under Section 301 of the Companies Act.

Despite the setback, WazirX said in a note to creditors that it remains committed to legal compliance and hopes to begin distributions “as soon as possible.” From Market Leader to Crisis Mode Once a dominant force in India’s crypto trading scene, WazirX’s credibility is in question due to poor communication, limited asset recovery, and an almost complete shutdown of user interaction on social media platforms. Moreover, this latest court ruling casts serious doubt over the platform’s future and signals deeper challenges for its path to redemption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Atkins has made cryptocurrency regulation a top priority of his leadership, pledging to replace the regulator’s controversial enforcement-first approach with a clear, structured rulebook. In his June 3 testimony, Atkins presented a vision to support innovation, protect investors, and eliminate fraud from the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Need for a Clear Crypto Regulatory Framework While delivering testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, Atkins stressed the importance of creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the country. He explained how the lack of clear regulation has encouraged fraud in the crypto market and emphasized that his top priority is to establish a regulatory framework that supports innovation and prevents fraud. Reports indicate that the new SEC leadership will focus on creating specific rules for issuing, storing, and trading crypto as part of broader cryptocurrency regulation reforms. SEC’s New Crypto Task Force During the U.S. election campaign, Donald Trump promised to introduce policies supporting the crypto sector. Following his inauguration, several initiatives have been launched to back the digital asset industry. One of the key steps is the creation of a new Crypto Task Force under the SEC . The task force aims to help the SEC establish clear regulations for cryptocurrency and has already held four public roundtables covering: Security classifications Trading oversight Custody Tokenization In the upcoming roundtable, the task force will discuss another major topic: Decentralized Finance (DeFi). .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit End When?

He strongly denounced the enforcement-first approach of the previous SEC regime, asserting that future policymaking will be conducted through public rulemaking —not surprise enforcement actions.Atkins emphasized a return to the SEC’s original mission: creating clear rules and enforcing them fairly , especially as cryptocurrency regulation enters a new phase in U.S. policy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Shiba Inu (SHIB), is regaining momentum thanks to ongoing ecosystem expansions and Shibarium upgrades, positioning it as a top coin among cheap cryptocurrencies with serious upside. Dogecoin (DOGE) follows closely, with bullish sentiment building around potential utility growth and its place in broader crypto ETF conversations. But it’s not just legacy tokens commanding attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin in presale, is gaining traction as the potential next big cryptocurrency for 2025, combining DeFi innovation with massive ROI projections. The project has raised more than $9.9 million and attracted over 11,700 holders. For those asking what crypto to buy now, this mix of proven popularity and fresh promise may offer the most compelling opportunities this month. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin: Best Meme Coins This June At the time of writing, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000012, suggesting it is slowly rebounding after recent changes. The token’s performance has grown as a result of improvements in the Shiba Inu environment, mainly because of Shibarium and greater involvement in decentralized finance. Because it is simple and widely known, SHIB appeals to investors hoping to join innovative early-stage blockchain projects. In the meantime, Dogecoin (DOGE) still stands at $0.19 and is part of the leading meme coins. Analysts think the price of DOGE will go up to $0.38 by July, mainly because of active community members and possible ETF moves. Because people have invested in SHIB and DOGE, they now consider these coins to be some of the best cryptos to buy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being lauded by people as a speculative coin that could bring major prizes in crypto. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built to avoid depeg risks. Thanks to the safe, open and Certik-audited nature of this project, blockchain investors enjoy stability. Through the merger of modern finance tech and powerful infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is turning the future of decentralized finance upside down. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.9 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,700 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share $100,000 each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for cheering the project in the beginning. While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin continue to dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving out its own lane as a DeFi disruptor with explosive upside potential. Over 11,700 early adopters have already contributed more than $9.9 million, securing tokens at just $0.03 before the next price increase. Backed by a dual-lending model, Certik-audited smart contracts, and a fully collateralized stablecoin, MUTM offers more than hype — it delivers real value.

Are you keeping an eye on Bitcoin? A fascinating signal has just emerged from the depths of the network, one that historically points towards opportune moments for accumulation. We’re talking about a potential Bitcoin buy signal flagged by a powerful on-chain tool known as the Hash Ribbons indicator. This isn’t just market noise; it’s a signal rooted in the very economics of Bitcoin mining, suggesting a period of stress among those who secure the network. Understanding the Hash Ribbons: What Are These Crypto Indicators Telling Us? The Hash Ribbons are essentially a set of two simple moving averages applied to Bitcoin’s hash rate – the computational power dedicated to mining and processing transactions. Think of the hash rate as a direct measure of the health and activity of the mining network. When the hash rate is high and growing, it suggests miners are profitable and expanding operations. But what happens when conditions get tough? This is where the Hash Ribbons become particularly insightful. They are designed to identify periods of Bitcoin miner capitulation . This happens when the price of Bitcoin drops, or energy costs rise, making mining unprofitable for less efficient miners. These miners are forced to shut down their machines, leading to a decline or stagnation in the network’s hash rate. The Hash Ribbons signal this stress through specific crossovers of the moving averages. Bitcoin Miner Capitulation: Why Stress Can Lead to Opportunity The term Bitcoin miner capitulation might sound dramatic, and in a way, it is. It signifies a phase where miners, who are essentially the backbone of the network, are under significant financial pressure. To cover their operational costs (electricity, hardware, etc.) and potentially avoid bankruptcy, these struggling miners often have to sell their mined Bitcoin. This forced selling adds supply to the market, contributing to downward price pressure or preventing a price recovery. Here’s the critical insight: While miner selling creates short-term headwinds, the capitulation phase eventually washes out the less efficient participants. Once the selling pressure from these specific miners subsides, and the hash rate begins to recover (signaling that more efficient miners are still operating or new ones are coming online), it has historically marked a strong bottom for Bitcoin’s price. The Hash Ribbons indicator aims to pinpoint this transition – the moment the ‘worst is over’ for miners and the network starts to heal. The Current Signal: What the Hash Ribbons Are Showing Now for BTC Price Analysis Recent analysis, like the one shared by Darkfost on CryptoQuant, highlights that the Hash Ribbons indicator is currently flashing a signal consistent with past periods of miner stress and potential capitulation. This comes after a phase where Bitcoin’s hash rate surged to new record highs. While a high hash rate generally indicates a robust network, if the price doesn’t keep pace or energy costs become prohibitive, it can squeeze profit margins for miners, particularly the less sophisticated ones. The indicator suggests that the market may be experiencing the effects of this miner stress. Miners offloading BTC to stay afloat can create temporary selling pressure. However, according to the historical performance of this indicator, this very stress phase often precedes a significant price recovery. It’s a counter-intuitive idea: pain in the mining sector can signal potential gain for investors looking at the BTC price analysis . Looking Back: How Have the Hash Ribbons Performed Historically? Let’s peek into the past to see why the Hash Ribbons are considered among the more reliable Crypto indicators for identifying potential cycle lows. Historically, every major Bitcoin bottom has been accompanied by a Hash Ribbons buy signal. Here are a few notable instances: December 2018: Following the peak of the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin entered a deep bear market. The Hash Ribbons signaled miner capitulation near the $3,200 bottom, which marked the end of that bear cycle. March 2020 (COVID Crash): During the sudden global market panic, Bitcoin’s price plummeted. The Hash Ribbons quickly printed a buy signal shortly after the bottom around $3,800, preceding a significant rally. July 2021: After the May 2021 peak and subsequent correction, the Hash Ribbons signaled miner stress and recovery, coinciding with the low around $29,000 before the push to new all-time highs later that year. January 2023: Following the 2022 bear market, the Hash Ribbons signaled accumulation early in the year, preceding Bitcoin’s rally from the $16,000-$17,000 range. These historical examples illustrate the indicator’s potential to highlight periods where the selling pressure from distressed miners is likely peaking, setting the stage for a recovery. This track record is why the current Bitcoin buy signal from the Hash Ribbons is attracting attention from analysts focused on BTC price analysis . Is This Bitcoin Buy Signal Foolproof? A Word of Caution While the Hash Ribbons indicator has a compelling history, it’s crucial to remember that no single indicator is a crystal ball. The crypto market is influenced by a vast array of factors beyond just miner behavior. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, institutional investor sentiment, and global events all play significant roles in BTC price analysis . Relying solely on the Hash Ribbons without considering the broader market context would be naive. This signal should be viewed as one powerful piece of the puzzle, suggesting that the fundamental supply side from miners is likely entering a less pressured phase. It’s a strong indication from the network’s core, but it doesn’t negate the impact of external market forces. Actionable Insights: What to Do With This Information So, you’ve seen the Hash Ribbons signal, understood Bitcoin miner capitulation , and reviewed the historical context. What does this mean for you as an investor or trader? See it as a Potential Accumulation Zone: Historically, periods flagged by the Hash Ribbons buy signal have offered attractive entry points for long-term holders. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This signal is a prompt for further investigation. Look at other Crypto indicators , analyze market sentiment, and consider your own investment strategy and risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: The Hash Ribbons signal is typically relevant for identifying macro bottoms or significant accumulation periods, not short-term trading fluctuations. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket based on a single indicator. The emergence of this Bitcoin buy signal based on the Hash Ribbons suggests that the market might be in a phase that has historically rewarded patient investors. The underlying stress in the mining industry, while challenging for miners, often cleanses the system and paves the way for future growth. In Conclusion: The Hash Ribbons Signal and the Road Ahead for Bitcoin The Hash Ribbons indicator’s latest reading, pointing to ongoing or concluding Bitcoin miner capitulation , presents a compelling case for a potential Bitcoin buy signal . This on-chain metric, rooted in the economic realities of mining, has a proven track record of coinciding with significant price bottoms in the past. While miner stress can create temporary selling pressure, the indicator suggests that this phase might be setting the stage for a more favorable environment for price appreciation, according to historical BTC price analysis . As with all Crypto indicators , it’s a tool to inform your decisions, not make them for you. However, the signal from the Hash Ribbons is a powerful reminder that opportunities can arise from periods of stress within the network’s fundamental layers. Keep this signal on your radar as you navigate the fascinating world of Bitcoin.

According to a Wednesday report from The Wall Street Journal , Trump is “losing patience” with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, and the relationship between the two influential figures is supposedly deteriorating. Musk is not willing to support the bill’s $5 trillion debt ceiling increase and cuts to several federal programs. A senior White House official, speaking anonymously with WSJ, said that Trump was confused and frustrated by Musk’s public attacks after months of alignment on multiple policy fronts. President Trump unhappy with ‘first buddy’ Musk Late Wednesday, on X, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul shared his concerns about the scale of the bill, saying he could vote for the “not yet Big Beautiful bill” if the debt ceiling issue was separated from it. Musk reposted Paul’s commentary by labeling the legislation as “the largest increase in the debt ceiling in US history,” and coining it as the “Debt Slavery Bill.” He called on his 220 million followers to contact lawmakers, saying: “ Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL .” This spending bill contains the largest increase in the debt ceiling in US history! It is the Debt Slavery Bill. https://t.co/7EEyUEha1q — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 4, 2025 His posts could have re-energized Republican spending hawks, but it’s unclear if the opposition will be sufficient to block the bill, which already passed the House and now awaits Senate revisions. CBO projects massive deficit increase, coverage losses The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis estimating that Trump’s proposed bill would reduce federal revenue by $3.67 trillion while cutting spending by $1.25 trillion over the next decade. The projected result is a $2.4 trillion increase in national debt , which currently stands at $36 trillion. The CBO also predicted that 10.9 million Americans would lose health insurance by 2034, including over 1.4 million individuals without verified immigration status, who would be removed from state-funded programs. In response to these projections, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt lambasted the CBO as a “politically-biased group.” She claimed the agency’s analysts support Democratic candidates, and therefore “could not be objective.” House Speaker Mike Johnson supported these sentiments, alleging that a vast majority of CBO staff are partisan Democrats, some of whom have contributed to progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. “ No government in the history of mankind has ever cut $1.6 trillion in a piece of legislation ,” he told reporters. Is it a NASA nominee dispute retaliation? WSJ alluded that the rift between Musk and Trump could have begun from a dispute involving Jared Isaacman, Musk’s ally and a private astronaut affiliated with SpaceX. The Trump administration recently pulled Isaacman’s nomination to lead NASA, a move that reportedly infuriated Musk. According to individuals familiar with the situation, Musk complained that despite contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to support Trump’s re-election campaign, his influence was disregarded in the NASA appointment. After Isaacman’s nomination was withdrawn, Musk went on social media to publicly defend him, describing him as “competent and good-hearted.” Isaacman piloted the first private orbital mission aboard a SpaceX vehicle. He believes that Musk’s criticism of the administration gave officials political cover to drop the nomination. T he Senate is expected to modify the bill before it returns to the House for final approval. Trump has set a self-imposed July 4 deadline to sign it into law.

BTC Falls Beneath $105K It was just two weeks ago, on Bitcoin Pizza Day, when the primary cryptocurrency skyrocketed to a fresh all-time high of almost $112,000. However, it failed to maintain its run and started to retrace almost immediately. At first, it remained around $110,000 but was stopped and driven south last week. The most violent rejection arrived at the end of the business week when the bears pushed bitcoin down by several grand. The culmination took place on Saturday when BTC slumped to a 12-day low of $103,100.

DOGE and XRP are now on Base Base is for everyone https://t.co/YTDqK3xgcH — Base (@base) June 4, 2025 Over 2.3 million cbXRP ($5M) and 10.4 million cbDOGE ($1.9M) were issued in the first 24 hours of the launch, showing strong demand. Coinbase has also warned against scammers who may pretend to offer cbDOGE and cbXRP. To stay safe, users should only trust the official Base contract addresses. Wrapped tokens let users use coins like XRP and Dogecoin on different blockchains. Coinbase’s move brings these popular tokens to Base, giving users lower fees, better trading options, and access to DeFi apps. This move boosts Base’s position as a top L-2 network with lower fees and faster DeFi access. Base is now the biggest Ethereum Layer 2 network, securing over $15 billion in assets. It has processed over $3.6 trillion in stablecoin transactions in Q1 2025, which shows a sharp rise in network activity. Litecoin, ADA In Works Coinbase had earlier revealed its plans to introduce wrapped tokens for XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, and Litecoin on Base. While cbXRP and cbDOGE are now live, cbLTC and cbADA are still in development. This follows the success of cbBTC, which now has a $4.7B market cap. How to buy Wrapped XRP? cbXRP can be bought through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Base network. These DEXs allow you to swap other cryptocurrencies, such as ETH or USDC, for cbXRP. You will need a compatible crypto wallet like Coinbase Wallet, and some ETH to cover transaction fees.

Understanding this underlying emotional state – whether people are feeling fearful and hesitant or greedy and eager – is crucial for navigating the market. A widely used tool for gauging this is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this popular indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 57 as of June 5. This figure marks a five-point decrease from the previous day’s reading. While this drop indicates a slight cooling of market enthusiasm, the index firmly places the current crypto market sentiment within the ‘Greed’ territory. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index : More Than Just a Number The index operates on a simple yet insightful principle: extreme fear can be a sign that investors are overly worried, potentially presenting a buying opportunity, while extreme greed suggests the market might be due for a correction as investors become complacent or overly speculative. The index scale ranges from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried. Could signal a potential bottom. 25-49: Fear – Market is nervous. Caution is prevalent. 50-74: Greed – Market is optimistic. Prices are rising, attracting more buyers. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Market is overheated. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is high. Could signal a potential top. The index doesn’t rely on just one data point. Instead, it aggregates data from several key sources, each weighted differently, to provide a comprehensive snapshot of market psychology. What Drives Crypto Market Sentiment ? The Index Factors Explained The calculation of the index is based on six distinct factors, though one is currently paused. Each factor offers a unique perspective on the market’s mood: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High crypto volatility , especially sharp downward moves, often signals fear in the market. Conversely, stable or upward-trending prices with lower volatility can contribute to a sense of greed or confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component compares the current market volume and momentum (strength of price movements) with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume on upward trends indicates strong Market momentum driven by investor interest and often signals greed. Low volume or high selling volume on downward trends suggests fear or lack of conviction. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes posts on various social media platforms, focusing on specific hashtags related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It counts the speed and frequency of posts and assesses the sentiment (positive or negative) of these interactions. High levels of positive discussion and engagement can boost the greed score. Surveys (15%): (Currently Paused) While not active at the moment, this factor historically involved weekly polls where users were asked about their perception of the market. This provided a direct measure of investor sentiment, bypassing market data analysis. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increase in Bitcoin dominance often suggests that investors are moving funds out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, which is typically seen as a safer haven in crypto. This can indicate fear. Conversely, decreasing dominance often means money is flowing into altcoins, a sign of higher risk appetite and potentially greed. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search query data related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends, the index can gauge public interest and sentiment. For example, a sudden surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “buy crypto” might indicate growing public greed, while searches for “Bitcoin scam” or “crypto crash” could signal fear. By combining these factors, the index provides a nuanced perspective that goes beyond simple price movements. Current State: Why 57 Still Signals Greed A reading of 57, while lower than the previous day, still falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ zone (50-74). This suggests that despite some recent price fluctuations or potentially cautious news, the prevailing mood among crypto investors remains optimistic. The slight drop might reflect short-term price dips, minor negative news cycles, or profit-taking, but it hasn’t been significant enough to push the overall sentiment back into ‘Fear’. Being in the ‘Greed’ phase means that investors are generally confident, willing to buy, and perhaps chasing upward price trends. This positive sentiment can create a self-reinforcing cycle, pushing prices higher as more people jump in. Navigating a ‘Greed’ Market: Opportunities and Risks When the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is in the ‘Greed’ zone, several market dynamics are typically at play: Opportunities: Continued upward price action is possible as positive sentiment fuels buying. Altcoins may perform well as risk appetite increases (reflected in potentially decreasing Bitcoin dominance ). Traders might find opportunities in riding upward trends, leveraging the positive Market momentum . Risks: The primary risk in a ‘Greed’ market is overheating. Prices can become overextended, driven more by emotion and FOMO than fundamentals. This increases the potential for sharp corrections. High Crypto volatility can work both ways, leading to rapid losses if sentiment suddenly shifts. It’s crucial to avoid getting swept up in the hype and making impulsive decisions based solely on positive sentiment. Limitations of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index : It’s Not a Crystal Ball While a valuable tool for understanding current crypto market sentiment , the index has limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects the *current* sentiment based on recent data. It doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty. Correlation vs. Causation: While high greed often correlates with market tops and high fear with market bottoms, the index doesn’t *cause* these events. It reflects the collective behavior that drives them. Simplified View: Market dynamics are complex. The index provides a useful summary but doesn’t capture all nuances, such as specific sector performance or regulatory news impacts. Using the Index: Actionable Insights for Your Strategy How can you use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index effectively? As a Contrarian Signal: Some experienced traders use the index contrarianly – considering buying when the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (when others are panicking) and considering selling or taking profits when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (when others are overly confident). As a Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm signals from your other analysis methods (technical, fundamental). If your analysis suggests a potential uptrend and the index is in ‘Greed’, it might reinforce the positive outlook driven by Market momentum . If your analysis suggests caution and the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it adds weight to the potential for a pullback. Understand the Context: Always look at *why* the index is at a certain level. Are all factors pointing in the same direction, or is one factor like high Crypto volatility pulling it down while others remain positive? Consider the role of Bitcoin dominance in the overall picture. Manage Risk: Regardless of the index level, always employ sound risk management practices. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders. Conclusion The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, currently sitting at 57 and indicating ‘Greed’, remains a valuable barometer for understanding the prevailing mood in the cryptocurrency market. While it has dipped slightly, the sentiment is still largely optimistic, driven by factors like market momentum, social media trends, and potentially Bitcoin dominance dynamics. By understanding how this index works and its components, and by using it in conjunction with other analytical tools, investors can gain better insights into the emotional forces shaping the market, helping them make more informed decisions rather than being solely guided by fear or greed themselves.

Wrapped tokens represent the original assets in environments where they are otherwise unavailable, offering compatibility with Base's protocol and DeFi applications. This facilitates interoperability, allowing for the seamless transfer of coins within the ecosystem while allowing holders to tap into DeFi and generate additional returns on top of their spot market holdings. The wrapped version of XRP has achieved a market cap of over $5 million within the first 24 hours, according to data source BaseScan . Wrapped DOGE's market cap is fast nearing the $2 million mark. XRP is a payments-focused cryptocurrency used by Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions and has a market cap of $128.8 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Dogecoin, with a market value of $28.2 billion, is the world's leading meme token by market value, CoinDesk data show. Coinbase debuted a wrapped version of bitcoin BTC, the largest cryptocurrency, on Base in September last year. That has reached a market cap of over $4.7 billion.",Markets|XRP|Dogecoin|Coinbase|Markets|Wrapped|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-05 07:41:17

Per our technical indicators, ALGO is bearish, with the fear and greed index showing a greed sentiment among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications has stagnated, with the charts showing that it could drop further in the coming days. Recent news: Algorand foundation- TVL is not correlated with price performance Algorand researchers are attempting to answer the question of whether TVL could predict the performance of a crypto, and after analyzing over 300 cryptocurrencies from 2023 to 2024, they did not find any outperformance, regardless of how the data was adjusted for known issue. The study will be published on June 10. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, The drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term.

Source: CoinStats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-05 07:45:00

As hopes for a rally continue for altcoins, cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment announced the four altcoins that whales transferred the most to exchanges. Accordingly, Santiment said that significant transfers were seen to exchanges in four altcoins in the last 24 hours. These include PayPal USD (PYUSD), SSV, Threshold (T), and ImmutableX (IMX). “There are several notable altcoins that have seen significant token transfers to exchanges in the last 24 hours. Here are the top transfers we’ve been tracking: PayPal USD (PYUSD): $15.9 million (1.67% of market cap) SSV: $1.1 million (0.89% of market cap) Threshold (T): $1.2 million (0.85% of market cap) ImmutableX (IMX): $6.4 million (0.60% of market cap) Such large altcoin inflows to exchanges are generally interpreted as preparations for sales. It usually signals potential selling pressure as whales or large holders may be preparing to unload their positions. Therefore, it can increase short-term volatility for these altcoins and affect price action. At this point, investors should also monitor PYUSD, SSV, Threshold, and IMX as increased exchange transfers could signal increased selling pressure.

45541119,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69765,1749109694,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Explains Why Ripple Escrow Could Aid XRP Price Rally,https://timestabloid.com/expert-explains-why-ripple-escrow-could-aid-xrp-price-rally/,"The escrow system used by Ripple has long been a source of controversy within and outside the XRP community. Critics, including Bitcoin advocates and some XRP holders, often claim that the monthly release of XRP from escrow creates downward pressure on the asset’s price. However, a well-known analyst within the XRP community has provided a contrasting perspective, asserting that the escrow does not harm the price. He claims it restricts market supply and could contribute to a future price surge. A Misunderstood Mechanism The analyst, who operates the “All Things XRP” account, argues that many people misinterpret the nature and impact of Ripple’s escrow system. According to the pseudonymous analyst, “It’s starving the market,” not flooding it. He explains that while XRP has a total fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, over 56 billion have already entered circulation. The remaining tokens are being gradually released from escrow, a system Ripple implemented in 2017 to address trust and transparency concerns. At the time, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow and set up a schedule to release 1 billion tokens per month. While this schedule might seem like a steady injection of new supply, the analyst clarified that Ripple does not typically use the full monthly allocation. In most months, a large portion of the released XRP is returned to escrow, effectively deferring its entry into the market. He stated that Ripple typically uses between 200 and 300 million XRP monthly for purposes such as market making, running its payment infrastructure, and supporting ecosystem initiatives. THINK XRP’S ESCROW IS BAD FOR PRICE? You’ve been misled. It’s not dumping XRP… It’s starving the market. And the moment it ends could be explosive. pic.twitter.com/L0ZXVxiqnI — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 17, 2025 Supply Control, Not Dumping This approach, the analyst argues, demonstrates supply control rather than market manipulation. He emphasized that Ripple’s behavior has been consistent and disciplined, with unused tokens routinely locked back into escrow. This process, he said, should not be equated with token dumping, which implies reckless or excessive release of assets into the market. Currently, Ripple holds approximately 36.5 billion XRP in escrow, down from the initial 55 billion, reflecting how the system has gradually reduced over time. The analyst believes this declining escrow balance, combined with increasing demand, particularly from On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services and the potential for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could lead to a scenario where demand surpasses available supply. In his view, this “starving” effect could ultimately fuel a significant price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Centralization Concerns and Transparency The analyst also responded to concerns about centralization, a point frequently raised by Bitcoin maximalists and skeptics of Ripple’s influence over XRP. While Ripple still owns a significant portion of the total supply, estimated at around 46%, he contends that the escrow system introduces accountability. Because every token release is publicly recorded on-chain, the process remains transparent and traceable. This structure, he argues, limits Ripple’s ability to manipulate the market and reinforces long-term trust in the system. Suggestions from the Community Some members of the XRP community have proposed alternative ways of handling the escrowed tokens. Ideas have included unlocking additional tokens to support ecosystem initiatives or even burning the remaining supply entirely to create artificial scarcity. However, Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has dismissed such proposals. He referenced the 2019 decision by the Stellar Development Foundation to burn 55 billion XLM tokens. “Stellar burned half their supply and there wasn’t so much as a blip on their price chart,” he said, suggesting a similar strategy for XRP would not yield the desired effect and would instead squander valuable assets. The analyst behind “All Things XRP” argues that Ripple’s escrow structure acts as a supply management tool, not a price suppressor. He believes that as long as Ripple maintains its current release practices and market demand continues to grow, the conditions for a substantial price movement will only strengthen as the remaining escrow balance declines.

Recently, as the Bitcoin price has retreated from its impressive all-time high, we’re seeing shifts in how different market participants are behaving. One notable change is the apparent cooling off of activity among retail investors . Has the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop Shaken Retail Confidence? Bitcoin (BTC), the bellwether of the crypto market , recently touched an all-time high of $111,000 on May 22nd. However, like any volatile asset, it experienced a pullback, dropping roughly 7% to trade near $104,000. While this might seem like a standard market correction, an analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci suggests it had a noticeable impact on smaller players. According to Kesmeci’s findings, the volume of transactions typically associated with retail activity – specifically transfers valued between $0 and $10,000 – saw a decline. This ‘retail transaction volume’ dropped from $423 million to $408 million following the BTC price dip. Furthermore, a look at the 30-day change in retail demand reinforces this trend. This metric, which had shown a healthy 5-point increase, shifted dramatically to a slight decline of 0.11 points. This pivot indicates a change in momentum, suggesting that the bullish enthusiasm from retail seems to be taking a pause. Understanding the Decline in Retail Transaction Volume What does a drop in transaction volume for small transfers tell us? It primarily indicates that individuals making smaller trades or transfers are becoming less active. There are several potential reasons for this: Fear and Uncertainty: Price drops can trigger fear (FUD) among less experienced investors, leading them to pause buying or even sell to cut potential losses. Profit Taking: Some retail investors might have taken profits after the rally towards the all-time high, and the subsequent dip reinforced their decision to stay on the sidelines temporarily. Waiting for a Lower Entry: Others might be waiting for a deeper correction before buying back in, reducing current transaction volume. Reduced Hype: A slight dip can sometimes cool the broader market excitement that often fuels retail participation. This specific ‘retail transaction volume’ metric, focusing on the $0-$10,000 range, is a useful proxy for gauging the activity level of individual, non-professional investors who are less likely to be moving large sums for institutional purposes. Why Do Retail Investors React Differently Than Institutions? The analysis highlighted that while retail activity waned, institutional interest appeared to remain steady. This is a crucial distinction in the crypto market : Investment Horizon: Institutions often have a much longer investment horizon than retail investors. Short-term price fluctuations are less likely to deter them from their long-term strategies. Risk Management: Institutional investors typically employ sophisticated risk management strategies and capital allocation models that account for volatility. Retail investors might be more emotionally driven. Access to Capital and Information: Institutions have deeper pockets and often access to proprietary research and trading desks, allowing them to act differently during market shifts. Strategic Goals: Institutional involvement is often part of broader portfolio diversification or specific strategic plays, not just speculative trading based on daily price swings. This divergence in behavior between retail and institutional players during a Bitcoin price pullback is a common theme in volatile markets. It underscores the different motivations and capabilities of these two distinct investor groups. Implications of Shifting Bitcoin Volume Dynamics A decline in Bitcoin volume among retail investors doesn’t necessarily signal the end of a bull run, but it does indicate a potential shift in market dynamics. If retail momentum slows, sustained price increases might rely more heavily on institutional accumulation or significant positive news events. Conversely, a period of lower retail volume during a pullback could be seen by some as a healthy consolidation phase, potentially setting the stage for the next move up once confidence returns or institutional buying pressure increases. It highlights the current sentiment among smaller players, which is a key component of the overall market structure. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors For those participating in the crypto market , understanding these shifts in Bitcoin volume and retail behavior is key. Here are a few insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of on-chain data and analyses like those from CryptoQuant to understand underlying market flows. Define Your Strategy: Whether you’re a long-term holder or a short-term trader, have a clear plan that isn’t solely dictated by daily price swings. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to smooth out volatility. Observe Institutional Activity: While harder to track directly, signs of continued institutional interest (like ETF flows or corporate adoption news) can be a positive signal. The current environment serves as a reminder that market corrections are normal and can reveal underlying shifts in participation. While the dip in BTC price has caused some retail investors to pull back, the broader picture involves multiple types of market participants with varying strategies. Summary: Retail Takes a Breather as Bitcoin Pulls Back In conclusion, Bitcoin’s recent retreat from its all-time high has indeed coincided with a noticeable decrease in activity among retail investors, as evidenced by declining small-value transaction volume and a negative shift in the 30-day retail demand metric. This suggests that many smaller players are reacting to short-term price movements, perhaps taking profits or waiting for clearer market direction. This contrasts with the reported steady interest from institutional players, highlighting the different approaches taken by various market segments. While the dip in Bitcoin volume from retail might cool short-term momentum, it’s a typical reaction during pullbacks and provides valuable insight into current market sentiment.

The company’s stock will list on NYSE American under the ticker BMNR. BitMine is expanding both its BTC holdings and advisory services. BitMine Immersion Technologies is raising $18 million through a public stock offering as it looks to expand its Bitcoin holdings and deepen its treasury strategy. In a June 4 announcement , BitMine detailed plans to offer 2.25 million shares priced at $8.00 each. Underwriters also have a 45-day option to purchase an additional 337,500 shares. The offering is expected to close on June 6, subject to standard conditions. BitMine to Deploy Entire $18M Raise Toward Building BTC Reserves The company said it intends to deploy all proceeds from the raise to purchase Bitcoin, supporting its long-term approach of building BTC reserves through mining and direct acquisition. BitMine operates in both Trinidad and Texas and is positioning itself as a Bitcoin treasury-focused public company. Alongside the offering, BitMine confirmed that its stock has been approved for listing on the NYSE American under the ticker BMNR, with trading beginning June 5. The stock will no longer trade on the OTCQX Best Market. ThinkEquity is managing the offering. The capital raise comes as interest in Bitcoin mining and BTC treasury strategies continues to grow. According to JPMorgan, the combined market cap of 13 publicly traded Bitcoin miners rose 20% in May, signaling improving mining profitability. BitMine has also expanded into advisory services. In May, it launched a Bitcoin Treasury Advisory Practice to help other public firms develop BTC-based strategies, covering areas such as accounting and risk management. The company also secured a $4 million leasing agreement involving 3,000 ASIC miners. With this $18 million raise and NYSE uplisting, BitMine is doubling down on its identity as a Bitcoin-first public company — raising the question of whether its latest BTC accumulation will have an impact on Bitcoin price dynamics. BTC Tests $104K Zone as Bulls Struggle to Regain Momentum Bitcoin is currently trading near $104,550 after facing resistance around the $105,200–$105,300 range. The 2-hour chart shows BTC in a consolidation phase following its recent high above $106,000. Bollinger Bands are tightening, indicating a potential breakout setup. On the 30-minute chart, BTC has been gradually sliding from last week’s highs near $112,000, with lower highs forming a descending structure. Current support is seen around $104,300–$104,500, which has held over the past 24 hours. RSI on both the 2-hour and 30-minute charts is hovering in the neutral zone (39–42), suggesting no clear bullish or bearish momentum yet. MACD on the 30-minute is slightly negative, hinting at weak bearish pressure. The 1-minute chart shows a minor recovery from the early morning low of $104,433, with RSI bouncing to 53 and MACD flipping positive — a short-term bullish signal. For now, BTC must reclaim $105,300 to shift sentiment toward bullish continuation. Failure to hold above $104,300 could open the door for a retest of the $103,500 level.

TRUMP Coin price forecast for 2025 goes upto $28. Price predictions suggest potential highs of $212.25 by 2030. TRUMP coin price prediction is gaining attention as the token, built on the Solana ecosystem , continues to generate buzz due to its strong association with U.S. President Donald Trump. The coin’s price initially skyrocketed after a viral campaign that promised top buyers an exclusive gala dinner with Trump . However, the rally was short-lived—TRUMP Coin plunged from a high of $49 on Coinbase to just $7, raising concerns of a potential pump-and-dump. Despite the sharp drop, the coin showed resilience by stabilizing above the $10 mark in Q2 2025.

His words hold the power to shake the crypto sector, which is why the term “Trump” itself is trending due to his announcements and warnings. This influence is clearly reflected in the price chart of the TRUMP coin. Back in January, the token saw a strong bullish candle, but the momentum didn’t last. In February, Trump’s actions triggered a wave of trade-related fear that impacted many altcoins—including TRUMP, despite its direct association with the former President. Like many other altcoins, TRUMP retraced and dropped to $7 by early April. Since then, it has attempted three times to reclaim the $16 level. However, in the final week of May, it broke below the dynamic 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, forming a bearish crossover—a signal that further downside may follow. Looking ahead, if TRUMP can successfully sustain and break above the $16 level in June 2025, it could target $28 by the end of the year. A breakout above this level could open the door for further gains. However, failure to maintain upward momentum could see the price falling back to either $16 or even $7. In terms of its long-term trajectory, the $28 level is considered highly critical in 2025. According to Fibonacci retracement levels and the high volume profile, this zone will likely determine the TRUMP coin’s future direction.

They also expect the Dogecoin price, fueled by renewed community excitement, to rise to $0.28. Alongside these top altcoins, Unilabs (UNIL) is a new altcoin that could give investors returns. Its AI-based platform that offers unique earning opportunities has attracted a lot of interest. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Poised for Breakout Wise Crypto, a market analyst, has highlighted that an uptrend might be on the way for the Binance Coin price. Currently, the Binance Coin price is pressing against a key resistance zone around $670. The analyst cited increasing volume as a sign of building momentum. Wise Crypto notes that a clear breakout above $670 could trigger an explosive move, with immediate targets at $710 and $742 and a potential retest of the all-time high near $800. Binance's ongoing dominance and BNB's critical utility within its ecosystem further reinforce this bullish outlook. If the Binance Coin price holds above $710, it could enter an acceleration zone, opening the door to even greater gains. Meanwhile, the BNB price has dropped after failing to cross the $670 mark. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the Binance Coin price has been confined to the $650-670 range in the past few days. A breakout could push the Binance Coin price towards the $670 level. Dogecoin (DOGE) Gathers Momentum For Upside Nirvan, one of the top crypto experts in the market, believes the DOGE price is gathering momentum for the next leg. He advised his followers to exercise patience, as it will be rewarded shortly. As part of his forecast, Nirvan added a Dogecoin price chart, which showed the memecoin dropping to $0.16. Afterward, the price of Dogecoin soared up the charts to $0.28. Meanwhile, another expert called V Crypto posted a more bullish Dogecoin price prediction. They said the Dogecoin price is preparing for the third wave, which could push it to $0.90 this June. The Dogecoin price is currently trading in the red zone. The memecoin has been oscillating between a tight range of $0.18–$0.20. Although the Dogecoin price retested the upper level on June 3rd, bulls failed to overcome selling pressure. On the brighter side, the Stoch RSI (14) flashes green and supports an uptrend in the coming weeks.

Among them, Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the emergent Unilabs (UNIL) are drawing attention this June. Binance Coin (BNB): A Strong Contender for Growth Binance Coin has been a staple in the crypto market, trusted for its stability and growth potential. Despite recent fluctuations, market analysts like Wise Crypto believe that BNB is on the brink of a significant price surge. According to observations, the Binance Coin is nudging at a pivotal resistance at $670, with potential to climb towards the $800 mark, revisiting its all-time highs should the momentum hold above $710. The ongoing expansions and integrations within the Binance ecosystem bolster the coin's standing, making it a sound investment this month. Unilabs (UNIL): Innovating DeFi with AI Integration Unilabs is capturing the fascination of the market with its unique proposition that blends AI with decentralized finance (DeFi). Geared towards redefining investment strategies in the DeFi space, Unilabs offers a diversified portfolio including AI-driven funds, which analyze market dynamics to optimize returns effectively. With the DeFi market expected to expand significantly, entering Unilabs could be a wise decision. Particularly, its current ICO price of $0.0062 and successful funding of over $2.2 million underscore strong market confidence.

Ever wonder if it’s the right time to focus on Bitcoin or explore the vast world of altcoins? The crypto market is constantly shifting, and understanding these cycles is key. A popular metric, the Altcoin Season Index, is currently giving us a strong signal: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is designed to give investors a snapshot of market sentiment and performance relative to Bitcoin. It measures how many of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. Here’s a simple breakdown: Altcoin Season: This occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have performed better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score would typically be high, often above 75. Bitcoin Season: This is the opposite. It happens when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. The index score would be low, typically 25 or below. Neither: If the performance is somewhere in between (25% to 75% outperform Bitcoin), the market isn’t clearly in either season. Bitcoin Season is Here: The Index at 23 As of June 5, the Altcoin Season Index registered 23. This figure is down slightly from the previous day, reinforcing the current trend. A score of 23 falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season. This means that over the last three months, a significant majority of the largest altcoins have struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. During Bitcoin Season, capital tends to flow primarily into Bitcoin. This could be due to various factors such as Bitcoin acting as a safe haven during uncertainty, increased institutional interest focused on BTC, or simply market dominance cycles where Bitcoin leads rallies or shows relative strength during downturns. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Cycle Understanding whether we are in Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season is crucial for developing an effective Crypto Investing Strategy. When the index signals Bitcoin Season, it suggests that focusing solely on a broad basket of altcoins might not yield the best short-term results compared to holding or focusing on Bitcoin. Key Considerations During Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market dominance (its market cap relative to the total crypto market cap) often increases during Bitcoin Season. Altcoin Performance: Many altcoins may underperform Bitcoin, and some may even see significant price drops while Bitcoin holds relatively steady or increases. Risk Assessment: Altcoins are generally considered higher risk than Bitcoin. During periods of market uncertainty or consolidation led by BTC, this higher risk can become more apparent. Your Crypto Investing Strategy in a Bitcoin-Dominant Market So, with the Altcoin Index pointing to Bitcoin Season, what’s your move? This isn’t financial advice, but understanding the current climate can help inform your decisions: Potential Strategies: Focus on Bitcoin: Some investors may choose to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to Bitcoin, anticipating it will continue to be the stronger performer. Selective Altcoin Exposure: Instead of a broad altcoin approach, focus on specific altcoins with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts, or unique use cases that might still perform well even in a Bitcoin-led market. Thorough research is essential here. Increase Stablecoin Holdings: For risk-averse investors, increasing stablecoin holdings can be a way to preserve capital during volatile periods or await clearer market signals. Rebalancing: Use this period to rebalance your portfolio according to your long-term strategy and risk tolerance. Challenges: Predicting the Shift: Knowing exactly when Bitcoin Season will end and Altcoin Season will begin is impossible. The index is a lagging indicator, reflecting the past 90 days. Market Volatility: Even during Bitcoin Season, the entire crypto market remains highly volatile. False Signals: The index is just one tool. Other factors like macroeconomics, regulatory news, and specific project developments also heavily influence prices. Understanding the Cycle is Power The Altcoin Season Index at 23 serves as a clear indicator of the current market phase – Bitcoin Season. While this doesn’t mean altcoins won’t see any gains, it suggests that Bitcoin is currently the dominant force and has been outperforming the majority of the top altcoins over the past three months. For investors, recognizing this phase is crucial for refining their Crypto Investing Strategy, managing risk, and potentially identifying where value is currently congregating within the crypto market. Remember, market cycles are dynamic. Bitcoin Season won’t last forever, and eventually, conditions will likely become favorable for altcoins again. Staying informed, conducting your own research, and having a well-defined strategy tailored to different market conditions are your best tools for navigating the exciting, albeit sometimes challenging, world of cryptocurrency.

According to a June 4 report by Bloomberg, the offering is expected to roll out in the coming weeks, starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF with over $70.1 billion in assets under management. The move signals growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and digital assets, particularly following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. JPMorgan’s program will let clients pledge crypto-linked ETFs to access liquidity and factor digital asset holdings into net worth calculations. JPMorgan CEO Stays Skeptical but Expands Bitcoin Access Despite JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s long-standing criticism of cryptocurrencies, the bank’s crypto footprint continues to grow. In May, Dimon acknowledged the growing client demand and said that JPMorgan would soon allow clients to purchase Bitcoin. Still, he reiterated his personal reservations about crypto, likening its use to smoking: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” JPMorgan has been gradually building its crypto infrastructure since launching its dollar-pegged stablecoin, JPM Coin, in 2020. More recently, the bank disclosed that it holds shares in several spot Bitcoin ETFs, further indicating its expanding interest in digital asset markets. The decision to offer crypto-collateralized loans places JPMorgan among a small but growing group of U.S. financial institutions exploring the integration of blockchain-based assets into traditional financial services. Trump Administration Eases Crypto Rules for Banks JPMorgan’s latest initiative also comes as U.S. regulatory attitudes toward crypto shift under the Trump administration. In April 2025, the Federal Reserve rescinded guidance that discouraged banks from engaging in crypto-related activities , including stablecoin services. A month later, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency affirmed that banks could legally custody digital assets for their customers. With regulatory barriers easing and institutional products maturing, the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur.

45541506,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69764,1749110446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO: I Invented XRP While Trying to Design a Better Vending Machine,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-invented-xrp-while-trying-to-design-a-better-vending-machine/,"Ripple CTO David Schwartz shared a lighthearted yet insightful post on X, offering a rare glimpse into his extensive experience in cryptography and blockchain. Responding to a question from OldmanJonesy about what his personal highlight reel would look like, Schwartz offered a satirical yet subtly profound glimpse into the evolution of his career. Among the most eye-catching of his remarks was the claim: “invented XRP while trying to design a better vending machine,” and in the process, “accidentally solved payments instead of snacks.” Though offered in jest, this comment captures the serendipitous brilliance that has long defined Schwartz’s trajectory. With a background in cryptography and a deep fascination for distributed systems, Schwartz co-created the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2012 alongside Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb. Their original intention was to build a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin, which at the time was grappling with high transaction costs and scalability issues. Schwartz’s latest playful anecdote aligns well with his history of transforming abstract technical ideas into tangible breakthroughs, turning a “vending machine problem” into a global payments infrastructure. Invented XRP while trying to design a better vending machine.Accidentally solved payments instead of snacks. Once debugged an XRPL consensus edge case using only telepathy and Diet Coke. Known as ""JoelKatz"" because ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" was already taken. Rumored to be the only… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 5, 2025 From Cryptographic Curiosity to Ledger Mastery David Schwartz has never been the typical technologist. His Twitter post adds color to this, stating that he once “debugged an XRPL consensus edge case using only telepathy and Diet Coke.” While clearly satirical, the comment nods to his deep involvement in fine-tuning XRPL’s consensus algorithm, which uses a unique Federated Byzantine Agreement to achieve fast, secure transactions without the energy demands of proof-of-work systems. This consensus model remains one of the XRP Ledger’s most distinguishing features and is at the heart of its institutional appeal. The CTO also jokingly claimed he “successfully explained XRPL’s consensus mechanism to one of his dogs,” who then went on to “lead a DAO.” Behind the humor lies a very real truth: Schwartz is widely respected for his ability to demystify complex blockchain concepts. His technical blogs, whitepapers, and public talks have educated thousands and helped shape industry conversations around scalability, interoperability, and decentralization. A Mythical Technologist with a Cryptic Past Schwartz’s self-effacing wit continued throughout his post, with claims like being “known as JoelKatz because Satoshi Nakamoto was already taken,” and “rumored to be the only person who understands both how the XRP Ledger works and Ripple’s org chart.” These tongue-in-cheek remarks not only reflect the cult-like mystique that surrounds blockchain pioneers but also hint at his dual role as both a deep technologist and a leader within Ripple’s complex organizational structure. Before his work in blockchain, Schwartz held various engineering roles, including working on encrypted cloud storage and secure messaging systems. He also once filed patents related to distributed computer networks, a precursor to his later work on decentralized ledgers. While his post claims he “architected NuDB in his head during a five-hour investor meeting while pretending to be asleep,” it’s true that Schwartz is the creator of NuDB, a key-value database engine optimized for high-throughput applications like XRP’s ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Satirical Brilliance, Serious Legacy Perhaps the most hilarious of his recent statements is the quip that he “publicly declared the blockchain trilemma ‘a fun puzzle,’ then solved it on a napkin during a lunch break. The napkin became the design for Solana.” Of course, there’s no evidence that Schwartz contributed to Solana’s design, but the joke serves as a nod to his towering reputation in crypto circles. Similarly, his claim of having “developed a zero-knowledge proof that he was not responsible for the ledger loss incident but never told anyone” pokes fun at the opaque nature of some blockchain narratives. He rounded off his mythical self-portrait by alluding to an early, fictional stint “lumberjacking in the Sahara Forest,” and being “often mistaken for a time traveler due to an unfortunate mix of never being completely sure what year it is, prophetic tweets, and extremely old shoes.” Though hyperbolic, these comments highlight Schwartz’s status as not only a respected technologist but also an influential figure in crypto culture. The Genius Behind the Humor Despite the humorous tone, David Schwartz’s post underscores a legacy that is anything but trivial. As Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, he remains instrumental in the ongoing development of cross-border payment solutions, decentralized finance protocols, and enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure. Under his technical guidance, Ripple has broadened its impact beyond XRP, driving fintech innovation through initiatives like the RLUSD stablecoin and XRPL EVM sidechain support . David Schwartz’s genius lies not just in the technologies he builds, but in the way he communicates them—with humor, clarity, and the kind of eccentric charisma that turns code into culture.

But Xi hasn’t been taking his calls. For weeks, Trump tried reaching him and got nothing back. Now, officials inside the White House say a phone call could happen any day — maybe even Thursday — but Beijing still hasn’t confirmed anything. “I am afraid we don’t have comments for you right now,” the Chinese embassy in Washington said , keeping their side of the line completely quiet. This split in communication shows how far apart the two governments are. Nobody trusts the call will actually happen. The silence comes while tensions between the world’s two biggest economies keep growing — not just over tariffs, rare minerals, or tech parts, but over how Trump and Xi work. Trump likes to deal directly. Xi does not. That difference is becoming a problem neither of them is fixing. China delays the call over trust issues with Trump According to CNN, Trump wants to talk directly to Xi, but Chinese officials are avoiding that for now. The reason? They don’t trust him. They’ve seen what he’s done in other situations — like the surprise pressure he put on Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa during talks. Even though those talks were supposed to be private, Trump turned them into awkward moments. Chinese officials don’t want to risk that happening with Xi, not even on a secure phone call. Meanwhile, Trump has been telling people for months that he expects to speak with Xi “soon.” He said it in spring. He said it last week. But nothing happened. That’s because the Chinese side doesn’t work like his team does. When Joe Biden met Xi in San Francisco two years ago, every tiny detail — from the timing to the translation to the flower arrangement — had to be agreed in advance. That’s normal for Xi, whose meetings are always scripted. People who’ve dealt with him say he sticks to the talking points and doesn’t go off-script unless it’s to make a rare personal comment. Last year, when Xi met Biden and spoke off the cuff, that was seen by US officials as a sign of deep respect. That’s not something Xi does for everyone. Most of the time, his phone calls are completely rehearsed, and actual decisions are made by his team weeks earlier. So while Trump pushes to negotiate live, Xi prefers everything locked in ahead of time — which kills Trump’s “top-down” style of dealmaking. Trade fight grows while leaders stay silent Inside the White House, Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week that “he’s very much involved in literally every policy discussion and decision,” especially on China. That includes the trade war, which got worse since Trump returned to office. He increased tariffs up to 145%, and Beijing struck back, expanding the fight beyond goods into the supply chain itself. The US now claims China is slowing down its exports of certain critical minerals — especially ones needed for magnet production — and that it’s violating agreements made during recent talks in Geneva. In those Geneva meetings, the two sides agreed to reduce some tariffs. That didn’t last. The US later said China had gone back on its word and blocked key minerals. Instead of improving, the relationship got even worse. Now it includes new measures, like Trump canceling student visas for Chinese nationals studying in the US and banning software exports that help design advanced chips. All of this was meant to pressure Xi, but it hasn’t led to a breakthrough. A senior White House official said this week, “The trade teams on both sides have determined that this needed to be elevated to the top.” Another official said Trump wants to press Xi about why China is dragging its feet on those mineral shipments. Trump believes Beijing is doing it on purpose. He also wants to remind Xi that he thinks China has more to lose from a failed trade deal than the US does — a view shared by his staff, who believe this gives them the upper hand. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said over the weekend, “I’m confident that when President Trump and Party Chairman Xi have a call this will be ironed out.” But that’s assuming Xi ever calls back. Trump hasn’t stopped trying. Yesterday, he posted on Truth Social: “I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!” That sums up where things stand — Trump wants results, and Xi won’t even pick up the phone.

A Perfect Call at $3.36 and What Followed Hunt recalled that his team had accurately called XRP’s previous high at $3.36, a price they predicted would act as a temporary top. Since hitting that level, XRP has fallen into what he describes as a falling wedge pattern — a technical setup where the price steadily moves lower within a narrowing range. Typically, falling wedges tend to break upwards, and Hunt expects XRP to follow this pattern eventually. The Importance of the $2 Support Zone According to Hunt, the $2 mark has become one of the most crucial support levels for XRP. Even though the token dipped below it a few times, each drop was quickly bought up, showing there are big buyers in that area. He believes this is a good sign for long-term bulls, as it means strong hands are defending the price around $2. While the current market isn’t showing much strength — especially with Bitcoin taking a hit recently — XRP still hasn’t broken down decisively. Hunt points out that while he exited some of his positions at the $3.36 high, he’s watching for a chance to jump back in if XRP drops slightly below $2 for brief periods, as it could offer “one or two lucky fills.” Why the Falling Wedge Matters The falling wedge pattern XRP is stuck in has lasted longer than expected, but according to Hunt, the longer this kind of setup holds, the stronger the eventual breakout tends to be. He explained that most of XRP’s trading action has happened in the lower half of the wedge, hinting that pressure is building for an upward move. However, Hunt warns that external market shocks — such as geopolitical conflicts or economic crises — could temporarily derail this setup.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 08:02:52

This significant leap marks the strongest upward movement among the top 10 exchanges this quarter and underscores HTX’s growing global influence and robust platform performance. Kaiko, a trusted provider of institutional-grade crypto market data and indices, assessed 45 leading spot exchanges across six weighted dimensions: Governance, Liquidity, Technology, Business, Security, and Data Quality. HTX distinguished itself particularly in the Business and Technology categories, while maintaining top-tier performance in Security. Business Strength: Ranked Second in the Industry HTX secured the No. 2 position globally in the Business category, reflecting its exceptional product depth, operational scale, and innovation capacity. In April alone, HTX listed 14 new tokens covering trending sectors such as staking infrastructure and on-chain narratives. Standout performers included: STO, which saw a post-listing surge of 303% DARK (MCP narrative), up 246% HOUSE (Solana-based meme coin), up 176% HTX also became the first exchange globally to list USD1 (World Liberty Financial USD), a new entrant in the stablecoin space, further cementing its position as a first-mover in emerging asset classes. According to DeFiLlama, HTX achieved a net capital inflow of $472 million in April, the highest among global CEXs—surpassing competitors by 6–7x. In addition, CoinGecko’s 2025 Q1 Crypto Industry Report named HTX the only Top 10 exchange with positive spot trading growth, bucking broader market headwinds. Technological Excellence and Seamless User Experience HTX also ranked among the top performers in the Technology dimension, which Kaiko defines by factors such as platform uptime, API latency, and throughput under high-load conditions. HTX’s consistent system stability and ultra-low-latency infrastructure have enabled it to deliver a high-frequency trading environment trusted by both retail and institutional users. In Kaiko’s analysis, technological excellence is a core driver of user retention—and HTX’s performance reinforces its standing as a premium trading venue.

The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is shaping up to be a major force to reckon with in the crypto world. To ensure the project is a resounding success, the team has been working on a few important developments that are worth highlighting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Passes Certik Audit One of the biggest pieces of news to come from the team is that the Mutuum Finance protocol has passed a Certik audit. That effectively means that the platform is safe for buyers, sellers, and liquidators, who are the primary target of the platform. Certik is the leading audit service in crypto and has earned a reputation for being a trusted source of audits for crypto projects. In fact, it is so trusted that most investors never invest in a project that has not presented a Certik audit. Consequently, the Certik audit is expected to boost participation in the presale, which has been a huge success so far. CoinMarketCap Listing Announcement CoinMarketCap is the biggest crypto price data aggregator in the world. With thousands of tokens listed on the platform, it is used by millions of people worldwide. The platform listed MUTM tokens, which could potentially bring millions of people into the project due to the visibility provided there. Another point worth noting is that CoinMarketCap is a trusted source of data. To maintain this reputation, the platform only accepts projects that meet certain requirements. The fact that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) managed to get a listing while still in the presale demonstrates the high level of confidence in its design. Beta Version Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. This beta platform will act as a technology demonstrator of what Mutuum Finance has to offer. The launch is expected to boost interest in the MUTM token, which could send its price to new highs. Since the announcement, interest in the presale has seen a massive uptick as investors scramble to get a share before the launch. With a planned listing price of $0.06, many investors are working hard to exit from current projects and join MUTM at the low price of $0.03 per token. The presale is currently in Phase 5, and over 20% of the tokens have been sold since the phase began around a week ago. In the upcoming phase, the token price is set to increase by 16.67% to $0.035. This increase will reduce the guaranteed return, based on the listing price, to 71.43% from the current 100%. With such a massive opportunity hanging in the balance, many presale buyers are trying to beat the clock. So far, over 11,600 unique buyers have already grabbed their tokens. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Offers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol. That means buyers always retain full control over their assets. When lenders deposit assets, they begin to earn interest on those assets based on the utilization rate of a pool. In exchange for depositing their assets in a pool, the lenders are given mtTokens, which grant them instant liquidity. The mTokens can be traded on secondary exchanges or used as collateral for new loans on the platform. Mutuum Finance is designed for long-term stability. To achieve this goal, the team will place numerous checks and balances in place, which include limiting some tokens from the platform. They will also ensure that all loans on the platform are over-collateralized to the right level. This will ensure that depositors do not face problems with solvency. Another measure they have in place is liquidation; if collateralization for a given position drops below a certain threshold, the loan is instantly liquidated. Liquidators can then step in and purchase the debt at a small discount. That helps to protect the long-term solvency of the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not plan to be just another token in the DeFi world. It aims to be the main token of decentralized finance. To achieve this goal, it focuses on user security and protocol solvency. Over the long term, this will ensure growth in liquidity pools while positioning itself as a trusted platform. It will carefully balance promoting protocol participation and ensuring only quality tokens can be added. Another area of focus for the team is cost-cutting. To do this, they will focus on coming up with strategies to reduce calldata, which is often the main source of transaction costs. Additionally, by limiting the number of tokens added on the platform, it will help to cut back on complexity, which will reduce overall gas fees. At the current price of $0.03, coupled with the expected features of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), joining the presale could turn out to be one of the wisest crypto investment decisions of 2025.

Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining attention as a pivotal player. Here's an exploration of recent developments that underline its rising prominence in the crypto community. New Developments in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A key milestone for Mutuum Finance this year is its successful pass of a Certik audit. Known for its rigorous security standards, Certik has endorsed Mutuum Finance as a secure platform for all its users, encompassing buyers, sellers, and liquidators. This validation is crucial as it not only boosts user confidence but also plays a vital role in attracting new participants to its ongoing presale. Adding to its credibility and market presence, Mutuum Finance has been listed on CoinMarketCap. This listing is particularly significant given that CoinMarketCap is a leading crypto price data aggregator with a global user base. Achieving this listing in its presale phase is a testament to the robustness and potential of Mutuum Finance. The visibility from this platform is expected to significantly enhance user engagement and investment. Pre-Launch Excitement and Presale Success As anticipation builds, Mutuum Finance is gearing up to launch a beta version of its platform. Scheduled to coincide with the token listing day, this launch is strategically designed to showcase the platform's capabilities and to spike further interest in the MUTM token. Consequently, the presale phase has seen a remarkable uptake, drawing over 11,600 unique buyers motivated by the attractive initial offering price of $0.03 per token. This is especially notable as the listing price is projected at $0.06, promising substantial returns. What Sets Mutuum Finance Apart Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol. It ensures that lenders retain full control over their assets while earning interest. Users who deposit assets receive mtTokens, providing them liquidity and opportunities for further investments. The platform also emphasizes user security, a crucial aspect to foster trust and long-term growth. To ensure platform stability and protect investor interests, Mutuum enforces strict loan-to-value ratios and mechanisms for instant liquidation to manage solvency risks effectively. By focusing on system integrity and cutting operational costs, Mutuum Finance is strategically positioning itself as a leader in the decentralized finance space.

After a volatile start to the year, recent corrections have opened discussions among investors about potential repositioning. Many are watching how these fluctuations could shape opportunities for the next bull run. Analysts observing current trends believe market dips are not unusual during broader consolidation phases. Rather than signaling weakness, they often allow for strategic positioning focused on long-term gains. By studying how previous cycles recovered, investors can understand that moments like this can offer better entry points when evaluating innovation-driven cryptocurrencies. This article highlights three tokens that reflect the growing market. Among them is Dawgz AI , an emerging project that blends blockchain technology with AI, alongside two established names that have maintained a consistent market presence. Each token offers different characteristics for those considering their options carefully in the current environment. Why Buying the Dip Appeals to Investors Historical market data shows that buying the dip has often been a profitable strategy for those who stay focused on long-term growth. After Bitcoin’s decline in 2018, the token recovered steadily, reaching new highs by 2021. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin’s price rose from under $4,000 in early 2019 to nearly $69,000 two years later. Similar patterns can be observed with Ethereum, which has navigated multiple market cycles and continues to drive a significant portion of the decentralized finance sector. Crypto enthusiasts believe that market dips provide investors with better entry points to acquire assets. Rather than chasing momentum during market peaks, accumulating during price corrections helps improve cost efficiency. Reports from Nasdaq suggest that disciplined accumulation during bear phases often positions portfolios for more substantial gains during the next upswing. Buying during corrections is not about timing the exact bottom. It focuses on maintaining a long-term perspective where price fluctuations become part of a broader strategy. While the market remains volatile, history indicates that tokens with solid fundamentals and real use cases often recover as conditions improve. This approach favors patience and research over speculation. Key Factors to Analyze Before Buying Cryptocurrencies Technology remains a core factor when researching new cryptocurrencies. Investors often focus on blockchain scalability, transaction speeds, and integration with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence. According to CoinDesk , projects that improve network efficiency and security tend to gain stronger adoption. Blockchain solutions that address fundamental limitations attract not only retail investors but also developers building decentralized applications. Community strength is another critical indicator of a project’s long-term potential. A transparent and engaged community often reflects the credibility of a cryptocurrency. Forbes Digital Assets reports that decentralized projects with active governance models usually build stronger trust. These communities drive development and ensure that decisions align with broader user interests rather than being controlled by a small group. Tokenomics plays a key role in sustaining growth. Investors examine supply caps, inflation rates, and staking incentives before deciding where to allocate their funds. A healthy model supports stability and rewards long-term participation. These fundamentals are crucial when determining which projects align with a strategy centered on the best crypto to buy now . Highlighting strong use cases, community trust, and sustainable tokenomics helps filter projects worth deeper research in a volatile market. 3 Cryptocurrencies Investors Are Monitoring Now Dawgz AI (DAWGZ) As blockchain technology moves closer to real-world applications, one segment drawing new interest is the combination of artificial intelligence and decentralized systems. Among the projects gaining attention is Dawgz AI, a token that focuses on building an efficient AI-powered ecosystem within the Ethereum network. Instead of stretching into NFTs or unrelated areas, Dawgz AI maintains a clear direction by prioritizing token utility and community growth. Dawgz AI has raised over $3.7 million. It is now priced at $0.00438. These figures reflect growing trust from early supporters who see potential in its focused strategy. According to the audit by SolidProof , Dawgz AI has completed key verification steps, improving transparency for future holders. This audit adds another layer of confidence for those assessing new opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. By targeting two of the strongest areas in technology — artificial intelligence and blockchain — Dawgz AI aligns itself with larger trends without overcomplicating its mission. Its emphasis on simplicity, combined with an active community, makes it a project that many are starting to take notice of. For investors researching innovation-focused tokens, Dawgz AI represents an accessible entry point tied to fundamental digital transformation themes. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and continues to set the standard for decentralized finance. It was the first project to introduce a peer-to-peer payment system without intermediaries. CoinMarketCap indicates that as of June 4, 2025, Bitcoin maintains a market capitalization of approximately $2.09 trillion, and as of today, the price is trading at around $105,435.22. Institutional adoption keeps Bitcoin relevant. Large financial organizations have increasingly explored Bitcoin as a store of value. Nasdaq highlights that many funds now hold Bitcoin alongside traditional assets, further validating its place in modern portfolios. As the market matures, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty has become more prominent. Bitcoin’s ability to recover from previous market corrections gives it a reputation for resilience. CoinMarketCap provides historical data showing how Bitcoin rebounded after major drawdowns. This track record supports the view among crypto enthusiasts that Bitcoin remains an essential asset to watch during both volatile and stable periods. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum holds a strong position in blockchain technology by offering more than just transactions. It provides the infrastructure for smart contracts, decentralized finance applications, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As of June 4, 2025, Binance reports that Ethereum has a current price of about $2,540.86 and a market cap of nearly $306.74 billion. It puts it second only to Bitcoin in overall market valuation. One key factor behind Ethereum’s growth is the adoption of its innovative contract capabilities. Developers favor Ethereum for building decentralized applications because of its flexibility and reliability. The network’s shift to Proof-of-Stake has reduced its energy consumption, a change that aligns with current environmental expectations. The Guardian notes that this move helps strengthen Ethereum’s reputation as a future-ready blockchain platform. Ethereum also benefits from strong developer activity and community support. CoinMarketCap data highlights its consistent market share in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These strengths give Ethereum a durable position in the cryptocurrency sector, making it a frequent choice for investors aiming to balance innovation with stability. Why Dawgz AI Aligns with Emerging Trends Artificial intelligence and blockchain are two areas that continue to gain attention for their practical uses in digital infrastructure. Investors are starting to look beyond price speculation and focus more on how these technologies solve real problems. Dawgz AI aligns with this shift by offering a straightforward project that focuses on developing an AI-powered blockchain system. It avoids unnecessary features like NFTs and focuses on straightforward token utility, which aligns with current investor expectations. A growing number of analysts suggest that blockchain projects with a focused use case and transparent development plans are better positioned for long-term growth. Tokens that combine real technological frameworks with active community involvement are often seen as more sustainable. Dawgz AI’s audit by SolidProof, along with its early fundraising success, supports its standing as a serious project among AI-based cryptocurrencies. Investor interest is shifting toward projects that demonstrate both innovation and a commitment to practical applications. Dawgz AI effectively addresses both areas without overextending into multiple sectors. By staying focused on its core mission, it appeals to those seeking digital assets that offer both accessibility and a clear growth strategy. This focus helps align it with broader market shifts where utility and simplicity are driving new investment decisions.

45541802,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=166410,1749111009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45541802.jpeg,Bitcoin Network Activity Surges: What it Means for Price Consolidation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-network-activity-consolidation/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Network Activity Surges: What it Means for Price Consolidation The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing, but sometimes, quiet periods in price action mask significant underlying movements. This appears to be the case with Bitcoin recently, as fascinating data from crypto analytics firm Santiment highlights a notable spike in activity on the network, even as the BTC price consolidation phase continues. Decoding the Spike in Bitcoin Network Activity According to Santiment’s observations shared on X (formerly Twitter), the Bitcoin network witnessed a dramatic increase in two key metrics: New Wallet Creation: On May 29, a staggering 556,830 new Bitcoin wallets were created. Santiment noted this was the highest daily figure recorded since December 2, 2023. This metric often serves as a pulse check on potential new entrants or increased interest in the asset. On-Chain Volume: Just a few days later, on June 2, the network saw 241,360 BTC transferred on-chain. This figure marked the largest single-day transfer volume since December 8, 2023 (assuming the year was 2023 based on typical data patterns). High on-chain volume indicates significant value moving across the network, which can be driven by various factors including large institutional transfers, exchange activity, or whale movements. While conventional wisdom suggests that increased network activity is a bullish signal, pointing towards growing adoption and usage, Santiment added a crucial caveat. They highlighted that this surge is occurring during a period where Bitcoin’s price has been largely consolidating, trading within a relatively tight range rather than establishing a clear upward or downward trend. This specific context makes the activity particularly noteworthy and warrants closer examination. Why the Surge in New Bitcoin Wallets Matters During Consolidation The creation of hundreds of thousands of new Bitcoin wallets in a single day is a significant event. But what does it truly signify, especially when the price isn’t making big moves? Here are a few potential interpretations: Potential for New Adoption: It could indicate a fresh wave of individuals or entities setting up wallets, possibly preparing to enter the market or already accumulating Bitcoin quietly during the consolidation phase. Increased Distribution/Accumulation Tactics: Existing holders, particularly large ones (whales), might be distributing their holdings across multiple wallets or consolidating smaller amounts into new addresses. This is a common tactic for privacy or strategic positioning. Exchange Activity: Exchanges often create new wallets for various purposes, including managing user deposits and withdrawals or internal shuffling of funds. A spike could relate to increased user onboarding or operational changes at major platforms. Speculative Interest: Sometimes, new wallets are created in anticipation of specific events, such as potential airdrops (though less common for native BTC) or forks, although this is a less likely primary driver for such a massive single-day spike. During consolidation, a jump in new wallets could suggest that ‘smart money’ or early participants are positioning themselves before a potential price breakout. Alternatively, it could simply be noise from automated processes or short-term speculative interest that doesn’t translate into sustained buying pressure. Understanding High On-Chain Volume in a Sideways Market Just like new wallets, high on-chain volume can be interpreted in multiple ways. When 241,360 BTC (worth billions of dollars at current prices) move in a single day, it demands attention. Here’s what it might imply during a phase of BTC price consolidation : Large Investor Movements: Significant volume often points to large players moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. This could be institutions rebalancing portfolios, over-the-counter (OTC) deals taking place off public exchanges, or whales shifting assets. Exchange Inflows/Outflows: A large portion of on-chain volume relates to funds moving to or from exchanges. High inflows could suggest intent to sell or trade, while high outflows might signal accumulation and a move towards cold storage. Monitoring exchange net flows alongside total volume provides better context. Internal Transfers: Sometimes, large entities (like custodians or exchanges) perform internal transfers between their own wallets, which adds to the on-chain volume without necessarily indicating market intent. Preparation for Volatility: Increased volume during consolidation can be seen as participants getting ready for a potential price swing. They might be moving funds to exchanges to trade the expected volatility or moving funds off exchanges for long-term holding. When volume spikes during consolidation, it often suggests that a significant move might be brewing. The challenge is determining the direction. Is it large players accumulating supply from impatient sellers, or is it distribution from those looking to exit before a potential downturn? This is where looking at the destination of the transfers becomes critical – are coins moving onto exchanges (potentially bearish) or off exchanges (potentially bullish)? Why Santiment Says This Trend is Worth Watching The key takeaway from the Santiment analysis is not just that activity is high, but that its timing alongside BTC price consolidation is particularly interesting. Santiment’s expertise lies in providing behavioral and on-chain data insights, and their caution suggests that while the numbers look positive on the surface, the context requires deeper analysis. During periods of strong price trends, high activity typically confirms the trend’s strength. However, during consolidation, high activity can be ambiguous. It could be: Under-the-Radar Accumulation: Large players might be quietly buying up supply within the tight price range, absorbing selling pressure without causing a significant price increase yet. This would be bullish long-term. Stealth Distribution: Conversely, large players might be selling into any demand that arises within the range, offloading their holdings without triggering a major price drop immediately. This would be bearish long-term. Increased Speculative Fidgeting: Traders might be moving funds more frequently between wallets and exchanges in anticipation of volatility, leading to higher volume without a clear directional bias yet. Santiment’s alert serves as a reminder that raw data points, while valuable, need interpretation within the broader market structure. The increased activity suggests that beneath the calm surface of price consolidation, significant movements of Bitcoin are occurring, which could prefigure the next major price move. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should investors and traders take away from this report on Bitcoin network activity ? Context is King: Understand that high activity during consolidation is different from high activity during a trend. It’s a signal of potential change, not necessarily confirmation of a current direction. Look Deeper: Don’t stop at the headline numbers. If possible, use on-chain analysis tools (like those offered by Santiment or others) to investigate where the activity is happening. Are funds flowing into or out of exchanges? Are large dormant wallets becoming active? Combine Metrics: On-chain data is powerful but best used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as technical analysis (chart patterns during consolidation), market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors. Prepare for Volatility: Increased activity during consolidation often precedes a breakout. While the direction isn’t guaranteed, being aware that a significant move could be coming allows you to prepare your strategy. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reports from reputable analytics firms like Santiment for ongoing insights into network behavior. The surge in new Bitcoin wallets and on-chain volume reported by Santiment is a compelling development. It indicates that even during a period of BTC price consolidation , the underlying network is highly active. This hidden activity could be the precursor to the market’s next major move, highlighting the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics alongside price charts. Conclusion: The Calm Before the Storm? The recent data from Santiment paints a picture of a Bitcoin network bustling with activity, even as the price takes a breather. The significant increase in new wallets and on-chain transfer volume suggests that participants are actively engaging with the network. While the direction isn’t yet clear from this data alone, the heightened activity during BTC price consolidation strongly implies that forces are positioning themselves. Whether this portends an imminent bullish breakout fueled by accumulation or a bearish downturn driven by distribution remains to be seen. However, the message is clear: beneath the surface stability, the Bitcoin market is dynamic, and watching these on-chain signals closely is crucial for understanding what might come next.

The decision follows a wider regulatory push to tap global capital in its growing virtual asset market by encouraging institutional involvement. The SFC’s upcoming derivatives framework targets a market surpassing spot crypto trading in size and velocity. TokenInsight data shows that crypto derivatives traded $21 trillion in Q1 2025 instead of $4.6 trillion in spot trades. These include futures and options, which provide the advantages of greater liquidity and hedging opportunities for the sophisticated trader. Leading industry stakeholders have advocated for Hong Kong crypto derivatives for quite some time. Deribit’s chief commercial officer, Jean David Péquignot, referred to it as a key part of the city’s virtual asset framework. Earlier this year, Péquignot spoke of the challenge of getting more institutional participants due to the lack of derivatives regulations. Amid intense competition among the world’s global financial centers, there is an uptick towards institutional-grade infrastructure. In response, Hong Kong is sculpting its tax incentives and legal frameworks to position itself as Asia’s most favored crypto hub. Stablecoin law passes as policy framework grows In May, regulations were approved for stablecoins in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, further aligning with international regulatory standards. The law also introduces a licensing scheme for fiat-referenced stablecoins that will further boost investors’ trust in digital assets tied to real-world currencies. Paul Chan, the Financial Secretary, said the new legislation is vital for providing a platform to build more sophisticated financial products. Most recently, the region’s authorities launched virtual asset spot ETFs and inverse futures products to diversify its digital market further. There are also steps being taken to refine the broader tax regime. Hong Kong officials said digital assets could soon be eligible for tax concessions now given to investment funds, single-family offices and carried interest structures. This could also attract more high-net-worth investors and global asset managers to take part in the city’s crypto ecosystem. The government is also streamlining licensing, tax, and compliance navigation for digital finance companies operating in the Greater Bay Area and mainland China, with support from Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Key Enterprises Office. Second policy statement and global alignment ahead A second virtual asset policy statement will be published by the SFC later in 2025. Further integration of Web3 infrastructure into mainstream finance and further clarification on rules surrounding custodial responsibilities, risk disclosures, and investor classification are expected in the announcement. In September 2024, Hong Kong regulators said they would implement crypto OTC derivatives reporting standards established by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The move aligns the oversight of the city closer to international norms and could be attractive to institutions that want regulatory certainty. Asia’s first spot crypto ETFs have been launched in Hong Kong, as well as nine virtual asset trading platform (VATP) licenses thus far. Over 1,100 fintech firms are based in the territory, with eight digital banks, four virtual insurers, and 10 regulated digital asset platforms. Hong Kong’s current trajectory was based on the original 2022 policy framework. The move comes after China banned crypto throughout the country, leaving Hong Kong as a regulated alternative across the region. However, since then, the crypto firms displaced by mainland restrictions have shown keen interest in the city. Hong Kong was ranked second most crypto-friendly city after Ljubljana, Slovenia, by migration advisory platform Multipolitan in a recent report. The ranking was on the basis of infrastructure, regulation, and innovation support. The report fits with the government’s goals. At the Consensus conference, Financial Secretary Chan affirmed that the city’s strategy is consistent with its “commitment to building a thriving digital asset ecosystem.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|BTC|ETH|HKD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-05 09:30:23

Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd, which focuses on developing gold and silver projects across Asia, said Thursday it intends to become the first publicly listed UK mining firm to adopt a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy. The move signals growing interest among real asset firms in using Bitcoin as a reserve asset, a trend that has picked up momentum in recent months as inflation concerns and digital asset legitimacy gain ground. Bluebird Outlines Strategy to Store Value in Bitcoin, Not Just Gold The miner said its future income from gold mining projects will be systematically recycled into Bitcoin, calling it a proactive approach to treasury management. The company added that it will maintain minimal corporate overhead to support this shift.

The firm said further announcements regarding this policy would follow in due course. UK Miner Balances Gold Operations with a Bold Bitcoin Pivot Bluebird Mining Ventures, formerly known as Bluebird Merchant Ventures, focuses on reviving high-grade, low-capex gold mines in Asia. It operates through a joint venture model. Currently, its key assets include the Gubong Gold Mine and the Kochang Gold and Silver Mine in South Korea. Both were closed in the 1970s due to a sharp decline in gold prices. In addition, the company owns the Batangas Gold Project in the Philippines. Under its JV model, Bluebird offers technical leadership. Meanwhile, its local partners provide operational support and funding. So far, the company has secured over $9m in committed capital. Out of this, $5m is allocated to Gubong and $2m to Kochang. The miner is estimated to hold a total resource of about 1.8m ounces of gold across all three projects. Moreover, its leadership team brings experience in developing gold projects across Southeast Asia. They have also invested about $2m of their own capital into the business. Bluebird is listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker BMV. It operates with a lean team of around seven employees. Additionally, the company is registered in the British Virgin Islands and is currently led by Interim CEO Aidan Bishop. This announcement positions Bluebird among a growing number of companies considering Bitcoin as an alternative store of value . While tech firms like MicroStrategy have pioneered this shift, Bluebird’s move shows that even traditional extractive industries are beginning to adopt Bitcoin as a hedge and long-term asset.

From Internet Buzz to Institutional Reality Gordon’s surprise may resonate with many retail investors and even industry observers who are only now grasping the scale of Ripple’s ambition and progress. For years, Ripple, the company behind XRP, has pursued one mission: to revolutionize cross-border payments. Its solution, built around XRP and the RippleNet network, addresses the limitations of the traditional banking infrastructure, namely, high fees, delayed settlements, and limited transparency. I just found out XRP is replacing SWIFT — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) June 5, 2025 By contrast, SWIFT (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) has served as the backbone of international banking since the 1970s, connecting over 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries. Yet despite its global reach, SWIFT is increasingly viewed as outdated in the digital age, often requiring 2–5 days for settlement and involving multiple intermediary banks, each taking a cut and adding friction. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product eliminates the need for pre-funded accounts and facilitates instant cross-border transactions using XRP as a bridge currency. This makes it not just faster, but significantly more cost-efficient—qualities that give XRP a compelling edge in an evolving financial system. ISO 20022 and Ripple’s Strategic Positioning The shift to ISO 20022, a new global standard for electronic financial messages, has become a pivotal moment in this transformation. SWIFT itself is migrating to ISO 20022 by 2025, signaling a major update to the underlying messaging language of global banking. Notably, Ripple is one of the few blockchain firms registered as a member of the ISO 20022 Standards Body. This isn’t a minor footnote. It means Ripple’s technology is not just interoperable with the future of global finance, it’s helping define it. XRP’s advanced integration and forward-thinking design make it well-suited to complement or potentially replace traditional systems such as SWIFT in specific payment corridors. Ripple’s Expanding Global Footprint Far from being a hypothetical solution, Ripple’s ecosystem is already in operation across dozens of corridors worldwide. Banks and payment providers in regions such as Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East are using RippleNet and XRP to facilitate remittances, corporate payments, and real-time settlements . Strategic partnerships with institutions like SBI Holdings in Japan and Tranglo in Asia have further validated Ripple’s model. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, Ripple’s collaboration with central banks underscores its expanding influence in official monetary ecosystems. Each of these steps demonstrates that Ripple’s roadmap isn’t just theoretical; it’s active, tested, and scaling. XRP vs. SWIFT: A Technological Showdown While SWIFT continues to rely on batch processing and multiple hops between correspondent banks , XRP transactions settle in seconds, with full traceability on a decentralized ledger. This not only improves operational efficiency but also strengthens compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. Even as SWIFT experiments with blockchain pilots and tokenization trials, Ripple is already delivering the kind of real-time, low-cost, and transparent transactions financial institutions need. The technology is here. The use cases are proven. And the regulatory outlook, once a cloud over XRP’s future, is beginning to clear. The Future Is Already in Motion Gordon’s post may have come off as a late realization, but it encapsulates a larger truth: what was once a fringe belief among XRP loyalists is steadily becoming institutional consensus. Ripple doesn’t need to destroy SWIFT to succeed, it only needs to outperform it where it matters most. And increasingly, it is doing exactly that. The crypto millionaire’s discovery is symbolic of a broader awakening within the investment community. XRP is no longer just a speculative asset; it’s part of a fully operational payment ecosystem that challenges the dominance of SWIFT. Whether XRP outright replaces SWIFT or works alongside it in a new global financial paradigm, one thing is clear: the rules of money movement are changing, and XRP is right at the center of that transformation.

Solana’s price hovers near $174, teasing a breakout toward $300. Cardano trades at $0.7524, buoyed by ETF approval odds climbing to 71%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi star, is in its fifth presale phase at $0.03, with over $9,900,000 raised and 530 million tokens sold to 11,700 holders. These coins signal robust potential, driven by unique strengths. But why are these altcoins dominating crypto investment conversations and what sets them apart in today’s dynamic market? Solana’s breakout potential Solana (SOL) is making progress in the crypto sector, valued at $174 and sticking within a narrow range that indicates it may soon move higher. Many analysts forecast SOL will rise to $300 which could happen after a $230 million short squeeze if the price hits $180. High trading volumes, up 20% to $3.48 billion, reflect strong accumulation. Crypto charts show a solid support zone, historically sparking rebounds. Positive funding rates on exchanges like Binance bolster bullish sentiment. While other altcoins vie for attention, Solana’s scalability and speed position it as a leader. Investors eye SOL as a top crypto for short-term gains, with momentum building steadily. Cardano’s ETF-driven surge Cardano (ADA) is riding a wave of optimism, with its price at $0.7524 and ETF approval odds at 71%. The SEC’s looming decision on Grayscale’s Cardano ETF could push ADA past $1. Crypto prices reflect cautious trading, but technicals show strength above the 100-week moving average. Long-term EMAs signal bullish potential, despite a neutral RSI. Compared to newer blockchains, Cardano’s modest $443 million TVL highlights growth challenges. Yet, its robust ecosystem and ETF buzz make it a strong crypto investment. ADA’s potential to hit $2 draws investors seeking stability and upside in crypto markets. Mutuum Finance’s presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in DeFi, with Phase 5 of its presale underway at $0.03 per token. This phase follows a 200% price jump from the opening phase’s $0.01, offering early buyers a 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Phase 6 will raise the price to $0.035, a 16.7% increase. Over $9,900,000 raised and 530 million tokens sold to 11,700 holders underscore demand. Analysts project a post-launch target of $2, implying a 6,566% gain. Mutuum Finance’s dual lending model sets it apart, making it a top crypto to buy now for long-term investors. Mutuum’s innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending, enhancing transparency and user control. The Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools for passive income, with dynamic interest rates boosting returns. The P2P model enables direct, intermediary-free loan agreements, fostering flexibility. A forthcoming Ethereum-based stablecoin, pegged to the USD, ensures secure transactions. Layer-2 integration promises low fees and fast transactions, unlike Solana or Cardano’s base-layer constraints. Crypto predictions highlight Mutuum Finance’s scalability, positioning it as a DeFi frontrunner. Investors see MUTM as a top crypto for its practical utility and growth potential. Mutuum’s security and community strength The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is bolstering trust, having finalized a Certik audit with a 70.00 security score, revealing no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. Active monitoring and moderate social media engagement enhance transparency. The team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens to maintain their rankings. This incentivizes loyalty, unlike Solana or Cardano’s broader market focus. Crypto investing in MUTM offers a unique blend of security and community-driven growth. With its beta platform launching alongside the token, Mutuum Finance is a top crypto to buy now. The spotlight on Solana, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underscores their unique roles in crypto markets. Solana’s speed and breakout potential, Cardano’s ETF-driven momentum, and Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation make them compelling choices. MUTM, with its presale success and projected $2 post-launch target, offers unmatched upside. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should act quickly, as Mutuum Finance’s Phase 5 window narrows.

The recent performance of US spot ETH ETFs is certainly catching attention. These investment vehicles, which allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly holding the cryptocurrency, have been on a remarkable run. What’s Driving the Latest ETH Inflows? According to data shared by analyst Trader T on X, US spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs saw a total net inflow of $57.31 million on June 4. This figure might seem modest compared to some Bitcoin ETF days, but it represents a significant milestone: the 13th consecutive trading day of net inflows for these products. This sustained period of positive flow suggests growing interest and potentially increasing institutional participation since these funds began trading. After a relatively slow start following their launch, the consistent inflows indicate a potential shift in investor sentiment or strategy regarding Ethereum exposure via regulated products. Breaking Down the Ethereum ETF Activity While the overall trend is positive, the activity across different issuers shows varying investor preferences on June 4: BlackRock ETH ETF (ETHA): Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s fund recorded substantial inflows totaling $73.51 million . This dominance highlights BlackRock’s strong position in the market and investor confidence in their offering. Grayscale ETH ETF (ETH): Grayscale’s converted fund also saw positive movement, adding $7.42 million in inflows. While smaller than BlackRock’s, this inflow for Grayscale is noteworthy, especially considering their Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) often sees outflows. Fidelity ETH ETF (FETH): In contrast to the leaders, Fidelity’s fund experienced net outflows of $23.62 million . This indicates some investors chose to exit their positions in this particular ETF on June 4, potentially reallocating or taking profits. Other Funds: Several other US spot ETH ETFs reported no net flow for the day, meaning the total value of shares bought equaled the total value of shares sold for those specific products. The combined effect of these individual flows resulted in the overall net positive figure for the day. Why Do Sustained Inflows Matter for the Ethereum Market? Continuous ETH inflows into these regulated ETF products can have several implications: Increased Demand: ETFs often purchase the underlying asset (Ethereum) to back the shares bought by investors. Sustained inflows mean continuous buying pressure on ETH in the spot market, which can be a positive factor for its price. Institutional Adoption: ETFs are a preferred vehicle for many institutional investors, wealth managers, and even retail investors who prefer brokerage accounts over direct crypto exchanges. Consistent inflows suggest growing adoption by these larger capital sources. Market Validation: The success and sustained demand for US spot ETH ETFs provide further validation for Ethereum as an asset class in traditional finance circles. This can attract more attention and investment over time. Liquidity and Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for a broader range of investors to access Ethereum exposure, potentially increasing the overall liquidity and maturity of the ETH market. Comparing BlackRock ETH ETF Performance The strong performance of the BlackRock ETH ETF , particularly its significant lead in attracting inflows on June 4, is a key takeaway. BlackRock’s brand recognition and distribution network likely play a role in this. Their success could set a benchmark for other issuers and potentially influence the competitive landscape among the various Ethereum ETF offerings. What About the Grayscale ETH ETF? The Grayscale ETH ETF ‘s inflow, while smaller than BlackRock’s, is still significant. Grayscale’s fund was converted from a trust, and like its Bitcoin counterpart, it faced challenges with outflows during the conversion period. Seeing positive inflows suggests that some investors are choosing to stay or even add to their positions within the Grayscale structure, or new capital is entering this specific fund. Looking Ahead: The Future of US Spot ETH ETFs The streak of 13 consecutive days of inflows is a positive sign for the burgeoning US spot ETH ETFs market. While daily flows can fluctuate, a sustained trend provides confidence. Market participants will be closely watching whether this momentum continues and how the competition between issuers like BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, and others develops. Potential future catalysts could include broader regulatory clarity, increased educational efforts about these products, and Ethereum network developments that further enhance its appeal to investors. In Conclusion: A Positive Trajectory for Ethereum ETFs The recent data showing $57.31 million in net inflows for US spot ETH ETFs on June 4, extending a 13-day streak, underscores a period of growing positive sentiment and capital allocation towards Ethereum through regulated investment products. Led by strong performance from the BlackRock ETH ETF, and supported by inflows into the Grayscale ETH ETF despite some outflows from others like Fidelity, the overall picture is one of increasing adoption and market maturity. This trend is likely to be a key factor influencing Ethereum’s market dynamics moving forward, signaling potentially sustained demand from traditional finance channels.

SEC court case update June 5,https://finbold.com/ripple-v-sec-court-case-update-june-5/,"All eyes are on the long-running Ripple v. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case again, with June 16 marking the expiration of the SEC’s 60-day window to update the U.S. Court of Appeals on the status of the case. The deadline was set in April, when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to a pause following a joint request from Ripple and the SEC, on the condition that the SEC file a status report by June 15. Bill Morgan, Ripple’s attorney, noted that “something has to happen” by June 16, suggesting major procedural updates and the continuation of the appeals process are equally possible. The count down to the date the SEC must report to the Appeal Court is now 12 days. Something has to happen by then or the Appeal and Cross-appeal continues and a briefing is due from Ripple. pic.twitter.com/pxImvvJxGG — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 4, 2025 Is the XRP v. SEC court case finally ending? The legal community is more divided on whether a settlement is truly coming. For example, a recent court filing from Justin Keener , who is not a party in the dispute, is muddying the waters, as it is not the first time Keener has tried to have a say in the case. Attorney Andrew Balthazor of Holland & Knight is also skeptical, noting that both parties had plenty of time to file at least something. Since we still haven’t seen anything, Balthazor argues, the matter at hand is not at all simple. In contrast, Keri Axel of Waymaker LLP sees the slow momentum as a short-term hurdle and remains optimistic that Ripple and SEC are going to find some common ground. Whatever the end result might be, the case remains of great importance for the crypto community as it serves to illustrate how not only XRP but digital assets in general will be treated under U.S. securities law.

The layoffs are set to happen in the Shanghai and Dalian Citi Solution Centers of the bank, and are scheduled to be finalized by the beginning of the fourth quarter. According to a Thursday CNBC insight, the layoffs primarily affect roles within the information technology services unit. These include positions involved in software development, testing, maintenance, and various operational support functions for Citigroup’s international operations. In its statement, Citi explained that some of these roles would be relocated to other technology hubs, though it did not disclose which centers would absorb the positions or how many jobs would be transferred. Bank reduces global workforce The recent move in China is part of a global restructuring initiative announced by Citigroup in January 2023, which includes plans to cut 10% of its global workforce, approximately 20,000 employees. According to CEO Jane Fraser, the plan is to simplify the bank’s operations in order to increase profits and get back on track with competing banks. Citi has already made similar workforce reductions in the United States, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Poland. The firm also scaled down its physical office space in several of these markets. Yet, even after the job cuts, Citi promised to maintain and develop business ties in China. “We will continue to firmly serve corporate and institutional clients in China and serve their cross-border banking needs,” said Marc Luet, Citi’s president for Japan, North Asia, and Australia. Industry-wide restructuring after months of economic headwinds Much like Citigroup, other banks, particularly those with strong regional presence in China and broader Asia, have begun to implement their own cost-reduction plans. Hong Kong-based Hang Seng Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC, recently announced a business restructuring that will impact about 1% of its core staff. The layoffs, led by HSBC Group CEO Georges Elhedery, could slash costs by $1.8 billion by the end of 2026. The bank attributed the job reductions to a deteriorating global economy and a rise in non-performing loans from China’s property sector. Meanwhile, US banking giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America have started annual performance reviews resulting in job cuts. Bank of America has reportedly eliminated 150 positions in its investment banking division in 2025 as part of routine staffing adjustments. A recent business survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China revealed that a record number of US firms are considering relocating their manufacturing or sourcing operations outside China. The companies are worried about trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, exacerbated during President Donald Trump’s imposition of triple-digit tariffs on several Chinese imports in May. ppl living in the streets, threat of war with China, mass layoffs, sounds familiar, but, by god the markets must go up – insanity https://t.co/BvQkdyF9eg — Terry S. (@TerrySquibb1) June 3, 2025 Some Chinese workers like Liu Shengzun, a 42-year-old former factory worker in Guangdong, lost two jobs within one month this spring. The manufacturing plants where he worked, one for lighting products and another for footwear, were forced to trim down operations due to the trade costs. “ It’s been extremely difficult this year to find steady employment, ” said Liu, who previously earned up to 6,000 yuan per month, but now cries that he “struggles to afford food.” Data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics indicates the number of urban workers reemployed after layoffs rose to 5.15 million by December 2024, up from 3.88 million in September. The number is now projected to go down significantly by the end of Q2 2025. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

KAS, with a potential surge, could go as high as $0.8310 by the end of 2030. Before diving into the Kaspa (KAS) price prediction, let’s first understand what this project is. Kaspa is a top-tier decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency that utilizes a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, enabling faster transactions. Its blockchain technology tops that of traditional blockchains. As we move into 2025, technological advancements continue to shape the crypto landscape. However, predicting or forecasting the price of any cryptocurrency remains challenging due to its highly volatile nature. That being said, let us have an overview of Kaspa (KAS) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030. Table of Contents Overview Kaspa Coin Price Prediction 2025 Kaspa Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 KAS Price Targets 2026 Kaspa Price Projection 2027 Kaspa (KAS) Price Prediction 2028 KAS Price Forecast 2029 Kaspa Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s KAS Coin Price Prediction Overview Cryptocurrency Kaspa Token KAS Price $ 0.08450311 -4.32% Market cap $ 2,220,047,825.4976 Circulating Supply 26,271,788,729.1424 Trading Volume $ 50,940,946.4982 All-time high $0.20 on 29th July 2024 All-time low $0.00050 on 29th September 2022 24 High Coming soon 24 Low Coming Soon Kaspa (KAS) Technical Analysis and Price Action According to expert technical analysis, KAS appears bearish, following a lower high and lower low price action pattern since the beginning of 2025. During this period, the asset has formed four lower highs and three lower lows, and the price is now heading toward another lower low. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the asset remains below the latest lower high, KAS could experience a significant price drop and form another lower low in the coming days. However, if the asset breaks above the recent lower high and closes a daily candle above it, it could shift both market sentiment and the sentiment surrounding the asset. Currently, the asset is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating that it is in a downtrend. Kaspa Coin Price Prediction 2025 As the KAS daily chart has formed a bearish price action pattern and the price is at a crucial level of $0.082, there is a strong possibility that the asset could drop by 45% to reach the $0.043 level in 2025. On the other hand, if KAS breaks out of this bearish pattern, surpasses the lower high, and closes a daily candle above the $0.0834 level, it could soar by 50% to reach $0.125 in the future. Hence, the average price KAS could witness in 2025 is around $0.065. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 0.043 0.065 0.125 See where Binance Coin is headed!

Recently, three major companies—Wellgistics Health, VivoPower International, and Webus International, announced plans to use XRP as a treasury reserve asset for their businesses. Let’s see how this could impact XRP’s future. Wellgistics Health Puts $50 Million Into XRP Wellgistics Health, a pharmaceutical company that distributes medicines in the US, shared exciting news. They have a $50 million credit line to help them start using XRP for real-time payments. This means they want to move away from old, slow payment systems and use Ripple’s blockchain to make faster and more secure payments. It could be a smart move that helps them stay ahead of the competition. VivoPower Plans Big XRP Purchases VivoPower International PLC has also shown its keen interest in creating an XRP-based digital asset treasury. They recently raised $121 million with help from Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. Out of that money, $100 million will be used to buy XRP tokens. VivoPower wants to be one of the first companies in the world to focus on using XRP in its business. They are working with BitGo to make sure they buy and hold XRP safely. Webus International Plans a $300 Million XRP Reserve Webus International, a China-based travel and hospitality giant, the company has shared plans to raise $300 million. This money will create a strategic XRP reserve, according to documents filed with the US SEC . Webus wants to tap into Ripple’s powerful blockchain network to simplify cross-border transactions. The idea is simple, faster payments and better transparency for their global bookings. How This Could Impact XRP Meanwhile, some experts believe that these big plans could help XRP become even more important. Right now, XRP’s price is trading around $2.18 , almost 33% down from its all-time high of $3.38. Another interesting thing is that the big institutions are holding XRP shows there is real demand and trust in it.

With the Open Mainnet launch scheduled for late 2025, traders and early adopters are bracing for clarity and a shift in market momentum. Pi Network Price Prediction: What Next? After hitting a local high of $2.9645, the PI/USDT pair sharply retraced, forming a strong support base near $0.38 . This zone has become the foundation of a descending triangle, a structure that typically resolves with a significant move. If $0.38 breaks down, analysts expect a plunge toward $0.16, where a major external demand zone could bring strong buyer interest. On the bullish side, a breakout above the upper trendline of the triangle would signal a major reversal, with upside targets already outlined by technical analysts. “Right now, the best strategy is to trade the range while the structure matures,” say chartists following the WXY corrective pattern closely. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Makes Futures Debut As $PI Perpetuals Go Live , Pi Day 2 Could Be a Game-Changer — But Will the Core Team Deliver? The broader Pi community has been buzzing with anticipation ahead of Pi Day 2 on June 28. Many expect the Pi Core Team to provide fresh updates on the Open Mainnet rollout or token utility, which could inject new life into the stagnant market. Without such a catalyst, the price may continue to drift lower, with some projections estimating a drop toward $0.40 or even lower by the end of August. Pi Unlocking Set to Slow — Can That Trigger a Recovery? One positive development: the rate of Pi unlocking is expected to decline by late August. This could ease selling pressure, providing much-needed relief and restoring investor confidence heading into Q4.As the structure unfolds and the Open Mainnet timeline draws nearer, all eyes remain on $0.38 and the descending triangle breakout zone, which will likely determine Pi’s next major move. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These regulated investment vehicles provide a bridge for traditional finance to interact with the digital asset space, leading to significant daily flows that offer valuable insights into market sentiment and institutional adoption. On June 4th, the market saw another day of positive momentum, with the combined US Spot Bitcoin ETF products recording a net inflow, continuing a trend that observers closely monitor. What Did June 4th’s Bitcoin ETF Inflows Reveal? According to data tracked by analysts like Trader T on X, June 4th concluded with a total net inflow of $87.03 million across all operational Bitcoin ETF Inflows in the United States. While this figure represents a positive net change, the underlying movements within individual funds paint a more nuanced picture of investor activity during the trading day. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures: Total Net Inflow: $87.03 million Leading Fund Inflow: BlackRock’s IBIT Significant Fund Outflow: Fidelity’s FBTC Other Funds: No reported change in holdings This daily snapshot is crucial for understanding the short-term dynamics at play. While the overall direction remained positive, the divergence in performance between major players like IBIT and FBTC warrants closer examination. Diving Deeper: The Performance of IBIT and FBTC BlackRock’s IBIT has consistently been a dominant force since the launch of the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market. On June 4th, IBIT once again led the pack, attracting a substantial $284.07 million in inflows. This continued accumulation by the world’s largest asset manager signals strong ongoing demand from its client base, which includes both retail and potentially significant institutional players accessing Bitcoin through this familiar investment structure. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC experienced notable outflows on the same day, shedding $197.04 million. Outflows from specific funds can occur for various reasons. They might represent profit-taking by early investors, portfolio rebalancing, or shifts in strategy among large holders. It’s also worth remembering that while new money flows into some funds, others might see redemptions related to activities like the unwinding of positions in previously converted trusts, although this effect is diminishing over time. The contrasting performance of IBIT and FBTC on June 4th highlights that while the aggregate net inflow provides an overall market sentiment gauge, the individual fund flows offer deeper insights into specific investor behaviors and distribution channels within the Bitcoin ETF Inflows landscape. The Significance of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The very existence and performance of the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market are intrinsically linked to the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. These ETFs provide a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway for large funds, wealth managers, and corporate treasuries to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct custody and management of private keys. The consistent, albeit sometimes fluctuating, pattern of positive Bitcoin ETF Inflows since their inception earlier this year suggests that this institutional interest is not a fleeting trend. Large asset managers are actively allocating capital to Bitcoin through these products, viewing it increasingly as a legitimate asset class for diversification, inflation hedging, or potential growth. Key drivers behind this trend include: Regulatory Clarity: The SEC’s approval of these ETFs provided a level of legitimacy and regulatory comfort previously absent for many traditional investors. Ease of Access: Trading ETFs on traditional brokerage platforms simplifies the investment process significantly compared to navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. Familiar Structure: ETFs are a well-understood investment vehicle within traditional finance, reducing the educational barrier for new investors. Liquidity: High trading volumes in major ETFs like IBIT and FBTC ensure ample liquidity for large trades. The daily flow data, including the figures from June 4th, serves as a tangible metric for tracking the pace and scale of this ongoing Institutional Bitcoin integration into the global financial system. Analyzing US Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: What Does it Tell Us? Interpreting the daily performance of the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market requires looking beyond just the net inflow number. While $87.03 million is a positive figure, its significance is best understood when compared to historical flows and the overall market context. Since their launch, these ETFs have collectively attracted billions of dollars, fundamentally changing the supply-demand dynamics for Bitcoin. Days with strong positive inflows often coincide with periods of price appreciation, while significant outflows can sometimes precede or accompany price dips. The June 4th data, showing moderate net inflows, suggests continued underlying demand, even as some participants may be taking profits or reallocating funds. Benefits of the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market for investors include: Diversification: Offering a new asset class for portfolio diversification. Transparency: Daily reporting of holdings and flows provides market transparency. Lower Barriers: Making Bitcoin investment accessible through standard investment accounts. Challenges and considerations for the market include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price remains highly volatile, impacting ETF values. Fees: While competitive, management fees still apply. Market Dependence: ETF performance is directly tied to Bitcoin’s price movements. The data from June 4th, showing robust inflows into IBIT offsetting outflows from FBTC , is a snapshot of the ongoing flux within this dynamic market. It underscores that while institutional interest is growing, it’s not monolithic, with different funds and investors exhibiting varied strategies. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape For investors and market observers, tracking Bitcoin ETF Performance provides valuable insights, but it’s essential to interpret the data correctly. Daily flows are just one piece of the puzzle. While large inflows are generally bullish indicators, and large outflows can signal caution, they shouldn’t be viewed in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Look at Trends, Not Just Days: Focus on weekly or monthly aggregate flows rather than getting fixated on single-day fluctuations. Consistent positive net inflows over time are a stronger indicator of sustained demand. Analyze Individual Funds: Understand which funds are seeing the most activity. Strong inflows into funds managed by large institutions like BlackRock ( IBIT ) can indicate broader institutional adoption. Consider the Context: Correlate flow data with price action, macroeconomic news, and other crypto-specific developments. Flows don’t happen in a vacuum. Understand Outflow Reasons: Don’t automatically view outflows as purely negative. They can be due to rebalancing, profit-taking, or specific fund dynamics (like GBTC conversions). Long-Term Perspective: The primary benefit of US Spot Bitcoin ETF is providing long-term exposure to Bitcoin. Daily flows are noise compared to the signal of overall market structure changes. The June 4th data, with its mixed fund flows resulting in a net positive, is a perfect example of why a nuanced approach is necessary when evaluating Bitcoin ETF Inflows . It shows that while the overall tide may be rising (net inflow), there are complex currents beneath the surface (individual fund movements). Summary: A Snapshot of Continued Interest The $87.03 million net inflow into US Spot Bitcoin ETF on June 4th confirms continued, albeit moderate, demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. The significant inflow into BlackRock’s IBIT underscores the ongoing appeal of this product, while outflows from Fidelity’s FBTC highlight the dynamic nature of capital allocation within the market. These daily figures are vital indicators of the pace of Institutional Bitcoin adoption and provide a lens through which to view overall Bitcoin ETF Performance . While daily flows can be volatile, the cumulative effect since the January launch demonstrates a fundamental shift in how traditional finance interacts with Bitcoin. The market is maturing, and data like that from June 4th offers valuable insights into the forces shaping this evolution. Watching these trends will be crucial for understanding the future trajectory of both Bitcoin and the broader digital asset landscape.

This locks other whales in a position where they cannot remove their stake, as most USDT is already claimed by borrowers. A giant whale removed up to 93% of available USDT liquidity on Aave, meaning all other lender whales were stuck in their positions. USDT has a high utilization rate on Aave, as it is one of the preferred assets to borrow. An address identified as HTX, formerly Huobi, withdrew $400M USDT in a single transaction. Liquidity in Aave USDT pools crashed in the short term, before new depositors appeared to tap the growing yields. | Source: DeFi Risk HTX has moved some of its USDT in the past week, as observed by on-chain analysts, with the potential to allocate the liquidity to other tasks. The Huobi Recovery wallet and the HTX 52 wallet were involved in a series of USDT operations. In the past, wallets linked to Justin Sun have also removed USDT from Aave for a series of swaps between chains, also involving Binance to move between the TRON and Ethereum versions of USDT. Available liquidity on Aave V3 fell by over $307M in the past 24 hours, immediately leading to an outsized spike in USDT interest rates. The removal of liquidity led to an immediate spike in the pool’s APY, with spikes as high as 40% annualized. All remaining lenders are making outsized gains, although they are unable to remove their liquidity. The exact purpose of the recent liquidity operation remains uncertain. Top DeFi apps continue to attract whales for their passive income opportunities, but are also vulnerable to similar large-scale liquidity operations. HTX remains one of the top depositors in Aave, still supplying significant liquidity to lending pools. HTX withdrawal caused a short-term spike in borrowing, deposit rates on Aave V3 Immediately after the large liquidity withdrawal, borrowing retained a rate of 28.6%, while deposits gained 24.65% in annualized yield. The rates continued to normalize within an hour of the large-scale withdrawal, sinking back to 8%, still an unusually high level. 更新：不要小瞧搬砖人的力量啊！😆 短短半小时，USDT 存款 APY 已经降回 8.07% 了，太有实力了朋友们 不过 HTX 目前仍是 Aave USDT 存款金库的榜一大哥，尽管撤走了 4 亿枚 USDT 也还有 12 亿枚，占总存款数量的 32.6% pic.twitter.com/HkLWcOyDhU — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) June 5, 2025 Following the large withdrawal, Aave started to draw in deposits from other whales, trying to make the best of the situation and grab the niche opened by the HTX deposit. Aave is not under-capitalized, and according to analysts, still has $1.2B in available USDT, among other stablecoins. However, the recent withdrawal demonstrated that DeFi is still unpredictable when it comes to available liquidity and rates. HTX sent back the funds to a known address belonging to Huobi Recovery with no previous warning. USDT withdrawal proved a stress test for Aave The recent withdrawal affected only a single USDT pool, with sufficient liquidity remaining in other assets, as well as USDT. Following the news, AAVE tokens only suffered a small setback, losing 2.7% to $262.90. The ability to withdraw $400M without affecting the protocol revealed the resilience of Aave and the self-correcting nature of pools. Aave V3 currently holds over $24B in value locked, with over $16.6B borrowed. The protocol’s health is also linked to the significant supply of native stablecoins GHO, with over 238M in circulation.

Having a physical headquarters might seem a bit counter-intuitive for a company focused on digital assets. But the move is fueling an ongoing shift at Solana Labs, from Solana the meme coin chain to Solana as a serious, ‘Wall-Street-ready’ DeFi chain. The offices opened back in 2023, and Solana Labs uses them as a staging board where potential partners and investors can come visit and chat directly with Solana’s devs. The move is paying off; even as more and more companies adapt a ‘Bitcoin reserve’ strategy to use with $SOL. What does it all mean? Even as Solana takes aim at becoming the go-to blockchain for finance, top crypto presales set out to build on the blend of memes and finance provided by the Solana chain. Solana: Go-To Blockchain for Finance? Major companies like Upexi, Inc ($UPXI) are taking Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin reserve strategy and applying it to Solana. Upexi purchased 77,879 $SOL, giving it a total of 679,677 $SOL valued at $121M. The company has gained roughly $24.5M from token appreciation so far, aided by a good month, performance-wise, from $SOL itself. Upexi isn’t the only company looking to capitalize on Solana’s success: SkyBridge Capital, led by Anthony Scaramucci, poured $50M into a Solana Staking ETF in Canada Apollo and Securitize partnered to launch tokenized credit funds on Solana and other blockchains SOL Strategies announced a $500M investment to facilitate SOL token acquisitions and partnerships Classover, an education company, will issue up to $500M in convertible notes to build a SOL treasury That’s a lot of money starting to pour into Solana’s potential as a financial tool, instead of a simple platform for spamming new meme coins . Of course, degens being what they are, meme coins are still being spammed. A lot of them. A million of them, actually, just in May alone on Solana. Most of those launches fail almost immediately. But the sheer volume of new tokens launched demonstrates continued interest in Solana’s speed and low fees, ideal factors for meme coin success. With a pump.fun token launch likely incoming , it’s not like Solana’s abandoning the meme coin world altogether. Instead, some of the most promising new crypto projects bring both sectors together. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Find 100x Opportunities On Telegram with Snorter Bot With so many tokens launching all the time, the question isn’t ‘will there be a 100x token.’ The real question is – how do you find it? That’s where the Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Snorter Bot come in. Tons of Solana meme coins never make it to big CEX listings or major news coverage. Instead, they’re traded on Telegram groups. If they do make it big, the best opportunities for buying low and selling high are long gone. Finding these underground opportunities takes a lot of effort, but thankfully, the Snorter Bot simplifies it all. Safety features like honeypot detection and rugpull alerts help minimize losses, while automated sniping and copy trading let you sniff out and snag the best opportunities. It’s all powered by the $SNORT token, the native utility token for the Snorter Bot. This isn’t a meme coin; it’s a sophisticated trading bot designed to sort through the millions of Solana memes and find the real winners. That utility is driving a wave of interest in $SNORT, with well over $400K raised so far. The presale is in the early days, which makes it the perfect time to buy and stake your $SNORT tokens for an estimated 735% dynamic APY. Buy and stake now , claim your rewards at the token launch, and they’ll be disbursed block-by-block over the next year. A full quarter of the token supply is reserved for product development, powering $SNORT into the future of Solana’s meme coin development. Will the Snorter Bot Bridge the Gap Between Memes and Finance? With millions of dollars flowing into Solana and the $SOL token as a strategic reserve, there’s room for a token that stays true to Solana’s meme coin roots while also looking to the finance future.

Why Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Could Be Your Better Path to Riches,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-xrp-a-good-investment-why-bitcoin-solaris-mobile-mining-could-be-your-better-path-to-riches/,"For years, XRP has been a go-to name for retail investors seeking exposure to institutional blockchain adoption. Designed for fast cross-border transactions, Ripple’s token built its reputation on the idea that banks and financial firms would eventually integrate the network. That story has had moments of momentum, particularly during SEC-related legal battles. But for many holders, the wait has been long, and the price action underwhelming. That wait-and-see model — reliant on regulatory green lights and centralized integrations — isn’t the only path anymore. A new contender, Bitcoin Solaris, has entered the picture with a structure that doesn’t depend on external speculation or delayed partnerships. Instead, it delivers real-time, retail-first participation through mobile-based mining and a fixed token economy that’s already functional. Functional Access Over Institutional Reliance XRP remains tied to decisions made by courts, governments, and enterprise clients. Its core value proposition hinges on adoption from systems that retail users can’t influence. Bitcoin Solaris approaches things from the opposite direction. The protocol is built for everyday participation, not institutional permission. Through the upcoming Nova App, Bitcoin Solaris allows anyone with a smartphone to contribute idle device resources — storage and processing power — and earn BTC-S tokens in return. Testers during the beta phase reported weekly returns that rival top staking platforms — without locking funds or risking third-party custody. This is value created by infrastructure, not hope. Tokenomics With No Blind Spots Bitcoin Solaris runs on a capped supply model, mirroring Bitcoin’s original scarcity mechanics. There will only ever be 21 million BTC-S tokens. Of that supply, 14 million are allocated for long-term mining rewards, ensuring a slow and measured release into circulation. Another 4.2 million has been distributed across public presale phases, with the remainder reserved for ecosystem liquidity and developer initiatives. There are no hidden allocations, no private early seed investors, and no emissions curve that changes post-launch. What’s been distributed is clear. What remains is hard-coded. And most importantly, ongoing mining participation requires users to hold BTC-S to contribute, which effectively reduces liquid circulating supply as the network scales. Where XRP holders watch price movement from the sidelines, Bitcoin Solaris participants can directly influence their token holdings through ongoing mining. Consensus Architecture Built to Scale Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a lightweight fork or a marketing vehicle. It’s a dual-layer blockchain combining Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity at its base, with a high-speed Solaris Layer running on Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. The result is a blockchain capable of over 10,000 transactions per second, delivering finality in just two seconds. It also operates with 99.95% less energy than traditional mining models — enabling sustainable mobile mining without draining batteries or throttling device performance. This architecture enables the Nova App to scale globally. More users doesn’t mean slower transactions or higher costs — it means more validation power and stronger network security. XRP’s validator model, by contrast, remains constrained by infrastructure and uptime limitations. Security You Can Verify One of the most consistent concerns with altcoin investments — especially pre-listing projects — is transparency. Bitcoin Solaris has taken a proactive approach by completing third-party audits and verification at multiple levels. The protocol’s smart contracts and consensus mechanisms were fully reviewed by Cyberscope . The Nova App’s mining logic and performance model was independently tested and validated by Freshcoins . And the core development team has completed public KYC verification . This level of operational visibility has rarely been seen at this stage of a crypto protocol’s lifecycle. It’s part of why analysts like Crypto Nitro are calling attention to the project’s unique positioning. In his breakdown, he describes Bitcoin Solaris as one of the only mobile-native blockchains with full consensus infrastructure live before token listings begin. Beyond Mobile: What Comes Next Bitcoin Solaris’s ambitions go beyond just making mining easier. The long-term roadmap includes a Bitcoin-backed reserve model, where BTC-S tokens will be backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in verifiable multisig wallets. This system will allow Bitcoin to gain smart contract functionality, DeFi access, and high-speed transaction throughput through the Bitcoin Solaris network. This hybrid model — bringing Bitcoin’s trust and scarcity into a usable, programmable format — is already being architected through Solaris’s dual-layer design and future bridge infrastructure. The same system that powers mobile mining today will enable DeFi tools, dApps, and cross-chain interaction in future phases. It’s a vision that combines Bitcoin’s monetary policy with a modern technology stack, enabling broader use without compromising fundamentals. The Decision That Matters Now Whether XRP recovers or not is ultimately out of your hands. Its growth depends on regulators, banks, and global legal frameworks. Bitcoin Solaris is offering a different kind of opportunity — one that rewards direct involvement. With BTC-S currently available in phase 6 at $6, participants who enter now are positioning themselves ahead of public exchange listings and before the Nova App enters general release. It’s not a gamble on marketing. It’s a protocol designed to reward users from the ground up, starting with the phone in their pocket.

French officials praised Morocco's cooperation, and pointed out that Bajjou was subject to an Interpol red notice for his involvement in previous attacks. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities apprehended a man accused of a massive cryptojacking operation that compromised over 5,000 accounts at a global hosting firm. The scheme was active since at least 2018, and reportedly caused more than $4.4 million in damages through unauthorized crypto mining. In the United States, the SEC scored a legal win against Keith Crews, who was found liable for a $1.1 million crypto fraud involving the bogus “Stemy Coin.” Crypto Kidnapping Suspect Arrested A 24-year-old French-Moroccan man, Badiss Mohamed Amide Bajjou, was arrested in Morocco for allegedly orchestrating a series of high-profile kidnappings in France to steal cryptocurrency. Acting on a request from French authorities, Morocco's national police and intelligence agency apprehended Bajjou, who was reportedly found in possession of several mobile phones and bladed weapons. His arrest was confirmed by France’s Minister of Justice, Gérald Darmanin, who praised Morocco for its cooperation and the strength of the two nations’ judicial collaboration in combating organized crime. Interpol red notice for Badiss Mohamed Amide Bajjou Interpol issued a red notice for Bajjou in 2023 because of his links to multiple criminal activities, including kidnappings targeting individuals connected to the cryptocurrency sector. The most recent incident occurred on May 13, when attackers tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of French crypto platform Paymium. The dramatic attack was captured on video by bystanders, and shows Noizat’s daughter bravely fending off the masked assailants. They ultimately fled the scene in a waiting van. Earlier in May, Paris police also rescued the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was held for several day s in connection with a €7 million ($7.8 million) ransom plot. And in January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, was kidnapped from his home and held captive for a day before being rescued by police. In response to this growing threat, French law enforcement is stepping up security measures for crypto executives and their families. These include giving them priority access to emergency police lines, conducting home security assessments, and providing safety briefings to ensure they follow best practices during the alarming rise in crypto-targeted kidnappings. Ukrainian Hacker Busted for Cryptojacking Scheme In Ukraine, police arrested a 35-year-old man from the Poltava region for allegedly conducting a years-long cryptojacking operation targeting an international hosting company. According to a statement that was released on June 4 by Ukraine’s National Police cyber division, the suspect is accused of breaching the company’s security systems to access over 5,000 customer accounts. National Police of Ukraine investigation Once inside, he reportedly deployed unauthorized virtual machines and cryptocurrency mining software, siphoning off computing power and electricity without detection or payment. This unauthorized use of resources is often referred to as cryptojacking. In this case, it is estimated that the man caused damages exceeding 185 million Ukrainian hryvnias, or approximately $4.4 million. Authorities believe the suspect was active since at least 2018 by exploiting vulnerabilities in corporate cybersecurity systems and hopping between regions—including Poltava, Odesa, Zaporizhia, and Dnipropetrovsk—to avoid detection. During a search of his residence, police seized computer hardware, mobile phones, and bank cards, along with a range of digital evidence. Investigators say they found tools and data suggesting the suspect was active on hacker forums and that he had access to a variety of compromised email accounts, crypto wallets, and software used for managing large-scale mining operations remotely. Some of the items found in the hackers home (Source: National Police of Ukraine ) The man is now facing charges related to unauthorized interference in the operation of electronic communication networks. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison. Additional penalties could include a ban on working in IT, communications, or any profession that would provide him access to electronic communication networks for up to three years. Authorities indicated that the investigation is still in its preliminary stages, and more charges may be filed as the case unfolds. This arrest follows a similar incident in the United States last year, where a man was charged with wire fraud and money laundering after allegedly defrauding cloud computing firms to mine almost $1 million in cryptocurrency. This case now adds to the growing list of criminals exploiting corporate infrastructure for illicit mining activities. Stemy Coin Promoter Ordered to Pay Over $1M In a separate case, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) secured a $1.1 million court victory in a crypto fraud case after the defendant failed to respond to the charges. A Georgia federal judge issued a default judgment on June 3 against Keith Crews, who was accused by the SEC of running a fraudulent crypto scheme and never responded to the agency’s lawsuit that was filed in August of 2023. Default ruling in favor of the SEC Judge Tiffany Johnson ruled in favor of the SEC and ordered Crews to pay over $1.1 million, including $530,000 in disgorged profits, nearly $51,000 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of another $530,000. In addition to the financial penalties, Crews was permanently barred from committing future violations of federal securities laws. According to the SEC’s original complaint, Crews allegedly operated a crypto scam under the guise of two companies, Four Square Biz and Stem Biotech, between October of 2019 and May of 2021. The agency claimed that he raised approximately $800,000 from around 200 investors through the sale of a token called “Stemy Coin,” which he marketed as a crypto asset backed by cutting-edge stem cell technology and physical assets like gold. Many of the investors were reportedly targeted through community and church-based relationships, particularly in African-American communities. The SEC alleged that Crews misled investors by claiming his company had functioning labs, a line of products, and partnerships with research teams and doctors—none of which actually existed. Investigators found that neither Four Square Biz nor Stem Biotech had any real operations, products, or connections to the stem cell industry. The complaint mentioned violations of several federal securities laws, including anti-fraud and registration provisions under both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. This ruling is a rare enforcement win for the SEC in the crypto sector, particularly after the agency scaled back some of its digital asset crackdowns under the Trump administration in 2025. Nonetheless, it still means that fraudulent behavior in the crypto space is on the agency’s radar, and those who ignore regulatory proceedings may still face penalties.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-05 10:00:13

The rise was driven by hype and rapid community growth. However, it has not been able to hold onto those gains in the long term. In 2025, PEPE investors have struggled to find growth amid a sharp decline in demand for meme coins. In response, investors have been moving capital into promising projects, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which are centered around utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Future Of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to cover all aspects of the DeFi world that have kept it from achieving its full potential. The project is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol, which allows lenders, borrowers, and liquidators to benefit. As a lender, the primary role is to supply liquidity into liquidity pools, which borrowers can borrow using overcollateralized loans. In exchange for lending out their assets, borrowers are given an annualized percentage yield, with the rate set by a pool’s utilization. The project takes things a bit further from this basic model and builds on it, with the goal of creating a thriving ecosystem. To avoid the pitfalls of past DeFi projects, the team has placed a huge focus on security. Recently, they passed a Certik audit, which confirms their commitment to security. They have also taken measures to ensure the long-term solvency of the protocol. These measures include: Overcollateralization All loans issued on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be overcollateralized to account for the asset value fluctuation. Enough headroom with the required, coupled with clear incentives, will ensure positions remain safe even when markets move unexpectedly. If collateral sinks below a given level, then part of that collateral becomes eligible for liquidation. Liquidators are given the option to buy the debt at a discount. Borrowers can also top up their collateral to avoid liquidation. This system ensures a healthy ecosystem where bad debt does not build up. Deposit And Borrow Caps A deposit cap sets the limit on how much of a given asset can be added to a liquidity pool. It ensures the protocol is not overexposed to assets that have low liquidity or high volatility. Additionally, it avoids the issue of unlimited asset minting. Setting the deposit can is determined via various factors like on-chain trading volume, historical price performance, and price stability. Borrow caps, on the other hand, control how much of an asset can be borrowed. The cap is used for tokens that are likely to experience price manipulation or liquidity issues. By placing a cap on the borrowed volume, the protocol reduces the risk of insolvency. Restricted Collateralization Some assets with low liquidity may be assigned a Restricted Collateralization mode. When this happens, a single collateral asset can only be used to borrow the same asset, or with strict limitations. If the oracle data is prone to manipulation, the restrictions ensure there is no system-wide impact. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) This feature is used for assets that have closely correlated price movements, such as stablecoins. An ECE gives assets an elevated borrowing limit if both assets and collateral are in the same grouping. Consequently, participants benefit from better capital efficiency while avoiding system-wide problems. Loan-to-Value (LTV) An LTV ratio is used to cap how much a user may borrow relative to the value of their collateral. The LTV in place at the time changes based on market conditions. These are just a few of the many features Mutuum Finance has in place to ensure the protocol remains safe for all users. Overall, it paints a picture of a project that places user security at the fore; nothing is left to chance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Roars Ahead The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a huge success since it launched. So far, it has raised over $9.9 million and is fast approaching $10 million. The presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03 per token. Early investors in Phase 1 of the presale got their tokens at $0.01, and the price has since gone up by 200%. Despite his increase, interest in the presale remains high. In the upcoming presale phase 6, the price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. That will also reduce the guaranteed returns, based on the $0.06 listing price, from 100% to 71.43%. If you are looking to be part of a project that could redefine DeFi, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is your best bet. The project comes with many powerful features and a new approach to the DeFi sector that will prioritize quality and long-term growth. At the current price of $0.03, the ticket for admission into the future of DeFi is a massive bargain.

Swan Says History’s Turning,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/last-bitcoin-cycle-swan-history-turning/,"Bitcoin is drifting just above $105,000 on June 5, its lowest realized volatility in almost two years, yet Swan, the Los-Angeles-based “Bitcoin-only” financial services firm, contends the market is on the verge of its most radical re-pricing ever. The Last Chance To Buy? In a X thread on Wednesday night, the company argued that the familiar four-year boom-and-bust cadence is giving way to “the last rotation”—a silent transfer of coins from retail speculators to institutions whose investment horizons stretch decades. “People less committed to the long term are exiting and a whole new class of investors is entering,” Swan is quoting Michael Saylor, framing the hand-off from retail traders to corporate treasuries, ETFs and multinationals such as BlackRock and Fidelity. So far, 2025 has defied the script. The third calendar year of every prior cycle—2013, 2017 and 2021—delivered the vertical moves that defined those eras. This year has offered “big moves, but also shallower corrections and longer periods of sideways chop,” Swan writes, conceding that the price action “is boring people.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Strength As Long-Term Holder Realized Cap Surges Past $20 Billion – Details The firm’s thesis is that boredom masks an invisible supply squeeze: long-time holders taking profits above $100,000 while “long-only buyers,” in Swan’s words, methodically absorb the float. “These corporations, they’re long-only buyers. Not traders of Bitcoin,” Swan argues, underscoring the firm’s view that coins migrating into corporate vaults are effectively removed from circulation. The thread portrays three intertwined rotations: Between entities – Trustees, lawyers and early adopters are exiting; ETFs, corporations and “sovereign-grade balance sheets” are stepping in. Between intentions – Speculation gives way to allocation. “This new wave of buyers isn’t speculating,” Swan writes. “They’re allocating.” Between generations. The Silent Generation hoarded gold; Boomers compounded in equities; Gen X surfed tech; now Millennials, “entering their peak accumulation years,” are “inheriting trillions—and they’re choosing Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Pauses Below $106K as Analyst Reveals Key Support Level To Watch Supply dynamics, Swan contends, make those rotations irreversible. “When long-term capital meets inelastic supply, the float starts vanishing,” the firm warns. “That’s when things get explosive.” The macro backdrop adds pressure: Swan points to a “rare and dangerous split” in which the US dollar is weakening even as bond yields surge—an environment, it says, that could funnel excess capital toward a neutral store of value. “This isn’t just the next cycle. It’s the end of an era,” Swan concludes. “If you’re selling now, understand you’re likely handing your Bitcoin to an institution that plans to hold it indefinitely. Once it’s gone, you’re probably never getting it back.” For Swan, the implication is stark. The apparent tranquility near $105,000 is less a sign of exhaustion than the quiet before a permanent liquidity event—one in which the marginal seller disappears, the marginal buyer never sells, and price must eventually mark higher to find equilibrium. “Think twice,” Swan advises would-be profit-takers. “The float is drying up. The buyers are built different. This is the last Bitcoin rotation.” If the firm is right, history is not repeating so much as culminating, and the market’s current stillness may soon be remembered as the eye of a generational storm. At press time, BTC traded at $104,605.

Aura reflects each user’s contributions through trading, liquidity, lending, or quests, and forms the backbone of Nibiru’s seasonal incentive engine. Aura is earned by interacting with applications on Nibiru EVM, including trading platforms like Oku, lending protocols such as LayerBank, DEXs like MIMSwap and OmniSwap, and the Sai perpetuals exchange. Users can also bridge assets via Stargate, mint and trade NFTs on Element, or explore prediction markets like BRKT and PRDT. With dozens of active applications already integrated, Nibiru EVM is live, growing, and ready for usage. Each month-long Aura Season resets the scoreboard. Aura is earned through both onchain and off-chain missions. Onchain activity is tracked via Merkl, a battle-tested liquidity mining engine built by Angle Protocol. Off-chain and social missions are powered by Galxe, a leading quest platform trusted by major Web3 ecosystems. Participants can boost their Aura by providing sustained liquidity in eligible pools. For example, users who lock funds in select stablecoin pairs for 90+ days can earn up to 3.5x point multipliers. Others can earn through concentrated liquidity, active trading, or completing protocol-specific missions. Nibiru Block Party: How to Earn Nibiru Aura Aura points and leaderboards will be viewable through a public dashboard launching soon. Each month closes with a snapshot of rankings, followed by a claim window and the start of a new season. Mechanisms such as Sybil resistance and time-weighted tracking have been implemented to ensure that rewards are allocated based on genuine activity, minimizing the potential for manipulation. The incentive structure is designed to proportionally reflect participant contributions. Full rules, terms, and conditions for the Block Party and Aura rewards are located here . About Nibiru Nibiru is a high throughput Multi VM blockchain featuring Nibiru EVM, an EVM-equivalent execution engine. Its architecture executes state updates in parallel to maintain performance under heavy load.

A significant development is brewing in the South Korean crypto market. Leading exchange Bithumb has officially announced an upcoming listing that could open up new avenues for investors. What’s Happening with the Latest Bithumb Listing ? South Korean cryptocurrency exchange giant, Bithumb, has confirmed it will list a new spot trading pair. The announcement, made via their official website, specifies the addition of the LA/KRW trading pair. Here are the key details at a glance: Exchange: Bithumb Trading Pair: LA/KRW (Lagrange / Korean Won) Listing Time: 08:00 UTC on June 5 Token: LA, the native token of the Lagrange network. This move is particularly noteworthy as Bithumb is one of the largest and most influential exchanges in South Korea, a country with a highly active and significant cryptocurrency trading scene. Understanding the KRW Trading Pair Significance Why is a KRW trading pair listing on an exchange like Bithumb such a big deal? The Korean Won (KRW) market is renowned for its high liquidity and trading volume, often referred to as the ‘Kimchi Premium’ when prices on Korean exchanges are higher than global averages. Access to a direct KRW pair allows South Korean residents to trade the asset directly using their local currency, bypassing the need to first convert KRW to a stablecoin like USDT or another major crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This direct accessibility often leads to increased trading activity and potential price discovery for the listed asset. For projects, getting a KRW pair on a top-tier Korean exchange is a major milestone that can significantly boost their visibility and adoption within the region. Introducing the Lagrange Crypto Project and its LA Token The token being listed is LA token , the native utility and governance token for the Lagrange network. While specific details about Lagrange weren’t in the original announcement snippet, understanding the project is crucial for potential traders. Lagrange aims to provide a decentralized state-proving network, focusing on cross-chain interoperability and data verification across various blockchain networks. By enabling verifiable computation and shared state across chains, Lagrange seeks to unlock more complex and secure cross-chain applications. The LA token likely plays a role within this ecosystem, potentially used for staking, paying for network services, governance participation, or incentivizing network participants. A listing on a major exchange like Bithumb provides significant exposure for the Lagrange crypto project to a wider audience of potential users and investors. What Does This Mean for Traders on a South Korea Crypto Exchange ? For traders using a South Korea crypto exchange like Bithumb, the addition of the LA/KRW pair presents a new trading opportunity. Here are some potential implications: Increased Accessibility: Direct trading against KRW simplifies the process for Korean users. Potential Liquidity: The KRW market’s nature could provide robust liquidity for the LA token. Price Discovery: The listing might lead to increased price volatility and discovery as new market participants enter. Portfolio Diversification: Adds a new asset option for traders interested in cross-chain infrastructure projects. However, as with any new listing, traders should exercise caution. New tokens can be volatile, and it’s essential to do thorough research on the Lagrange project, understand its fundamentals, and be aware of the risks associated with trading nascent assets. Navigating the Opportunities and Risks The Bithumb listing of LA/KRW is undoubtedly a positive development for the Lagrange project, offering a gateway to one of the most dynamic crypto markets globally. For investors, it represents a new potential investment avenue. Benefits: Enhanced market access for Lagrange. Potential for increased trading volume and liquidity for LA token. Greater visibility for the Lagrange project within the Asian market. Challenges/Risks: Price volatility typical of new listings. Market sentiment fluctuations impacting LA token price.

Don’t trade based solely on the listing news. Conclusion: A New Chapter for LA Token on Bithumb The upcoming Bithumb listing of the LA/KRW spot trading pair on June 5th marks a significant event for both the exchange and the LA token .

Mohammed has been on Interpol’s red notice for arrest over abduction, false imprisonment, and arbitrary detention of a hostage. The French Justice Minister thanked Morocco for its cooperation and support. French security authorities have faced a series of kidnappings and attempted abductions that targeted crypto bosses and their families. Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat, a prominent crypto entrepreneur, called out the authorities to stop the Mexicanization of the country. Crime spikes in France targeting crypto owners Moroccan General Directorate for National Security arrested Badis Mohamed Amide Bajjou in the northern city of Tangier. The Moroccan police reportedly seized bladed weapons, multiple phones, and a sum of cash believed to be proceeds of criminal activities. French Chief Justice Gerald Darmanin thanked Morocco, stating that it demonstrated excellent judicial cooperation between the two countries in the fight against organized crime. French authorities charged twenty-five people, among them six minors, last week in connection with a series of kidnappings and attempted abductions in the country. The attempted kidnapping of the daughter and grandson of the Paymium crypto exchange CEO, Pierre Noizat, on May 13 drew the attention of authorities. In an online footage , several masked men attacked the pregnant daughter of Noizat and her husband during the day in the streets of the French capital’s hip 11th district. The suspects fled the scene after the family put up a resistance, with support from a local with a fire extinguisher. David Balland, a co-founder of crypto-wallet developer Ledger , was kidnapped with his wife in January this year, and Balland’s finger was severed in the process. Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau reported that Balland and his wife were separated and taken to different locations. The kidnappers later made contact with the other Ledger co-founder, demanding a ransom in cryptocurrency, which was paid to them. French daily Le Parisien reported that Bajjou, the suspected criminal mastermind, is a native of Le Chesnay, west of Paris, and was the main suspect in the abduction of David Balland and his wife in January. Balland’s crypto firm is valued at $1 billion. Lawyer Ambroise Vienet-Legue, a defendant of an 18-year-old suspect in the Nantes case, reported that the case was characterized by young people attracted by cash and ended up in a situation beyond their control. He added that most suspects were born in France, Angola, Senegal, and Russia. He pleaded with the court to recognize the defendant’s age and consider protections for minors. French Minister of Interior’s agreement on measures to tighten security bears fruit The French Minister of the Interior, Bruno Retailleau, called a meeting with cryptocurrency stakeholders on May 16 to discuss possible measures for keeping the targeted individuals alive. Retailleau agreed on measures to tighten security following the series of kidnappings. The team also discussed strengthening collaborations with internal security officers to protect professionals. French security briefing provided training on preventing cryptocurrency money laundering. The Director General of the National Police and Gendarmerie, Association for the Development of Digital Assets (ADAN) representatives, and other crypto industry stakeholders were present. Another Franco-Moroccan individual in his forties who is suspected to be behind the abductions has yet to be captured. He is alleged to be the online recruiter of the young men to carry out the heinous acts in exchange for cash. There are two police warrants issued for his arrest, including attempted murder in 2023 and the kidnapping of a crypto entrepreneur’s mother the same year. Jameson Lopp, co-founder of the Bitcoin security company Casa, said that investors and executives are forced to take their wallets offline for safety, and most wrench attacks target high-profile people. Reportedly, over 97,000 Coinbase customers’ personal information has been leaked online , with data likely stolen by bribed contractors or customer support employees. The company revealed that it rejected a $20 million ransom demand from fraudsters claiming to possess customer personal data. Unfortunately, this data breach could expose more users to targeted crypto theft.

He playfully encourages Elon Musk to give the cryptocurrency a shot by sharing Musk’s 2020 tweet where he referred to Bitcoin as his “safe word.” This clever move is happening amid the debate over the controversial “beautiful bill,” which involves a proposed $2.5 trillion spending boost tied to increasing the U.S. debt ceiling . With Bitcoin holding strong at $105,000, Dorsey’s appeal highlights the exciting tension between decentralized finance and traditional financial policies, intriguing both crypto fans and investors. Musk Calls Out the “Debt Slavery Bill” Elon Musk didn’t hold back . In a fiery post on X, he slammed the bill as a reckless move that would increase the U.S. budget deficit by $2.5 trillion. He warned that it would cancel out all the savings achieved by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which he recently stepped away from. Musk urged Americans to take action, writing: “Bankrupting America is NOT OK! KILL the BILL.” He also supported Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s warning: if the U.S. continues to spend irresponsibly and removes the debt ceiling, Bitcoin could become the world’s new reserve currency. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton added that Musk might even make a major Bitcoin move soon. Trump’s Debt Ceiling Twist Stuns Markets In a series of events, President Trump endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren ’s call to abolish the debt ceiling, claiming on X that it could prevent economic disaster. This spontaneous alignment, despite his administration’s support towards the “beautiful bill,” has left viewers reeling. However, Bitcoin maximalists like Max Keiser and Armstrong see the bill as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin, quoting that it will weaken fiat currencies through uncontrolled spending. Bitcoin Maxis See the Bill as Bullish While the bill has raised concerns, some Bitcoin advocates see it differently. Max Keiser and Brian Armstrong both believe that more government spending could actually benefit Bitcoin. Their view? The more the U.S. prints money, the weaker the dollar becomes and the stronger Bitcoin looks as an alternative. Crypto firms like HTX, founded by Leon Li, are also backing Bitcoin adoption during this debate, reinforcing its growing importance in the global financial system. Dorsey Shows Bitcoin in Action Jack Dorsey believes in action. He recently tweeted that he bought fries at Steak ‘n Shake with BTC, showing how it works in real life. Since Musk took over X, Dorsey has been focusing on Block Inc., which has started accepting Bitcoin payments. His decision to repost Musk’s old tweet is a signal: in uncertain times, Bitcoin might be the safer choice. As Washington pushes ahead with massive spending, crypto leaders like Dorsey and Musk are warning about the long-term risks. We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 10:03:16

Aura reflects each user’s contributions through trading, liquidity, lending, or quests, and forms the backbone of Nibiru’s seasonal incentive engine. Aura is earned by interacting with applications on Nibiru EVM, including trading platforms like Oku, lending protocols such as LayerBank, DEXs like MIMSwap and OmniSwap, and the Sai perpetuals exchange. Users can also bridge assets via Stargate, mint and trade NFTs on Element, or explore prediction markets like BRKT and PRDT. With dozens of active applications already integrated, Nibiru EVM is live, growing, and ready for usage. Each month-long Aura Season resets the scoreboard.

Off-chain and social missions are powered by Galxe, a leading quest platform trusted by major Web3 ecosystems. Participants can boost their Aura by providing sustained liquidity in eligible pools. For example, users who lock funds in select stablecoin pairs for 90+ days can earn up to 3.5x point multipliers. Others can earn through concentrated liquidity, active trading, or completing protocol-specific missions. Nibiru Block Party: How to Earn Nibiru Aura Aura points and leaderboards will be viewable through a public dashboard launching soon. Each month closes with a snapshot of rankings, followed by a claim window and the start of a new season. Mechanisms such as Sybil resistance and time-weighted tracking have been implemented to ensure that rewards are allocated based on genuine activity, minimizing the potential for manipulation. The incentive structure is designed to proportionally reflect participant contributions. Full rules, terms, and conditions for the Block Party and Aura rewards are located here .

Despite facing multi-week consolidation and repeated rejections at key resistance levels, underlying fundamentals are strengthening. From surging ETF inflows to falling exchange reserves, Ethereum’s ecosystem is flashing signs of renewed confidence. But the big question remains: will it finally break out? 10x Research: Is Wall Street Finally Warming to ETH? Is Wall Street Really Warming Up to Ethereum? The Truth Behind ETH ETF Inflows A year ago, when enthusiasm for the launch of Ethereum ETFs was at its peak, we took a contrarian bearish stance. Wall Street lacked a compelling marketing narrative to position these products to… pic.twitter.com/RmYF6LUoaF — 10x Research (@10x_Research) June 5, 2025 In a recent X post, 10x Research questioned whether Wall Street is beginning to take Ethereum seriously. Last year, the firm held a bearish stance on ETH ETFs , citing poor institutional demand and stagnant on-chain activity, conditions that dragged ETH from $4,000 to $1,500. Today, however, they admit price action has surprised to the upside. Ethereum is now approaching the apex of a triangle pattern, which could result in a sharp breakout toward $2,000 or $3,000 , triggered by fundamental shifts or a large buyer stepping in. The key question, they argue, is whether Wall Street has finally figured out how to market Ethereum ETFs to long-term investors, similar to how Bitcoin ETFs drew in massive flows. If so, ETH could be on the verge of a game-changing rally. Meanwhile, on Binance, traders are heavily betting against Ethereum again, just like they did back in February before prices dropped. Many investors might be using ETH ETFs and staked ETH in a smart strategy to earn passive income, while also shorting Ethereum to protect themselves if the price falls. It’s a balanced, “hedged” approach similar to what platforms like Ethena offer. ETF Inflows Hit 12-Day Streak This confidence came with the consistent capital inflow into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs. For 12 consecutive days, the funds have attracted net inflows totaling $743.8 million, according to SoSoValue. On Tuesday alone, inflows hit $109.43 million, the second-highest since February, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading at $77 million. Since May 11, ETHA has accumulated over 214,000 ETH, suggesting growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s exchange reserves have also gone down by 450,000 ETH in just a week, hitting a low not seen since 2016. This trend points to long-term accumulation, with investors moving ETH off exchanges and into cold storage, a typical bullish signal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 3 Major Companies Eye XRP for Strategic Reserves: Will This Boost Its Price? , Headwinds Still Exist… However, caution continues as Futures data from CME and Binance show a rise in short positions, reflecting a bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, ETH continues to face technical rejection at a rising trendline. The Road Ahead From the Petra upgrade improving on-chain activity to Sharplink Gaming’s massive $425M ETH buy, signs of broader adoption are emerging. Legislative progress, like the GENIUS Act in the U.S. Senate, could also further legitimize Ethereum. With price action coiling and investor activity heating up, Ethereum may be on the verge of its next major move, just as Wall Street begins to notice. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ADA has been fluctuating between $0.665 and a high of $0.70 in the last 24 hours. ADA Building For a Big Move Analyst Dan Gambardello has pointed out that Cardano’s momentum is extremely oversold on the Stochastic RSI, one of the lowest points it has been in years. Although there is no bounce or relief yet, he claims that this is not purely bearish and ADA is building up energy for a big move. The price also just broke below a key trendline, so most traders can expect further price drops. But Dan believes that this kind of setup often leads to a surprise breakout. So while ADA may look weak now, it could be preparing for a strong rally. Institutional Giants Back Cardano The analyst also highlighted a major developement in the Cardano ecosystem. The $.1.6 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton is now running Cardano nodes. Frederick Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation also confirmed the move, recognizing it as a key step in blockchain infrastructure adoption. Norway’s NBX is partnering with Cardano to build Bitcoin-based DeFi. Cardano’s secure design makes it perfect for such advancements as more institutional money flows into crypto. Cardano’s fundamentals are improving despite price struggles. Dan reminded the critics of his October 2024 prediction when ADA was at 0.36 and then rose to 300% and current price setup looks similar. ADA’s support lies between $0.58-$0.64 level. Will ADA Rally? If ADA holds above the 50-week moving average ($0.64) or breaks above the 200-week EMA, it could start a new uptrend. Dan Gambarello says Cardano could eventually hit $10, but it first needs to break resistance at $0.694 and then $1.10 to start the rally. Analyst Dalin Anderson compared ADA’s current pattern to Bitcoin’s 2012-13 bull run, and predicts it to reach around $3.67 based on a $130 billion market cap.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 10:07:08

As a result, investors and analysts use it to understand sustainable earnings, make forecasts, and compare performance across periods or with peers. Therefore, the above Bitcoin chart shows that profit-taking activity has steadily increased since the second half of May, frequently surpassing the $500 million mark. Given that Bitcoin is witnessing the most intense period of profit-taking by whales since early February, the apex cryptocurrency’s recent trend of touching various psychological prices of $100,000, $105,000, and $110,000 might have triggered this development. Notably, this phenomenon usually leads to increased selling pressure as traders anticipate potential price corrections. Market analyst Willy Woo recently cemented the fact that BTC whales were on a selling spree. He noted that over the past eight years, whale entities holding between 10,000 and 100,000 Bitcoin have steadily reduced their supply. This is because their total holdings have dropped by approximately 40% , declining from 2.7 million BTC to about 1.6 million BTC. Source: Willy Woo Bitcoin's All-Time High Sparks Profit-Taking Frenzy Bitcoin's recent surge to an all-time high has been met with a wave of profit-taking, leading to a notable pullback in its price. After reaching a peak of $112,00 on May 22, Bitcoin has experienced a decline, trading at $104,548 as of June 5 , marking a 7% drop from its peak. At the time, Bitcoin’s new ATH made the leading cryptocurrency to surpass Amazon in terms of market capitalization. Nevertheless, analysts attribute this downturn primarily to investors capitalizing on gains from the recent rally On-chain metrics also reveal increased volumes to exchanges from short-term holders in profit, suggesting that these investors are actively taking profits. Despite the pullback, the broader market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Institutional demand continues to provide support, and some analysts believe that the current correction is a healthy consolidation after a significant rally. However, the market may experience further volatility if selling pressure persists without sufficient demand to absorb it. Therefore, Bitcoin's recent all-time high has triggered profit-taking among investors, leading to a price correction. While this is a common occurrence in bullish markets, the sustainability of Bitcoin's upward trajectory will depend on the market's ability to absorb selling pressure and maintain demand. Bitcoin Has Not Thrown in the Towel Yet Given that Bitcoin ETFs have ended a 3-day outflow streak, institutional investors have ignited the fire after pumping in $375 million. This uptick in Bitcoin ETF inflows signifies growing investor interest and confidence among asset managers, pension funds, and hedge funds. Notably, consistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect bullish market sentiment and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This trend indicates that investors view Bitcoin as a viable investment, potentially as a hedge against economic uncertainties. On the other hand, a supply shock is brewing in the Bitcoin ecosystem with a recent Sygnum report showing that BTC supply is at an 18-month low. Sygnum analysts recently stipulated that more than 1 million BTC have departed crypto exchanges since the end of 2023. Why is this bullish? Well, as more BTC exit exchanges, selling pressure decreases whereas scarcity increases. Conclusion Even though whales are accelerating profit-taking in the Bitcoin network, various on-chain metrics, such as an increase in BTC ETF inflows, show that its still game on for the top cryptocurrency. Therefore, time will tell how Bitcoin plays out in the short and long term.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-05 10:09:41

Ever wonder how seemingly unrelated economic data, like a jobs report, can send ripples through the volatile world of Bitcoin? You’re not alone. As the upcoming U.S. jobs report looms, analysts are weighing in on its potential impact, suggesting it could be a critical factor in determining the next major move for the Bitcoin price . Why the U.S. Jobs Report Matters for the Crypto Market You might be thinking, “What do jobs in the U.S. have to do with my Bitcoin?” It’s a fair question, and the connection lies in the intricate web of global finance and monetary policy. The monthly U.S. jobs report , officially the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, is a key indicator of the health of the American economy’s labor market. It tells us how many jobs were added or lost, the unemployment rate, and wage growth. Why is this report so closely watched by financial markets, including the crypto market ? Because it heavily influences the decisions of the Federal Reserve , the U.S. central bank responsible for setting monetary policy. The Federal Reserve, Interest Rates, and Bitcoin Price The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: to maintain maximum employment and stable prices (control inflation). When the jobs market is strong, it can signal inflationary pressures (more jobs often mean more spending and potentially higher wages). Conversely, a weak jobs market can indicate economic slowdown and potentially easing inflation. This is where interest rates come into play. The Fed uses interest rates as a primary tool to manage the economy. Raising rates makes borrowing more expensive, which can cool down spending and inflation. Lowering rates makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging investment and spending to stimulate the economy. So, how does this affect the Bitcoin price ? Here’s the general idea: Lower Interest Rates: When rates are low or expected to fall, traditional safe haven investments like bonds offer lower returns. Investors often look for alternative assets that can provide higher returns, and riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, can become more attractive. Cheaper borrowing also makes it easier for institutions and individuals to invest. Higher Interest Rates: When rates are high or expected to rise, bonds become more attractive. Borrowing becomes more expensive, which can reduce liquidity available for riskier investments. This environment can put downward pressure on assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, the jobs report provides crucial clues about the Fed’s potential next move on interest rates , which directly impacts the sentiment and flow of capital into the crypto market . Scenario 1: A Disappointing U.S. Jobs Report Fuels Bitcoin’s Ascent? Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex have outlined a bullish case for the Bitcoin price . According to their analysis, as reported by Cointelegraph, a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report , particularly the one due on June 6, could significantly strengthen the argument that inflation is cooling (disinflation). Why is disinflation important? Because it gives the Federal Reserve more room to consider cutting interest rates sooner rather than later. Lower rates, as we discussed, are generally seen as a positive catalyst for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Bitfinex analysts suggest that under this scenario, fueled further by growing institutional demand and continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin price could see significant upward momentum, potentially climbing to $115,000 or even higher by early July . Potential Benefits in this Scenario: Increased investor confidence due to anticipated monetary easing. Greater capital inflow from institutions seeking higher returns outside traditional finance. Positive market sentiment potentially leading to broader gains across the crypto market . Scenario 2: A Strong Jobs Report Weighs on Bitcoin Price? On the flip side, economic data is inherently unpredictable. What if the upcoming U.S. jobs report comes in stronger than anticipated? This outcome would likely suggest the U.S. economy is still robust and potentially indicate that inflationary pressures are not easing as quickly as hoped. In this situation, the Federal Reserve might feel less pressure to cut interest rates soon, potentially delaying any policy easing. A stronger U.S. economy and delayed rate cuts can often lead to a stronger U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes act as a headwind for the Bitcoin price , as it makes dollar-denominated assets relatively more expensive for international investors and can signal tighter global liquidity conditions. The Bitfinex analysts warn that a strong report could weigh on BTC’s price, potentially pushing it down. They mention testing support near $102,000 or even a drop below the significant $100,000 level . They suggest that in this bearish scenario, potential accumulation could occur in the $95,000–$97,000 range . Potential Challenges in this Scenario: Market disappointment over delayed rate cuts. Strengthening U.S. dollar potentially reducing international buying power. Increased volatility and potential liquidation events in the crypto market . Are These Forecasts Actionable for Investors? While analyst reports provide valuable insights into potential market movements based on specific catalysts like the U.S. jobs report and expected actions from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates , it’s crucial to remember that these are scenarios, not guarantees. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond macroeconomic data, including regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to the actual jobs report data when it’s released. Understand the Nuance: Don’t just look at the headline number. Wage growth and unemployment rate figures also provide important context. Consider Both Scenarios: Have a plan for how you might react to both a bullish and a bearish outcome for the Bitcoin price . Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially given the inherent volatility of the crypto market . Look for Confirmation: Don’t rely solely on one data point or one analyst’s opinion. Look for broader market reactions and technical indicators to confirm potential trends. The Bottom Line: Navigating the Crypto Market Ahead The upcoming U.S. jobs report is undoubtedly a key event on the macroeconomic calendar that has the potential to significantly influence the short-term trajectory of the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . The analysis from Bitfinex highlights the potential for a surge towards $115K if the report is weak, paving the way for potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Conversely, a strong report could reinforce higher interest rates for longer, potentially pushing Bitcoin back towards key support levels near or below $100K. As investors, understanding these potential scenarios and their underlying economic drivers is vital. While forecasts provide a roadmap, the path the Bitcoin price ultimately takes will be determined by how the market collectively interprets the data and reacts. Staying informed, maintaining a balanced perspective, and employing sound risk management strategies are your best tools for navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, journey of the crypto market .

But according to influential crypto commentator BarriC, the real moment of mass hysteria, true Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), won’t arrive until XRP crosses the astonishing $1,000 mark. BarriC’s Bold Price Forecast Taking to X, BarriC made a compelling case that while XRP has seen its fair share of market cycles, the public has yet to experience what he calls “massive FOMO.” In his words, “When $XRP hits $1,000 , that’s when we see massive FOMO from the masses, desperate to own 1 XRP.” The post, which quickly gained traction, taps into a growing narrative that XRP’s long-term value lies not just in its utility or legal clarity but in its scarcity and psychological appeal. While $1,000 may sound like a fantastical number to many retail investors accustomed to XRP’s historically modest price range, BarriC’s perspective is rooted in a broader understanding of how retail behavior tends to trail institutional adoption. His comment suggests that the bulk of the public has yet to grasp XRP’s full potential and that true market frenzy will only ignite once the price reaches levels most now consider unthinkable. When $XRP hits $1,000 That’s when we see massive FOMO from the masses, desperate to own 1 x #XRP — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 4, 2025 Institutional Momentum and Utility-Driven Value BarriC’s projection comes amid a wave of growing institutional attention on Ripple, the company closely associated with XRP. Ripple’s cross-border payments network, which continues to expand globally, leverages XRP for on-demand liquidity, a model that has begun to appeal to central banks and large-scale financial institutions looking to modernize outdated payment rails. Ripple has also taken firm steps toward integrating its ecosystem into broader financial frameworks. The launch of RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, is aimed at enhancing XRP Ledger (XRPL) liquidity and promoting enterprise-grade tokenization, setting the stage for further adoption. These developments add a layer of long-term utility to XRP, strengthening the argument for a significantly higher valuation. Moreover, the advent of tokenized assets and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) places XRP at the center of conversations about the future of finance. With its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, XRP is uniquely positioned to serve as the bridge asset in a rapidly evolving global financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Psychological Threshold: The Power of Round Numbers BarriC’s $1,000 target also reflects an important psychological principle in financial markets: the power of round numbers. In the same way, Bitcoin’s rise above $10,000 and $50,000 triggered new waves of interest; XRP crossing a milestone like $1,000 could dramatically shift public perception. Scarcity-driven narratives, especially the idea that owning just one XRP becomes a big deal, have historically sparked major retail interest in other assets. The comparison is not without precedent. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum also went through extended periods of underestimation before the masses caught on. By the time BTC crossed $20,000 in late 2020, most of the institutional accumulation had already occurred. Retail investors, driven by headlines and viral posts, often buy the top of the wave. BarriC believes XRP could follow a similar trajectory, with the masses only scrambling to accumulate when supply dries up and price enters four-digit territory. The FOMO Threshold: Speculation or Strategic Forecast? BarriC’s forecast, while bold, aligns with a growing belief that a massive price appreciation for XRP could be triggered not by speculation alone but by fundamentals converging with market psychology. Utility, legal clarity, and scarcity narratives could become catalysts, and in a space as sentiment-driven as crypto, such a tipping point could result in a self-fulfilling surge. As history has shown with other digital assets, today’s improbable can become tomorrow’s inevitable. And if BarriC is right, the XRP FOMO that many expected years ago has yet to begin, it’s merely waiting for the right number to be printed on the charts.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading AVAX Price Declines Amid Market Uncertainty Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced significant price drops recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 11.31%, contributing to a monthly loss of 2.19%. In the last six months, AVAX has seen a sharp decline of 59.28%. Currently, AVAX trades between $18.99 and $23.55. This range positions it closer to its nearest support level at $17.12 than to the resistance level at $26.22. If the downward trend continues, the price may test the support level, which could lead to further declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for AVAX is 54.58. An RSI above 50 suggests that the asset isn't oversold, indicating potential for price stability or a rebound. Breaking above the resistance level of $26.22 could signal a positive shift in momentum. Given the recent performance and current indicators, AVAX's future price movement remains uncertain. Monitoring the support and resistance levels will be crucial in understanding its potential direction. Chainlink's Price Dips: Is a Rebound on the Horizon? Chainlink (LINK) has seen a decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the price dropped by 10.13%. In the last month, it fell by 4.75%, and over the past six months, it decreased by 42.19%. These figures show a downward trend in the short to medium term. Currently, LINK's price is between $12.93 and $15.69. The nearest support level is at $11.79. If the price falls below this point, it could indicate further declines. The nearest resistance level is at $17.32. Breaking above this could signal a potential upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for LINK is at 53.00. An RSI around 50 suggests that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. This means the price could move in either direction depending on market factors. Traders are watching these levels closely. A move above the resistance at $17.32 might indicate a positive trend. Conversely, dropping below the support at $11.79 could lead to more losses. The next few days may reveal where LINK is headed. Aave Price Swings: Will It Rise or Fall Next? Aave's price is now between $228.42 and $273.33. Over the past month, it went up by 39.92%. In the last week, it dropped by 9.27%. In the past six months, it has gained 1.34%. This shows that Aave has been volatile recently. The nearest resistance level is at $300.54. If Aave's price rises from $273.33 to $300.54, that's an increase of about 10%. Breaking this resistance could signal more growth. But reaching this level may be challenging. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $210.72. A drop from $228.42 to $210.72 would be a decrease of about 8%. If the price falls below this support, it could lead to further declines. Traders may watch this level closely. The RSI is at 49.59, which is neutral. This suggests that Aave is neither overbought nor oversold. With recent gains in the past month and a small drop in the last week, the price could move in either direction. Investors should keep an eye on key levels. Monero's Bullish Trend Continues Despite Weekly Decline Monero (XMR) experienced a price decline of 16.64% over the past week. This short-term drop may concern some investors, but it contrasts with the cryptocurrency's strong longer-term performance. Over the past month, Monero's price has increased by 24.18%, indicating robust growth. Even more impressive is the 71.39% surge over the past six months, demonstrating a significant upward trajectory. Currently trading between $300.76 and $408.22, Monero is approaching its nearest resistance level at $468. Breaking through this resistance could result in a potential gain of approximately 15%. Conversely, the nearest support level is at $253.52, serving as a potential floor if prices decline. An RSI of 68.17 suggests that Monero is nearing overbought territory, which could lead to some consolidation. However, given the strong momentum over the past month and half-year, the data indicates that Monero's price may continue to rise after this brief pullback. Maker (MKR) currently trades between $1484 and $1749. Over the past week, its price has dipped by 3.52%. However, in the past month, it has seen a modest rise of 1.02%. This shows that while there has been a recent decline, there's also signs of recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for MKR is at 52.75. An RSI around 50 suggests a balanced market, indicating that MKR is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral position could mean the price is ready to move significantly in one direction. The nearest resistance level is at $1895. If MKR's price breaks above this point, it could signal a strong upward trend. This would be an increase of over 8% from its current high in the trading range. Such a move might attract more buyers and push the price even higher. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $1365. If the price falls below this, it might continue to drop. Over the past six months, MKR's price has decreased by 30.93%. This significant decline suggests there is potential for growth if market conditions improve. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like AVAX, LINK, AAVE, and XMR remain undervalued with solid long-term prospects, their short-term potential appears limited in the current bull run. Codename:Pepe emerges as a standout option, unleashing true intelligence to maximize profits in the volatile crypto market.

Total crypto-collateralized lending fell 4.9% quarter-over-quarter to $39.07 billion, the first decline since late 2023, Galaxy Research’s Q1 2025 report shows. But while the headline figure contracted, underlying dynamics suggest leverage is shifting form, not fading. Lending in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending took a hit early in the quarter, sliding as much as 21%, before rebounding sharply in April and May. The turnaround was driven largely by Aave’s integration of Pendle tokens, whose yield-bearing structure and high loan-to-value ratios (up to 90%) sparked a wave of fresh borrowing. By late May, DeFi borrowing had surged more than 30% off the lows, with Ethereum leading the recovery. Centralized finance (CeFi) lending climbed 9.24% to $13.51 billion, led by Tether, Ledn, and Two Prime. Still, Galaxy notes that a narrow set of public disclosures limits visibility into the true scope of centralized lending. Private desks, OTC platforms, and offshore credit providers likely push the actual total far higher. perhaps by 50% or more. Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC treasury companies are quietly becoming a new systemic leverage node. Firms like Strategy (MSTR) have issued billions in convertible debt to fund BTC purchases. As of May, total outstanding debt across treasury firms stood at $12.7 billion, much of it set to mature between 2027 and 2028. In derivatives, CME’s rising open interest especially in ether ETH futures signals accelerating institutional participation. At the same time, upstart exchange Hyperliquid has carved out a growing share of the perpetual futures market, underscoring the continued strength of retail-driven leverage. The report points to an increasingly interconnected market structure, one where stress in a single venue or instrument could reverberate quickly across the ecosystem. Leverage, in crypto’s current cycle, may be more fragmented than before — but it’s no less potent.",Markets|Galaxy|Leverage|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-05 11:38:52

It surprised the market by pricing its IPO at $31 per share, well above the expected $27 to $28 range. The company and existing shareholders sold about 34 million shares, raising approximately $1.1 billion. This pricing values Circle at around $6.9 billion, according to Bloomberg . Second Big Crypto Listing Goes Live The stablecoin issuer was set to go live today on the NYSE under the ticker “CRCL.” Circle has also given its underwriters a 30-day option to buy an extra 5.1 million shares. BlackRock plans to buy 10% of Circle’s IPO shares, while ARK Invest plans to invest up to $150 million. This IPO is the second big crypto listing under the Trump administration, after eToro’s debut last month. This move gives Circle more access to funding and stronger regulatory oversight that will help improve investor confidence amidst recent volatility in crypto markets. Ripple Denies Circle Acquisition Rumors This comes shortly after the rumors of a potential acquisition by Ripple were put to rest. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared during a Las Vegas Bitcoin conference that Ripple had never pursued an acquisition of Circle, while some reports had suggested that Circle had denied a $5 billion offer from Ripple. Coinbase was also on the list to acquire Circle. Nevertheless, Circle’s IPO shows rising institutional interest in stablecoins and the broader crypto market. U.S. lawmakers are also pushing for clearer rules for stablecoins, which marks a major shift in how these digital assets will be viewed in the country. Lately, Wall Street giants have also shown interest in exploring their own stablecoin plans. Why Institutions Could Choose Circle- Circle is one of the first big crypto companies. The USDC, issued by Circle, is the second most popular stablecoin, holding 27% of the market, while Tether’s USDT leads at 67%. Circle’s IPO is also one of the biggest since Coinbase’s 2021 Debut. This is a big step for crypto moving into traditional finance. More crypto firms are eyeing the public market. Kraken is reportedly planning an IPO this year, while BitGo launched a global trading desk in February ahead of its listing plans. Circle’s USDC coin is likely to be favored by institutions due to the company’s strict regulatory focus. It was the first to get a New York State BitLicense in 2015, which gives it an advantage as banks and fintech firms look to enter the stablecoin space.",News|Crypto news|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 11:39:03

A longtime Bitcoin supporter, Lummis is working with Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) to fold in parts of her bipartisan crypto regulation bill , co-authored with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Her proposals aim to close tax loopholes and support the crypto industry – though not everyone is on the same page. Crypto Wash-Sale Rule Could Raise Billions One of Lummis’s main proposals is to apply the wash-sale rule to crypto. This would stop investors from selling their digital assets at a loss and quickly buying them back to reduce their tax bills – a common tactic that isn’t currently restricted for crypto. Lummis told Semafor, “This bill is the right place to fix crypto taxation,” but skeptics, including Gillibrand, call it “premature,” citing risks of rushed policy. Bitcoin Miners May Catch a Break Another part of Lummis’s plan would exempt Bitcoin miners from reporting capital gains and losses. This would ease the reporting burden on miners, who often face confusing tax requirements despite playing a major role in the crypto ecosystem. This proposal reflects Lummis’s ongoing support for the industry, but it’s expected to face resistance in a divided Senate. Trump Weighs In on GOP Tax Bill On Wednesday, members of the Senate Finance Committee, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), met with President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss the bill. According to Cassidy, Trump is focused on including “working account benefits,” adding more complexity to ongoing negotiations. A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto Policy With the 2025 tax cuts set to expire soon, Lummis’s proposals could help set the direction for how digital assets are taxed and regulated going forward. If adopted, they could provide clarity to the crypto market while also boosting federal revenue. But with mixed support – even among allies – the road ahead for these reforms remains uncertain.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 11:40:38

This accounts for $31.45 billion in USDT and USDC alone. It is more than three times the next closest competitor, OKX, which holds $8.2 billion (15.39%). The stablecoin market cap is on a surge as its capitalization breached the $254 billion mark. Tether’s USDT remains the largest stablecoin with a market cap of more than $153 billion, while USDC remains at the second spot with over $61 billion cap. Hype for stablecoins is such that even Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial launched its dollar-pegged USD1 recently. Binance tops Bitcoin inflows According to the data, Binance dominates in its central role in crypto liquidity, while Coinbase leads in total reserves with $129 billion. Binance stands in the second spot in all reserves, holding $110 billion. Combined, Coinbase and Binance hold 60% of the total reserves held across the top 20 crypto exchanges. As of May, Binance received $31 billion in USDT/USDC deposits. It stood just ahead of Coinbase’s $30 billion. A report mentioned that the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows. Meanwhile, Coinbase does not provide a public Proof-of-Reserves (PoR), but Binance offers transparent PoR reports, and this includes wallet addresses. It added that Coinbase and Binance bagged the largest cumulative inflows in USD terms in 2025. These figures turn out to be $344 and $335 billion, respectively. However, Binance showed the highest average Bitcoin inflow . On May 22, as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of over $111,900, the exchange saw an average BTC deposit size of 7 BTC, the biggest among major exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant On the other side, major exchanges’ average deposits were lower. Bitfinex accounted for 5, OKX for 1.23, and it was less than 1 BTC for Kraken and Coinbase. Stablecoin boom and politics collide This surge comes as the US Senate is heading into the final stretch of debate on the GENIUS Act . The stablecoin bill could become the first major crypto legislation to pass the chamber as it seeks to regulate the issuers of dollar-pegged tokens like USDT and USDC. However, it has already cleared the Banking Committee and passed an early floor test with bipartisan support. Some Democrats have begun linking the bill to Donald Trump’s personal crypto ventures. This includes one of the projects closely tied to the president, USD1 . Backed by World Liberty Financial, USD1 has exploded in usage. In just 10 days after its Binance listing, the stablecoin recorded over $10.7 billion in transfer volume. Data shows that from May 22 to June 1, trading volumes surged past all prior records. The week of May 19 alone saw a 1,300% jump in transfer activity. It soared from $307M to $4.3 billion, and by June 1, USD1 had already logged another $6.8 billion, setting a new weekly high. That surge follows a rapid rise in market cap as USD1 broke into the top six stablecoins in May, surpassing $2 billion. For lawmakers, this growth complicates the GENIUS Act’s final steps, as some argue the legislation could benefit Trump-linked ventures.

The program, known as Stabilize Families, is backed by the nonprofit RISE Together Innovation Institute and the Community Shelter Board in Franklin County, Ohio, reports The Columbus Dispatch. The Community Shelter Board will give 80 families a one-off cash handout of $1,500, while RISE Together Innovation Institute will offer monthly payments of $500 to 20 families for 11 months. Data collected by the Community Shelter Board reportedly shows homelessness in Franklin County in 2024 went up six times faster than the population growth. As of January 23rd, according to the report, there were 2,556 homeless people in the Ohio county, up by 7.4% from 2024. Community Shelter Board’s president and CEO Shannon Isom says the guaranteed income pilot program is “about dignity” and will give the beneficiaries “breathing room to stabilize, plan, and dream again.” The report cites RISE Together Innovation Institute’s CEO Danielle Sydnor saying, “Guaranteed income is a viable strategy to promote economic stability and well-being for residents in Franklin County.” According to the report, Ohio State University will be involved in the guaranteed income pilot program and will conduct research on the project’s impact on beneficiaries and the community.

While Bitcoin (BTC) often dominates headlines, recent data suggests a significant shift is occurring, with Ethereum (ETH) taking the lead in terms of short-term performance. This divergence is sparking conversations across the industry about the potential for a broader rally among altcoins – commonly known as an altseason. Understanding the current landscape requires a close look at the key metrics driving this narrative. What Does Ethereum (ETH)’s Outperformance Mean? Recent analysis from crypto data analytics firm Swissblock, shared on X, highlights a compelling trend: Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated remarkable strength over the past month. Specifically, ETH has surged by an impressive 46% over the last 30 days. This performance substantially outpaces Bitcoin (BTC)’s gains during the same period. This kind of relative strength from the second-largest cryptocurrency is often seen as a significant indicator within the market. The disparity in performance between the two crypto giants is a crucial piece of the puzzle when conducting Crypto Market Analysis. Bitcoin’s movements typically set the tone for the overall market, but when Ethereum begins to show independent strength and outperform BTC, it suggests capital might be rotating down the market cap ladder. Why is the ETH/BTC Ratio So Important? The relationship between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) is often tracked using the ETH/BTC ratio. This ratio measures the price of one ETH in terms of Bitcoin. A rising ETH/BTC ratio means Ethereum is gaining value relative to Bitcoin, while a falling ratio indicates the opposite. According to Swissblock’s report, the ETH/BTC ratio has increased by 30% over the past 30 days. This substantial jump is a direct consequence of ETH’s superior performance during this period. The ETH/BTC ratio is a critical barometer for market sentiment regarding altcoins. When this ratio trends upward, it often signals increasing confidence and interest in Ethereum and, by extension, the broader altcoin market. Traders and analysts closely watch this ratio for clues about potential market rotations and the likelihood of an Altseason. Is a Breakout Approaching for the ETH/BTC Pair? The growing momentum reflected in the rising ETH/BTC ratio is pushing the pair towards a significant technical level. According to Swissblock, the pair is approaching the upper boundary of its weekly trading range. Technical analysts pay close attention to trading ranges and their boundaries. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Resistance Level: The upper boundary of a trading range typically acts as a resistance level, where selling pressure has historically emerged. Breakout Potential: A successful breakout above this level, especially with strong volume and conviction, is often interpreted as a bullish signal. Trend Confirmation: Clearing this resistance could confirm the strengthening trend of ETH relative to BTC and potentially pave the way for further gains. A breakout from this key technical level for the ETH/BTC pair is considered a potential trigger for a significant shift in market dynamics. Could This Signal the Beginning of an Altseason? The term Altseason refers to a period where altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) experience significant price increases, often outperforming Bitcoin by a large margin. These periods are characterized by capital flowing from Bitcoin into various altcoins as investors seek higher returns and explore emerging technologies or trends. While there’s no single definitive trigger for an altseason, several factors often precede or accompany one: Bitcoin Stability or Sideways Movement: Bitcoin consolidating after a large rally allows capital to look elsewhere. ETH Leading the Charge: As the largest altcoin by market cap and a major ecosystem driver, Ethereum’s strong performance relative to Bitcoin is often a precursor. Increasing Risk Appetite: Market sentiment becomes more bullish, and investors are willing to take on more risk by investing in smaller, more volatile altcoins. Specific Altcoin Narratives: Hype around particular sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI, etc.) can fuel rallies in related altcoins. The current scenario, with Ethereum (ETH) showing such strong relative strength and the ETH/BTC ratio challenging a key resistance, aligns with historical patterns that have preceded altseasons. A successful breakout could indeed act as the catalyst that broadens the rally beyond just ETH. What Factors Are Driving Demand for Ethereum? Beyond simple speculation, several fundamental factors could be contributing to the rising demand for Ethereum (ETH): 1. Staking Yield: The transition to Proof-of-Stake allows ETH holders to earn yield by staking their tokens, making it an attractive asset for passive income. 2. Ecosystem Activity: Ethereum remains the dominant platform for decentralized applications (DApps), including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 scaling solutions. Increased activity in these areas drives demand for ETH as the network’s native currency for gas fees and participation. 3. Potential ETF Developments: While Bitcoin ETFs have launched, speculation continues regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions, which could open the door to significant institutional investment. 4. Network Upgrades: Ongoing developments and planned upgrades to the Ethereum network aim to improve scalability, security, and sustainability, enhancing its long-term value proposition. These underlying drivers provide a fundamental basis for ETH’s value, complementing the technical and market-driven factors contributing to its recent outperformance in the Crypto Market Analysis. Challenges and Considerations While the signals are promising, it’s important to consider potential challenges and risks: Bitcoin Volatility: A sudden significant downturn in Bitcoin’s price could negatively impact the entire market, including Ethereum and other altcoins, potentially halting or reversing an altseason. Regulatory Headwinds: Uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in major markets can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and dampen investor enthusiasm. Technical Failure to Break Out: The ETH/BTC pair could fail to break above the weekly range resistance, leading to a retracement and delaying any potential altseason. Market Saturation: While some altcoins may rally, not all will participate equally, and many carry high risks. Navigating the market requires careful consideration of both the bullish signals and the potential pitfalls. Actionable Insights for Readers Given the current market dynamics, what should interested individuals consider? Monitor the ETH/BTC Ratio: Keep a close eye on the ETH/BTC chart, specifically the weekly range upper boundary mentioned by Swissblock. A convincing break and hold above this level would be a strong bullish signal. Research Altcoins: If an altseason materializes, not all altcoins will perform equally. Research projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Manage Risk: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Employ proper risk management strategies, such as diversification and setting stop-losses. Stay Informed: Follow market analysis, news, and on-chain data to stay ahead of potential shifts. Concluding Thoughts: Is Altseason Imminent? The data from Swissblock painting a clear picture: Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing significant strength relative to Bitcoin (BTC), marked by a substantial 30-day gain and a rising ETH/BTC ratio challenging key resistance. This technical setup, combined with underlying fundamental drivers for Ethereum, presents a compelling case for the potential start of a new Altseason. While a breakout from the ETH/BTC weekly range boundary is seen as a potential trigger, the market remains subject to broader macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin’s price action. Investors should view these signals as indicators, not guarantees. The potential is certainly building, but careful observation, research, and risk management remain paramount in navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of cryptocurrency markets.

Its impressive rally is likely driven by support from Upbit. ‘The Sleeping Giant Just Woke Up Today’ The low-cap altcoin Ravencoin (RVN) took center stage today (June 5) by registering a whopping price increase. Specifically, its valuation skyrocketed by over 75% on a 24-hour scale, jumping to a five-month-high of approximately $0.02. RVN Price, Source: CoinGecko Its market cap surged past $260 million, which represents serious progress, but RVN remains out of the top 250 cryptocurrencies. Back in 2021, RVN was in much better shape, with its capitalization briefly touching the $2 billion mark. At that time, its price reached an all-time high of almost $0.30, meaning the current figure is 93% lower than the historic peak. However, some industry participants believe the asset could restore its former glory. X user Vasil said, “ the sleeping giant RVN just woke up today,” predicting this might be the beginning of a major pump. The most likely reason fueling the recent spike is the support coming from Upbit. The leading South Korean crypto exchange listed the RVN/KRW trading pair, making some important disclaimers involving certain services: “Deposits and withdrawals are only supported through the designated network (RVN-Ravencoin). Be sure to verify the network before depositing . Deposits and withdrawals are only possible fro m/t o personally verified wallet addresses. Even if the deposit is made from a linked personal wallet, depending on the asset’s network, deposit returns may be necessary.” Upbit’s Previous Impact Last week, the exchange allowed trading services with Pocket Network (POKT) and Livepeer (LPT). The effort gave a serious boost to the prices of the involved assets. POKT exploded by 350% on a daily scale, while LPT headed north by 80% within the timeframe. A similar price reaction was observed in February and April. First, Upbit allowed users to trade the TRUMP/KRW, TRUMP/BTC, and TRUMP/USDT pairs, which resulted in a substantial rally for the meme coin connected to the US president. Then, the company followed Binance’s example and backed DeepBook (DEEP). The valuation of the altcoin jumped by double digits shortly after the announcements. Such dynamics shouldn’t come as a surprise. After all, support from big industry players like Upbit increases the liquidity of the listed token, boosts its accessibility, and has a positive impact on its reputation.

Afterwards, BTC started to recover with the moderate steps taken by US President Donald Trump and broke a new record by rising above $111,000 in the last days of May. While tariff tensions have had a significant impact on Bitcoin, Swyftx Chief Analyst Pav Hundal identified Trump’s ongoing tariff uncertainty as a significant threat to Bitcoin. At this point, Pav Hundal said that Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in June if trade tensions in the US ease. “The biggest threat to bulls right now is that nothing changes for the next two months and we get stuck in this endless cycle of tariff uncertainty. If the tariff tensions are resolved, Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in June. However, if the bears say 'I told you so', we could see Bitcoin fall below $100,000.” FED Expects Tariff Uncertainty to Be Resolved for Interest Rate Cuts! Hundal said that tariff uncertainty also delayed the FED's interest rate cut decision, adding that there was a risk that the FED would delay monetary expansion until it obtained concrete data on the impact of Trump's tariffs, which would pose a risk of slowing growth. “Trump-induced tariff uncertainty has jeopardized the achievement of the 2% inflation target this year. Six months ago, a 2% inflation target seemed possible; today, it is under long-term threat from tariffs. The US is at a macro turning point and the Fed is walking a fine line right now.” *This is not investment advice.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump highlighted that reaching an agreement with Beijing would be “extremely hard” while Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, commented that negotiations were a “bit stalled” at the moment. This deteriorates the macroeconomic backdrop but may favor cryptocurrencies as an economic slowdown caused by higher-for-longer tariffs could prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Lower rates result in higher liquidity for the financial markets in the near term and would favor a bullish Cardano price forecast. We’re talking about potentially unlocking $1.5 trillion in DeFi opportunities – that’s the power of this new cross-chain era for Bitcoin and Cardano. Together with @FairgateLabs , Input | Output has worked to make this possibility a reality thanks to our ongoing strategic… pic.twitter.com/YLwmBMYbTm — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) May 28, 2025 In addition, in late May, significant progress was made to expand Cardano’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem as the first Bitcoin-to-Cardano transaction involving Ordinals was successfully executed. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano project, emphasized that a full integration between these two powerful blockchains could unlock nearly $1.5 trillion in cross-chain trading volumes for the network. This could be the beginning of a new era for Cardano that could result in significant upside potential ahead for its native asset ADA. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Could Retest $1 After Bullish Breakout of Falling Wedge Cardano (ADA) encountered strong selling pressure at around $0.84 lately and proceeded to move lower, below the $0.70 level at some point in the past few days. Trading volumes have been relatively stable in the past 24 hours as the token has booked a mild gain of 0.4%. A falling wedge has formed as a result of the latest price action. This is a bullish setup that could deliver significant gains. Momentum indicators seem to be improving as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now pointing upwards and appears to be heading to retest its 14-day moving average from below. The price has dived below its short-term and long-term EMAs. Hence, it would need to jump above those resistances to move higher. A successful breakout above the $0.70 level would favor a short-term Cardano price prediction of $1, especially if a bullish crossover between the 21-day and 200-day EMA occurs. Apart from ADA, the best crypto presales of this year like SUBBD (SUBBD) offer significant upside potential to early buyers. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises $600,000 to Build the Best Content Distribution Platform for Creators SUBBD (SUBBD) is a decentralized content distribution platform that aims to create a better environment for influencers to share their content and monetize their fan base.

Analyst Dan Gambardello, discussing the news in a video , called the move “ massive “; adding: “Franklin Templeton is just casually securing the Cardano network. It’s hard to be bearish when the big players are already playing the long game.” The broader implication is clear: institutions are beginning to explore altcoins beyond Bitcoin, and Cardano is being increasingly seen as a serious network for future decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation.

Fans flooded stores across cities in New York and Tokyo as stores struggled to keep up with pent-up demand for the new console. According to gaming console KOLs, there’s more than likely to be a Switch 2 supply crunch that may last weeks or even months. At GameStop Corp.’s Union Square location in New York City, gamers began lining up nearly 20 hours in advance, with the first arrivals staking out their spots as early as 4:30 a.m. Another snaking line was seen at the Nintendo Store uptown. In Japan , Tokyo’s Ikebukuro shopping district, dozens of customers who had secured a purchase through a lottery system stood in line at electronics retailer Bic Camera to collect their consoles. “I feel like I’m going to cry,” said Yumi Ohi, a 30-year-old delivery contractor from Saitama prefecture, who had lost previous lotteries before finally securing her Switch 2. Nintendo’s original Switch console, which debuted in 2017 and sold over 152 million units globally, alongside hit franchises like “The Legend of Zelda” and the pandemic-era favorite “Animal Crossing: New Horizons.” Console supply shortage affects millions globally Retailers in both the US and Japan had expected the demand for the Switch 2 to be inordinate, but were left in shock after thousands of customers lined up before stores had opened. “ Line of people waiting to get Switch 2 but people online say nobody cares about Switch 2 and how it’s gonna flop ,” said one Zelda fan on X, sharing a video of a long line of customers waiting for GameStop stores to open. Nintendo had instituted a lottery system in Japan to manage the chaos, with over 2.2 million people applying. Only a fraction were able to purchase the device on release day. “ The level of demand seems to be sky-high ,” said Serkan Toto, founder of the Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games. “ You are looking at weeks or months until you can walk into a store and buy a Switch 2. ” Switch 2 ‘early success’ similar to the first The $499.99 Switch 2 is a determining release for Nintendo, as it is the company’s first major hardware refresh in years. Analysts view the launch as a test of the company’s manufacturing and logistics resilience, especially during a period of “hot heads” from the trade war initiated under the US President Donald Trump against China. The Switch 2 retains the hybrid home-portable design of its predecessor but introduces a larger screen and significantly improved graphics. On social media, those who were lucky to get their hands on the tech have shared clips playing titles like Cyberpunk 2077 , Bayonetta 3 , and Hyrule Warriors , all at 60 frames per second.

The system is also backward-compatible, so users can play existing Nintendo Switch games on the new hardware. Among the launch titles is “Mario Kart World,” retailing for $79.99 in the US, a price that gamers were not happy with. Yet for some customers, the premium is justifiable. “ I’ve been around since the Super Nintendo era ,” said Akitomo Takahashi, a salesman in his forties. “ Games from that period were expensive too, so I think it’s somewhat within the acceptable range .” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

A recent revelation from Binance CEO Richard Teng, citing data from CryptoQuant, shines a spotlight on the massive concentration of Binance stablecoin reserves within the centralized exchange ecosystem. According to Teng, Binance holds a staggering 59% of all stablecoin reserves across Centralized Exchanges (CEXs), amounting to approximately $31 billion. This figure underscores Binance’s significant position and its potential influence on the broader stablecoin market . What Exactly Are Stablecoin Reserves? Before diving deeper into Binance’s dominance, let’s quickly define what we’re talking about. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability makes them essential for trading, yield farming, and acting as a safe haven during market volatility. Stablecoin reserves held by exchanges are the total amount of stablecoins users have deposited onto these platforms. These reserves are vital for facilitating trading pairs (like BTC/USDT, ETH/USDC), providing liquidity, and enabling users to easily enter and exit positions without constantly converting back to traditional fiat currency. Why Does Binance Hold Such a Massive Share? Exploring Binance Dominance The figure of 59% of all Centralized Exchange stablecoins held by Binance is not just a number; it reflects the exchange’s immense scale and reach. Several factors likely contribute to this level of Binance dominance : Vast User Base: Binance boasts the largest user base among crypto exchanges globally. More users naturally mean higher deposits, including stablecoins. Extensive Trading Pairs: Binance offers an unparalleled number of trading pairs involving various stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD – historically significant, etc.). This makes it the go-to platform for traders who rely heavily on stablecoin pairs for strategy execution. Deep Liquidity: High reserves contribute to deep liquidity across numerous markets on Binance, attracting both retail and institutional traders who prioritize minimal slippage. Global Presence: Despite regulatory challenges in specific regions, Binance maintains a strong global footprint, consolidating a large portion of worldwide crypto activity. Product Diversity: Beyond spot trading, Binance offers futures, options, staking, lending, and other products that heavily utilize stablecoins, encouraging users to keep reserves on the platform. This concentration highlights Binance’s central role in the flow of stable value within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding the Crypto Market Share Implications Binance holding nearly 60% of all Centralized Exchange stablecoins has significant implications for the overall Crypto Market Share landscape. Here are a few key takeaways: Liquidity Hub: Binance acts as the primary liquidity hub for stablecoins, making it the most efficient place for large trades involving stable assets. Market Influence: The sheer volume of stablecoins on Binance means activity on the platform can heavily influence stablecoin prices and trading patterns across the market. Risk Concentration: While dominance indicates strength, it also presents a degree of risk concentration. Any significant event impacting Binance (e.g., regulatory action, technical issues) could have a ripple effect on a large portion of the stablecoin market. Competitive Landscape: This data point emphasizes the challenge faced by other CEXs in competing with Binance’s established network effect and liquidity advantage in the stablecoin arena. For traders and investors, understanding this distribution is vital for assessing market dynamics and potential points of impact. What Does This Mean for the Stablecoin Market? The fact that $31 billion in Binance stablecoin reserves represents 59% of the total on CEXs tells us something important about the overall size and distribution of the Stablecoin market on these platforms. It suggests the total stablecoin reserves on all CEXs combined are somewhere in the range of $52-53 billion ($31B / 0.59). This figure is separate from stablecoins held in decentralized protocols, self-custody wallets, or other venues, but it highlights the significant volume anchored within centralized trading infrastructure. The health and stability of these centralized reserves are paramount for market functioning. Binance’s large share means it bears a significant responsibility in managing these assets securely and transparently, a point often emphasized by exchanges in building user trust. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from Centralized Exchange Stablecoins Concentration While Binance dominance in stablecoin reserves offers benefits like deep liquidity, it also brings challenges: Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Large concentrations of funds attract regulatory attention regarding compliance, KYC/AML, and potential market manipulation risks. Single Point of Failure: A major security breach or operational failure at Binance could disproportionately impact the centralized stablecoin market. Centralization Concerns: For proponents of decentralization, such high concentration on one platform runs counter to the core ethos of crypto. Opportunities: Enhanced Trading: Deep pools of Centralized Exchange stablecoins allow for efficient, large-volume trading. Price Stability: Concentrated liquidity can help stablecoins maintain their peg more effectively on the dominant platform. Innovation Hub: Binance can leverage its large stablecoin reserves to launch new products and services that require significant stablecoin liquidity. Navigating these aspects is key for both the exchange and market participants. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Given the significant level of Binance stablecoin reserves and its resulting market influence, what should individuals in the crypto space consider? Monitor Binance Activity: Keep an eye on major announcements, regulatory news, or changes in policy related to Binance, as these could impact a large portion of the stablecoin market. Understand Liquidity: While Binance offers deep stablecoin liquidity, be aware of how liquidity is distributed across different stablecoin pairs and other exchanges. Diversify Exchange Use (Optional): Depending on your risk tolerance and trading needs, consider distributing funds across multiple reputable exchanges, although this comes with its own complexities. Stay Informed on Stablecoin Developments: Pay attention to regulatory developments surrounding stablecoins themselves, as these will affect their usage and reserves on all platforms, including Binance. Understanding the landscape of Centralized Exchange stablecoins , particularly Binance’s role, is crucial for making informed decisions. The Future of the Stablecoin Market and Binance’s Role The Stablecoin market is constantly evolving, driven by technological advancements, increasing adoption, and evolving regulatory frameworks. Will Binance maintain its dominant Crypto Market Share in stablecoin reserves? Competition from other CEXs, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), and potential new regulations could shift the balance. However, Binance’s established network effect and liquidity advantage provide a strong foundation. The reported $31 billion in Binance stablecoin reserves is a testament to the exchange’s current standing. As the market matures, transparency and regulatory compliance will become even more critical factors influencing where users choose to hold their stable assets. Concluding Thoughts Richard Teng’s statement, backed by CryptoQuant data, confirms Binance’s formidable position in the centralized stablecoin landscape. Holding 59% of Centralized Exchange stablecoins underscores its role as a critical liquidity provider and a significant force in the overall Stablecoin market . While this level of Binance dominance brings efficiency and liquidity, it also highlights the importance of understanding concentration risk within the Crypto Market Share distribution. As the industry moves forward, monitoring these dynamics will be essential for anyone participating in the crypto space.

In a video analysis, the analyst pointed to a second consecutive “blue bar” flashing on Ethereum’s momentum oscillator, a signal he treats as a reliable harbinger of imminent, high-magnitude moves across the digital-asset complex. “The last time we had two blue bars on Ethereum was way back when we were still young and optimistic,” he said, invoking memories of August 2023. “We printed five that time and the market moved sixteen percent. We’re at two now; by Sunday we’ll probably have four, which tells me the move should come next week.” Dogecoin Needs June Rally To Avert Summer Slump Although the blue-bar framework is native to Ethereum, VisionPulsed argued that its read-through for Bitcoin and, by correlation, Dogecoin is more important than ever. He noted that Bitcoin’s own hash-ribbon metric—formed when the network’s 30-day and 60-day hash-rate moving averages compress—has followed a strictly “sell for two weeks, then rally” pattern through the current cycle. “We’ve already been selling off for two weeks,” he said. “Historically in this bull market, that’s when Bitcoin resets and moves higher. If that plays out again, Dogecoin should finally get the lift it’s been denied since February.” Related Reading: June Or Doom: Dogecoin Faces 6 Red Months If It Fails To Surge, Predicts Analyst The crux of his thesis sits on a 70-day timing model derived from Dogecoin’s prior impulse lows. Measuring from the most recent trough, the 70-day mark falls on 14 June. “Every major upswing in Dogecoin during this cycle has come 60 to 80 days after a bottom,” he explained, scrolling through historical candles on screen. “We’re right on that window—if we’re going to break higher, it almost has to be now.” VisionPulsed acknowledged his own track record of slipping deadlines—“one for five hundred,” he joked—but insisted the structure remains statistically sound. “If we don’t rally next week, I’m never putting dates on anything again,” he told viewers, before adding a caveat that has become the headline takeaway. “Dogecoin has to clear $0.40. If we can’t do that, the bear case strengthens dramatically: June down, July probably down, September seasonally weak, and suddenly you’re talking eight red months out of nine.” Pressed by commenters about the depth of a potential downside scenario, the analyst pointed to Ethereum for context. A bullish resolution, he said, could lift ETH to roughly $3,200 before a summer consolidation and possibly $4,200 by early autumn, a path that in his view would drag Dogecoin well north of the $0.40 trigger. Failure, however, “sets up a very large move down, maybe sub-$2,000 on ETH,” a slide that would likely leave Dogecoin retesting multi-month lows. “Whichever way we go,” he concluded, “is going to determine the rest of the summer.” Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The urgency is aggravated by Dogecoin’s mounting sequence of monthly losses: five red candles since January, with only a brief reprieve in April. “Six red months out of seven is staring us in the face,” VisionPulsed said. “June doesn’t have to be a vertical move, but it does have to be green—or at least show a decisive breakout—because otherwise, where is the bull run?” Market structure rather than sentiment, he stressed, underpins the call. Bitcoin already sits near cycle highs while Dogecoin still trades markedly below its own year-to-date peak, a divergence he interprets as latent leverage. “If Bitcoin punches through its local top, it typically drags Doge,” he said, referencing earlier intervals in 2024 when BTC strength eventually translated into delayed but exaggerated moves in the memecoin. Whether that historical choreography can repeat depends, in his framework, on the next few daily closes. “We’re definitely getting more energy built up,” he said, pointing to narrowing Bollinger Bands and declining on-chain activity. “I don’t think the large move is here yet, but by late this week—or early next week at the latest—you should get your answer.” For traders who still believe the four-year cycle remains intact, the analyst’s $0.40 line in the sand arrives almost exactly one calendar year before the next projected Bitcoin top in October 2026. “If Doge can’t start moving now, the entire timing model gets pushed off course,” he warned. “I genuinely think June is a make-or-break month.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

With Bitcoin trading sideways after its all-time highs, Ethereum could be poised for a potential breakout. In this write-up, we talk about the top reasons why the Ethereum price rally is on the cards. Top Reasons Why Ethereum Price is Going to Rally! Crypto analyst Lark Davis , in his recent post, cites that ETH is back in business, and the data proves it. Since the 8th of May, ETH’s trading volume has shown a sustained uptrend, indicating a rise in both buying and selling activity. Unlike previous phases of stagnation, traders are back and active. Additionally, whale accumulation is building a solid floor. While unconfirmed directly, on-chain signals and large wallet behaviors suggest heavy ETH buying, possibly in anticipation of future price rallies or institutional inflows. Importantly, the post also highlights that Ethereum’s comparative strength against Bitcoin is a standout. Even as BTC traced back from its all-time highs, ETH has held firm, signaling resilience. This independent performance is often a bullish signal, suggesting ETH may lead the next market leg higher. Furthermore, Ethereum’s 76% dominance in the tokenized asset space, boosted by stablecoin growth and active wallets, underpins its leadership role in the broader crypto ecosystem. This network strength continues to attract capital and developer attention. ETH Price Analysis Despite a minor 1.29% dip in the last 24 hours, ETH at press time trades at $2,608.70, still up over 45% in the past month. Its 24-hour trading volume has surged 9.14% to $17.75 billion, while its market cap stands at $314.79 billion. The chart shows ETH forming a higher low structure and holding support above key EMA20 at $2,522 and EMA50 at $2,320. Price action remains within a horizontal channel, with a clear resistance around $2,787. Should ETH break above the $2,787 resistance with volume, the next leg could target $3,000 and beyond. Given its strong fundamentals and technical setup, ETH offers an asymmetric long opportunity, especially if Bitcoin remains neutral or bullish.

This action involved the seizure of numerous domains and valuable crypto assets tied to the illicit platform, marking another step in the ongoing battle against online criminal enterprises that profit from stolen personal and financial information. Understanding the Threat: What Was the BidenCash Dark Web Market? For those unfamiliar with the shadier corners of the internet, a dark web market is a hidden online marketplace often used for illegal activities. BidenCash was one such platform, notorious for facilitating the sale of vast quantities of stolen data, primarily focusing on payment card information and other personally identifiable details. Think of it as a black market bazaar, but instead of physical goods, the commodities were digital lives and financial identities. According to reports, BidenCash managed to generate over $17 million in revenue. How? By selling access to more than 15 million compromised payment card numbers and associated data. This kind of operation fuels various types of fraud, from direct financial theft using cloned cards to identity theft that can plague victims for years. The sheer scale of BidenCash’s operation highlights the persistent threat posed by these hidden markets. How Did US Prosecutors Execute This Massive Crypto Seizure? The action taken by US prosecutors wasn’t just about taking down a website; it was a multi-pronged attack on the infrastructure and finances of the BidenCash operation. The coordinated effort led to two primary outcomes: Domain Seizures: A total of 145 domains associated with BidenCash were seized. This effectively shut down the primary access points users and vendors had to the market, disrupting its operations significantly. Imagine trying to run a store when the front door and all back entrances are suddenly locked by law enforcement. Crypto Asset Seizure: Crucially, authorities also obtained court authorization to seize crypto assets linked to BidenCash’s illicit activities. While the exact value hasn’t been publicly disclosed yet, these assets represent the ill-gotten gains from selling stolen payment cards and other data. Seizing these funds hits the criminals where it hurts most – their profits. This demonstrates the increasing capability of law enforcement agencies to trace and act upon financial flows in cryptocurrencies, challenging the long-held belief that crypto offers complete anonymity for criminals. Beyond BidenCash: Why Are Stolen Payment Cards a Persistent Problem? The BidenCash case isn’t isolated. The trade in stolen payment cards and personal data is a massive global industry. But why is it so prevalent? High Demand: Criminals constantly need fresh data for fraud. Relative Ease of Acquisition: Data can be compromised through various methods, including phishing, malware, data breaches at companies, and skimming devices. Profitability: Stolen data is a valuable commodity on the dark web. The data sold often includes not just the card number and expiry date, but also CVV codes, cardholder names, addresses, and even linked email addresses or phone numbers. This comprehensive data allows criminals to undertake more sophisticated fraudulent activities. What Does This Crypto Seizure Mean for Cybercrime? The crypto seizure in the BidenCash case sends a strong message. For years, some cybercriminals believed that using cryptocurrencies provided an impenetrable shield against asset forfeiture. While tracing crypto can be complex, especially with mixers or privacy coins, blockchain analysis tools and international cooperation are making it increasingly difficult for large-scale criminal operations to hide their wealth. This action, alongside other high-profile crypto seizures related to ransomware and dark web activities, indicates a growing trend: law enforcement is getting better at following the money, even when it’s in digital form. It increases the risk for cybercriminals and potentially disrupts their ability to fund future operations or enjoy the proceeds of their crimes. Protecting Your Digital Life: Actionable Steps While law enforcement works to dismantle markets like BidenCash, protecting yourself is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords across different sites. Use a password manager. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Especially on financial accounts, email, and social media. Be Wary of Phishing: Don’t click suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders. Verify requests for personal information. Monitor Financial Accounts: Regularly check bank statements and credit card bills for unauthorized transactions. Consider credit monitoring services. Limit Sharing Personal Information: Be mindful of how much information you share online. Keep Software Updated: Ensure your operating system, browser, and security software are always current. Taking these steps can significantly reduce your risk of becoming a victim whose data ends up on a dark web market. Conclusion: A Victory in the Fight Against Dark Web Crime The seizure of BidenCash domains and associated crypto assets by US prosecutors is a significant victory. It disrupts a major source of stolen payment cards and personal data, striking at the financial heart of a notorious dark web market . While the fight against cybercrime and the misuse of cryptocurrencies is far from over, actions like this demonstrate the increasing effectiveness of law enforcement in tracking, disrupting, and seizing assets from these illicit operations. It serves as a stark reminder to criminals that the digital realm is not a guaranteed safe haven for illegal activities, and a crucial alert for the public to remain vigilant in protecting their personal information.

Usually, mining is done by huge companies with super-powerful computers, so this small miner’s success is a rare and exciting moment that shows anyone can still play a part in the Bitcoin world. But how did this happen? And how often does a solo miner get so lucky? Solo Bitcoin Miner Wins $325,000 On June 4, 2025, a lone Bitcoin miner managed to solve block number 899,826 all by themselves. This lucky miner processed 3,680 transactions and received the full block reward of 3.125 BTC, which is worth around $325,000, plus an extra 0.026 BTC in transaction fees. Usually, it’s very hard for solo miners to win because huge mining farms and pools have so much computer power. These giant mining operations have massive resources, making it tough for someone working alone to compete against the 600+ EH/s network hashrate. Many in the mining space see this as a small win for decentralization, though large pools still dominate. Bitcoin Mining Is Getting Tough for Small Miners Mining Bitcoin isn’t as easy as it used to be. The process has gotten much harder because the network’s difficulty level is now at a record 126.98 trillion . This makes it tough for smaller miners to keep up, especially when big mining companies have more powerful machines. At the same time, Bitcoin’s hashrate, which shows how much computing power is being used, is at its highest level of 842.92 exahashes per second. That’s 40% more than it was just a year ago. This shows how crowded and competitive the Bitcoin mining space has become.

Data released last month showed the country’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation jumped to 3.5% in April, up from 2.6% in March. The statistics body has released revised data showing that the UK’s CPI rose by a lower 3.4% in the 12 months to April. The revised figure still exceeds the expectations of previous analysts, who had expected it to be 3.3%. ONS promises to use correctly weighted data from May This is … extraordinary. April's UK inflation figure should have been 3.4%, not 3.5%. Everybody makes mistakes, but I don't recall the ONS getting the CPI wrong before! https://t.co/XHF0O2vka1 — Julian Jessop (@julianHjessop) June 5, 2025 The ONS acknowledged that on Thursday, it realized an error in the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department of Transport, which is part of the information used to calculate inflation. It said the incorrect data overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates applicable in the first year of registration. The agency also noted that the error overstated the Retail Prices Index (RPI) annual rates by 10 basis points for the year to April 2025. It acknowledged that no other periods were affected by the miscalculation. “In line with our consumer prices revisions policy, these statistics will not be amended. However, we are reviewing our quality assurance processes for external data sources in light of this issue.” – The Office of National Statistics . The fault added to the agency’s already stained record, which has previously been criticized in some quarters for the accuracy and reliability of its data. The government also launched an investigation in April into the effectiveness of the official economic data it publishes. ONS apologized for the mistake and said it would use the correctly weighted data from May 2025’s figures onward. The agency will release the correct vehicle excise duty data in May’s inflation announcement. The UK currently has the second-highest inflation rate of any major Western European economy, behind the Netherlands. Despite the error in inflation data, Britain’s higher-than-expected surge in April also prompted investors to bet on the Bank of England slowing its already gradual pace of interest rate cuts. BoE expects to cut interest rates amid Trump’s trade policies Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said she was disappointed since the UK was far from the double-digit inflation it had under the previous administration. She also revealed her determination for the country to go further and faster to put more money in people’s pockets. According to JP Morgan economist Alan Monks, the inflation data called into question the likelihood of a rate cut over the summer. He told investors the surprise would reinforce BoE’s hawkish bias since there is no chance of a June cut, and the likelihood of an August cut shifted lower. The BoE forecasted that inflation would hit 3.7% by September. However, some central bank officials disagree with its key assumptions that the rise in inflation would not have longer-running effects on pricing. BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said last week that interest rate cuts had been too fast given strong wage pressures on inflation. Britain’s central financial institution lowered rates by a quarter point to 4.25% on May 8 in a three-way split vote. Two members of the Monetary Policy Committee favored a bigger cut, while two – including Pill – favored a hold. Trade uncertainty still lingers as U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline for countries to present their improved trade negotiations passed without any concrete developments. A BoE survey from May 9 to May 23 revealed on Thursday that only 12% of British businesses expect to be directly affected by recent changes in U.S. trade policy. Britain secured a partial exemption from Trump’s levies in early May, although the details will be finalized. The country’s financial institution said 70% of businesses surveyed in May as part of its monthly Decision Maker Panel expected that U.S. tariffs would not impact their sales, prices, or investment plans. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey acknowledged that domestic wage and price developments will likely be more important for future BoE rate cuts than U.S. trade policy.

EDPB Guidelines Could Outlaw BTC Over GDPR Conflict,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ban-in-europe-edpb-guidelines-could-outlaw-btc-over-gdpr-conflict/,"The post Bitcoin Ban in Europe? EDPB Guidelines Could Outlaw BTC Over GDPR Conflict appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A major regulatory storm is brewing in Europe, and it could put Bitcoin users in legal jeopardy. A recent consultation by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) could potentially ban Bitcoin across Europe , according to Alexandre Statchtchenko, co-founder of French crypto exchange Paymium. Why Is the EDPB Targeting Bitcoin? The EDPB’s draft guidelines argue that Bitcoin public keys qualify as personal data , making every BTC transaction subject to GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) . Because a public key can indirectly identify a person, it triggers compliance obligations, including the right to data deletion —something fundamentally incompatible with blockchain’s immutability. This clash between Bitcoin’s unalterable ledger and European privacy laws could make the cryptocurrency illegal to use or operate within EU nations. Alerte réglementaire — Bitcoin risque l’illégalité de fait en Europe Si les Guidelines du Comité Européen de la Protection des Données (EDPB en anglais) sont confirmées dans leur version finale, il n’existera plus aucun usage de Bitcoin 100 % conforme au droit européen. … pic.twitter.com/0N5qrW4kVg — Alexandre 'unhosted' Stachtchenko (@StachAlex) May 5, 2025 Critics Slam the Ban Proposal The guidelines have sparked immediate backlash. Critics argue the EDPB is demanding a “radical solution” without offering a feasible technical pathway for data deletion on blockchain . The committee even admitted that deletion requires an “ad-hoc engineered architecture,” a solution that doesn’t currently exist for Bitcoin. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump Accused of Crypto Corruption as CLARITY Act Debate Heats Up , AML vs. Anonymity: A Legal Paradox Statchtchenko highlights the absurdity of the situation, where regulatory demands conflict with each other. The GDPR requires anonymization and deletion of data, but Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws prohibit anonymity in financial transactions. In France and other EU countries, anonymous crypto transactions are presumed to be money laundering , placing Bitcoin in a regulatory deadlock. Who’s Involved and What’s Next? The EDPB’s public consultation is open until June 9, 2025 , and it’s attracting attention from across the crypto and Web3 ecosystem. Major industry players and legal experts are expected to voice concerns before the final decision.If the current draft guidelines are adopted without change, Bitcoin could be effectively banned in Europe , leaving millions of users trapped in legal uncertainty. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The strength or weakness of major fiat currencies like the US Dollar and the Euro exchange rate can significantly influence market sentiment and capital flows, often having an indirect but noticeable impact on digital asset valuations. Currently, attention is focused on recent shifts in the US Dollar ‘s position and the stability of the Euro exchange rate as a significant event looms: the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. Understanding Recent US Dollar Movements The US Dollar has seen some interesting price action recently. After a period of strength, it has edged off its recent highs. This movement is often influenced by shifts in expectations around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, economic data releases from the United States, and broader global risk sentiment. A weaker US Dollar can sometimes be seen as positive for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, as it can signal increased liquidity or a decreased appetite for safe-haven assets. Several factors contribute to the US Dollar ‘s fluctuations: Interest Rate Expectations: The market constantly re-evaluates when and by how much the Federal Reserve might change interest rates. Any hint of a delay in rate cuts or a potential hike can strengthen the dollar, while anticipation of cuts can weaken it. Economic Data: Reports on inflation, employment, retail sales, and manufacturing provide clues about the health of the US economy, influencing the dollar’s value. Strong data typically supports the dollar. Global Events: Geopolitical tensions or economic instability in other regions can lead investors to seek the relative safety of the US Dollar , increasing its demand. The Steady Euro Exchange Rate: A Calm Before the Storm? While the US Dollar has seen some volatility, the Euro exchange rate has remained relatively steady. This stability is notable, especially considering the impending ECB meeting impact . The euro’s position against the dollar (EUR/USD) is a key pair in the Forex market analysis , reflecting the economic health and monetary policy stance of the Eurozone relative to the United States. The steadiness in the Euro exchange rate suggests that market participants may have largely priced in current expectations regarding the ECB’s likely actions or are awaiting confirmation from the meeting itself. However, even small deviations from these expectations can trigger significant moves in the Euro exchange rate and the broader Forex market analysis . Anticipating the ECB Meeting Impact The upcoming ECB meeting is a pivotal event for the Euro exchange rate and global currency trends . Central bank meetings are closely watched for signals on interest rates, quantitative easing or tightening programs, and economic outlook assessments. The decisions made and the language used by ECB officials can dramatically shift market sentiment and drive currency trends . Key aspects traders and analysts will focus on include: Interest Rate Decision: Will the ECB hold rates, cut them, or signal future moves? This is arguably the most impactful decision. Economic Projections: The ECB’s updated forecasts for inflation and economic growth in the Eurozone provide context for their policy decisions. Forward Guidance: Statements about the future path of monetary policy are crucial for setting market expectations and influencing currency trends . Press Conference: The post-meeting press conference with the ECB President offers further clarification and can often cause volatility. The potential ECB meeting impact on the Euro exchange rate is significant. A more hawkish stance (hints of higher rates or less easing) would likely strengthen the euro, while a dovish stance (hints of lower rates or more easing) would likely weaken it. These movements then ripple through the entire Forex market analysis . Broader Forex Market Analysis and Currency Trends The movements in the US Dollar and the Euro exchange rate are central to global Forex market analysis . The relationship between these two major currencies affects many other currency pairs and global asset prices. Understanding these currency trends is vital for anyone involved in international finance or investing, including those in the crypto space who track how traditional markets influence digital assets. Current currency trends suggest a complex interplay of forces. While the US Dollar faces headwinds from potential Fed policy shifts, the Eurozone grapples with its own economic challenges and inflation picture, which the ECB meeting aims to address. This dynamic creates opportunities and risks in the Forex market analysis . Here is a simplified look at potential outcomes and their likely impact on the EUR/USD pair based on the ECB meeting impact : ECB Meeting Outcome Likely Policy Signal Expected EUR/USD Impact Rate Cut Announced/Strong Hint of Future Cuts Dovish Euro weakens relative to Dollar (EUR/USD falls) Rates Held, Dovish Guidance Slightly Dovish to Neutral Euro potentially weakens or remains stable with downside risk Rates Held, Neutral/Hawkish Guidance Neutral to Slightly Hawkish Euro potentially strengthens or remains stable with upside risk Rates Raised/Strong Hint of Future Hikes Hawkish Euro strengthens relative to Dollar (EUR/USD rises) Note: This is a simplified view; actual market reactions can be influenced by many other factors. What Do These Currency Trends Mean for Investors? The prevailing currency trends , particularly the relative strength of the US Dollar and the stability of the Euro exchange rate ahead of the ECB meeting impact , offer insights for various types of investors. For those in the crypto market, watching these traditional finance movements provides context. Actionable Insights: Diversification: Understanding currency risk is part of a broader diversification strategy. Macro Awareness: Pay attention to major central bank decisions and economic data releases, as they drive significant capital movements across markets, including into and out of crypto. Volatility Ahead: Expect potential volatility in the Euro exchange rate and related pairs immediately following the ECB’s announcements. This volatility in traditional markets can sometimes spill over into crypto markets. The Forex market analysis provided by these events helps paint a picture of the global economic environment, which is a critical backdrop for understanding asset performance across the board. Conclusion: Navigating the Upcoming Volatility The current state of the US Dollar , having pulled back from recent highs, and the steady Euro exchange rate set the stage for potentially significant market movements driven by the anticipated ECB meeting impact . The decisions and forward guidance from the European Central Bank will be key determinants of short-term currency trends , particularly for the euro. Staying informed on this Forex market analysis is crucial for investors looking to understand the broader economic forces influencing global markets. The period ahead promises to be dynamic, requiring careful observation of how these major currencies react to central bank policy.

Bitcoin was once a curiosity, selling for under a dollar. Today, it’s a cornerstone of wealth. But as its accessibility fades with its rising price, a new opportunity has arrived—Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S)—and it’s changing the game by allowing everyday users to mine directly from their phones. A single $10 move into this ecosystem today could echo the wealth-building effects of Bitcoin’s early days. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Turning Heads Bitcoin Solaris isn’t chasing trends—it’s building a new infrastructure for financial independence. At its core is a hybrid blockchain design that merges the tried-and-true security of Proof-of-Work with the blazing scalability of Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This unique two-layer system ensures both decentralization and high-speed performance, processing up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality. The key innovation, however, is its focus on accessible mining. No warehouses, no expensive GPUs—just your phone. With the upcoming Solaris Nova App, anyone can start mining BTC-S with a tap. Headline Features Powering the Revolution 1. The Solaris Nova App (Upcoming) This isn’t just another mobile wallet. It’s a full mining suite, accessible from mobile, desktop, or browser. It features: One-click mining with adaptive power use Built-in secure wallet Biometric login and remote wipe Real-time analytics and performance reports Customizable settings to fine-tune user control 2. Mining Power Marketplace This upcoming marketplace enables users to rent or sell computational power with the help of smart contracts, performance-based rewards, and real-time task distribution. It opens passive income streams even for those who don’t mine directly. 3. Universal Device Compatibility From high-end GPUs and ASICs to standard laptops and Android/iOS smartphones, Bitcoin Solaris optimizes mining performance based on your device’s specs. 4. Community-Centric Gamification Mining is no longer a solo grind. Earn achievements, climb leaderboards, and participate in community forums—all built directly into the app to encourage growth, education, and consistent engagement. The Future of Decentralization Is Already Mining—Start with BTC-S A Mobile Mining Engine That Scales Behind the scenes, BTC-S is powered by a meticulously engineered dual-consensus architecture: Base Layer: SHA-256 PoW mechanism, 5-minute blocks, built for energy-efficient security. Solaris Layer: High-speed DPoS layer with 21 validators, dynamic block sizes, and 15-second blocks. Validator rotation and state anchoring between layers ensure robust synchronization and security while maintaining low fees and high throughput. The Referral Program That Rewards Everyone Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double-sided referral system where both the referrer and the referred receive 5% bonuses in BTC-S during the presale. It’s a smart, community-driven mechanism that fuels both growth and participation—fitting perfectly with the project’s inclusive vision. Audited, Transparent, and Ready for Growth Security and transparency are non-negotiable in today’s market. That’s why Bitcoin Solaris has undergone audits by both Cyberscope and FreshCoins, with KYC verification completed through FreshCoins as well. These steps ensure the code is clean, the project is trustworthy, and your investment is protected. Plus, with an active and growing community, users can stay up to date by joining the Telegram group or following their X account . The Presale That’s Blowing Up We’re currently in Phase 6 of the BTC-S presale, with the price at just $6—and climbing to $7 next. The final launch price? $20. That’s a potential 1,900% return, not counting the daily mining income. With over 3 million dollars raised and more than 11,000 users already on board, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. And with only around 8 weeks left, timing is critical. Bitcoin Solaris Is the New Blueprint Crypto has always promised decentralization and equal opportunity, but Bitcoin Solaris is delivering it. You don’t need to be an early miner with thousands in hardware. You just need a phone, internet, and the will to participate. The upcoming Solaris Nova App isn’t just about mining—it’s about rethinking how wealth is distributed in Web3. When you combine scalable infrastructure, mobile-first mining, community features, gamification, and audited transparency—you don’t just have a project. You have a movement. And sometimes, it only takes $10 to be on the right side of history.

This move by institutional buyers signal heightened confidence in Dogecoin as the apex meme coin contemplates breaching the psychological price of $0.2. Will Dogecoin’s Rebound Gain Steam? Dogecoin price prediction continues to be of key interest to many traders and investors because DOGE is no longer an internet joke. This is because Dogecoin’s mainstream popularity can be traced to a combination of internet culture, celebrity endorsements, speculative trading, and the appeal of being a fun, community-driven crypto — all amplified by social media and news cycles. As a result, various market analysts continue delving deeper into its price action. For instance, crypto analyst Lingrid recently acknowledged that the eighth-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization was eyeing a leg up to the $0.26 zone. She noted , “DOGE has completed a retest of the breakout zone following its departure from a long-term falling triangle. The price is currently rebounding from a strong confluence of horizontal support and ascending trendline, aiming for the mid-channel target near 0.26. Sustained higher lows would confirm the bullish structure continuation.” Therefore, Lingrid believes that the DOGE rally will become sustainable if the $0.20 price level is breached with meme coins seemingly being back in play , thanks to community-generated hype and lighthearted nature. Anticipation of a Dogecoin ETF There's growing optimism about the approval of a Dogecoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in 2025. Crypto betting platform Polymarket indicates a 51% probability of such an ETF launching by the end of the year. Notably, an ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for direct cryptocurrency purchases or digital wallets. This ease of access could attract a broader range of investors, including those hesitant to engage with crypto exchanges. By increasing institutional participation, a Dogecoin ETF could trigger heightened market liquidity and stability, making it a reckoning force. This explains why asset management firm 21Shares recently filed for a Dogecoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Dogecoin Teeters on a Crucial Psychological Threshold Dogecoin is currently trading at approximately $0.1897 , positioning itself just below the psychological threshold of $0.20. Despite recent market volatility, several factors suggest that DOGE may be poised to reclaim and potentially surpass this key level. Technical Indicators and Market Sentiment Dogecoin has recently broken out of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish technical indicator that often precedes upward price movements. Analysts note that if DOGE can close above $0.2, it could trigger a parabolic rally. However, the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a slight downturn, with the total market capitalization decreasing by 3% to $3.41 trillion. This overall market sentiment may influence DOGE's short-term price action. DeFi Integration and Institutional Interest The launch of wrapped DOGE (wDOGE) on Coinbase’s Base network has expanded Dogecoin’s utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This integration allows DOGE holders to participate in DeFi protocols, potentially increasing demand for the token. Market Challenges and Support Levels Despite these positive developments, DOGE faces challenges. The meme coin market has weakened, dropping below a $60 billion market cap, and DOGE is approaching the $0.18 support level. A failure to hold this support could lead to a retest of $0.14. Therefore, Dogecoin finds itself in a make-or-break situation. Conclusion Even though Dogecoin finds itself below the $0.20 mark, technical indicators, DeFi integration, and increasing institutional interest suggest potential for upward movement. However, caution should not be thrown to the wind because broader market conditions and key support levels will play a crucial role in determining DOGE's short-term trajectory with the psychological price of $0.20 being a key turning point.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-05 12:27:07
45550635,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69939,1749126429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,New Document: XRP Will be Covered Under MiCA as a “Utility Token”,https://timestabloid.com/new-document-xrp-will-be-covered-under-mica-as-a-utility-token/,"In a significant confirmation that reinforces XRP’s functional role within blockchain finance, new findings show that XRP will be classified under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a utility token. This designation not only bolsters Ripple’s ongoing strategy around cross-border payments but also clarifies XRP’s regulatory standing within the EU, one of the most comprehensive jurisdictions for digital asset legislation globally. This development was recently highlighted by prominent analyst SMQKE, who shared documented evidence supporting XRP’s classification. His post, accompanied by visual materials and insightful commentary, underscores the growing clarity around XRP’s regulatory positioning and broader market relevance. XRP’s Functionality and MiCA’s Classification Criteria MiCA defines utility tokens as digital assets that are intended to provide access to a good or service supplied by the issuer. In XRP’s case, the token is not issued for speculative investment purposes but is used as a means of value transmission , particularly within Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions. Yes, XRP will be covered under MiCA as a “utility token.” Documented. https://t.co/N5tjg8Grgw pic.twitter.com/AXCy2JBXrt — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 This perspective is reinforced by a commentary from Enoch Chng, featured in a discussion on “Technology Risk in Financial Systems.” Chng noted that RippleNet and XRP do not act like traditional currencies or investment tokens. Rather, XRP operates “like an interledger” used to facilitate cross-border payments. “If you look at Ripple in that context, it is more like a utility coin,” he stated, emphasizing XRP’s role in transmitting information and value, not in serving as a speculative asset. This aligns precisely with MiCA’s interpretation, confirming that XRP does not fall into the asset-referenced or e-money token categories that come with stricter compliance and reserve obligations. Instead, its usage model meets the criteria of a utility token, allowing it to benefit from lighter regulatory requirements under the MiCA framework while remaining fully compliant. Ripple’s Strategic Modeling Confirms Utility Use Case Further validation comes from Ripple’s strategic assumptions, as shown in internal modeling shared in a slide presentation titled “Key Assumptions.” Ripple approached XRP “with more of a utility token framework,” calculating its long-term network value using utility-based metrics. The document outlines critical drivers such as total global cross-border payment volume (estimated at $155 trillion in 2018), XRP’s velocity, Ripple’s market share, and the incremental benefit of using XRP versus traditional methods. These inputs serve to demonstrate how XRP’s value accrues not through market speculation but through transactional utility and efficiency gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple explicitly states that XRP’s incremental value is tied to “the aggregate incremental value of XRP needed to support the volume of transactions” across its network. This transactional perspective is a hallmark of utility tokens and further aligns XRP with MiCA’s framework . Implications for XRP Holders and Ripple’s Global Operations The confirmation of XRP’s utility classification under MiCA has important implications. First, it legitimizes XRP’s regulatory status in one of the most forward-thinking legal jurisdictions globally. This clarity could encourage increased adoption across Europe, especially among institutional players that require regulatory certainty before integrating crypto solutions. Second, it could position Ripple and XRP as compliant market leaders ahead of many other projects that still face legal ambiguity. As regulatory frameworks tighten globally, this early alignment with MiCA provides Ripple with a competitive advantage and demonstrates its proactive approach to regulation. Lastly, it sends a message to other jurisdictions, including the United States, where XRP has faced legal hurdles. The EU’s decision to treat XRP as a utility token, backed by sound rationale and usage-based classification, could influence how other regulators assess the token’s functionality and legal standing.

Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) plunged to $0.9300, its lowest level since April 22 and 45% below its May peak. The crash has coincided with the broader sell-off in Solana-based meme coins, which saw their combined market capitalization drop from $15 billion in May to $10 billion today. Most of these tokens have declined sharply, with Bonk ( BONK ) falling by 20% in the past seven days and Dogwifhat ( WIF ) also down 20% over the same period. On-chain data from Nansen shows that smart money investors now hold 24.4 million Fartcoin tokens, down from a peak of 34.16 million last month. Nansen defines these wallets as addresses with a strong track record of executing profitable trades.

This wave of selling has led to a notable increase in Fartcoin balances on exchanges. The number of tokens held on exchanges has jumped to 194.54 million, the highest level since March. Rising exchange inflows typically signal that investors are preparing to sell, often to secure profits. Fartcoin exchange balances and price | Source: Nansen Fartcoin price technical analysis Fartcoin price | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Fartcoin bottomed at $0.2097 in March before surging nearly 700% to a high of $1.6520. During that rally, it formed an ascending channel defined by a series of higher highs and higher lows. Fartcoin has now broken below the lower boundary of that channel, as well as the 50-day and 25-day moving averages. It has also dipped beneath the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator are both pointing lower. Given these signals, the coin will likely continue falling, with sellers potentially targeting the psychological support level at $0.50, a further 45% decline from current levels.

(DJT) has filed an S-1 registration with the SEC for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF (B.T.). This ETF, if approved, would let regular investors buy into Bitcoin in a simpler way, even though the market is already crowded with many other Bitcoin investment funds. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF could become the next big thing for retail investors eager to get a piece of Bitcoin. Truth Social File For Bitcoin ETF Application Trump Media isn’t just about social media anymore. After building the Truth Social platform and exploring other tech projects like Truth+ streaming and Truth.Fi fintech, it’s now setting its sights on Bitcoin. The ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, which calls itself an “America-First” asset manager. Crypto.com will play a key role too, acting as the Bitcoin custodian, main executor, and liquidity provider. But before any of this happens, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has to give the green light. If the SEC approves the plan, the ETF will be listed on NYSE Arca. That’s when investors will have a new, easy way to bet on Bitcoin’s ups and downs—using Trump’s trusted brand name. A Small Company Entering a Big Field This new ETF shows Trump Media’s big push into the crypto world, using the Truth Social brand name to grab attention. The New York Stock Exchange Group has already filed regulatory paperwork for this ETF, signaling that things are moving forward quickly. Support and Criticism Over BTC ETF President Trump has spoken many times in support of Bitcoin, calling it a sign of financial freedom. Many of his supporters might see this ETF as a trusted way to get involved in Bitcoin investing. However, some critics worry that this could personally benefit Trump because of his name’s connection to the fund. The White House has said Trump himself is no longer directly tied to the businesses that use his name. Still, there are concerns about the ethics of such a close link. What Next? Trump Media’s move comes at a time when there are already plenty of Bitcoin ETFs out there. But the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF stands out because of Trump’s name and the way it’s packaged to appeal to his loyal base. If the SEC gives the green light, this new ETF could quickly become a favorite for retail investors who trust Trump’s vision—and who want an easier way to invest in Bitcoin",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-05 13:29:17

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. With DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, these features collectively enhance Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Key Insights: Floki’s price is down 3.86% today. The MACD is bearish. Short-term momentum suggests sellers are in control of the market. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: FLOKI shows clear bearish momentum On June 5, FLOKI shows clear bearish momentum, pressing against immediate support at $0.00007780. The RSI at 40.54 shows weak buying pressure. Meanwhile, the MACD remains negative, confirming ongoing downside momentum. Unless the $0.00007780 support holds or a bullish catalyst (like the June 30 Valhalla launch) emerges, FLOKI may continue drifting lower. Floki Inu shows clear bearish momentum FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Floki Inu continues its steady decline in the short-term On the 4-hour chart, the trend remains clearly bearish, with price candles forming below the William Alligator moving averages. The Money Flow Index (MFI) corroborates the downturn, sitting firmly in oversold territory, pointing to a lack of capital inflow. Likewise, the Balance of Power is negative, confirming that sellers continue to dominate. Until volume or momentum shifts significantly, FLOKI risks further decline unless oversold conditions trigger a short-term bounce.

FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Despite global macroeconomic pressures—including rising US Treasury yields and persistent trade tensions between the US and China—ETH continues to show resilience. Market analysts believe that Ethereum could be leading the charge into a long-anticipated altseason, provided it holds key levels and breaks above current supply. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? Top analyst Ted Pillows recently pointed to a compelling technical pattern: Ethereum has now posted four consecutive two-week green candles, a formation that mirrors Bitcoin’s price structure in early 2020 following the March crash. That period marked the beginning of Bitcoin’s legendary bull run to $69,000. According to Pillows, the similarities between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025 are “just mind blowing,” sparking renewed interest from traders who see Ethereum’s current consolidation as a bullish continuation. With investor sentiment slowly recovering and technicals turning favorable, the market is watching ETH closely. If history is any guide, this consolidation could mark the calm before Ethereum’s next major leg higher. However, macro risks still linger, and timing will be critical. Ethereum Resilience Sparks Hopes Of 2020-Like Rally Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,600 level, showing resilience amid global macro uncertainty and volatile market conditions. This consolidation around key support has many investors and analysts anticipating a breakout that could lead Ethereum into a new rally phase, potentially triggering a broader altseason. Despite growing concerns around systemic risk in the bond market and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, Ethereum continues to attract buyers, signaling confidence in its long-term strength. Analysts are watching this range closely. Many believe that if Ethereum can maintain support and break above near-term resistance, it could gain serious momentum. One of the more compelling arguments for a bullish outlook comes from Ted Pillows, who highlights a striking similarity between Ethereum’s current structure and Bitcoin’s behavior in 2020. According to Pillows, Ethereum has now printed four consecutive two-week green candles since bottoming, just as Bitcoin did after the March 2020 crash. That pattern marked the start of BTC’s legendary run to $69,000. The comparison has sparked optimism that ETH may be preparing for a similar breakout, especially if it clears resistance near $2,700–$2,800. While the macro environment remains tense, this technical structure—paired with rising confidence in ETH’s strength—keeps bulls hopeful that a major move is on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Consolidation Above Support Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,607, consolidating just above the 34-period EMA on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near $2,594. After the strong surge in early May that saw ETH rally from under $2,000 to highs near $2,850, the price has moved into a tight consolidation range. This sideways action reflects market indecision as buyers and sellers battle for control. Despite the recent volatility, ETH has continued to post higher lows, indicating ongoing bullish pressure. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are aligned below the current price, all trending upward, signaling that the broader trend remains intact. The price is finding consistent support from the 50-period SMA around the $2,590–$2,600 zone, which is a key level to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst A decisive break above the short-term resistance near $2,680 would be needed to confirm continuation toward $2,800 and potentially retest previous highs. On the downside, a break below $2,590 could trigger a pullback toward $2,500 or lower, especially if BTC shows weakness.

Given the prevailing waning price performance, indications of profit-taking are starting to emerge as SOL witnesses a major surge in Coin Days Destroyed. Coins Days Destroyed Explodes On Solana Solana’s current bearish trend has triggered a notable shift in its on-chain dynamics. Following this weakening period is the recent massive spike in Coin Days Destroyed as reported by Glassnode, a leading financial and on-chain data platform, in a post on X. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) is a key metric that measures the movement of coins by weighting transactions based on how long these assets have been held. Thus, such a huge uptick in the metric signals a significant movement of long-held coins. Furthermore, the development points to a possible profit-taking from long-dormant wallets or a strategic realignment by seasoned investors. Should this trend persist, it is likely to have implications for Solana’s price trajectory. According to the on-chain platform, the coin days destroyed for Solana year-to-date (YTD) reached approximately 3.55 billion SOL on Tuesday, marking its third-largest spike since the beginning of this year. In prior spikes, the coin days destroyed increased sharply to 5.53 billion SOL on February 26, which currently stands as the biggest so far this year. Meanwhile, the second-largest surge in coin days destroyed was recorded on March 3, reaching about 4.64 billion SOL. Glassnode noted that these consistently large spikes are hinting at a shift in holders’ conviction as the SOL price struggles to regain upward momentum. With previous massive spikes preceding heightened volatility, SOL’s waning price may be extended in the upcoming weeks. A continuation of the ongoing volatile period is likely to trigger distribution among these wallets, driven by reduced volume and technical flashes of mean oversold setups. SOL’s Network Fundamentals Showing Strength Despite the substantial upticks in the coin days destroyed, the Solana network activity remains strong. The Solana Post, an informative platform on X, disclosed that the network is flexing its strength, consistently surpassing all other chains in the number of active addresses and transactions processed in a single day. Data from the platform shows that the daily active wallet addresses on the network have increased to 7 million, while the daily transaction count exceeds 100 million. This notable performance could be attributed to the network’s low transaction costs and fast throughput, which keep attracting users and developers. SOL’s heightened user engagement, surpassing that of all other major chains, highlights i ts growing dominance in blockchain activity, cementing its position as a leading network.",Solana|CDD|Coin Days Destroyed|Glassnode|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana network|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|The Solana Post|Year-To-Date|YTD,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-05 13:30:48

That’s a dramatic rise from 312,200 BTC held a year ago in corporate treasuries, according to Binance Research’s latest report . Nearly 100,000 BTC has been added since early April alone. The surge appears driven by a mix of rising prices and structural tailwinds. Donald Trump adopted a pro-crypto stance during his 2024 presidential campaign, vowing to make the U.S. a global hub for the asset class and create a “crypto capital of the planet.” Since Trump took office he has moved to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile , while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped numerous lawsuits against major crypto firms.. Binance’s report shows that bitcoin treasury accumulation grew in November, when Trump won the election . Adding to that, new fair-value accounting rules introduced by the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) this year allow companies to recognize gains on BTC holdings, removing a longstanding deterrent. Newer entrants including GameStop (GME) and PSG have recently started accumulating BTC as a well, yet Strategy still holds the lion’s share of BTC in corporate treasuries, with over 70% of holdings. Some companies are also tiptoeing into other assets. SharpLink holds $425 million in ETH, while DeFi Development and Classover are betting on solana SOL. China-based firm Webus recently filed for a $300 million XRP strategic reserve. Still, these altcoin holdings remain relatively small and are often tied to firms trying to rebrand as token-forward entities, Binance noted. Binance’s report also flagged the rapid rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), which have climbed more than 260% from $8.6 billion to $23 billion this year.",Markets|Bitcoin|Treasury|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-05 13:34:22

BTC slipped below $105,000 as selling pressure and buyer exhaustion weighed on the price. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,600. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is also down almost 1% as it struggles to stay above $2,600. Ripple (XRP) is down over 2%, trading around $2.18, and Solana (SOL) is down over 2%, trading at $152. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 4%, while Cardano (ADA) is down nearly 3%, trading at $0.678. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines. US Stocks Register Mixed Wednesday US stocks ended Wednesday’s trading session mixed after weak private payrolls report and a cautious outlook from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book led to renewed concerns about inflation, growth, and tariffs. As a result, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a four-day streak, falling 0.22%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 traded flat, and the Nasdaq Composite traded 0.32%. Market sentiment was rocked by a weaker-than-expected ADP employment report, which showed that private payrolls rose only 37,000 in May, significantly lower than estimates. The reading comes just before Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data and could force the Fed to cut interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book reported a marginal decline in US economic activity over the past six weeks, with hiring mostly flat as business owners put off expansion plans due to policy uncertainty. The Fed stated, “All Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty.” Crypto.com Sues Nevada Gaming Body Crypto.com’s derivatives arm has sued the Nevada gaming and gambling regulator over its restriction of trading and sporting event contracts. The North American Derivatives Exchange Inc., which operates as Crypto.com’s North American derivatives business, sued the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) in the state’s federal court on June 3, claiming the board improperly blocked the exchange from offering derivatives contracts that reference sporting events on its federally regulated market. The lawsuit also claimed that the regulator asserted jurisdiction with the mistaken premise that contracts traded on the exchange constitute “wagering on sporting events.” “NGCB has no authority to regulate, let alone prohibit, derivatives trading offered by a federally regulated DCM [designated contract market] operating pursuant to federal law.” It also cited federal injunctions involving prediction marketplace KalshiEX, where courts ruled that state gaming authorities in Nevada and New Jersey could not regulate federally approved event contracts. The courts ruled that the Commodity Exchange Act preempts state law and that the CFTC has exclusive authority. “Federal courts have consistently recognized that the CFTC’s regulation of the national derivatives market is exclusive and preempts state involvement.” South Korea’s New President Backs Crypto South Korea’s new President Lee Jae-myung’s incoming administration is expected to speed up crypto integration into South Korea’s regulatory and financial systems. The President is expected to oversee several crypto policy changes in South Korea, including enacting the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA). Work on the act began under former President Yoon, but he could not see it through due to his dismissal. The Democratic Party has formed a Digital Asset Committee, led by lawmaker Min Byoung-dug, aiming to pass DABA through the National Assembly this year. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin's (BTC) price action remained subdued as the flagship cryptocurrency struggled to recover from a low of $104,253. BTC has been sluggish all week as it struggles to overcome the resistance at around $107,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency had surged to a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level as investors locked in profits and buyer exhaustion set in. As a result, the price plunged nearly 4% the following day. BTC’s downward trajectory continued as it fell to a low of $103,199 on May 31. BTC has struggled to reclaim $105,000 since. Analysts have stated that while BTC’s pullback is concerning, investors are still optimistic about a recovery. Crypto market sentiment remains strong, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index showing a score of 57 out of 100. Some analysts believe BTC could surge to a new all-time high above $115,000 next month if institutional interest continues and US job data comes in weaker than expected. “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July.” The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report on June 6. Job data is a crucial indicator for Bitcoin as it impacts the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, which in turn, influences sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin . “A stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin.” On the other hand, a softer-than-expected report could encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates sooner. The analysts noted, “If the jobs report indicates a stronger labor market, Bitcoin might test support levels around $102,000 or lower. Overall, the report’s outcome will be pivotal for lower timeframe traders but will only be a smaller piece of a larger puzzle in the larger scheme of things.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), falling nearly 4% to $107,356. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% and 1.16% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,103. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC rose 0.32% to $109,453. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to slip below $109,000 and settle at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday, dropping over 1% to $107,834. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,662. BTC continued to decline on Friday, falling 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067.

The price fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell nearly 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,755. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it looks to reclaim $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) continued trading sideways as it consolidated around the $2,600 mark, as the crypto market entered a subdued phase following BTC’s surge to a new all-time high. Investors are waiting for the next catalyst to dictate price action, with trade tensions and policy uncertainty impacting investor sentiment. However, open interest in ETH futures jumped to a record $37.6 billion. High open interest levels indicate bullish momentum but also increase the risk of a strong pullback as markets get too one-sided. ETH has faced repeated rejections around the 200-day SMA and $2,700. A break above these levels could push ETH beyond $3,000, as no strong resistance exists until that price level. ETH’s latest rejection from $2,700 was on Friday (May 23), when it fell to $2,527. The price recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and increasing nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. ETH continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase to $2,564. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH rose nearly 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,662. Buyers retained control on Wednesday, with the price rising almost 1% to $2,683. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,790 on Thursday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 1.89% to $2,632.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continues to trade downwards as it struggles to stay above $150. The altcoin faced a sudden decline on Tuesday, dropping from a high of $165 to $164. Sellers retained control in the subsequent session, with SOL down almost 1%. SOL started the previous weekend positively, rising 1.09% on Saturday and settling at $175.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/critical-cryptocurrency-operation-from-the-us-millions-of-dollars-in-crypto-funds-seized-here-are-the-details/,"The US Department of Justice has conducted a comprehensive operation against BidenCash, an illegal marketplace operating on the dark web. US Seizes Crypto Funds and 145 Domains Belonging to BidenCash According to the statement, the Virginia Eastern District Attorney's Office announced that 145 dark web and traditional internet domain names were seized with cryptocurrency funds linked to BidenCash. “The United States has ordered the seizure of crypto funds used by the BidenCash marketplace to collect revenues from illegal sales,” the prosecutor's office said in a press release. While the amount and type of crypto funds were not disclosed, the Justice Department alleged that BidenCash had operated since March 2022, providing services to more than 117,000 customers and generating over $17 million in revenue by trading more than 15 million stolen payment cards and personal data. Authorities also noted that between October 2022 and February 2023, BidenCash released 3.3 million stolen credit card details for free for promotional purposes. The leaked information included card numbers, expiration dates, CVV codes, and personal information such as name, address, email, and phone. BidenCash also allegedly sold stolen credentials that provided illegal computer access. Following the operation, all domain names belonging to BidenCash were disabled. Users trying to access these addresses are now directed to servers controlled by US law enforcement, preventing further illegal activities. The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Secret Service's Frankfurt Resident Office and Cyber Investigation Section, and the FBI's Albuquerque Office, with support from the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit, the Shadowserver Foundation and Searchlight Cyber. The operation is part of a broader U.S. crackdown on cryptocurrency-related cybercrime. Last month, U.S. authorities seized five internet domains linked to a malware tool called LummaC2 that stole crypto wallet information for millions of people around the world. *This is not investment advice.

This strategic move underscores a growing trend of traditional companies integrating digital currencies into their financial frameworks, spotlighting Solana as a key player. Amid this development, emerging projects like Kaanch Network are gaining traction, positioning themselves as high-potential contenders in the altcoin space. Kaanch Network: A Rising Contender In The Altcoin Race Kaanch Network has gained notice because it is a Layer 1 blockchain focused on speed, scalability and practical uses. The current price of Kaanch tokens in stage 6 is $0.32, which will double to $0.64 in the next stage. More than $1,827,789 was raised during the presale, showing that many investors were interested. Because there are only 58 million Kaanch tokens and they will be listed on BitMart for $30, the presale offers investors up to 30% APY. SpyWolf and VerifyLab check the project to maintain transparency and security. People can get tokens using ETH or USDT, and the upcoming listing on BitMart should help increase their visibility. Anyone interested can find the presale information on the Kaanch website. Classover’s $500M Solana Strategy: A Game-Changer Source – X Classover Holdings, which is listed on Nasdaq, has attracted attention with its plan to raise $500 million through convertible notes to create a treasury reserve on the Solana network. The deal, made with Solana Growth Ventures, requires that 80% of the proceeds be used to buy SOL tokens and Classover has already bought 6,472 SOL for about $1.05 million. The new deal follows a previous $400 million equity purchase agreement, so the total financing is now $900 million. By doing this, Classover became one of the first public companies to use Solana in its main financial operations which could add to Solana’s reputation in the market. Even so, the current price of Solana at $156.68 has dropped 1.40% in just one day which suggests the market is not fully responding to this news. Kaanch’s Technological Edge: Outpacing Solana The network is unique because it can process 1.4 million transactions per second and finalize them in just 0.8 seconds which allows for fast trading and efficient use of smart contracts. Because it has very low gas fees, it is perfect for decentralized applications, small transactions and payments. With the help of 3,600 nodes, Kaanch allows for fast and secure transactions, especially for gold and real estate tokenization. Thanks to its tangible assets, enterprise-friendly features and open governance, Kaanch is expected to compete strongly with Solana. Kaanch is expected to see a 100x rise, thanks to its scalability and more whales joining which could make it more successful than Solana in the future. Institutional Adoption Fuels Altcoin Momentum The deal between Classover and Solana points to more companies including cryptocurrencies in their financial portfolios. Solana is chosen as a core reserve asset because of its strong infrastructure and ability to scale, but Kaanch’s quick transactions and focus on real assets like gold and real estate make it a good alternative. The model used by the project which includes a staking dashboard and tools for developers, makes it easy for the blockchain to be adopted by many. Kaanch’s listing on Bitmart at $30 is expected to help it gain a bigger presence and attract more investors.

45554102,https://invezz.com/?p=2751453,1749130800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"If you missed ADA’s 100x or XRP’s 30x, MUTM could be last big catch under $0.05",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/05/if-you-missed-adas-100x-or-xrps-30x-mutm-could-be-the-last-big-catch-under-0-05/,"In every bull market, there are those few tokens that define the cycle. Cardano (ADA) rose from pennies to over $3, multiplying investor returns by 100x. Ripple (XRP) delivered a powerful 30x in a much shorter window. Those who caught these moves early didn’t just witness history—they lived it. Today, with so many high-profile tokens already trading in the dollars, the hunt is on for the last under-the-radar opportunity priced under $0.05. That gem, by every measurable metric, is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale Phase 5, raising over $10 million to date with more than 11,800 holders already onboard. At just $0.03 per token, it is still priced like an early-stage opportunity—despite showing all the hallmarks of a breakout project. It has completed a CertiK audit, scoring 80 on Token Scan, a mark of strong security and development quality. The foundation is not just hype—it’s built on verifiable progress and real-world utility. Real-world DeFi for the next generation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that does more than just follow the crowd. While most DeFi platforms rely solely on pool-based lending models, Mutuum combines both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending into one flexible ecosystem. This dual approach opens the door to broader use cases, including assets that traditional lending platforms typically avoid. In P2P lending, users can lend or borrow tokens such as DOGE, PEPE, or SHIB—something few competitors offer with this level of control. The token that works for you At the heart of this ecosystem is the MUTM token. More than just a placeholder for speculation, MUTM has tangible utility. When users deposit assets into the protocol’s P2C pools, they receive mtTokens—a representation of their deposit and the interest it earns over time. These mtTokens can then be staked to receive dividends, funded by a portion of the platform’s revenue. As lending activity increases and platform fees rise, a portion of those earnings is used to buy back MUTM on the open market and distribute it to staking participants. This creates consistent buy pressure and makes long-term holding more rewarding. Timing is everything — and the clock is ticking ADA was under $0.05 once. XRP was too. But those windows closed quickly, and latecomers were left chasing green candles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at that same crucial moment right now. With over $10 million already raised, demand is accelerating. More than 11,800 holders are already positioned, and the presale price is still locked at just $0.03. This phase won’t last. Adding fuel to the momentum is the team’s roadmap, which includes launching the beta version of the platform when the token goes live. This immediate utility from day one stands in stark contrast to projects that promise platforms “coming soon.” Mutuum is already preparing for action. Layer-2 speed and cost efficiency One of the most critical features of Mutuum’s infrastructure is its Layer-2 integration. This dramatically lowers transaction costs and improves processing speeds—a known problem in many DeFi platforms during high network activity. The Layer-2 approach gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a technical edge that translates into better user experience and broader adoption. By removing barriers like high gas fees and slow confirmations, Mutuum ensures that even small-scale users can interact with the platform effectively. This democratization of access enhances liquidity and supports faster platform growth. Stablecoin innovation that strengthens the protocol A standout development in progress is Mutuum’s overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by centralized fiat reserves, Mutuum’s version will be minted directly from on-chain assets, offering full transparency and automatic supply adjustment. This stablecoin strengthens the entire lending protocol by offering users a more reliable borrowing asset while reinforcing the platform treasury. Moreover, the interest paid by borrowers using this stablecoin doesn’t vanish—it is redirected back into the ecosystem, contributing to protocol health and long-term sustainability. This mechanism further enhances MUTM’s value as the token sits at the center of this expanding economic system. A final window below $0.05 At $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may be the last DeFi project of this caliber still priced under five cents. It’s not just a token—it’s a full lending protocol with working mechanics, broad asset support, a powerful revenue-sharing model, and a live user base. The CertiK audit confirms its integrity, while the upcoming platform launch shows that development is not theoretical—it’s happening. Projects like ADA and XRP reached their peaks after months or years of growing communities, protocol upgrades, and utility expansion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is packing much of that growth curve into its earliest days, giving early adopters a rare chance to ride the full wave from the start. This is not just another presale. With over $10 million in contributions, 11,800+ holders, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway , and protocol-ready fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the DeFi sector’s most promising underdog. Those who missed the last 100x stories now have another shot—this time with a real platform, real value, and a real price still below $0.05.

Traditionally, many investors focused on well-known cryptocurrencies like XRP, which has been prominent in facilitating cross-border payments and has established partnerships around the globe. Yet, diversification within one's crypto portfolio can often lead to discovering unique, potentially lucrative opportunities. One such example is XYZVerse, a project that combines the world of sports and blockchain into an engaging platform. Diversifying with XYZVerse Having been a reliable asset in the realm of blockchain payments, XRP has long been favored for its robust technology and institutional backing. However, the evolving crypto landscape continuously offers new ventures that are worth exploring. XYZVerse represents an innovative melding of blockchain technology with interactive sports and gaming, diverging from traditional crypto assets which often lack tangible real-world interactions. What Sets XYZVerse Apart? Unlike typical meme coins that primarily thrive on market speculations and social media trends, XYZVerse is carving out a niche by integrating sports-related engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming. This approach not only enhances user interaction but also adds a layer of real-world utility and sustainability beyond mere speculation. Sports and Blockchain Integration: By leveraging the global popularity of sports, XYZVerse creates a unique ecosystem where fan engagement is combined with lucrative DeFi opportunities. Community and Cultural Appeal: The G.O.A.T (Greatest Of All Time) vision of XYZVerse integrates well with sports culture, appealing to a broad audience including both blockchain enthusiasts and sports fans. Market Performance and Presale Success: The project has shown strong presale momentum, indicating a growing investor interest and potential for significant market performance. Utility and Adoption: With features like prediction markets and gaming integrations, XYZVerse extends its utility beyond what many other new tokens offer, suggesting a more sustainable market presence. Comparative Analysis: XRP vs. XYZVerse Feature XRP XYZVerse ($XYZ) Technology Primarily for cross-border payments Blockchain integrated with sports and gaming Adoption Supported by financial institutions Rapidly growing community base Transaction Capacity Efficient transaction processing Capable of 10,000+ TPS Utility Facilitates international payments Diverse applications in sports and entertainment Market Position Established, with institutional backing Emerging with strong grassroots support Why Invest in XYZVerse? With the crypto market's landscape constantly evolving, seizing early opportunities in innovative projects like XYZVerse can be crucial. The unique blend of technology, community engagement, and real-world application presents a promising venture poised for growth and sustainability.

Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out in the bustling crypto market. Each offers distinct strengths, from Dogecoin’s meme-driven surge to XRP’s cross-border efficiency and Mutuum Finance’s innovative lending model. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, priced at $0.03, with over $9,900,000 raised and 525 million tokens sold to 11,600 holders. These crypto coins’ unique features signal strong potential for long-term gains. Let’s dive into their distinct paths to wealth creation. Dogecoin’s Social Surge Dogecoin (DOGE) is riding a wave of social momentum. Trading at $0.18, it faces short-term dips but analysts remain optimistic. Social volumes have spiked 12% in a day, per Santiment data, reflecting growing chatter. One expert predicts DOGE could hit $0.34 in June 2025, driven by a bounce from a descending channel’s support. Another sees a bolder climb past $3 if it breaks resistance. Despite whale sell-offs signaling caution, Dogecoin’s community keeps it relevant. Its volatility, tied to market sentiment, makes it a riskier bet. Yet, its cultural pull fuels hope for a rally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a more structured growth path by comparison. XRP’s Steady Climb XRP is carving a niche in global finance. Priced at $2.305, it’s down 0.56% daily, with rising selling pressure. Technical indicators show neutral sentiment, with a 50-day SMA at $2.27 and increasing volatility. Analysts forecast XRP reaching $3.94 by 2025’s end, with potential to hit $5 if adoption grows. Its strength lies in fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Ripple’s technology draws institutional interest, boosting XRP’s long-term outlook. Despite bearish short-term charts, its community remains loyal. XRP’s stability contrasts with Dogecoin’s swings, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a fresher opportunity. Its presale success hints at untapped potential, making it a compelling choice for crypto investment. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in Phase 5 of its presale. Tokens sell at $0.03, up 200% from the opening phase’s $0.01. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, with a launch price of $0.06 ensuring a 100% ROI for current buyers. Analysts project a post-launch surge to $2.50, a 8,233% jump from now. Over $9,900,000 has been raised, with 525 million tokens sold to 11,600 holders. The team recently completed a Certik audit, scoring 70.00 for security, with no vulnerabilities found. Active monitoring and social engagement bolster trust. This solid foundation sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart in the crypto market. Dual Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reshaping decentralized finance. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools. These pools enable instant borrowing and adjust interest rates automatically. Lenders earn passive income, while borrowers access funds at lower costs. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct lending, cutting out intermediaries. Users negotiate custom loan terms, ensuring transparency. This dual approach empowers users, aligning with DeFi’s core ethos. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its user-centric design. Layer-2 Scalability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates Layer-2 solutions for faster, cheaper transactions. This reduces network congestion and gas fees, enhancing user experience. Unlike Dogecoin’s volatility or XRP’s institutional focus, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes scalability. Its beta platform will launch alongside the token, offering immediate access to lending and earning features. A decentralized stablecoin, pegged to USD, ensures secure transactions. Revenue from borrowing supports the treasury, driving long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for efficiency, making it a top crypto to buy now. Building Lasting Wealth Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) each offer paths to generational wealth. Dogecoin thrives on social buzz, XRP on institutional adoption, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends innovation with accessibility. Its presale, now in Phase 5, draws investors with a guaranteed 100% ROI at launch and a potential $2.50 post-launch price. The crypto market rewards early movers.

The conversation, reported by Xinhua and confirmed by Beijing’s foreign ministry, was initiated by Trump, who had been pushing for direct talks after weeks of rising trade tension between the US and China. But details of the chat were not shared. This was only their second call of the year, the first being on January 17, before Trump returned to the White House. In recent days, Washington has accused Beijing of dragging its feet on following through with trade promises, especially around critical mineral exports. Those promises came from talks in Switzerland, where both sides had agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. But that deal started falling apart fast. Trump’s administration wasn’t seeing the deliveries it expected, and China wasn’t happy about the new waves of restrictions coming from Washington. Trump pushes Xi on trade slowdown and new export blocks During the call, Trump raised issues over China’s delay in exporting key minerals that were part of the post-Geneva understanding. He also brought up semiconductors, where his administration had just issued fresh export bans and advised US firms to avoid relying on Chinese chips. The White House claimed the decision was for national security, but Beijing called it punishment disguised as protection. Adding fuel to the fire, China was already frustrated by a new rule tightening visa access for Chinese students, something it viewed as politically motivated. Officials in Beijing said the US was “undermining recent progress” by targeting young people and education exchanges. Trump didn’t back down. The administration believes these moves are necessary to protect American strategic interests. The economic impact of all this was already showing. On the day of the call, US stock futures climbed. The Dow went up 89 points, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures both gained 0.2%. Investors reacted quickly to any hint that the two countries were at least talking again, even if the problems weren’t solved. Meanwhile, new numbers showed the US trade deficit had dropped to $61.6 billion in May, its lowest point since September 2023. That’s a $76.7 billion drop from April, and the fastest monthly decline since 1992. Exports were up $8.3 billion, while imports had collapsed by $68.4 billion, a 16.3% slide. Companies had rushed to bring goods in ahead of Trump’s April 2 “liberation day” tariffs, knowing costs were about to go up. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Traders are asking whether they will use their profits to buy crypto. Retail investors are taking profits from their Nvidia purchases, while institutions continue to buy. According to a report by Vanda Research, retail investors dumped $258 million of Nvidia stock during the week ending on June 4. Many retail investors made significant gains from their Nvidia investments between 2023 and 2024. Now, they appear to be searching for new opportunities, according to a sentiment survey by Vanda Research. Retail sentiment has sharply dropped in 2025, shifting from 10 points leaning to buy to over 15 points leaning toward sell. Retail sentiment in Nvidia, 10-day average | Source: CNBC This analysis is in line with a report by Sherwood, which recorded $4.9 billion in retail outflows during the third week of May. It was the largest dollar outflow for Nvidia since 2015 and marked the longest retail selling streak, two consecutive weeks, since March 2022. The report also notes similar activity in another retail favorite, Tesla. You might also like: AI crypto tokens at risk as Nvidia faces restrictions on China exports Why are retail investors dumping Nvidia? Retail investors who bought the dip after Nvidia shares fell on the DeepSeek launch are now looking for more lucrative opportunities. Analyst Ben Bajarin notes that Nvidia stock has already priced in much of its growth potential. As a result, traders are seeking higher upside elsewhere. Additionally, many are concerned about the impact of U.S. tariffs and chip restrictions on China. In this environment, investors with higher risk tolerance are turning to AI stocks and crypto. According to Vanda Research , retail investors are now eyeing more volatile small-cap AI stocks to chase further gains. Nvidia and Bitcoin (BTC) have historically shared a strong connection. A 2024 study found a consistent correlation above 0.80 between the two assets, largely due to Nvidia’s role in powering crypto mining infrastructure. This suggests that many Nvidia investors are already familiar with, or actively involved in, the crypto market. At the same time, retail investors are taking a back seat when it comes to Bitcoin, letting institutions accumulate. The most established crypto asset has actually underperformed Nvidia in the last five years, returning 992% vs Nvidia’s 1,523.1%. Still, there is no clear indication yet of a broad retail pivot from Nvidia into Bitcoin. While historical correlations and overlapping investor profiles suggest a potential bridge between the two, current sentiment doesn’t make the case for a clear rotation into Bitcoin. Whether those taking profits on Nvidia will ultimately move into crypto may depend on broader macro signals. This includes interest rate decisions, regulatory developments, and trade policies.

Many are asking: Why hasn’t Binance listed Pi Coin yet? The growing frustration among the Pi Network community is palpable, especially as Binance continues to list hyped meme coins with questionable fundamentals. So, what’s causing the delay? According to Pi Network analyst with the X handle Pi Pioneers X , below are the possible reasons why Binance may still be holding back on listing Pi Coin: 1. Regulatory Roadblocks Post $4.3B Fine Binance’s $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities in 2023 for anti-money laundering (AML) failures placed it under strict scrutiny. The exchange is now closely monitored for three years, and the EU’s DAC8 regulation adds additional pressure. 2. Binance’s Profit-Driven Listings Strategy Despite Pi’s massive community, the coin may not currently align with Binance’s revenue-first listing playbook. Pi’s slow mainnet rollout and token lock mechanisms might mean less immediate trading volume and profit. 3. Community Backlash Risk Tensions have risen between Pi’s vocal community and Binance. After the February vote , where Pi secured 226,000 votes, Binance did not move forward. This sparked backlash including one-star Google Play reviews and social media outrage. 4. Competitive & Strategic Concerns Pi’s mobile-first and accessible mining approach could pose a long-term threat to Binance’s dominance in the retail crypto space. Additionally, Binance tends to favor projects built on its BNB Smart Chain , unlike Pi’s independent blockchain ecosystem. 5. Murky Regulatory Status of Pi Coin With its phased mainnet rollout , unique mining model , and unclear classification (utility vs. security token), Pi raises potential regulatory flags. Binance, now risk-averse post-penalties, might see Pi as too ambiguous. So, Will Pi Coin Get Listed Before Pi2Day? There is still hope. Pi’s mainnet wallet activation , 86.2% community vote support , and improved clarity in KYB compliance could pave the way. Some sources, like @PiNewsGlobal , estimate a 93% chance of listing before Pi2Day on June 28 . However, the community remains cautious, recalling false rumors of a December 2024 listing.Until then, all eyes are on the PiCoreTeam and Binance for the next move. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the space, delivering both innovation and immense returns, a new player is beginning to turn heads: Ozak AI (OZ) . With its bold blend of predictive artificial intelligence and decentralized blockchain infrastructure, many are asking—could Ozak AI be the next altcoin superstar? What Is Ozak AI? Ozak AI is a next-generation blockchain project designed to harness the power of artificial intelligence for financial market prediction. The platform integrates multiple technologies to deliver advanced, real-time, and actionable data analytics that can support smarter trading, risk assessment, and market analysis. Ozak AI’s core ecosystem includes: Ozak Stream Network (OSN) – a decentralized, high-speed network for real-time data ingestion and analysis Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) – ensuring resilient and secure distributed processing Ozak Data Vaults – enabling users to control and monetize their data securely Prediction Agents (PAs) – customizable AI models tailored to user preferences and market conditions Together, these components create a powerful toolkit for individual and institutional investors seeking an edge in increasingly volatile markets. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin How Ozak AI Stands Apart While many altcoins boast speculative narratives with little utility, Ozak AI distinguishes itself through functionality and demand-driven design. In an era where AI is rapidly transforming every industry—from finance to healthcare—Ozak AI is positioning itself at the convergence of two explosive sectors: AI and blockchain. What makes it even more attractive to early investors is its low entry point. Currently priced at $0.005 in its third Ozak AI presale phase, Ozak AI has already raised over $1 million, reflecting rising investor confidence. If the token hits its projected $1 target, that would represent a 300x gain—a return that would rival the early days of Ethereum or Solana. Why It Could Be the Next Big Thing Several factors make Ozak AI a serious contender for the next altcoin superstar: Real-World Utility: It solves real problems—helping investors make better, faster decisions using AI-generated insights. Scalability: Its architecture is built to handle massive data volumes and user growth without compromising performance. Decentralization and Security: By integrating DePIN and secure vaults, Ozak ensures data integrity and user control. Customizability: Prediction Agents allow users to shape the AI model around their specific needs and strategies—a major innovation in personalized finance. Of course, becoming the next Bitcoin or Ethereum isn’t easy. Ozak AI will need to continue hitting its roadmap milestones, deliver consistent utility, and build a thriving user base. But with a solid foundation, growing visibility, and market demand for predictive analytics, Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most promising new projects in the space. In a sea of speculative tokens, Ozak AI stands out with purpose and potential. It might not replace Bitcoin or Ethereum in market cap any time soon, but it could very well become the next superstar altcoin—delivering major returns to early believers and reshaping how we interact with financial data. If users are scouting the market for the next big thing, Ozak AI deserves a serious look. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto enthusiasts and businesses make the correct decisions.

Despite Telegram’s May 13 ban on the notorious Huione Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee crypto marketplaces, both appear to have reemerged — according to blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs — following a familiar cybercrime pattern where shuttered platforms resurface under new names, new channels, or slightly altered forms. In a May 29 blog post , TRM Labs revealed that despite Telegram’s ban on Huione Guarantee’s public-facing vendor channels, Huione Group is “still operating channels for its ‘VIP’ vendors on the platform.” More than that, the Cambodia-based company has also relaunched its crypto exchange, which continues to process payments using its own USDH stablecoin. Huione Group’s re-emerged crypto exchange on Telegram | Source: TRM Labs TRM Labs also said it found indications that Xinbi Guarantee, banned the same day, had resumed activity on Telegram “within days.” Some vendors linked to Huione Guarantee and its wallet service, Huione Pay, were also active on Xinbi Guarantee, raising the possibility of shared infrastructure or close coordination between the two, the analysts note. These findings come despite recent enforcement steps. Just two weeks before the bans, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network designated Huione Group as a “primary money laundering concern.” And on May 29, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Funnull Technology, a Philippines-based cyber scam operator reportedly linked to Huione’s services. But enforcement efforts haven’t fully pushed these networks completely underground as Telegram still functions as the main gateway for many such operations. And when bans do occur, operators often adapt quickly: new aliases, new channels, same methods. The rise of guarantee marketplaces To understand the current landscape, it helps to know what guarantee marketplaces are, and why they matter. Unlike traditional darknet markets, platforms like Huione Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee don’t operate on Tor or in obscure corners of the internet. They function openly on Telegram and don’t directly sell illicit goods. Instead, they facilitate transactions between buyers and vendors, mostly across Southeast Asia and China. Directory of merchants on Huione Guarantee | Source: Elliptic The concept is straightforward: create a trusted environment for high-risk or illegal deals. Huione Guarantee served as a kind of escrow service. Vendors offered services ranging from SIM cards and fake IDs to surveillance equipment and fake investment platforms. Buyers browsed listings and paid in stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ). You might also like: Telegram shared data from 2,253 users with US officials in 2024 To maintain “trust,” vendors were required to post a security deposit that could be forfeited in the event of fraud. Automated bots managed logistics, and all payments flowed through crypto, preserving user anonymity. As another blockchain firm Elliptic put it , the marketplace administrator “controls access and operates anti-fraud mechanisms such as merchant deposits (‘guarantees’) and escrow services.” The result, in effect, was a vast digital bazaar for cybercrime, running on stablecoins and encrypted chat apps. Huge money, bigger risks These weren’t marginal operations. TRM Labs said Huione facilitated at least $81 billion in crypto transactions since 2021. That’s more than the infamous Hydra darknet market before it was shut down in 2022. Xinbi, by comparison, was tied to over $8.4 billion in USDT transactions since 2022. Combined, their volumes appear to surpass every other known illicit marketplace to date, including Silk Road and Alphabay. Darknet marketplaces by their inflows | Source: Elliptic Telegram did take action. On May 13, the company removed several related channels and banned associated usernames, limiting vendors’ ability to direct users to replacement groups. Still, Huione’s team had contingencies in place. “The marketplace was ready — using backups to recreate the marketplace in new channels,” Elliptic noted. One major Huione group dropped from over 800,000 members to around 250,000, but continued operating. Xinbi’s operators seemed even more brazen, announcing a relaunch under the name “Xinbi 2.0.” Some users reportedly expressed concern about a possible “exit scam.” Beyond fraud While financial fraud and identity theft dominated activity on these platforms, some listings were more disturbing. TRM Labs and Elliptic identified vendors offering electric shock devices, metal restraints, and even women marketed as surrogates. Captions — apparently machine-translated — suggest some of these items were intended for use in scam compounds. The marketplaces were built to serve professionalized scam networks. Users didn’t need to run an entire operation just purchase what they needed. SIM cards, malicious scripts, money laundering contacts, everything was on offer. With Telegram offering access to over a billion users and crypto enabling anonymity, the environment proved ideal, at least until it drew too much attention. Persistence over platform The apparent resurgence of these markets underscores how adaptable such networks can be. After Telegram’s enforcement action, some Huione-affiliated vendors migrated to Tudou Guarantee, a platform reportedly backed by Huione last year. According to TRM Labs, Tudou’s user count jumped by nearly 30% in the aftermath. More moves could follow. TRM Labs noted that Huione Group and Xinbi-related operators are exploring alternatives to Telegram, such as ChatMe and SafeW, proprietary messaging platforms modeled on Telegram but free from third-party moderation. In effect, the ecosystem remains intact even if the surface names change.

Coinbase Unveils Wrapped Versions on Base Network,https://cryptopotato.com/good-news-for-xrp-and-doge-coinbase-unveils-wrapped-versions-on-base-network/,"The largest American crypto exchange, Coinbase, has launched wrapped versions of XRP and Dogecoin on its Ethereum-based layer-2 network, Base. According to a series of tweets from the Coinbase Assets X account, the crypto exchange holds 1:1 reserves for the underlying assets of cbXRP and cbDOGE in its custody. cbXRP, cbDOGE Go Live on Base The launch of wrapped tokens for XRP and DOGE will enable cross-chain functionality for the assets. Market participants can now use cbXRP and cbDOGE to interact with applications on the Base network. So far, Coinbase has issued 10.4 million cbDOGE worth approximately $1.88 million per Dogecoin’s price at the time of writing. The exchange has also issued at least 2.3 million cbXRP worth more than $5 million. To prevent scammers from misleading users, Coinbase has provided the Base contract addresses for cbXRP and cbDOGE. cbXRP and cbDOGE have joined the growing list of wrapped assets across the Base network. Coinbase has already issued Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC) and Wrapped Ether (cbETH). The company plans to launch similar versions for Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) in the coming weeks. Coinbase’s Wins and Challenges Since last year, the exchange has been expanding its market for wrapped tokens, especially after the successful launch of cbBTC. The product went live on Base and Ethereum in mid-September 2024, becoming the third-largest wrapped bitcoin version within a week. It has maintained that position with a market capitalization of at least $4.7 billion, according to data from CoinGecko, trailing behind Binance’s wrapped BTC (BTCB) and BitGo’s product, WBTC. This latest milestone comes shortly after Coinbase joined the S&P 500 stock market index, marking the first time a crypto company has achieved this distinction. The firm has also recently entered into an agreement to acquire Deribit, the largest crypto derivatives platform, for $2.9 billion. While the crypto exchange records new wins, it is also tackling certain challenges. Coinbase faced a massive data breach that affected at least 69,000 users. The incident not only compromised user data and Coinbase’s support infrastructure but also led to a loss of up to $400 million. As the firm tries to handle the situation, it has come under intense scrutiny for failing to disclose the cyberattack when it was first noticed. The post Good News for XRP and DOGE?

Will History Repeat Itself? Here's What Analysts Say,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-weak-in-june-will-history-repeat-itself-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies have struggled to provide investors with a clear directional signal amid a historically bearish June, further deepening the slump as inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have slowed. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Weak in June: ETF Inflows Slow According to data published by 10x Research, June is generally a mixed or negative month for Bitcoin. Over the past 10 years, BTC's average return this month was recorded as 1.9%, with half of them being positive and half being negative months. Ethereum (ETH) has performed less well: it has only risen in two of the last seven Junes, with an average decline of 11.7%. XRP has performed even worse, while Solana (SOL) has remained relatively more resilient. This weak outlook is also reflected in the waning interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the U.S. According to SoSoValue data, the ETFs saw net inflows on only two of the last five trading days. ETF inflows remained at $87 million on Wednesday, a sharp drop from Tuesday’s $387 million. Inflows into Ethereum ETFs also fell to $57 million, the lowest since May. “The weakening pace of institutional inflows suggests that we are losing momentum and forces us to remain cautious about the near-term outlook,” said Valentin Fournier, chief research analyst at BRN. However, some analysts are more optimistic. “Despite the seasonal summer lull, structurally positive ground remains. BTC and ETH supply growth rates are now lagging behind global money supply growth, increasing the likelihood of positive price action in the long term. New treasury buyers are absorbing supply,” QCP Capital said. The company also pointed out the relative strength of Ethereum, noting that the ETH-BTC ratio is trading near recent highs. *This is not investment advice.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which snapped its latest five-day winning streak on June 4, opened in the green but after 40 minutes of trading turned slightly negative. While the trading showed a lack of upbeat momentum, enthusiasm on Wall Street reflected the news that Trump and Xi talked over the phone. The call, reported by Xinhua , comes just days after Trump claimed China violated a recently agreed trade agreement. Stock markets rallied in April after U.S.-China trade talks in Switzerland. As stocks edged higher following this latest move, Bitcoin ( BTC ) hovered just above $105k.

Latest to add to the overall downbeat mood is the ADP report on private-sector hiring growth. On Thursday, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that weekly jobless claims rose for the second consecutive week. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest weekly jump since October 2024. The figure came in above economists’ expectations of 237,000 new claims. In parallel, U.S. worker productivity fell in the first quarter of 2025, driving unit labor costs up 6.6% amid persistent tariff uncertainty. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm productivity declined at an annualized rate of 1.5% during Q1.

This marks the ECB’s seventh consecutive rate cut, down from a peak of 4% in mid-2023. The ECB’s move follows eurozone inflation data showing a decline to 1.9% in May, below the bank’s 2% target. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has recently criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates. Ongoing uncertainty around tariffs and monetary policy continues to shape investor sentiment in risk asset markets.

Both parties had earlier approached the court to finalize a proposed $50 million settlement and put a definite end to the long legal battle. However, the initial settlement agreement, aimed at resolving the SEC’s allegations against Ripple for unregistered securities sales, was dismissed by Judge Torres due to procedural issues. This dismissal necessitates a resubmission that adheres to the court’s procedural requirements. Despite expectations for a prompt refile , the absence of such action has led to speculation about the reasons behind the delay. Fred Rispoli’s Perspective on the Delay Legal expert Fred Rispoli has provided insights into the situation, suggesting that the delay might be strategic. He notes that the SEC and Ripple have until June 16, 2025, to file a joint status update with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 20 days later, no refile yet by SEC and Ripple in district court and the June 16 deadline for the status update in the 2nd Circuit looms large. Expect the refile before Judge Torres to happen by then. If there is nothing pending before Torres when the parties file the…1/3 https://t.co/XSq3uYC0Bj — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 4, 2025 According to Rispoli, if no motion is pending before Judge Torres by that date, the appellate court will proceed based solely on the existing record, potentially restarting the briefing process. Conversely, if a motion is pending, the Second Circuit is likely to grant an additional 60 days for the district court to address the matter. Rispoli interprets Judge Torres’ dismissal as a signal that both parties need to approach the court with a more conciliatory tone. He questions whether the SEC is willing to exhibit the necessary humility to move forward, stating, “Ripple will say whatever to get it done, but how much public groveling is the SEC willing to do? And how much groveling will be authorized?” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Ripple’s Future The outcome of this legal process holds significant implications for Ripple’s future operations. The company seeks to negotiate terms that would vacate certain unfavorable aspects of Judge Torres’ ruling, such as the $125 million penalty and the permanent injunction on XRP sales to institutional investors. These elements could pose obstacles to Ripple’s future fundraising and public offering endeavors if not resolved. The Road Ahead As the June 16 deadline approaches, the legal community and XRP stakeholders await the next move from both Ripple and the SEC. The refiled settlement agreement, if submitted, could pave the way for a resolution to this long-standing legal dispute. Until then, the case remains in a state of uncertainty, with the potential to influence the broader regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States.
