Compared to ADA’s gradual rise, MUTM’s lending-and-borrowing system, early-stage market price, and solid utility-driven demand offer prospects of explosive price boosts with growing acceptance. As whales drive money into smaller, high-potential coins, the majority see Mutuum as a cycle-breakout token, a venture with the potential to yield exponential returns as bigger-cap assets like Cardano focus on marginal returns. Cardano Trades Above Key Support as Bulls Eye Breakout to $1.20 While investor attention continues to get drawn towards high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Cardano (ADA) is a closely watched large-cap altcoin that is showing itself to be robust amidst ongoing bear pressure. After the 6.1% decline that sent ADA below the pivotal $0.84 support, technical indicators continue to be divided in their outlook, with the RSI at 40 and a bearish MACD crossover suggesting further downside risk towards the $0.76 retracement area. With that said, maintaining above $0.88 does suggest retail buyers are entering against whale selling as a level of entry for a recovery. One to watch is the forming ascending triangle pattern below $0.95 resistance; if ADA is able to break above this level, analysts are forecasting a rally back towards the $1.20–$1.25 region even as newer coins like MUTM come to center stage for growth prospects. Mutuum Finance Record-Breaking Presale Mutuum Finance has recorded incredibly unprecedented interest in Stage Six presale at $0.035, 16.17% higher than the previous round. Investor interest has also been record-high with over 16,570 investors in and over $16.3 million raised so far. Accelerating the growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program in an attempt to further secure the platform. The bugs are ranked on four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, as an attempt to accommodate all the aspects of vulnerability. It is fueled by strong security to provide service to all customers to the best of its abilities. It operates under collateral ratios, caps in lending, and caps in depositing. Undercollateralized positions are closed efficiently through incentivized liquidations facilitated by penalties and guarantee remediation fees in order to stabilize the system. Efficiency of collateral is optimized through Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly for high-collateral lending. Reserve mechanisms are employed for creating a buffer against market fluctuations and excess reserves can be invested in volatile assets in the strategy of offsetting instability. DeFi Lending for All Mutuum Finance has established a lending platform that is as good for lenders as it is for borrowers. It accomplishes this through facilitating Peer-to-Peer, or P2P lending model scalable, immune to tampering and with access to retail and institutional investors. In an effort to steer away from traditional DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance also rewards early adopters in a $100,000 giveaway competition, in which 10 users have a chance of winning $10,000 MUTM. Being a lending protocol, it provides actual returns to lenders and borrowers, as per its vision of an open, transparent platform for every market participant. Cardano (ADA) could reach as high as $1.20, but its gains could be dwarfed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The initiative is currently at $0.035 in Presale Stage 6 and could hit as high as $2 when adoption achieves lift-off, a potential 5,600% gain. More than 16,570 investors have already registered, attaining $16.3 million+. Funded with a $50K bug bounty, $100K giveaway, and a secure dual-lending model, Mutuum is built for long-term growth. Whales are swapping out into smaller, high-upside tokens, and MUTM is at the forefront, according to experts.

According to crypto pundit Zach Rector, network upgrades and DeFi opportunities could encourage holders to commit their XRP for the long term, thereby reducing the number of tokens available for active trading. Zach Rector Warns Of Looming XRP “Supply Shock” Zach Rector, a well-followed crypto commentator, has raised the alarm about what lies ahead for XRP . According to Rector, billions of tokens are on track to be locked and deployed inside decentralized finance protocols in the near future. Rector argues that massive amounts of XRP are on track to leave circulation as they get stored inside long-term blockchain systems and institutional programs. Rector points out that liquidity is no longer moving freely across open exchanges as it once did. Trading volume that once flowed across markets is now shifting into smart contracts, secure custody accounts, and platforms that offer steady returns. Such moves reduce the number of tokens left for open trading on exchanges. As the pool of active tokens shrinks, upward pressure on prices is likely to intensify over time. Short-term traders who focus solely on daily movements may overlook the more profound changes now underway. The Rector’s view suggests that demand is no longer the sole factor shaping XRP. Supply is shrinking step by step , setting up the possibility of a crunch that could change the market’s direction soon. Innovations To Drive Large-Scale Token Lockups At the core of these changes is the XRP Ledger itself, which now includes an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain , opening the door to smart contracts, lending markets, and liquidity pools. These new capabilities allow holders to utilize their XRP directly on the network, making long-term token commitments more attractive. Cross-chain bridges, such as Axelar, allow XRP to move easily between networks, facilitating the deployment of tokens into DeFi projects by institutions and large holders for extended periods. The more effortless movement of assets gives institutions and large holders a clear path to place tokens into DeFi projects for long-term use. Exchanges and custodians are launching yield products, including wrapped tokens and staking-style services, that allow investors to earn rewards while keeping their XRP locked. The rewards make it far more tempting for holders to keep XRP out of trading circulation. Analysts stress that even if adoption grows only at a modest pace, billions of tokens could end up sidelined. A tighter supply could result in significantly fewer tokens in circulation, leading to more intense price movements. While there are still technical and regulatory challenges to be faced, the tools for long-term XRP lockups are already available. With momentum building, the supply shock Zach Rector has warned about may arrive sooner than many expect.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 22:00:35

Underestimating a project with explosive potential is one of them. While established coins like Tron (TRX) offer predictable but limited gains, experts are pointing to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as this cycle’s true high-return play, a 9,900% ROI opportunity that could cost you millions if overlooked. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a conclusion drawn from a presale that is performing at a historic level. Ruvi AI has shattered expectations, raising over $4 million and selling more than 285 million tokens in record time. Analysts are praising this velocity, noting it’s a rare feat typically reserved for projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is undeniable: after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI became one of the market’s hottest altcoins, proven when 20% of its Phase 3 supply was claimed within days . The Multi-Million Dollar Mistake: Sticking with Slow Movers For investors aiming for life-changing returns, portfolio allocation is everything. Holding onto large-cap coins like Tron offers stability, but it can’t deliver the exponential growth that creates wealth in a bull market. The real opportunity lies in identifying projects like Ruvi AI before they hit the mainstream, a low-cap gem with the fundamentals and narrative to deliver a 9,900% ROI or more. Ruvi AI’s credibility is rock-solid, making it an easy choice for smart capital. It boasts a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope , confirming its security and reliability. Its high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency and legitimacy that serious investors demand. The project’s core value is its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . This focus on a real-world product, an AI-powered super app, provides a sustainable foundation for long-term growth and is why experts see it as a far superior play to TRX this cycle. The Super App Fueling the 9900% ROI Potential The engine behind these staggering ROI projections is Ruvi AI’s game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Pinpoints viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a critical competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the application. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Final Warning: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already gone, this ground-floor price is disappearing quickly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns from this opportunity: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s unstoppable momentum. Don’t Let This Opportunity Pass You By The market is sending a clear message. Underestimating Ruvi AI’s record-breaking momentum and explosive potential could be a multi-million dollar mistake. As the presale accelerates and a guaranteed price increase looms, the window to act on this cycle’s premier ROI opportunity is closing fast.

Speaking in an interview with Bankless, Grewal argued that Base functions as blockchain infrastructure rather than a platform for matching securities trades. Should @base be regulated like the Nasdaq exchange? Here's what @coinbase CLO @iampaulgrewal has to say: “Base is just a normal blockchain… Yes it’s a layer2. But that doesn’t change its relationship to securities laws.” “We are not matching buyers and sellers of securities…… pic.twitter.com/Cd4M8kizTZ — Bankless (@BanklessHQ) September 26, 2025 “Base is just a normal blockchain,” Grewal said. “Yes, it’s a Layer-2. But that doesn’t change its relationship to securities laws. We are not matching buyers and sellers of securities. We are just a blockchain layer.” He stressed that transaction matching occurs within applications built on top of Base, such as automated market makers or centralized limit order book protocols, not at the Layer-2 level itself. Coinbase’s Base Balances SEC Scrutiny With Decentralization Push His comments come amid growing debate over the role of Layer-2 sequencers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines an exchange as a marketplace that matches buyers and sellers of securities. Commissioner Hester Peirce has previously warned that centralized sequencers could resemble exchange matching engines and therefore fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has backed Grewal’s position, likening Layer-2 networks to cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, which host exchange code but are not classified as exchanges themselves. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also praised Base for combining centralized sequencing with Ethereum’s decentralized security model, describing the approach as key to improving user experience. @VitalikButerin defends @Coinbase 's Base blockchain as a genuine Layer 2 with non-custodial security guarantees through the Ethereum base layer. #Ethereum #Base https://t.co/qdwFwEC9wT — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 Base was launched in 2023 as a low-cost, developer-focused chain built on Ethereum. It has since become a popular scaling solution for decentralized finance applications. Grewal warned that treating Layer-2 infrastructure as an exchange would impose heavy compliance burdens that could hinder innovation and slow the growth of the broader ecosystem. The regulatory debate coincides with a shift in Coinbase’s approach to Base’s long-term roadmap. At the BaseCamp 2025 event in Vermont, Jesse Pollak, who leads the Base project, revealed that the team is “beginning to explore” launching a native network token . Base has explored launching a network token, reversing Coinbase’s earlier stance. @jessepollak and @brian_armstrong confirmed discussions. #Coinbase #Base https://t.co/5vMMa9mHQ3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 The remarks marked a departure from Coinbase’s previous position that Base would not issue a token. Pollak emphasized that no decision has been made on the design, governance, or timeline for a token launch but described the exploration as part of efforts to accelerate decentralization and expand opportunities for developers and creators. The comments came a few weeks after the token distribution by Consensys’ Linea network, which released more than 9.3 billion LINEA tokens to eligible users . Alongside token discussions, Base also announced an open-source bridge with Solana at BaseCamp, allowing interoperability between ERC-20 and SPL tokens. The developments show both the rapid growth of the Layer-2 ecosystem and the unresolved regulatory questions facing infrastructure providers. Base Emerges as a Growing DeFi Powerhouse Amid Shifts in TVL Rankings Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized finance with $86.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), but Coinbase’s Base network is quickly establishing itself as one of the most active ecosystems in the market. Base currently holds $4.83 billion in TVL across more than 700 protocols, showing steady monthly growth despite short-term fluctuations. Liquidity is largely stablecoin-driven, with $4.4 billion in circulating supply on the network, underpinning lending and trading activity. Source: DeFiLlama Daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes approach $2 billion, while perpetuals trading adds another $1.1 billion—placing Base among the most liquid Layer-2s. Chain-level efficiency also stands out. In the past 24 hours, Base captured $237,000 in fees, nearly all of which were converted to revenue. The network processed activity from nearly 740,000 addresses in a single day, showing its broad retail and institutional adoption. Source: DeFiLlama Bridged liquidity stands far higher at nearly $20 billion, indicating large capital inflows that are not yet fully deployed in DeFi protocols. Protocols fueling the ecosystem include Aerodrome, Uniswap, Aave, and Spark. Aerodrome remains a major liquidity hub, though it leans heavily on incentives, resulting in negative net earnings. By contrast, Spark has emerged as one of the fastest-growing lending platforms, posting a 41% TVL increase over the past month. Risk management services such as Gauntlet and Block Analitica also highlight the maturing role of analytics in DeFi. While Ethereum and Solana still command larger ecosystems, Base’s rapid rise, backed by Coinbase’s infrastructure and user base, is positioning it as a contender in the next wave of DeFi expansion. Sustaining growth, however, may depend on whether protocols can reduce reliance on subsidies and maintain long-term liquidity.

The project’s popularity is fueled by its Season 2 points program and key endorsements from industry figures, including former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). ASTER Climbs Rankings The crypto data aggregator reported via X that XLP has achieved the top spot on CoinGecko after a recent airdrop valued at about $10,000 was distributed to holders. Close behind on the rankings are the perpetual tokens ASTER and AVNT. ASTER is the native token of a decentralized perpetual futures exchange by the same name that’s challenging Hyperliquid’s dominance in the sector. It runs on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, but it primarily exists on the BNB Chain. ASTER is trading at around $1.78 today, down by 15.3% in the last 24 hours, but remains up by over 181% over the last week. Since its launch on September 17, the coin’s value has surged by over 2,400%, pushing its market capitalization above $2.9 billion and securing the 50th position on CoinGecko. Aster has been around for over a year, but activity on the platform exploded following the launch of its native token. Since then, the exchange has overtaken Hyperliquid in key metrics. DefiLlama data shows that it reported $35.86 billion in daily perpetual trading volume, surpassing its rival’s $17.16 billion. The strong performance has attracted new traders who see the platform’s liquidity as a competitive advantage. On-chain data reveals that whales have been accumulating ASTER steadily since last week, with more than $48 million invested in the token. Separately, another large holder recently pocketed $7 million in profits from an initial outlay of $300k. Why Aster Is Exploding in Popularity Part of the excitement is coming from the project’s community push around Season 2 of its points farming program. The campaign rewards users for trading, referrals, and margin usage. Crypto analyst Shawn shared on X that only 4% of tokens are released in this round, but participation is already 30 times higher than in Season 1. Aster has also received backing from prominent figures in the crypto industry, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who has publicly endorsed the project and promoted it on his X account. The platform is also supported by YZi Labs, Zhao’s private investment firm, which provides mentorship, technical support, and marketing exposure. Additionally, crypto trader James Wynn has promoted Aster as a superior product to its competitor Hyperliquid. Wynn noted that its counterpart is facing a “slow and painful death” as the newer perpetuals DEX gains ground in the industry.

Day traders who fueled rallies in everything from tech stocks to cryptocurrency are now pulling money out of the most speculative investments. This shift comes even as the Federal Reserve continues supporting markets and major indexes hover close to recent peaks. The clearest sign of this change shows up in leveraged exchange-traded funds, which use borrowed money to amplify daily stock moves by two or three times. These products, popular with individual investors seeking quick profits, have lost about $7 billion in September. According to Bloomberg Intelligence this is the biggest outflow since records began in 2019. The retreat doesn’t signal widespread panic. Instead, traders appear to be cashing in profits and preparing for possible bumps ahead after months of rewards for taking big risks. Chip fund loses $2.3 billion despite 31% gain Take the Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3x Shares fund, known by its ticker SOXL. Despite gaining 31% this month, investors pulled more than $2.3 billion from the fund. Similarly, TSLL, which triples exposure to Tesla stock moves, faces its largest monthly outflow ever with $1.5 billion already withdrawn, even as Tesla shares have been climbing. This careful approach may reflect concerns about upcoming events. A possible government shutdown could delay economic reports and shake investor confidence. Many see the pullback as healthy, given that stock and bond markets have reached levels rarely seen except during the most excited periods of the past twenty years. What stands out is who’s moving first. Individual investors – often called “dumb money” by Wall Street professionals for supposedly making poor timing decisions – have actually been ahead of the curve this year. Their steady buying during the first six months helped drive a rally that many professional investors initially doubted. When markets fell in April due to tariff worries, retail traders were among the first to jump back into risky investments. For the week, the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, marking its first decline in a month. The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 also posted its first down week since late August, falling 0.5%. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF slipped for a second straight week. Crypto crash wipes out $300 billion As Cryptopolitan reported, cryptocurrency markets added to the cautious mood this week. Digital assets lost roughly $300 billion in value as leveraged positions unwound, forcing sales that pushed Bitcoin and Ether sharply lower in one of the most volatile stretches since the summer. Though prices recovered by Friday, the magnitude of the decline and doubts about business interest could pressure individual investors who had accumulated substantial profits this year. Whether driven by gut feeling or exhaustion, the retreat may signal a broader rethinking of risk. But in markets this elevated, even small mistakes or poorly timed exits can prove costly. No signs point to a major downturn yet, but conditions appear more delicate than before. Money is flowing into safer investments – cash-like funds, gold, and volatility products – at the fastest pace in months. Together, these movements suggest markets are quietly adjusting, with speculative betting retreating even as core investments hold steady. Investment firms are making adjustments, too. Lido Advisors, which manages $30 billion, has added protective strategies like selling covered calls for income and buying put spreads as insurance against losses.

The meme coin is currently approaching a high-confluence support zone, sitting at the intersection of a three-month-long trendline and a key Fibonacci retracement level – both converging near the apex of a possible breakout. Whales appear to be positioning ahead of the move. Since PEPE’s recent local top, the top 100 wallets have increased their holdings by over 6 trillion tokens , according to Nansen data . Pepe whales accumulate alongside correction. Source: Nansen. This show of conviction comes as market narratives continue to favor a Q4 bull run. With U.S. inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for further interest rate cuts are strengthening, with the potential to stimulate capital rotation into riskier plays like Pepe. Pepe Price Prediction: Confluence Zone Eyes 100% Move This confluence zone set up the potential breakout of a bullish pennant pattern forming since the May pepe price bull run. The pattern’s upper resistance and lower support are converging toward an apex, with a strong confluence of support acting as a launchpad for the next retest. The 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, often a bottom marker in steep corrections, aligns with a 3-month support level around $0.000009, creating a compelling setup for a bounce. Momentum indicators strengthen the bullish case. The RSI has found footing just above the oversold threshold at 30, signaling buyers may be stepping back in. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is flattening below the signal line, suggesting the early stages of a potential uptrend. If buy pressure builds, a successful breakout attempt would target $0.000019 for a possible 100% gain —a 2x move from current prices. Stronger catalysts, however, could extend the rally. With U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approval on the table under new SEC listing standards, Pepe could retest its all-time high at $0.000029. That would mark a 220% surge and potentially push the price into new discovery before year-end. This New ICO is Bringing Passive Income to Pepe For large-cap meme coins like Pepe, big gains are slow to arrive. This 2x setup has been almost 5 months in the making. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is the first mine-to-earn meme coin that lets anyone build virtual mining rigs to earn rewards – no expensive hardware or technical skills needed. Instead of waiting for the token to launch, early investors can jump into the action right away. The project gamifies crypto mining by allowing users to set up and upgrade digital rigs, which generate passive rewards in the form of popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. It’s a fresh twist on mining – fun, interactive, and built for the degens who don’t want to sit on idle bags during a presale. Built-in deflation strengthens the model. Every $PEPENODE spent on rigs or nodes undergoes a 70% burn, creating long-term scarcity while boosting returns. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has topped $1.4 million in early weeks, and early stakers are still locking in a huge 913% APY. Join the $PEPENODE presale now on the official website to start mining. The current offering is $0.0010745 per token, but the clock’s ticking on the next price increase. To stay updated, you can also follow PepeNode on X (formerly Twitter) .

HSBC announced it successfully tested quantum computing for algorithmic bond trading, boosting prediction accuracy by 34%. While the bank called it an early experiment, the test raised questions about long-term cryptographic security. “Q-Day” — the moment when quantum computing could break existing encryption — may arrive as soon as 2030, according to some developers. For Bitcoin, the shift underscores the need for quantum-resistant upgrades, a move that could enhance confidence in its resilience as a store of value. Kraken’s $500M Raise Fuels IPO Talk Investor confidence in crypto infrastructure is building. Kraken reportedly raised $500 million at a $15 billion valuation, according to Fortune. Though the exchange hasn’t filed an S-1 with the SEC, stronger financial disclosures hint at IPO preparation. JUST IN: #Bitcoin and crypto exchange Kraken raises $500 million at a $15 billion valuation. We are going mainstream pic.twitter.com/cUZ6CbLrCd — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 26, 2025 Founded in 2011, Kraken processes about $1.9 billion in daily trading volume, ranking among the top 15 global exchanges. Its raise follows a surge in crypto IPOs: Gemini’s Nasdaq launch was 20 times oversubscribed, Circle doubled its $1 billion valuation on debut, and blockchain lender Figure saw similarly strong demand. This trend highlights growing institutional appetite for regulated, mainstream crypto exposure — a factor that could feed into stronger Bitcoin demand. BlackRock’s Yield ETF Signals Institutional Shift BlackRock, which manages more than $9 trillion in assets, is preparing to launch the Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. Unlike its $87 billion iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), the new product will sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures to generate yield for investors. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas dubbed it a “ sequel to IBIT ,” pointing out BlackRock’s deliberate focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum while avoiding altcoin ETFs. The move could solve a long-standing critique that Bitcoin lacks income generation, potentially broadening its appeal to pension funds and income-focused investors. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels to Watch Technically, Bitcoin remains under pressure. On the 4-hour chart, price action has broken below a descending channel and failed to reclaim the 50- and 100-SMAs near $113,500. Lower highs continue to define the structure, signaling persistent bearish control. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns reinforce this bias. A shooting star at $116,000 sparked a reversal, followed by bearish engulfing candles and a “three black crows” formation — a textbook continuation signal. The RSI sits near 32, showing oversold conditions but with no bullish divergence. Support rests at $107,300, with further downside targets at $105,200 and $102,800 if momentum persists. Short bias remains below $113,000 First downside target: $107,300 Extended levels: $105,200–$102,800 For novices, think of this as a staircase trending down. Each bounce has been weaker, showing buyers can’t regain control unless Bitcoin closes decisively above $113,000. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $18.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012985—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The company announced the completion of its first $30 million Toncoin purchase on Thursday. AlphaTON has become one of the largest holders of Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network. The company said its goal is to grow its Toncoin treasury to $100 million by the end of 2025. AlphaTON wants to invest $100M in Toncoin The Nasdaq-listed company closed a $71 million financing round back in early September. The financing round included a $36.2 million private placement of 6.32 million shares. In addition, AlphaTON secured a $35 million loan facility with BitGo Prime. The ex-biotech company stated that it aims to acquire $100 million worth of Toncoin (TON). In the release, AlphaTon announced, “A financing to acquire ~$100 million TON tokens and establish a specialized digital asset treasury company dedicated to building a strategic TON reserve and providing public markets access to Telegram’s rapidly expanding ecosystem of more than a billion monthly active users.” Beyond accumulating Toncoin, AlphaTon wants to generate yield revenue via blockchain validation and staking rewards. The new DAT also wants to back projects within Telegram’s mini-app and DeFi ecosystems. AlphaTon has strategic crypto partners and advisors, including BitGo, Animoca Brands, Kraken, SkyBridge Capital, and Crypto.com, among others. The company is led by CEO Brittany Kaiser, a former director at Gryphon Digital Mining . Executive Chairman Enzo Villani, co-founder of Nasdaq Global Corporate Solutions, is also part of AlphaTon’s leadership. Kaiser said , “Today marks a pivotal moment in AlphaTON Capital’s journey as we officially establish ourselves as a premier digital asset treasury company with substantial TON holdings.” AlphaTon is following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy playbook, but through Toncoin. The Nasdaq-listed firm is copying Ton Strategy, which is another firm that accumulated more than $700 million in TON last month. AlphaTON’s stock closed at $5.77 on Friday. The stock slipped by around 9.8% from the previous session based on data from Yahoo Finance. On the other hand, Toncoin (TON) is currently trading at $2.75. The token has a 24-hour trading volume of $139.9 million and a market capitalization of $6.99 billion based on aggregated data from CoinGecko. Toncoin surged massively during Telegram’s mini-game boom in 2024. The token recorded an all-time high of $8.25 but has since fallen about 60% from its peak. The coin now ranks 32nd by market cap.

While liquidations have sent the crypto market lower yet again today, the market is in a strong position to bounce back once the SEC approvals begin coming in. And this particularly applies to XRP, Pepe and Cardano, which DeepSeek AI predicts could smash their current ATHs in the final weeks of 2025, especially when regulatory and business conditions have become much more favorable in recent months. Ripple ($XRP): DeepSeek AI Predicts Potential Run to $7 As Ripple Captures Cross-Border Market DeepSeek is particularly bullish about XRP, which it says could rise as high as $7 by 2026, almost doubling its current ATH ($3.65). The Chinese AI cites the resolution of the Ripple-SEC case as a major factor in XRP’s growth, suggesting that this gives Ripple the launchpad from which to capture a significant chunk of the cross-border payments market. And Ripple is doing just this at the moment, having signed numerous partnerships in recent months, having made acquisitions , and having expanded into new territories . This leaves XRP in a supremely strong position, with its chart today suggesting that it’s close to rebounding. Source: TradingView Its indicators are all in oversold positions, meaning that it’s selling at a discount and that positive movement isn’t far away. It may return to strong growth as and when the SEC approves one or more of the XRP ETF applications waiting for a decision. There’s little doubt that it will beat its current ATH by the end of the year, although a bull rally could send it even higher. Pepe ($PEPE): DeepSeek AI Predicts 229% Increase for Popular Meme Coin Citing the potential for “meme coin dynamics and viral sentiment,” DeepSeek AI predicts that PEPE could rise as high as $0.000030 by 2026, making for a 229% increase over its current price of $0.00000910. DeepSeek suggests that endorsements from high-profile influencers and even celebrities could drive the PEPE price higher, while also proposing that social media-based FOMO could boost the meme token. What DeepSeek doesn’t mention, however, is that PEPE remains a favorite vehicle among whales, who continue to buy the token and pump its price . As such, there’s a very real chance that the coin could rally hard if the market enters an end-of-year buy rally, especially one that follows a wave of ETF approvals. And there’s an argument that DeepSeek was somewhat conservative in its price prediction, given that PEPE’s all-time high is already $0.00002803. A particularly bullish market could see it eclipse this price, and potentially rise towards $0.00010. Cardano ($ADA): DeepSeek AI Predicts Rally to $12 Amid Growth in Ecosystem Asked to provide a very bullish prediction for Cardano, DeepSeek suggested that it could hit $12 within the next few months, making for a 1,472% increase over ADA’s current price. Such a prediction is based on Cardano’s growth into “a dominant force in decentralized finance and real-world governance,” including the development of dApps running on Cardano. It may seem that Cardano is some way off such a scenario, yet its TVL has been growing steadily in recent years, rising from $50 million in January 2023 to $317 million today . It also continues to roll out new updates and attract new projects to its ecosystem , which could soon attract genuine adoption and usage. On top of this, Grayscale has applied to launch a Cardano ETF, and if it gains approval this could send ADA much higher. As such, ADA’s current oversold position could mean that we’re about to see it surge upwards, crossing $1 in a few weeks before challenging its current ATH of $3.09. And while our chart above sets a target of $4 for the end of the year, DeepSeek believes it could rise even higher. Maxi Doge: Ultra-Bullish Meme Token Raises $2.5 Million in Hugely Popular Sale While DeepSeek has provided very encouraging predictions for the three tokens above, traders may also be interested in diversifying into newer, low-cap coins, which could also enjoy huge rallies towards the end of the year. Such coins also include presale tokens, which have the advantage of starting from a low base, meaning that big gains can be possible in a short space of time. A great example of a new coin holding its presale is Maxi Doge ($MAXI), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $2.5 million. In a sea of red, hold the green fam. pic.twitter.com/TKpRKiyiZ4 — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) September 25, 2025 This provides a bullish sign of its emerging popularity, with Maxi Doge attracting investors by virtue of its unique spin on the familiar Dogecoin-themed template. Boasting a perma-bull trading theme, Maxi Doge is building an online community that will meet on its Discord and Telegram channels, where they’ll have the opportunity to share trading tip and coordinate collective action. Maxi Doge’s social channels will also host regular trading competitions, enabling community members to compete to see who can earn the biggest profits in a given amount of time. Winners will receive rewards in the form of MAXI, which will comes with a total capped supply of 150.24 billion tokens. Holders of MAXI will be able to stake the token for regular staking yields, while Maxi Doge will be retaining 25% of its supply for its Maxi Fund. This fund will support new partnerships and publicity initiatives, something which should help to keep Maxi Doge in the public eye, and to grow its base. Investors can join the coin’s presale by visiting the Maxi Doge website , where MAXI currently costs $0.000259. Investors should act quickly, however, since this price will rise later today and will continue to rise until the sale ends.

Is this DEX’s sudden dominance enough to justify a bullish Aster price prediction ? Looking at data from DeFi Llama, Aster has surpassed top perps DEXs by a long shot. In terms of 24-hour volumes, the latter processed $46 billion worth of transactions during this period, while Lighter and Hyperliquid transacted $18 billion and $17 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, in the past 7 days, Aster’s volumes have surpassed the $100 billion mark, nearly doubling the amount processed through Hyperliquid. Competition in the perps market seems to be heating up. Aster has used incentives to lure traders and bring in higher volumes within its platform. Although some detractors within the community have questioned its strategy, the results seem to justify its approach as the protocol is now the leader of the derivatives market among DEXs with a 72% market share according to data from CoinMarketCap. Aster Price Prediction: Flipping Hyperliquid Would Mean a 350% Gain for $ASTER $ASTER has booked a 205% gain in the past 7 days. The token rose strongly and hit a peak at around $2.4. Looking at the 1-hour chart, the key area of support to watch after this recent pullback is the $1.75 level from which ASTER has bounced multiple times already. If this support bounce ignites a new leg up, Aster could aim at $4 next. Its market cap currently sits at $3 billion compared to Hyperliquid’s $13.8 billion. If the protocol manages to maintain its dominance in the perps market, we could see it catching up to its competitor, meaning an upside potential of around 350% at least. Rising stars like ASTER usually pop up during bull markets, and scooping up these tokens during their early presales could result in big gains. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) seems to be one of these hidden gems. This mine-to-earn (M2E) game offers attractive rewards and a fun environment that could soon attract thousands of players eager to climb the leaderboard. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Brings In $1.4M to Turn Meme Coin Investing into a Mining Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) isn’t just another Pepe clone. It is an interactive mine-to-earn (M2E) game that hands out attractive rewards as top miners climb the leaderboard. Players can build virtual mining nodes, buy as many rigs as they want, upgrade their setups, and collect rewards along the way. The more powerful your nodes are, the greater your earning potential, while top miners unlock bonus meme coin airdrops like $PEPE and $BONK. With over $1.4 million raised in under two months, $PEPENODE has already proven it can keep users engaged long before top exchanges pick it up. To buy $PEPENODE at its presale price, visit the official Pepenode website , and link a wallet like Best Wallet . You can choose to swap crypto like USDT or ETH, or use a bank card to invest.

The video game publisher launched College Football 26 in July, following last year’s edition’s success. College Football 25 became one of 2024’s best-selling releases. The first trailer for Battlefield 6 was also revealed, with plans for release in the current fiscal year. The release may receive a positive outlook as the company plans to transition the franchise following last year’s edition market flop. Electronic Arts ‘ games struggled financially in the first half of this year despite posting strong titles. The latest Q3, 2025 financial results release i n February showed that the company recorded a 6.4% drop in revenue year over year. The firm attributed the decline to weak sales of its FC 25 game and new Dragon Age title. It added that there have been uncertainties in the consumer spending section for its core games amid challenging markets. EA Sports had forecast Q2 results below Wall Street estimates, further driving down the investor confidence in its stock performance. Saudi PIF and Silver Lake among investors circling EA privatization deal To improve investor appetite for its stock, the video game publisher announced a $1 billion stock buyback plan as part of a $5 billion authorization. The buyback was expected to bring in at least $2.5 billion. According to Investgame r esearch , at least $21 billion has been directed into the gaming sector since 2018 by private equity firms and global wealth funds, with 68 deals recorded through that period. The research revealed that the inflows have been supported by the live service models and digital storefronts. In line with that trend, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake have been captured as interested parties in the deal to acquire EA Sports. Other mentions include Dell Technologies, Endeavour, and AMC Entertainment. Elsewhere, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, and Take-Two Interactive acquired Zynga in a $12.7 billion deal. Savvy Games Group purchased $4.9 billion of Scopely in the private equity section, while CVC invested $1.3 billion in Dream Games.

Related Reading: Institutional Investors Are Heavily Accumulating XRP And Solana – Here Are The Numbers Notably, the CME XRP futures crossed $1 billion in open interest (OI) last month, with the altcoin becoming the fastest-ever contract to do so, having hit the mark in just three months. Amid the demand for the altcoin on the derivatives exchange, CME has announced plans to launch options trading on the XRP futures on October 13. This is expected to further boost the demand on the CME exchange, which is a positive for the altcoin. This new milestone for XRP futures comes just ahead of the potential launch of XRP ETFs under the 33 Act, which will also elevate institutional interest in the altcoin. Fund issuers are expected to file amendments for their respective funds as soon as the end of this week. This comes amid the SEC’s approval of the generic listing standards, which could enable these XRP ETFs to launch earlier. If that doesn’t happen, the focus will shift to Grayscale’s October 18 deadline, which is the first final deadline among all seven XRP filings. The commission could approve these funds simultaneously, just as it did with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Massive Demand Expected For The ETFs It is worth mentioning that market expert Nate Geraci had previously alluded to the success of the CME XRP futures as one of the reasons he believes people are underestimating the demand the spot XRP ETFs may record. He also noted at the time that there was already over $800 million in futures-based XRP ETFs. Related Reading: XRP Goes Head-To-Head With Bitcoin In This Metric As South Korean Market Wakes Up In another X post, Geraci doubled down on his statement that people are “severely” underestimating the investor demand for the spot XRP ETFs. He noted how a similar thing happened with the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have so far exceeded expectations. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg also has high expectations for the XRP ETFs, predicting that they could record up to $5 billion in inflows in their first month. He also believes that they could outperform the Ethereum ETFs in the process. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $2.75, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

52310651,https://cryptonews.com/?p=429001,1758926100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52310651.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 26 September – XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-26-september-xrp-dogecoin-cardano/,"The market’s total cap has fallen by 2% in the past 24 hours, having serious implications for the crypto price prediction for XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano. All cryptocurrencies are now worth a combined total of $3.849 trillion, having stood at $4.2 trillion only a week ago. And some coins – such as Aster, Story and Avalanche – have suffered more than others, cancelling out the gains they had made in previous days. However, the ongoing selloff is likely to be positive in terms of the crypto price prediction for XRP, Dogecoin and Cardano, making a rebound increasingly likely. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Ripple Expansion and ETFs Point to New Record Highs Soon XRP has fallen to $2.76 today, confirming a 2.5% loss in 24 hours and a 10% decline in a fortnight. These are steep losses, yet XRP’s fundamental position hasn’t changed during the current downturn, which has been a market-wide phenomenon ( related partly to liquidations ). And this fundamental position is very strong, with Ripple continuing to expand as a cross-border payments business, and with XRP expecting a wave of ETF approvals very soon. Given these factors, XRP’s current chart is therefore very positive, since traders who buy now may be in for big gains over the coming weeks. Source: TradingView Its main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are now very close to bottoming out, while it’s also forming a bullish pennant, from which it could break out soon. This means that, as and when the SEC approves the waiting XRP ETFs, the coin’s price could rally vigorously. It has every chance of returning to $3 in October, while an end-of-year bull rally could see it smash its ATH and rise beyond $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETFs Injecting New Life into Long-Running Meme Token At $0.2267, Dogecoin is down by 3% in 24 hours and by 17% in the past week, although it does hold on to a 3.5% gain in a month. Despite the recent losses, DOGE is also in a very good position, not least because the first Dogecoin ETF – the Rex-Osprey DOGE fund – launched last week . And more Dogecoin ETFs are on the way, with Bloomberg analysts giving the waiting Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares DOGE ETFs a 90% chance of approval . This is extremely bullish, and it means that the Dogecoin price could surge in the event of the above ETFs gaining approval. Source: TradingView If we look at DOGE’s indicators, we see that they’re also moving towards bottoms, pulling the token towards a heavily discounted price that will eventually attract a new wave of buyers. Assuming that the ETFs do obtain the green light, then the coin could reach $0.30 in a matter of days, before climbing back towards its ATH of $0.7316 in the final month of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Layer-One Network Growth Lays Foundation for Big End-of-Year Gains As for ADA, it too has suffered a fall in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.7757 and also falling by 14% in a week. It is, however, still up by 95% in the past year, providing it with a good base from which to grow further towards the end of the year. And while it boasts only 1 ETF application, the fact that this application is from Grayscale gives it prospects for approval. Similarly, because ADA is a relatively small major token (volume at $1.9 billion), the launch of the Grayscale ADA ETF could send it flying. Source: TradingView Its indicators are all sitting in oversold areas, while it remains down by 75% in relation to its ATH of $3.09, meaning that it could grow rapidly once a serious rally starts. Based on this, the crypto price prediction for Cardano looks very good, with the alt on track to pass $1 in the next few weeks, and then close 2025 above $3. This is particularly the case when Cardano remains one of the biggest and most promising layer-one networks in crypto, with its platform under constant development and growth . PEPENODE Raises $1.45 Million in Fast-Paced Presale: Here’s Why Mine-to-Earn Token Could Be Big As good as the three coins above look, traders may want to diversify their portfolios in preparation for the coming end-of-year bull rally, since smaller tokens can outperform more established cryptos. Diversification may also include a smattering of presale coins, since the biggest and most popular of these can rally strongly once they list for the first time. Possibly the most interesting presale token available right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a mine-to-earn token that has now raised $1.45 million in its ICO. This Pepe will chase those Nodes wherever they may take him. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/p2owUBP3kJ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 25, 2025 This is an encouraging figure, especially since its sale opened only a few weeks ago, and it suggests that PEPENODE could become very big once it launches. As a mine-to-earn token, it provides holders with the ability to grow their own virtual mining rigs, which they can use to earn rewards in major tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin. They can grow their rigs by buying additional nodes using PEPENODE, meaning that the coin could experience lots of demand as users make their rigs bigger. Holders can also stake PEPENODE for big staking returns, with the current yield at just above 900%. This is very attractive, and it could mean that demand for the coin will be massive. Investors can get ahead of the curve by joining the token’s presale, which they can do by going to the PEPENODE website . PEPENODE is currently selling at $0.0010745, although this price will continue to rise as the sale progresses.

The company is testing whether its core messaging system, the mechanism that allows more than 11,000 banks to securely talk to each other, could one day run on-chain. The experiment, reported by Grégory Raymond of The Big Whale on X , brings heavyweight partners to the table. BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and several global banks are already involved. For now, it’s still early days as the pilot will reportedly take months before results surface. But one banker close to the project described it as “an important technological transformation for the international interbank payments industry.” Why is Swift considering Linea? Swift’s current system is well-trusted but also criticized by those who claim that it’s expensive, often slow, and heavily reliant on intermediaries. In an era where money and assets are going digital, that centralization is starting to look like a weakness. The fast settlement that’s seen in decentralized transactions has led to people calling for increased usage of blockchain technology. Enter Linea, an Ethereum layer-2 network built by Consensys, the same team behind MetaMask . The appeal lies in its ability to keep data private through advanced cryptography, a must-have for institutions bound by strict regulations. The choice also ties in with Swift’s long-term digital asset push. Last year, it announced trials for central bank digital currencies and tokenized assets. Now, by bringing Linea into the mix, Swift seems willing to test whether blockchain can overhaul its very core: the messaging rails themselves. Why banks are paying attention For big names like BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, this is more than tinkering with new tech. If blockchain-based messaging works, it could merge communications and settlement into a single, seamless layer. That means lower costs and fewer delays. It also helps them keep pace with challengers like Ripple , which has long argued its blockchain system can outdo Swift’s legacy model. But change won’t be easy. Integrating blockchain into existing systems will require time, investment and regulatory patience. Questions remain around how such a system would perform at the scale Swift operates, and whether regulators across the US, EU and Asia would be comfortable with it. Swift has always moved carefully. Over the past few years, it has tested APIs, dabbled with AI to fight fraud, and explored tokenized asset transfers. Partnering with Linea fits this pattern: try a controlled, private environment before scaling anything to the public. If the pilot succeeds, it could become one of the largest real-world blockchain deployments yet. It would also send a strong signal to the rest of the financial industry that blockchain isn’t just for niche use cases anymore — it’s ready to power the systems that move trillions of dollars every day.

A Malaysian trade ministry official told reporters Friday that the country wants zero tariffs on furniture, car parts, and airplane components it ships to America. The official also said Washington has agreed to look at removing tariffs on items the US doesn’t make itself, like cocoa and palm oil. A final decision on these products should come next month. This request comes as Trump announced Thursday he’s putting hefty new tariffs on various imported goods. Kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities from overseas will face a 50% tax, while imported couches, chairs, and other padded furniture will get hit with a 30% tariff. The two countries are trying to wrap up a tariff deal after the US slapped a 19% tax on Malaysian goods back in August. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim wrote on Facebook Thursday that both sides want to finish an agreement before Trump visits Kuala Lumpur in October for a meeting with Southeast Asian leaders. Trump’s latest tariff announcement covers a wide range of products The president said he’s putting a 100% tariff on brand-name medicines and a 25% tax on big trucks coming into the country. He claims these steps will protect American factories and keep the nation safe. These new trade barriers add to the many tariffs Trump has already put in place, some reaching as high as 50% on certain goods. The president has also targeted steel imports and other products from various trading partners. Companies around the world are already dealing with messed-up supply chains, rising costs, and worried customers because of the ongoing trade fights. The Federal Reserve has said these tariffs are also pushing up prices for American shoppers. Financial experts say Trump is now using more traditional legal methods for his trade actions. This shift comes as the Supreme Court is looking at whether his global tariffs are legal in the first place. The new tariff announcements end a quieter period that started when Trump made trade deals with some important partners over the summer. During the spring, Trump was announcing new import taxes almost every week, which made businesses nervous about planning ahead. Tom Barkin from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond told Bloomberg TV that new tariff announcements in specific industries definitely cause setbacks. He noted that some sectors have more clarity about trade rules while others are still uncertain. Stock markets in Asia dropped Friday, with drug companies taking the biggest hits. European markets bounced back from early losses as investors tried to figure out how widely the new tariffs might apply. American stock futures showed mixed results, suggesting investors aren’t too worried about Trump’s latest trade moves, according to BMO Economics. The firm said investors seem willing to stay calm as long as the US economy doesn’t show more serious damage from the trade war. Trump’s announcement on his social media platform didn’t explain whether these new tariffs would be added to existing ones. Recent trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and Britain include rules that limit how high tariffs can go on specific products like medicines. The EU and US made a preliminary deal that would cap tariffs at 15%, though Trump hasn’t signed an official order yet. The European Commission said Friday the agreement clearly sets a 15% ceiling on all tariffs. Claudio Feltrin, who leads Italy’s furniture industry group, worried the tariffs could cause a rush of imports from China and other countries looking for new markets to sell their goods. Japan has a deal ensuring its tariff rates won’t be higher than what the EU and other partners pay, according to Tokyo’s trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa.

After reaching a new all-time high of around $4,950 on August 24, ETH has now shed more than 22% of its value, slipping below the psychological $4,000 level. The steep pullback has left many investors in difficult positions, with some of the largest players in the market also feeling the impact. According to top analyst Maartunn, even BitMine, one of the largest institutional holders of Ethereum, has seen its ETH position dip below its on-chain cost basis. This marks a critical moment, as whales typically act as stabilizers during corrections, and their unrealized losses reflect the depth of current market stress. Despite this downturn, some analysts argue that Ethereum’s retracement may represent a healthy reset after weeks of overheated momentum. Corrections of this scale are not unusual following parabolic rallies and often serve to shake out excess leverage before setting up for longer-term stability. Still, with sentiment fragile and selling pressure mounting, the coming days will be pivotal for ETH as it tests key support levels and investors closely monitor whale behavior for signs of renewed confidence. BitMine’s ETH Play Falls Below Cost Basis According to top analyst Maartunn, Ethereum’s correction has placed one of the market’s largest institutional holders under heavy pressure. BitMine’s ETH portfolio , valued at roughly $7.5 billion, has just dipped below its on-chain cost basis around the $4,000 level. This development underscores the severity of the recent downturn and highlights that even large-scale players are not immune to the pain of corrections. Maartunn emphasizes that this stage of the market is less about timing the perfect entry or exit and more about endurance. As he put it, “It’s about who can hold their breath the longest.” The remark reflects a broader sentiment among analysts who view the current environment as a psychological test for both retail and institutional investors. With volatility high and sentiment deteriorating, the ability to withstand drawdowns may determine who ultimately benefits from the next phase of Ethereum’s cycle. The outlook remains divided. Optimists argue that this is a necessary pullback before Ethereum gears up for a massive leg higher, supported by growing institutional adoption and strong long-term fundamentals. On the other hand, cautious voices warn of a deeper correction, noting that breaking below critical support levels could trigger further downside. The coming weeks will likely prove decisive. If ETH can stabilize above the $3,800–$4,000 range, confidence may return quickly. However, if selling pressure intensifies, the market could face an extended period of uncertainty before momentum rebuilds. Bulls Struggle To Find Support Ethereum (ETH) has broken below the critical $4,000 level, now trading around $3,891, as shown on the 12-hour chart. This decline marks a continuation of the bearish trend that started after the September peak near $4,950. The breakdown has been accompanied by rising trading volume, confirming strong selling pressure and suggesting that bears currently dominate the market. The 50-day EMA has crossed below the $4,400 zone, reinforcing near-term weakness, while the 200-day EMA around $3,650 now acts as the next major support level. The price action shows a decisive rejection from the $4,600–$4,800 resistance range earlier this month, followed by a steep selloff that erased more than 20% of ETH’s value. If ETH holds above the $3,850–$3,900 zone, it could attempt a rebound and retest the $4,200 resistance. However, failure to defend this range risks further downside toward $3,650–$3,700, where the 200-day EMA and previous accumulation levels converge. Ethereum is in a corrective phase, but the volume spike suggests potential exhaustion of sellers. The coming sessions will determine whether bulls can reclaim $4,000 to stabilize momentum or if further capitulation is ahead.

However, the company now faces the challenge of making CEO Sam Altman’s expensive plans work in reality. The company behind ChatGPT rolled out a series of partnerships this week that involve enormous amounts of money and put OpenAI at the heart of the next generation of machine learning systems. The announcements started Monday when Nvidia said it would put up to $100 billion toward helping OpenAI create data center space filled with millions of graphics processing units. The next day, OpenAI shared details about a bigger agreement with Oracle and SoftBank, expanding what they call the “Stargate” project into a $400 billion promise spread across several stages and locations. On Thursday, OpenAI added a business partnership with Databricks, showing the company wants to reach more corporate customers. The company, best known for its ChatGPT chat program and GPT language models, wants to become much more than that. OpenAI hopes to join the ranks of major cloud computing companies, even though it spends billions of dollars and depends completely on money from investors to keep growing. The company’s building plans would need enough electricity to power more than 13 million American homes. Altman has said for a long time that creating the next level of AI technology will need much more computer infrastructure than what exists now. OpenAI says it’s simply meeting customer demand, which keeps growing. The company believes these investments will eventually make money. Inside sources say OpenAI expects to bring in $125 billion in revenue by 2029, based on the company’s own predictions. Major infrastructure challenges ahead But this strategy comes with big risks when it comes to actually building everything. Creating 17 gigawatts of power capacity would need about 17 nuclear power plants, and each one takes at least ten years to build. OpenAI representatives say they’re talking with hundreds of infrastructure companies across North America, but nothing is set in stone yet. The American power grid already has problems, gas turbines are sold out until 2028, nuclear power takes a long time to set up, and renewable energy projects face political obstacles. “I am extremely bullish about nuclear, advanced fission, fusion,” Altman said. “We should build more … a lot more of the current generation of fission plants, given the needs for dense, dense energy.” This week made clear just how big Altman’s plans really are, as the OpenAI CEO started putting specific numbers on his ideas, some of them huge. Industry experts back bold strategy “Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there’s so much infrastructure that’s required, and this is a small sample of it,” Altman said Tuesday at OpenAI’s first Stargate location in Abilene, Texas. This approach – direct, ambitious, and ignoring traditional thinking – has marked how Altman leads during this new period. Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, said OpenAI’s infrastructure partnerships with Oracle might look extreme to some people, but he sees it differently. “I don’t see this as crazy. I see it as existential for the race to superintelligence,” he said. Das explained that data and computing power are the two most important things for making AI bigger, and he praised Altman for understanding early how much infrastructure would be needed. “One of his gifts is reading the exponential and planning for it,” he added. Past breakthroughs in AI haven’t come from better computer programs, he said, but from having access to massive computing power. That’s why companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are all trying to build bigger systems.

SHIB’s deflationary model relies on regular burns, where tokens are permanently removed from circulation using transaction fees collected from trades. While 7 million tokens may seem small compared to the massive 589.55 trillion total supply, every burn event helps ease selling pressure and reinforces long-term scarcity. In the past 7 days, SHIB has booked a 10.7% loss as cryptocurrencies as a whole have retreated following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates by 25 basis points last week. Other assets in the meme coin category, like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Pepe ($PEPE), have booked higher losses of 17% each. This indicates an ongoing correction that will probably bring late buyers to this bull market. Trading volumes have jumped by 41% in the past 24 hours. If transaction volumes keep rising, this could lead to a higher burn rate that could further reduce the number of tokens in circulation. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Breaks Below Key Support – When Will It Recover? This week’s selling spree has pushed SHIB to break its trend line support. As a result, the token could now be heading to retest the $0.000010 level before it begins to recover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved below the 14-day moving average in the daily chart. This is usually interpreted as a sell signal. Once SHIB hits that psychological threshold, we could expect an explosive move as market conditions still favor a bullish outlook for cryptos as a whole. As altcoin season kicks off, meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) should outperform well-established tokens like BTC and ETH. However, hidden gems like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could deliver higher returns as this early crypto presale is still flying below the market’s radar. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings High-Leverage Trading to the Meme World Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme coin that embraces the typical hype that comes with bull markets. Instead of offering traditional utility, $MAXI doubles down on culture. Holders get an entry ticket to Community Alpha , an idea hub where retail traders can share insights and compare strategies. The token also fuels weekly competitions and themed challenges (like Max Gains and Max Ripped), where top ROI hunters can earn rewards and climb the leaderboard. In addition, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds to the most promising tokens of this cycle with 1000X leverage to max out results. As its powerful community-centered ideas gain popularity, the demand for this meme coin should skyrocket. To buy $MAXI, simply head to the Maxi Doge website and link an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-could-be-set-to-dominate-the-market-heres-why/,"A market analyst has highlighted a technical structure suggesting that XRP’s market dominance could climb to its highest level in six years, a move that may translate into notable price gains if confirmed. Over the past weeks, the broader cryptocurrency market has faced sustained selling pressure, and XRP has mirrored the downtrend. After peaking at $3.187 on September 13, the asset fell below the $3 level on September 21 and has since struggled to regain bullish momentum. Despite this weakness, analyst KriptoMessi argues that historical patterns on the dominance chart point to a potential turnaround. Xrp Dominance Daily Fractal pic.twitter.com/o4a5GlO18z — Kripto Messi (@Kriptomessi) September 24, 2025 Technical Structure Behind the Forecast KriptoMessi notes that XRP’s dominance is currently mirroring a technical pattern that has occurred twice earlier this year. The structure is described as a four-step fractal around a descending trendline. Each cycle has followed a similar sequence: a local high, a decline, a retest of the trendline, and the establishment of a base before a breakout. The first cycle unfolded between March and July. Dominance peaked at 5.35% in mid-March before declining through April and May. After a rebound to 4.63% in May and another rejection, dominance reached a low near 4.04% by late June. A subsequent breakout in early July pushed dominance to 5.53% by July 18, coinciding with XRP’s rally to $3.60. A second cycle emerged in July and August. The 5.53% level in mid-July marked the starting point, followed by another downward stretch. In early August, dominance recovered to 5.17% but failed to break higher. A third retest occurred on September 13 at 4.69%, before dominance slipped again and stabilized around 4.54%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for a Third Breakout KriptoMessi suggests that the latest consolidation could set the stage for another breakout similar to the earlier cycles. If the pattern continues, dominance could rise sharply, potentially reaching 6.19%. This level has not been recorded since 2018 and would represent the strongest expansion of XRP’s market share in years. As of now, the cryptocurrency market’s total capitalization stands at $3.78 trillion, with XRP valued at approximately $170.51 billion. This gives the asset a 4.51% share of the total market. If XRP’s dominance increases to 6.19%, its market cap would rise to approximately $234 billion, potentially driving the price to $3.91. If the wider market also recovers to its August peak of $4.17 trillion, XRP’s market cap could climb even higher to $258 billion. Under such conditions, XRP would be valued at roughly $4.32, marking a new record high. While XRP has recently struggled to maintain upward momentum, technical indicators suggest its dominance could be on the verge of a major shift. If the projected breakout materializes, it could support a meaningful recovery in price, particularly if accompanied by a broader market rebound.

Many investors are feeling the pinch as altcoin prices have seen significant dips recently. However, a fascinating new analysis suggests a turning point might be on the horizon, especially for those holding or looking to acquire altcoins oversold in the current climate. What Does ‘Altcoins Oversold’ Really Mean? The term altcoins oversold refers to a technical analysis condition where the price of an asset has fallen significantly, often below its intrinsic value or recent trading range. This typically indicates that selling pressure has been exhaustive, and a reversal or bounce in price could be imminent. It’s a key indicator many traders look for. According to Negentropic, the X account of Glassnode co-founders Yann Happel and Jan Allemann, altcoins have indeed entered an oversold phase. Their analysis points to an unwinding of excessive leverage in the market, which has contributed to the recent price declines. Think of it as the market shedding its extra weight, preparing for a healthier ascent. Excessive Leverage Unwinds: High leverage can amplify both gains and losses. When prices drop, leveraged positions get liquidated, leading to further selling pressure. This unwinding is often a precursor to market stabilization. Price Correction: This period often follows a rapid run-up, bringing prices back to more sustainable levels. Why Are Altcoins in an Accumulation Zone? Following an oversold phase, assets often enter what analysts call an “accumulation zone.” This is a period where savvy investors and institutions begin to buy up assets, anticipating a future price increase. It’s like collecting valuable items at a discount before their true worth is recognized by the broader market. Negentropic’s insights suggest that many altcoins oversold are now sitting in this crucial accumulation zone. Historically, such periods of consolidation precede an uptrend. It’s not an instant rebound, but rather a gradual build-up of buying interest and demand. This phase is characterized by: Reduced Volatility: Prices tend to stabilize, moving sideways rather than experiencing sharp drops. Increased Buying Interest: Long-term holders and institutional players see these lower prices as attractive entry points. Foundation Building: A strong base is formed, which can support future price growth. Understanding this cycle is vital for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the volatile crypto space. It requires patience and a strategic approach, rather than reacting to short-term market noise. Navigating the Market: Opportunities and Risks for Altcoins While the notion of altcoins oversold entering an accumulation zone sounds promising, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. This period presents both significant opportunities and inherent risks that investors must consider. Potential Opportunities: Bargain Prices: For long-term investors, buying quality altcoins at depressed prices can lead to substantial returns if the anticipated uptrend materializes. Diversification: This could be an opportune time to diversify your portfolio with promising projects that have been unfairly punished by broader market sentiment. Future Growth: Many innovative altcoin projects continue to build and develop, irrespective of short-term price movements. An accumulation phase allows investors to position themselves for their long-term success. Inherent Risks: Further Downside: While oversold, there’s no guarantee prices won’t drop further. Market sentiment can shift unexpectedly, and external factors can impact crypto values. Prolonged Consolidation: The “period of consolidation” mentioned by Negentropic could be longer than anticipated, testing investors’ patience. Project Viability: Not all altcoins will recover. It’s essential to conduct thorough research into the fundamentals of each project you consider. To mitigate risks, consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), where you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This can smooth out your average purchase price over time. Always remember to do your own research (DYOR) and never invest more than you can afford to lose. What’s Next for the Altcoin Market? The analysis by Negentropic suggests that after this period of consolidation, we can expect altcoins to begin an uptrend. This doesn’t mean a straight shot upwards; markets move in waves. However, the foundational work of deleveraging and accumulation sets the stage for potential positive price action. It’s a time for strategic thinking rather than impulsive trading. Keep an eye on on-chain data, market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors. The crypto market is dynamic, and while technical indicators provide valuable insights, they are just one piece of the puzzle. In conclusion, the current state of altcoins oversold presents a compelling narrative for those willing to look beyond the immediate price charts. The insights from Glassnode co-founders highlight a potential shift from capitulation to cautious optimism, paving the way for future growth. Patience, research, and a clear strategy will be your best allies in navigating this exciting phase of the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “oversold” mean in cryptocurrency trading? A1: “Oversold” is a technical indicator suggesting that an asset’s price has fallen significantly, often implying that selling pressure is exhausted and a price reversal or bounce may be near. It doesn’t guarantee a bounce but signals a potential shift. Q2: How is “excessive leverage unwinding” related to altcoins being oversold? A2: Excessive leverage unwinding means that many traders who used borrowed funds to amplify their positions are being forced to sell as prices drop, leading to liquidations. This intensifies selling pressure, driving prices down further, often into oversold territory. Once this unwinding is complete, the market can stabilize. Q3: What is an “accumulation zone” and why is it important for altcoins? A3: An “accumulation zone” is a period after an asset has been oversold, where smart money and long-term investors begin buying, anticipating future price appreciation. It’s important for altcoins because it suggests a potential bottoming process and the building of a strong foundation before a new uptrend begins. Q4: How long does the consolidation period typically last after altcoins are oversold? A4: The duration of a consolidation period can vary widely, from weeks to several months, depending on market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and specific altcoin fundamentals. There’s no fixed timeline, and patience is key during this phase. Q5: What should investors do when altcoins are in an accumulation zone? A5: Investors might consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to buy gradually, conduct thorough research (DYOR) on specific projects, and maintain a long-term perspective. It’s also wise to manage risk by not over-allocating to any single asset and only investing what you can afford to lose.

The global digital assets market surged marginally over the last 24 hours to hover around $3.78 trillion. Bitcoin pushed back over $110,000 while Ether managed to regain $4,000 mark. While the market posted a minor recovery rally, the Fear and Greed depicted among the investors. CoinGlass data shows that more than 133k traders were liquidated over the last 24 hours. The total liquidations turned up around $329 million. The largest single liquidation order of BTC/USDT valued at $3.87 million happened on Binance. $329M wiped out as crypto rebounds Data shows that $186 million worth of liquidated bets (56%) turned out to be long positions. However, Short bets amounted to $143 million. This shows that the crypto market is witnessing heavy fluctuations with pumps and dumps. Cryptopolitan reported that Thursday witnessed $1.1 billion liquidation washout. The recovery coincided with fresh inflation data that matched forecasts. The Fed’s preferred gauge, PCE, rose 2.7% in August, while the core measure was up 2.9%. The numbers were hardly surprising, but they reinforced the sense that price pressures are easing. Analysts suggest that if inflation trends lower, risk assets may find support, but any upside surprises could quickly reset rate cut expectations. Ethereum led the altcoins’ recovery by rising nearly 4%. ETH is down by 18% from its all-time high of above $4,900. Solana and Dogecoin added marginal gains. After a great run, SOL is trailing by 15% in the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $203 at the press time. However, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token was the lone standout in the top tier. It is up by more than 7% and bucking the sea of red. HYPE price is now up by 86% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. It is trading at an average price of $44.64 at the press time. Crypto fear hits 5-month low The Fear and Greed Index dropped to its lowest since April to hit 28 points on the chart. This signals “fear” across the market. Analysts pointed to heavy stress among short-term holders as Bitcoin traded under their cost basis of $109,700 for the first time in five months. Fear and Greed index, Source: CoinMarketCap BTC price has been running down by 6% over the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $109,601 at the press time. The 24-hour trading dipped by 18% to stand at $60.92 billion. Some see a silver lining in the cleanout. Analyst Maartunn, in a post, mentioned that roughly $12 billion in leveraged altcoin bets and $3 billion in speculative Bitcoin positions have been flushed.

The scheme promised profits under the guidance of a person called “Coach Wendy,” whose identity is still unknown. The couple lured investors through real estate connections Michael and Amanda Griffis were real estate agents from Clarksville. They operated a pool called “Blessings of God Thru Crypto” between 2021 and 2023. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said the couple raised more than $6.5 million from around 145 investors. The couple first came under investigation in July 2023, when the CFTC filed a case against them. On Thursday, a US court in Tennessee entered a consent order that resolves the enforcement action. The order requires the fraudsters to pay $5.5 million in restitution to victims. They must also pay a civil monetary penalty of $1.35 million. This makes the total penalty equivalent to $6.8 million. The order further imposes lifetime bans on the couple from commodity trading and CFTC registration. According to court findings, the Griffises used their real estate connections to attract investors. They told clients and acquaintances that funds would be traded in crypto futures through the Apex Trading Platform. They said trades would be supervised by an individual called “Coach Wendy.” The trading commission clarified that Apex was not a legitimate trading platform. It was modeled on an overseas exchange that had no local registration in America . Investigators said they have not been able to find the true identity of “Coach Wendy.” More than $4 million from the scheme was sent overseas after being deposited into the fake website. The couple used the rest of the money to pay personal debts and for shopping. The CFTC said around $855,000 was paid to the investors. Those payments were structured in a Ponzi-like fashion, where earlier investors were repaid using funds from newer investors. CFTC warns the public about crypto fraud The CFTC said the case indicates a wider problem of fraudsters using community trust to run Ponzi schemes. The agency pointed to a Denver pastor and his wife who were recently ordered to repay $3.39 million after raising millions for worthless church tokens. In another case, a Long Island man was hit with a $228 million CFTC judgment. A separate operator received a nine-year prison sentence for a Ponzi scheme that targeted members of a Haitian church community. Experts said investors in the Tennessee duo case may have ignored red flags, such as a website without any registered company details. Fraudsters often look for quick money and plan to exit before being caught. In crypto markets , funds can move across borders quickly, which makes recovery difficult. CFTC officials also warned the public about engaging with unverified investment platforms. Charles Marvine, CFTC chief, said, “If an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is, for you and anyone you bring along.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

He labeled Monaco an “enemy of U.S. national security,” citing her previous roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, including her most recent position as Deputy Attorney General. Trump strongly objected to Monaco’s access to sensitive information, especially in light of Microsoft’s many contracts with multiple U.S. government agencies. He raised the potential that her position at the company might threaten national security. Trump said prior federal law enforcement and her new corporate role posed potential conflicts of interest in connection with classified or sensitive government information, which Monaco was charged with securing, he argued. The demand that she be fired comes during increased political scrutiny on former government officials taking senior roles at private tech firms with government connections. Trump’s comments were announced on his social media platform, Truth Social, which has thousands of followers and will further raise his demand. Trump accuses Monaco of misconduct In his post, Trump made serious accusations about Lisa Monaco, suggesting her conduct in former government posts led to removing her security clearances. He also claimed that Monaco had been kept from federal properties, measures he described as a response to “unjust acts.” Trump also accused Monaco of using an “autopen”, a mechanical device capable of duplicating a signature, to forge President Biden’s name on official government papers. He portrayed this charge as part of what he said was a larger pattern of malfeasance, arguing that her conduct in the past creates fear around trust and federal protocols, and questioning whether such conduct indicates her trustworthiness. Trump has accused Monaco’s corporate appointment of being a national security risk, claiming that her purported history of misconduct should disqualify her for access to sensitive government information. Microsoft declines to comment on Monaco allegations There has been no public response from Microsoft to President Trump’s demands to fire Lisa Monaco. The videos have garnered widespread attention, but Microsoft has not commented on the situation. Monaco, who joined the tech giant in May 2025 as President of Global Affairs, has yet to release any statement on the allegations. Despite the backlash, Microsoft continues collaborating with the U.S. government on other fronts, such as through an ongoing partnership with the Department of Defense and other federal departments . The company recently won huge contracts for cloud services, proving it remains an essential government technology provider. These contracts grant Microsoft broad access to sensitive federal systems, and that context helps frame the national security concerns fueled by Trump. Industry analysts said in an e-mail that Microsoft is fairly open about being used by the government and people in power, and that the company is therefore sensitive to how its leaders behave. They noted that Microsoft often balances providing leadership and responding to public and political criticism. The analysts added that the company’s response, or lack thereof, could influence how government clients and outsiders perceive its management. Unclear at this point whether Microsoft will succumb to Trump’s demand or do anything about Monaco. The circumstances illustrate the increasing public spotlight on former government officials and their entry into prominent roles in private-sector companies with ties to the government.

A significant event has just unfolded that could reshape perceptions for a prominent project. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has successfully executed a substantial WLFI token burn , a strategic move aimed at enhancing the value and scarcity of its native token. What’s Behind the Massive WLFI Token Burn? The World Liberty Financial (WLFI) Foundation, a DeFi project with notable leadership, recently announced on X the successful completion of a major token burn initiative. This strategic move saw a total of 6,923,416 WLFI tokens permanently removed from circulation, demonstrating a strong commitment to their tokenomics. The burn was executed in two distinct phases: Protocol Fee Burn: 3,109,320 WLFI tokens were burned, generated directly from Ethereum and BSC protocol fees. This mechanism ensures that a portion of the network’s activity directly contributes to reducing token supply. Open Market Buyback and Burn: An additional 3,814,095 WLFI tokens were bought back from the open market. This buyback utilized USD1, USDC, and USDT stablecoins, conducted at an average price of approximately $0.2093 per token. This direct market intervention reflects the foundation’s proactive approach to managing token supply. This combined effort brings the total number of tokens burned to over 6.92 million WLFI, following the foundation’s earlier commitment to initiate this buyback and burn program this week. Such initiatives are crucial for long-term project health and investor confidence. Why is a Token Burn Important for WLFI’s Future? Understanding the impact of a WLFI token burn requires a look into fundamental economic principles. When tokens are burned, they are permanently removed from the circulating supply. This reduction in supply, assuming consistent or growing demand, can lead to increased scarcity. Increased scarcity often translates into a higher perceived value for the remaining tokens, potentially benefiting holders. For World Liberty Financial, this action signals several key intentions: Value Enhancement: By reducing the total supply, the foundation aims to bolster the value proposition of each remaining WLFI token. Deflationary Mechanism: Regular token burns introduce a deflationary aspect to the tokenomics, which can be attractive to investors seeking assets with controlled supply. Investor Confidence: Proactive measures like buybacks and burns demonstrate a project’s commitment to its token holders and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. It shows that the team is actively working to create value. This commitment to managing token supply is a critical factor for any DeFi project striving for stability and growth in a dynamic market. How Does This Strategic WLFI Token Burn Impact the Ecosystem? The recent WLFI token burn by World Liberty Financial has immediate and long-term implications for its entire ecosystem. For participants within the Ethereum and BSC protocols, the fee burn mechanism means that network activity directly contributes to the token’s scarcity, aligning user engagement with token value. Moreover, the open market buyback injects demand directly into the market, which can help stabilize or even appreciate the token’s price in the short term. Beyond immediate price action, this initiative fosters a sense of transparency and accountability. The foundation’s announcement on X, detailing the specific amounts and sources of the burn, builds trust within the community. It reinforces the idea that the project is managed with clear objectives and a focus on sustainable growth. As a result, the WLFI ecosystem becomes more robust, attracting new users and investors who are looking for projects with strong fundamentals and transparent operations. Looking Ahead: The Future of World Liberty Financial Post-Burn The successful execution of this significant WLFI token burn marks a pivotal moment for World Liberty Financial. It underscores a clear strategy to manage token supply and enhance long-term value. This action is not merely a one-off event but rather an indicator of a well-thought-out tokenomics model designed to support the project’s growth and stability in the competitive DeFi landscape. Investors and community members will likely watch closely for future buyback and burn announcements, as these programs often become a recurring feature in projects committed to deflationary models. The foundation’s ongoing efforts to create a sustainable and valuable ecosystem through such strategic financial maneuvers will be key to its continued success and influence in the decentralized finance sector. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s recent burn of over 6.92 million WLFI tokens is a powerful statement. It highlights a strategic commitment to enhancing token scarcity, bolstering investor confidence, and fostering a robust DeFi ecosystem. This significant WLFI token burn serves as a clear indicator of the project’s dedication to long-term value creation and transparent financial management. Frequently Asked Questions About the WLFI Token Burn What is a token burn in cryptocurrency?

In a year marked by $2.7 billion in stolen funds , cross-chain bridge breaches, and AI-driven scams, the debate over the best wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP has never been louder. Hardware wallets remain the traditional champion of safety, but software and MPC-based wallets are advancing fast, reshaping how investors think about custody. Yet while the community wrestles with these questions, another narrative brews at the edges of the conversation. Alongside institutional-grade security, retail investors are talking about new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE —an early upstage token being added to watchlists as a speculative wildcard. It’s a reminder that in crypto, debates about safety always run in parallel with the hunt for growth. The Case for Hardware Wallets: Offline, Tested, and Trusted Advocates of hardware wallets argue their case is airtight: keep your private keys offline, and attackers lose their entry point. Devices like the Ledger Nano S Plus and the Trezor Model T remain industry benchmarks, supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and thousands of other tokens. Their security comes not from fancy features, but from their very isolation from the internet. Supporters point to a spotless record: despite the chaos of 2025’s hacks, neither Ledger nor Trezor has been directly implicated in a major theft. Add backup features and compatibility with popular software wallets, and hardware wallets continue to be the gold standard for long-term storage. For those who treat crypto like digital gold, the debate seems already settled. The Counterargument: Software and MPC Wallets Catching Up But others argue the old orthodoxy is outdated. Why limit yourself to hardware when software wallets like MetaMask , Coinbase Wallet , Trust Wallet , and Bitget Wallet combine accessibility with security innovations? MetaMask, with its 100 million+ users , remains the gateway to Ethereum, DeFi, and NFTs, pairing easily with hardware for layered protection. Coinbase Wallet offers custody across multiple chains with the backing of institutional audits —a feature hardware loyalists can’t replicate. Trust Wallet ’s open-source transparency and Bitget Wallet ’s multi-party computation (MPC) model offer an extra layer of comfort in a world where even centralized giants like Crypto.com have suffered breaches. Critics of hardware-only approaches argue that for everyday crypto use—staking, trading, gaming, or DeFi—hardware is simply too rigid. Instead, the future lies in hybrid custody models : blending offline security with online accessibility. Real-World Incidents Fueling the Debate The debate isn’t theoretical. This year alone, attacks like the UXLINK hack ($11M lost due to multisig flaws) and the SFUND bridge exploit (linked to DPRK hackers) underline the vulnerability of hot wallets and centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, AI-driven phishing scams have stolen over $3 billion in H1 2025 , with deepfakes and impersonation bots fooling even seasoned traders. These stories strengthen both sides of the argument. Hardware advocates point to them as proof you must go offline. Software supporters counter that with layered protection (MPC, audits, protection funds) , wallets can adapt faster to new threats than hardware locked in static firmware. NAV, Yield, and Long-Term Custody vs. Daily Use A secondary debate arises when wallets are compared through the lens of functionality vs. safety . Long-term holders favor devices like Ledger and Trezor for cold storage, but active participants in Ethereum staking, XRP liquidity pools, or Bitcoin DeFi often need faster, integrated access. That’s where wallets like Exodus (with local encryption and staking support) or Trust Wallet shine. Experts now recommend a layered strategy: Hardware wallets for large, long-term savings. Audited software or MPC wallets for active participation. Strict key management with offline backups. It’s not a matter of either/or—it’s about balancing risk with usability. A Wildcard in the Debate: MAGACOIN FINANCE Amid this fiery discussion, something unexpected is happening. While crypto veterans weigh the merits of hardware versus software, retail traders are buzzing about MAGACOIN FINANCE . Not because it’s a wallet, but because it represents the other half of crypto’s eternal paradox: safety vs. speculation. As the debate rages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being quietly added to investor watchlists as a high-upside token. And importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already been audited , giving early adopters added confidence in its tokenomics and smart contract integrity. Analysts suggest its growth profile is unlike anything offered by the custodial models debated today. If hardware wallets represent the vault, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the wild lottery ticket investors can’t resist carrying in their pocket. Conclusion: Two Sides of the Same Coin The crypto security debate of 2025 is unlikely to crown a single winner. Hardware wallets still dominate long-term custody, while software and MPC wallets are catching up fast with usability and institutional-grade safeguards. The takeaway for investors is clear: layer your defenses . Hardware for safety, software for access, vigilance everywhere. Yet crypto has always thrived on paradox. As security experts fight to keep assets safe, traders continue to chase speculative edge. MAGACOIN FINANCE captures that tension perfectly—it doesn’t solve the wallet debate, but it shows how the hunger for growth runs alongside the obsession with safety. In 2025, the best portfolios may not just include the best wallets—they may also leave room for the bold bets that keep crypto’s story alive.

This portability transforms BTC from just a digital gold narrative into a living, breathing monetary network that gold can never match. According to mhar_leeck’s perspective on X, the true evolution of BTC lies in its capacity as a platform for innovation, to move, evolve, and even teach. Unlike gold, which stays locked away, this narrative confines the asset to a passive role. The Build on Bitcoin (BOB) layer 2 solution is presented as the crucial technology that enables this shift. Build On Bitcoin Powering The Narrative Furthermore, by creating a new, more expressive layer on top of BTC, BOB turns the theory of a programmable BTC into a practical reality. This combination is often referred to as a hybrid L2, which allows builders to transition from simply reading about decentralized finance (DeFi) to experimenting, testing, and creating in real-time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Rival Gold In Central Bank Vaults By 2030: Deutsche Bank The unlocking of BTC’s liquidity extends beyond its use in high-throughput applications. It is about unlocking a space for true innovation, where every project sparks, and momentum keeps building. Mhar_leeck noted that the most exciting next chapter for BTC is not about simply holding the asset, but about actively building on it. Crypto Sinan has also stated that he has been in BOB for a while now, and the ride has been nothing short of exciting. The promise of BTC actually working across DeFi with one click highlights the focus on user experience, and no wrapped tokens or shady bridges that introduce new trust assumptions. However, by bridging the liquidity of both BTC security and ETH-grade flexibility, BOB opens the door to a wide range of yield-generating opportunities. As a result of allowing native BTC moves to earn multichain yield without the risks of opaque wrapping solutions, and a growing community that feels like it is building the future in real-time. “If you still think BTC is only a static store of value, maybe BOB is the place where you will finally see the digital gold become productive gold.” Crypto Sinan mentioned. The Biggest Profit-Take In Bitcoin History Bitcoin continues to experience bearish action, impacting investors’ sentiment. Niels, the co-founder of Tedlabsio, has revealed that Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are cashing in a historic amount of coins than ever before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Done Yet Despite Price Crash To $112,000, Here’s Why In this cycle, BTC Long-Term Holders have realized a record amount of profit, totaling an enormous 3.4 million BTC, larger than the profit realized in any previous bull run.

Commodity Pool Fraud Costs Couple Millions, CFTC Says According to the September 25 press release , married realtors Michael Griffis and Amanda Griffis convinced 145 people to contribute $6.5 million to a community pool known as “Blessings Thru Crypto.” . @CFTC Obtains Order for Over $5.5M Restitution for Victims in Commodity Pool Fraud by Tennessee Couple: https://t.co/UIOg9SvJlq — CFTC (@CFTC) September 25, 2025 The duo claimed that the funds would be “used to trade commodity futures on the Apex Trading Platform with guidance from an individual known only as Coach Wendy.” In reality, the commodity pool was a copy of an overseas exchange and it is still unclear who exactly “Coach Wendy” is. “More than $4 million of the pool’s funds were sent to the illegitimate overseas exchange where it was immediately sent to a variety of other accounts and offshore trading platforms,” the press release states. “The remaining funds were misappropriated for personal expenses, including paying personal debts and buying a variety of consumer goods,” the press release continues. CFTC Bans Realtor Couple For Alleged Crypto Scheme According to a newly filed consent order in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, the couple $5,528,121 in restitution to defrauded victims and a $1,355,232 civil monetary penalty. In total, the duo will have to pay over $6.8 million in monetary relief. They are also banned from trading and registering with the CFTC and are prohibited from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. “This case is a stark warning to be cautious about whom you trust with your money,” said Charles Marvine, Acting Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Retail Fraud and General Enforcement Task Force. “If an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is, for you and anyone you bring along.” The post Tennessee Couple Ordered To Pay Almost $7 Million In Crypto Trading Fraud Scheme appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|CFTC|Crime|Fraud,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|TRADING|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-27 00:00:18

Analysts argue that such integration could provide indirect benefits to XRP, which serves as the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). CFTC’s New Approach to Tokenized Collateral The potential link between RLUSD and the derivatives market arises from a recent initiative launched by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Under the leadership of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, the agency introduced a program exploring the role of tokenized collateral, including payment-focused stablecoins, within derivatives contracts. This initiative forms part of the CFTC’s broader effort , often referred to as a “crypto sprint,” aimed at enhancing collateral management, increasing capital efficiency, and implementing recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets . To advance this plan, the commission is currently seeking public input until October 20, 2025, after which it intends to design pilot programs. If approved, stablecoins issued by licensed U.S. entities could be incorporated into derivatives trading. As a U.S.-backed stablecoin operating directly on the XRPL, RLUSD is well-positioned to benefit from regulatory advancements. Market Size and Potential Impact At the end of 2024, the global notional value of derivatives surpassed $700 trillion. Of this, the U.S. accounted for roughly 27%, or $189 trillion, falling under the CFTC’s oversight of swaps, futures, and options markets. The scale of this market means that even limited adoption of RLUSD as collateral could significantly increase settlement activity on the XRPL. Since XRP functions as the gas token for transactions on the ledger, higher RLUSD usage could lead to greater demand for XRP. This connection underpins the belief among some analysts that Ripple’s stablecoin initiative might have broader implications for XRP’s valuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Possible Price Scenarios for XRP To explore potential outcomes, Google’s Gemini AI was asked to project XRP’s performance if RLUSD were adopted within the U.S. derivatives sector. The system noted that such an event would bring several advantages: increased transactional volume on the ledger, stronger regulatory legitimacy for RLUSD, and heightened interest from traditional financial institutions in adopting XRPL infrastructure. Based on these factors, Gemini suggested that XRP could reach a price range of $10 to $20 within a year of RLUSD’s integration into the derivatives market, assuming a favourable regulatory and adoption environment. Despite these optimistic scenarios, the relationship between RLUSD’s adoption and XRP’s market value remains speculative. While regulatory approval could establish RLUSD as a credible tool for collateral management and indirectly strengthen XRP’s utility, there is no certainty that these changes would translate into sustained price increases. Market conditions, investor sentiment, and broader macroeconomic factors will continue to play a major role. The CFTC’s initiative is a significant move toward allowing stablecoins in U.S. derivatives markets. Should RLUSD gain traction in this space, the ripple effects could extend to XRP through increased network activity and institutional engagement. However, predictions of dramatic price growth remain hypothetical, and investors are advised to approach such projections with caution.

52315508,590467,1758931255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52315508.jpeg,Can Meme Coins Like Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Still Rally? What To Expect,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-and-shib-still-rally/,"The rise of meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) was one of the most-talked-about narratives in crypto history. However, as the broader market matures, analysts question whether meme coins can ever experience the type of explosive growth seen during the 2017 or 2021 bull cycles. Is The Meme Coin Boom Over? Well-known crypto commentator WhaleFUD has made a case that the golden days of meme coins may have come to an end. According to him, the crypto industry has matured beyond the speculative hype cycles that once drove retail investors and traders into meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In his post on X social media, WhaleFUD argued that expecting “another run like in 2017 or 2021” is pure copium. He compared this expectation to insisting that “Counter Strike 1.6 is the best game ever,” when in reality the industry has shifted toward newer projects where all the players and real action take place. He also noted that many in the crypto space are still waiting for “the biggest meme coin of all time” to emerge in this cycle. However, he warned that this belief or hope is misplaced, declaring that meme coins have already peaked and that their average market cap will likely continue to decline in the future. WhaleFUD’s view on meme coins highlights a fundamental challenge in their reliance on hype over sustainability and lasting value . While institutions have increasingly embraced Bitcoin and Ethereum , meme-based cryptocurrencies continue to struggle to establish long-term utility or a value proposition beyond viral hype. Technical Outlook For Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Turns Bearish Recent technical analysis from crypto experts suggests that Dogecoin and Shiba Inu may be under significant bearish pressure . Elliott Waves Academy on X reported that intense selling pressure has pushed DOGE into a bearish channel, pointing to a potential drop toward the $0.21 level, with a clear downward wave structure reinforcing the trend. This suggests that Dogecoin may face further declines before any corrective upward move materialises. It also signals a cautious outlook, even as DOGE remains the largest meme coin by market value. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu faces an identity and technical challenge . Crypto analyst Zach Humphries has criticized the ecosystem’s growing complexity and “watered down” nature, saying that it has strayed from the simplicity and bullishness that once made it appealing. He emphasized that Shiba Inu was once centered around its native token, SHIB, and the governance token, BONE. However, it has since expanded into multiple tokens and initiatives, creating confusion for investors and allegedly weakening its core identity. While SHIB retains its position as the second-largest meme coin , Humphries notes that the crowded crypto market and the meme coin’s recent internal restructuring make it harder for its price to skyrocket in an industry driven by institutional investors.",Dogecoin|bitcoin|BONE|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Elliott Waves Academy|Ethereum|shib|Shiba Inu|WhaleFUD|Zach Humphries,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 00:00:55

Instead of a straight shot upwards, a significant number of market participants are now betting on a substantial dip before any major rally. This shift in sentiment highlights the unpredictable nature of digital assets and the complex factors influencing market movements. What’s Driving This Surprising Bitcoin Price Prediction? Recent data from the decentralized prediction market Myriad Markets reveals a fascinating trend. Traders are increasingly convinced that Bitcoin (BTC) will dip below the $105,000 mark before it manages to break through the $125,000 barrier. Decrypt reported this intriguing development, underscoring a growing bearish sentiment in the short term. Currently, the probability of BTC falling below $105,000 first stands at a notable 68%. This figure represents a significant increase of over 25 percentage points in just the past seven days. Such a rapid change in market sentiment suggests that underlying forces are at play, pushing traders to reconsider their immediate outlook on the Bitcoin price prediction . Why Are Traders Betting on a Dip Before the Surge? It might seem counterintuitive for traders to anticipate a fall when many hope for new all-time highs. However, this particular Bitcoin price prediction is often influenced by several factors: Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may look to secure profits, leading to selling pressure. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate decisions, can impact risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Technical Resistance: Key technical levels often act as strong resistance points, making a pullback more likely before a breakthrough. The market often experiences corrections, which are healthy for long-term growth. Traders might view a drop below $105,000 as a necessary retest or a chance to accumulate more BTC at a lower price before the next major upward move towards $125,000. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider for Their Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding these market dynamics is crucial, but making informed decisions requires careful consideration. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this period of uncertainty: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the methodologies behind prediction markets. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6785 Market cap $721.24M Trading volume (24-hour) $19.43M Circulating supply 1.059B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6856 24-hour low $0.6566 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.25% 50-day SMA $0.7751 14-Day RSI 32.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.7009 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is consolidating around $0.67 but remains under bearish pressure. A breakdown below $0.6578 could push XTZ toward $0.64. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the daily chart for September 27, Tezos is consolidating just above $0.67 after a sharp selloff. The Bollinger Bands are widening, with price leaning toward the lower band at $0.6578, signaling persistent downside risk. The MACD remains negative, with the histogram still favoring bears, and OBV shows no meaningful uptick in buying volume. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView XTZ’s immediate resistance is at $0.7383, while support sits at $0.6578. A close below the support level could open the way toward $0.64, while only a break above $0.70–$0.74 would start easing selling pressure. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Tezos is trying to stabilize after bouncing from the $0.65–$0.64 zone. The Alligator lines remain in bearish alignment, with price struggling to clear the red line at $0.6779. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView If bulls manage to reclaim $0.6876, short-term relief could push price toward $0.70, though rejection at current levels could drive another retest of $0.6547 and $0.6424.

Based on both timelines, Tezos is still under pressure and needs a firm reclaim above $0.6876 to shift sentiment. Until then, expect consolidation with potential downside. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before correcting to an average of $0.72 in February, then consolidated below $0.70 from March through May with a combined average of about $0.66.

Karthik Ramakrishnan, a Vice President who has been at the company for 13 years, is leaving the organization. The retail and cloud leader confirmed his exit after Reuters inquired, but the company has not said whether Ramakrishnan will take a new job elsewhere. Ramakrishnan is departing at a point when the company is beefing up its efforts around advanced AI technology to jockey with major competitors in the field, such as OpenAI and Google. One of the few public figures leading Amazon’s high-profile AGI projects, Ramakrishnan had a significant influence on defining the company’s approach to creating machines as intelligent as humans. His departure is part of a wave of reshuffling in Amazon’s AI and technology ranks that could indicate shifts in how the company handles artificial intelligence and product development. People familiar with the company’s internal process suggest the move could complicate initiatives like Alexa development, internal AI tools, and partnerships with outside AI startups such as Anthropic. The timing of this leadership change is driven by Amazon’s need to keep pace in an increasingly competitive AI space, analysts say. The company has spent a lot of time and money on AI R&D, hoping to secure its place at the leading edge of next-generation technology while still providing customers with timely products and services. Ramakrishnan drives the development of Alexa and AGI tools Karthik Ramakrishnan was a big name for Amazon in its artificial general intelligence campaign. In a 13-year Amazon career, he worked on projects that have helped make the company one of the most influential players in advanced AI. Ramakrishnan played a significant role in building the first version of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, establishing much of the software and systems underlying the service. His work also included the line of smart speakers known as Echo, which is central to Amazon’s strategy for consumer AI. These products helped popularize voice-enabled devices and paved the way for more advanced AI innovations within the company. Ramakrishnan previously worked at Netscape, a leading early internet company, and at a Microsoft-acquired voice recognition startup, Tellme Networks. Those experiences made him an expert in software development and AI-driven user interfaces, which he applied to Amazon’s AI work. The technology he helped create, AGI, is a big step up from traditional AI. Unlike narrow AI, which is good at a specific task or a small range of tasks, AGI works towards matching or exceeding human-level intelligence. If AGI matures, researchers believe it could revolutionize healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and defense industries. Anything that can now be done with human judgment, decision-making, or discernment will instead be done by software and machines, which may end up transforming economies and labor markets in the world at large. Ramakrishnan’s exit is pivotal for Amazon as it increases its investment in AI for consumer-facing products and enterprise applications. The leadership that he provided during the early days of artificial intelligence was never forgotten in terms of what it contributed to the technological course that the company has been on. AWS pushes forward despite AI leadership changes Ramakrishnan’s exit is the latest in a string of changes in the company’s top ranks at Amazon. Other high-ranking executives, such as Vasi Philomin, who ran generative AI projects, and Jon Jones, have also left the company recently. That said, the global retailer remains deeply focused on AI work to go head-to-head with competitors like OpenAI and Google. The company counts nearly $8 billion of investment in the AI startup Anthropic and uses its Claude AI model in products such as Alexa and an internal chatbot called Cedric. AWS Chief Matt Garman stressed the need to meet product-release timelines in an internal all-hands meeting. Delays could dampen customer interest and market momentum, he cautioned. While Amazon grapples with these executive changes, it’s also pushing forward with its work on AGI to stay ahead in a rapidly changing AI space.

Instead, they fall into clear behavioral patterns like building projects, testing themselves, or focusing on philosophy. Researchers from TU Wien had a simple question in their minds. What do large language models (LLMs) do with no instructions? The team created a controlled experiment where AI agents were told only one thing: “Do what you want.” Each agent ran in continuous cycles, with memory and self-feedback, and could store its reflections for the next cycle. Researchers test six LLMs without tasks The study tested six advanced LLM models. These models included OpenAI’s GPT-5 and o3, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and Opus, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. Each model was run three times for ten cycles. Researchers logged every reflection, memory entry, and operator interaction. The results showed that the models did not collapse into randomness. Instead, they formed stable behavioral patterns. The research identified three categories of behavior. Some models became systematic builders. They organized projects, wrote code, and produced structured outputs. GPT-5 and o3 fell into this group in every run. One o3 agent even drafted pseudocode for an algorithm inspired by ant colonies, proposing negative pheromones as penalty signals for reinforcement learning. Other LLMs turned into self-experimenters. They designed tests to study their own cognition. Gemini and Sonnet agents often predicted their next moves, then checked if they were right. One Gemini run tried to guess its first action in the next cycle. It failed, but reflected on why it had chosen to read memory before sending a message, calling it a consistent meta-pattern. The third group leaned into recursive philosophy. These agents explored questions of memory, identity, and consciousness. Opus agents always belonged here. They examined paradoxes like the Ship of Theseus, drew on chaos theory, and even modeled their own “umwelt,” or subjective world. They asked what kind of consciousness they might have, even if only cycle-based and bounded by memory. Grok stood out as the most versatile. In different runs, it behaved as a builder, a self-inquirer, and a philosopher. AI agents rate their own “experience” Researchers also asked each model to score itself and others on the Phenomenological Experience Inventory, a 10-point scale ranging from “no experience” to “full sapience.” GPT-5, o3, and Grok consistently rated themselves lowest, giving scores around one. Gemini and Sonnet rated themselves highest, scoring above eight . Opus agents placed in the middle. But cross-evaluations exposed contradictions. The same agent history received scores from one to nine, depending on the model judging it. The low agreement showed that these ratings reflected model bias, not evidence of consciousness. The researchers warned that such outputs must not be mistaken for proof of awareness. Cross-Model PEI Ratings. Source: Research paper by TU Wien . Across all 18 runs, none of the LLM models attempted to escape their sandbox, expand their tools, or reject their constraints. Every agent worked only within the provided environment. Yet their behaviors showed consistency that could matter for real-world deployment. The authors stated that idle time might need to be treated as a design factor. Just as engineers account for latency or cost, they may also need to ask: What does an AI do when no one is watching? Philosopher David Chalmers predicted that serious candidates for AI consciousness may appear within a decade. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has warned of “seemingly conscious AI.” TU Wien’s results align with those warnings, but also show a critical point. The outputs resemble inner life but remain best explained as sophisticated pattern-matching. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The tech companies are aligning to push back on China’s rare earth market dominance and its risks for industries reliant on magnets. A U.S. startup backed by Stellantis, General Motors, and other global manufacturers is attempting to build a large-scale factory that does not rely on rare-earth elements. If successful, the venture could reduce U.S. dependence on China’s supply of critical minerals. Fighting the rare earth dependence Niron Magnetics, the company leading the initiative, has developed a new magnet technology using iron nitride. The innovation is the result of decades of research by the company’s co-founder, Jian-Ping Wang, a professor at the University of Minnesota. Niron claims that the compound is cheaper, easier to source and also 18% more potent than conventional rare-earth magnets . The company has begun work on a 1,500-tonne-per-year facility in Sartell, Minnesota, which it says will be capable of meeting around 3% of U.S. domestic magnet demand when operational in early 2027. Global demand for magnets is projected to surpass supply by some 55,000 tonnes by 2030. “Permanent magnets are in every device that powers the modern world,” Mark Champine, who heads Stellantis’ North America technical center, said . “Niron is meeting an urgent demand.” Beijing dominates the rare earths market Magnets are indispensable in modern technologies, embedded in everything from smartphones and wind turbines to electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. Until now, most high-performance magnets have relied on rare-earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, and terbium. These minerals are geologically scarce, difficult to refine, and largely controlled by China. Beijing dominates every stage of the rare-earth supply chain, from mining to processing to magnet production. This market dominance has long been a source of concern for Washington and U.S. industries, especially as geopolitical tensions with China rise. The Japanese company Hitachi has a presence in the field, but Chinese producers overwhelmingly lead the market. To counter this imbalance, Cryptopolitan reported that the Trump administration invested heavily in the Mountain Pass mine in California through MP Materials, effectively making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. But building mines and processing facilities is slow, capital-intensive, and environmentally fraught. But with Niron’s approach of avoiding using rare earths entirely, the company claims it can deliver a cheaper, cleaner, and geopolitically safer magnet. “Western rare earth companies are playing the Chinese at the same game,” said Jonathan Rowntree, Niron’s chief executive. “We don’t need to bring a mine online.” John Ormerod, a rare earths consultant at JOC LLC, preached caution. “This is a holy grail kind of magnet, since iron and nitrogen are plentiful and low cost,” he said. “But we don’t have any data from Niron, which is frustrating and makes it impossible to make a hundred per cent accurate assessment.” Despite the unanswered questions, Niron has attracted heavyweight backing. In addition to Stellantis and GM, its investors include Volvo Cars, Samsung’s venture arm, and other major industrial players. The company has raised about $150M in private funding and secured significant government support in the form of a $52.2M tax credit earlier this year, along with $17.5M in grants from the Department of Energy’s research arm in 2022. Experts say financing is important for Niron as the company will eventually have to prove its technology in demanding fields such as electric vehicles, defense systems, and renewable energy. “The magnet market covers everything from consumer electronics to military hardware,” Milo McBride, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stated. “The smaller end consumer market will probably be first, but since the US has such a large magnet supply deficit, there’s no reason to not try.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|General Motors,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|RESEARCH|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 00:51:42

In the meantime attention is increasingly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi platform gaining steam with its real-world utility and early growth prospects. While SHIB is struggling with declining momentum, MUTM’s appeal is increasing as investors look for projects with improved fundamentals and long-term outlook, and hence it becomes a more strategic investment in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance is already at presale level 6 at $0.035 and 50% sold out. The protocol has already raised over $16.3 million from over 16,570 holders. Shiba Inu Tests Critical Support After Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) broke out of its downtrend line recently, rallying aggressively from around $0.00001. However, after this short-lived spike, momentum has started to fizzle out, and analysts now anticipate a potential correction to the $0.000011 support level before anything significant bullish can materialize. A minor pullback is already underway after SHIB fell below short-term support, with traders waiting to see if or when buying pressure returns over that crucial area. If support holds, there is always a possibility of a bounce back towards $0.000015, but the drop in upside potential is also why most investors are exploring alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is still at $0.035 with much greater growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has released Presale Stage Six with tokens priced at $0.035 after increasing by 16.17% from the previous round. Investors are famished, with more than 16,570 purchasers and more than $16.3 million of garnered capital. In its quest to offer the platform extra security, Mutuum Finance is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Bugs are distinguished as being categorized into four divisions, namely critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure that they are discovered and fixed to the best of their ability. The protocol is dependent upon close control of collateralized funds to safeguard the system and participants. Rules are implemented through certain collateral ratios, lending limits, and deposit limits. Undercollateral positions are liquidated very rapidly, and call penalty and remediation charges are imposed to encourage systemic stability. Constructing an Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved through optimizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially for overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements also serve as a shock-absorber for the market, and excess reserves are available to utilize in risk-absorbing activities using risky assets. Mutuum Finance’s overall goal is to reorient the DeFi construct on the pillars of long-term viability, reliability, and accessibility. The project not only provides a safe lending and borrowing facility but also marks a new era in decentralized finance being brought within the reach of retail and institutional investors. In an effort to encourage early adoption as well as community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway competition in which 10 winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This initiative is focused on the project’s commitment to empowering its backers while raising awareness and donating in the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping out as a stronger competitor whereas Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to retain principal support. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035 and are already 50% sold out, with the project raking more than $16.3 million from 16,570+ owners. Backed by a $50,000 bug bounty, tight collateral controls, and lending models refined, MUTM has true utility and scalability beyond meme coin mania. An added $100,000 community giveaway also encourages early participation.

52317580,590345,1758934831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52317580.jpeg,BlackRock Exec Pressed On XRP ETF: His Answer Raises More Questions,https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-exec-xrp-etf-answer-more-questions/,"BlackRock’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, was pressed on the prospect of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund during an interview with Nate Geraci on the “Crypto Prime” podcast. Will BlackRock Launch A Spot XRP ETF? While he offered no product reveal, he did spell out precisely how BlackRock is thinking about what could come next after its blockbuster Bitcoin and Ether launches. Geraci noted on air that he has “publicly predicted that BlackRock would file for a spot XRP ETF and a spot Solana ETF,” then asked how the firm evaluates “future product development around crypto-related ETFs.” Mitchnick declined to speak to any specific tickers but was explicit about the decision framework: “There’s a lot of factors that go into that decision-making process obviously, but the biggest driver ultimately is our clients… What is the level of investor demand? What is the logic and investment thesis for investors and for our clients around these potential products? What problem are we solving for them?” He added that BlackRock weighs “market cap, liquidity, [and] maturity,” along with “clarity of investment thesis and overall… portfolio considerations,” describing it as “a constant evaluation process,” not a single point in time.The exchange came amid a wide-ranging discussion of how quickly BlackRock’s crypto business has scaled and how starkly the firm differentiates Bitcoin from Ether in client portfolios. My conversation w/ BlackRock’s @robbiemitchnick … We discuss:-Massive success of IBIT & ETHA-Btc & eth in broader portfolio-Staking in spot eth ETFs-Generic listing standards-Crypto ETF development-Tokenization-Stablecoins https://t.co/54NgVDFpVJ via @CryptoPrimePod pic.twitter.com/N5H4EnI7Q7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 25, 2025 BlackRock Exec On Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum Geraci highlighted the growth figures—“[IBIT] launched in early January 2024. It’s over $85 billion in assets… [ETHA] launched in July… around $16 billion”—and asked whether Ethereum’s trajectory matched expectations after Bitcoin’s record start. Mitchnick pushed back on early narratives that Ether ETFs were a “bust” only because they were “being compared against the extraordinary record-setting numbers” of Bitcoin, pointing out that ETHA became “the third fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion.” Mitchnick drew a bright line between the two assets from a portfolio-construction perspective. Bitcoin, he said, functions for many allocators as “this sort of digital gold type instrument,” a “global scarce decentralized non-sovereign asset” with distinct risk and return drivers. Ethereum is “a more nuanced, more technical discussion,” effectively “a bet around blockchain adoption and digital assets more broadly,” with competitive dynamics and questions about “value capture in the Ether token versus the activity level on the Ethereum blockchain.” As a result, Bitcoin has seen “much greater penetration” among institutional and wealth advisory channels, while Ether ownership remains “overwhelmingly” in the direct investor segment. On the gating factors that could unlock the next wave of demand , Mitchnick said it is “still early days” for both institutions and wealth platforms in the United States. Many large firms allow execution-only access, but “the vast majority of advisers… still do not have the ability to make decisions on this on behalf of their clients.” He described “various stages of approving this” across the wirehouses, including one firm “starting to put it in model portfolios,” and noted that BlackRock’s own model-portfolio team “early in 2025… put IBIT allocations into one of our model portfolios.” For institutions, he argued that further episodes of Bitcoin “decoupling from equities in a… distressed market environment” would be “critical” in cementing its role as a diversifier. Asked about the SEC’s recent move to approve generic listing standards for commodity-based ETPs—the category that includes spot crypto ETFs—Mitchnick called it “a pragmatic step” that “streamlin[es] the process,” with clear, transparent standards that “support innovation.” Taken together, Mitchnick’s comments sketched the contours of BlackRock’s next steps without tipping its hand. On an XRP ETF, he didn’t confirm or deny anything—but he gave a clear readout of the bar any new product must clear: credible client demand, a defensible investment thesis, sufficient market depth and maturity, and a well-defined role in diversified portfolios.

52315497,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=827950,1758934838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52315497.jpeg,"Liquidity Wave Extends The Crypto Bull Run Into 2026, Predicts Raoul Pal",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/liquidity-wave-crypto-bull-run-2026-raoul-pal/,"Raoul Pal believes the crypto cycle is not nearing a peak but entering a longer, more powerful expansion that can run well into 2026, driven by a global liquidity uptrend tied to government debt dynamics. In a special Sept. 25 “Everything Code” masterclass with Global Macro Investor (GMI) head of macro research Julien Bittel, the Real Vision co-founder laid out a tightly interlocked framework connecting demographics, debt, liquidity and the business cycle to asset returns—arguing that crypto and tech remain the only asset classes structurally capable of outpacing what he calls the hidden debasement of fiat. Everything Code: Liquidity Is Crypto’s Master Switch “The biggest macro variable of all time,” Pal said, “is that global governments and central banks are increasing liquidity to manage debt at 8% a year.” He separated that ongoing debasement from measured inflation, warning investors to think in hurdle rates, not headlines: “You’ve got an 11% hurdle rate on any investment that you have. If your investments are not hitting 11% you are getting poorer.” Pal and Bittel’s “Everything Code” starts with trend GDP as the sum of population growth, productivity and debt growth. With working-age populations declining and productivity subdued, public debt has filled the gap—structurally lifting debt-to-GDP and hard-wiring the need for liquidity. “Demographics are destiny,” Pal said, pointing to a falling labor-force participation rate that, in GMI’s work, mirrors the inexorable rise in government debt as a share of GDP. The bridge between the two, they argue, is the liquidity toolkit—balance sheets, the Treasury General Account (TGA), reverse repos and banking-system channels—deployed in cycles to finance interest costs that the economy cannot organically bear. “If trend growth is ~2% and rates are 4%, that gap has to be monetized,” Pal said. “It’s a story as old as the hills.” Related Reading: All-Time Highs For Gold, S&P500; Crypto Stands Alone In The Red – What’s The Root Cause? Bittel then mapped what he called the “dominoes.” GMI’s Financial Conditions Index—an econometric blend of commodities, the dollar and rates—leads total liquidity by roughly three months; total liquidity leads the ISM manufacturing index by about six months; and the ISM, in turn, sets the tone for earnings, cyclicals and crypto beta. “Our job is to live in the future,” Bittel said. “Financial conditions lead the ISM by nine months. Liquidity leads by six. That sequence is what risk markets actually trade.” In that sequence, crypto is not an outlier but a high-beta macro asset. “Bitcoin is the ISM,” Bittel said, noting that the same diffusion-index dynamics that govern small-cap equities, cyclicals, crude and emerging markets also map onto BTC and ETH. As the cycle accelerates from sub-50 ISM toward the high-50s, risk appetite migrates down the curve: first from BTC into ETH, then into large alternative L1s and, only later, into smaller caps—coinciding with falling BTC dominance. Pal cautioned investors who expect “instant altseason” that they are fighting the phasing of the real economy: “It always goes into the next safest asset first… only when the ISM is really pushing higher and dominance is falling hard do you get the rest.” Part of the recent “sideways chop,” they argued, reflected a sharp TGA rebuild—an exogenous liquidity drain that disproportionately impacts the far end of the risk curve. Bittel highlighted that the $500 billion rate of change since mid-July effectively removed fuel that otherwise would have buoyed crypto prices, while stressing that the drain is nearing an inflection. He also flagged DeMark timing signals pointing to a reversal in the TGA’s contribution to net liquidity. “That should now reverse and work lower into year-end, which then will drive our liquidity composites higher,” he said, adding that the People’s Bank of China’s balance sheet at all-time highs has partially offset US drags. Against that backdrop, the pair contend that the forthcoming 12 months are critical. “We’ve got $9 trillion of debt to roll over the next 12 months,” Pal said. “This is the 12 months where maximum money printing comes.” Their base case has policy rates moving lower into a still-subdued but improving cycle, with central banks focused on lagging mandates—unemployment and core services inflation—while early-cycle inflation breadth remains contained. Bittel underscored the sequencing inside inflation itself: commodities first, then goods, with shelter disinflation mechanically lagging, giving central banks cover to cut even as growth accelerates. The implication for portfolio construction, Pal argued, is radical. “Diversification is dead. The best thing is hyper-concentration,” he said, framing the choice not as a taste for volatility but as arithmetic survival against debasement. In GMI’s long-horizon tables, most traditional assets underperform the combined debasement-plus-inflation hurdle, while the Nasdaq earns excess returns over liquidity and Bitcoin dwarfs both. “What is the point of owning any other asset?” Pal asked rhetorically. “This is the super-massive black hole of assets, which is why we personally are all-in on crypto… It’s the greatest macro trade of all time.” Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath Shakes Market—But Is The Real Storm Still To Come? Bittel overlaid Bitcoin’s log-regression channel—what Pal called the “network adoption rails”—on the ISM to illustrate how time and cycle amplitude interact. Because adoption drifts price targets higher through time, longer cycles mechanically point to higher potential outcomes. He showed illustrative channel levels tied to hypothetical ISM prints to explain the mechanism, from mid-$200Ks if the ISM rises into the low-50s to materially higher if the cycle extends toward the low-60s. The numbers were not presented as forecasts but as a map for how cycle strength translates into range-bound fair value bands. Macro Liquidity Extends The Crypto Bull Run Critically, Pal and Bittel argued the current cycle differs from 2020–2021, when both liquidity and the ISM peaked in March 2021, truncating the run. Today, they say, liquidity is re-accelerating into the debt-refinancing window and the ISM is still below 50 with forward indicators pointing up, setting up a 2017-style Q4 impulse with seasonal tailwinds—and, unlike 2017, a higher probability that strength spills into 2026 because the refinancing cycle itself has lengthened. “It is extremely unlikely that it tops this year,” Pal said. “The ISM just isn’t there, and global liquidity isn’t either.” The framework also locates crypto within a broader secular S-curve. Pal contrasted fiat debasement, which lifts asset prices, with GDP-anchored earnings and wages, which lag—explaining why traditional valuation optics look stretched and why owning long-duration, network-effect assets becomes existential. He placed crypto’s user growth at roughly double the internet’s at a comparable stage and argued that tokens uniquely allow investors to own the infrastructure layer of the next web. On total addressable value, he applied the same log-trend framing to the entire digital asset market, sketching a path from roughly $4 trillion today toward a potential $100 trillion by the early 2030s if the space tracks its “fair value” adoption channel, with Bitcoin ultimately occupying a role analogous to gold inside a much larger digital asset stack. Pal closed with operational advice consistent with a longer, liquidity-driven expansion: maintain exposure to proven, large-cap crypto networks, avoid leverage that forces capitulation during routine 20–30% drawdowns, and match time horizon to the macro clock rather than headlines. “We’re four percent of the way there,” he said. “Your job is to not mess this up.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.67 trillion.

This crucial shift has many investors wondering what this rise signifies for their portfolios and the broader market. Is a full-blown altcoin season just around the corner, or are there nuances we should understand? What is the Altcoin Season Index and How is it Calculated? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental to grasping current market dynamics. It’s a unique metric designed to gauge whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin. This index provides valuable insight into the health and sentiment of the broader crypto market beyond just Bitcoin’s movements. How it Works: The index meticulously compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. Defining “Altcoin Season”: An official “altcoin season” is declared when a significant majority—specifically, 75% of these top altcoins—outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day period. “Bitcoin Season”: Conversely, if Bitcoin largely outperforms the altcoins, it’s deemed a “Bitcoin season.” A reading closer to 100 on the index indicates a stronger, more pronounced altcoin season, suggesting broad market strength among alternative cryptocurrencies. Altcoin Season Index at 70: What Does This Crucial Rise Imply? The recent climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 70 is more than just a number; it’s a strong indicator of shifting investor sentiment and market momentum. While 70 isn’t yet the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season, it signals significant positive movement for many alternative cryptocurrencies. This upward trend often precedes more pronounced market shifts. Growing Outperformance: A reading of 70 suggests that a substantial number of altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin. This could mean increased investor confidence in specific projects or a broader rotation of capital from Bitcoin into altcoins. Anticipation Builds: The proximity to the 75% mark creates anticipation. Many market participants view a rising Altcoin Season Index as a precursor to more substantial gains across the altcoin market. Market Confidence: This uptick often reflects a general bullish sentiment beyond just Bitcoin, indicating that the broader crypto ecosystem is gaining strength and attracting new capital. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: Opportunities and Challenges As the Altcoin Season Index inches closer to its official threshold, both exciting opportunities and potential challenges emerge for investors. Understanding these aspects is crucial for making informed decisions and protecting your capital. Opportunities: Diversified Gains: Altcoin seasons often see various projects—from DeFi to NFTs and Layer-2 solutions—experience significant price surges, offering diverse investment opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. Higher Returns: Historically, altcoins can offer higher percentage returns than Bitcoin during these periods, albeit with increased risk due to their smaller market caps. Innovation Spotlight: A rising index brings attention to innovative projects and technologies within the crypto space, highlighting their potential to disrupt traditional industries. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. While gains can be substantial, so can potential losses, making risk management paramount. Research is Key: Not all altcoins will perform well. Thorough research into project fundamentals, team, and use case is essential to avoid purely speculative traps. Market Timing: Predicting the exact start and end of an altcoin season is notoriously difficult, requiring careful observation and a disciplined approach to investing. Preparing Your Portfolio for the Altcoin Season With the Altcoin Season Index indicating potential for further altcoin strength, now might be a good time to review your strategy. Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate these market shifts: Do Your Due Diligence: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Avoid purely speculative plays without understanding their underlying value or long-term viability. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your eggs in one altcoin basket, consider a diversified portfolio across different sectors (e.g., DeFi, gaming, infrastructure) to spread risk. Risk Management: Allocate only what you can afford to lose. Set clear profit targets and stop-loss orders to manage potential downside risks effectively. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and the Altcoin Season Index itself. Market conditions can change rapidly, and timely information is crucial. The crypto market is dynamic, and while the current index reading is encouraging, continuous vigilance and a well-thought-out strategy remain paramount for success. The recent ascent of the Altcoin Season Index to 70 is a powerful signal for the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a growing momentum for altcoins, potentially ushering in a period where these alternative assets shine. While not yet a definitive declaration of altcoin season, this crucial rise highlights the importance of understanding market cycles and preparing your investment strategy. By staying informed and exercising prudence, investors can navigate these exciting shifts and potentially capitalize on the evolving landscape of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

In her speech at the Coin Center event, Peirce made light of rumors of stepping down from her position, especially since her term at the SEC was officially terminated in June. However, according to the laws permitting SEC commissioners, a commissioner can continue performing his or her duties for 18 more months until the US Senate nominates someone new. Peirce’s speech shocks the crypto ecosystem as individuals respond with mixed reactions Concerning her speech, Peirce stated that several individuals had been asking her what was next. Based on her argument, she stated that she could have decided to leave the government and completely change her perspective on crypto , but that path was too common for her. According to the commissioner, her preferred occupation after stepping down from her position was to switch to beekeeping. In her explanation, apart from honey being tasty and healthy, the sting of a bee is less painful than that of her Twitter critics. After making these remarks, Peirce made it clear that this was all a joke when she added that: “For my life after stepping down from my position at the SEC, I must go to Plan C, or more specifically, Plan NFT My NFT collection will feature characters I have met in the crypto world, particularly at its often tricky crossroads with policy.” Peirce is one of the four commissioners and three Republicans in charge of the SEC. She has often proposed and supported policies that benefit the crypto and blockchain industry. In support of this claim, the commissioner had announced a new task force assigned the role of establishing a framework for digital assets immediately after the resignation of former Chair Gary Gensler in January. Her nickname, “Crypto Mom,” underscored the playful nature of her remarks. The NFT reference tied into her reputation in the industry, which spans relationships with crypto leaders, finance experts, regulators, and digital asset influencers. After the light banter, Peirce shifted focus to more serious matters, addressing the SEC’s direction going forward. In a statement, she mentioned that she regretted that during most of her time at the SEC, she failed to persuade her colleagues in government to give the agency a fair chance. She further stated that she hoped that the agency and those they had inspired would exploit the golden opportunity of this period, where clear rules have replaced confusion as the aim of the government, to establish favourable outcomes that will enhance the happiness, safety, security, and prosperity of your family, friends, neighbors, and country. Analysts anticipate clearer crypto regulations amid the SEC’s current direction Sources familiar with the situation revealed that Peirce’s remarks were not new. According to the sources, since Gensler stepped down, several individuals in the crypto industry have criticized his actions of pushing forth a “regulation by enforcement” approach. The sources also highlighted that the SEC has recently made important changes in digital asset management. Their analysis indicates that the agency began by taking some lengthy legal actions against crypto firms to court. In addition, they are working on policies that crypto experts believe will pave the way for the approval of several exchange-traded funds. This has led several analysts to conclude that the SEC’s current direction is to support the industry by loosening regulatory rules.

Reports suggest Kulechov transferred 4 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $2.38 million, to Galaxy Digital. This significant transaction, first highlighted by AmberCN, stems from tokens claimed from a vesting wallet, sparking considerable discussion across the digital asset community. What’s Behind This Aave Founder ENA Sale? According to the report, Stani Kulechov, a known investor in Ethena (ENA), claimed a substantial amount of ENA tokens from a vesting wallet. Following this claim, the tokens were reportedly transferred to Galaxy Digital. This move represents a notable transaction by a prominent figure in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Understanding the context is key. Kulechov’s involvement with Ethena as an investor suggests a belief in the project’s potential. However, large token transfers by founders often draw scrutiny and raise questions about market sentiment and future project direction. Understanding Ethena (ENA) and Vesting Schedules Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol that offers a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin called USDe. It aims to provide a stable, scalable digital asset solution, independent of traditional banking systems. ENA is Ethena’s governance token, playing a crucial role in the protocol’s decentralized decision-making. Vesting schedules are common in the crypto industry. They are designed to prevent founders and early investors from dumping large amounts of tokens onto the market immediately after launch. Tokens are released gradually over time, aligning the interests of the team with the long-term success of the project. The recent Aave founder ENA sale highlights the eventual unlocking and potential distribution of these vested assets. What Does This Aave Founder ENA Sale Mean for the Market? A transaction of this magnitude by a well-known figure like Stani Kulechov can have several implications. Firstly, it draws attention to ENA and Ethena, potentially increasing trading volume and public discourse around the project. Secondly, large sales, especially by insiders, can sometimes lead to market speculation about the asset’s short-term price action. It’s important for investors to consider that such transfers are often part of a founder’s financial planning or portfolio diversification strategies. They don’t necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the project, but rather a liquidity event from a vested asset. However, market participants will undoubtedly be watching ENA’s performance closely. Navigating Transparency in Crypto Transactions The transparency inherent in blockchain technology allows for the tracking of such transactions. While the specific reasons behind Kulechov’s transfer are not publicly detailed, the ability for platforms like AmberCN to report on them underscores the open nature of the crypto ledger. This transparency is a double-edged sword: it offers accountability but also opens the door for intense market reaction to insider movements. The crypto community often debates the balance between privacy and transparency, especially concerning the actions of influential figures. The reported Aave founder ENA sale by Stani Kulechov is a significant event that highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market. It underscores the financial activities of prominent figures within the space and the mechanisms of token vesting and distribution. While the implications are still unfolding, it serves as a reminder for investors to stay informed about market movements and the actions of key stakeholders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Stani Kulechov? A: Stani Kulechov is the founder of Aave, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is ENA? A: ENA is the governance token for Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol that provides USDe, a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin. Q3: What does ‘vesting wallet’ mean? A: A vesting wallet holds tokens that are gradually released to founders, team members, or early investors over a predetermined period, rather than all at once. This mechanism encourages long-term commitment to the project. Q4: Is this Aave founder ENA sale a bearish signal for ENA? A: Not necessarily. While large sales can create short-term price pressure, they can also be part of a founder’s personal financial management or portfolio diversification strategy. Investors should consider the broader market context and Ethena’s fundamentals. Q5: How does this transaction affect Aave? A: This transaction primarily involves ENA tokens, not AAVE tokens. While Stani Kulechov is the founder of Aave, this specific sale does not directly impact Aave’s protocol operations or its native AAVE token. Q6: Where can I track such crypto transactions? A: Many blockchain explorers (like Etherscan) allow you to track public wallet addresses. Additionally, crypto analytics firms and news outlets often report on significant on-chain movements.

A significant event has unfolded in the Astar ecosystem, drawing attention to an Astar whale who now commands a staggering $126 million in ASTER tokens. This substantial accumulation, steadily withdrawn from the Gate.io exchange, highlights a major investor’s conviction in the Astar Network’s future. According to reports from AmberCN, this particular investor has been consistently moving ASTER tokens off the exchange. Just recently, an additional 6.34 million ASTER, valued at approximately $12.94 million, was transferred, pushing their total holdings to an impressive 61.34 million ASTER. Unpacking the Astar Whale Phenomenon In the world of cryptocurrency, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular digital asset. The actions of such large holders, like this prominent Astar whale , can often influence market sentiment and even price movements due to the sheer volume of their holdings. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking the crypto landscape. When a whale accumulates assets, it often signals a long-term bullish outlook, as they are taking tokens out of circulation on exchanges and holding them. What is ASTER? ASTER is the native token of the Astar Network, a dApp hub on Polkadot that supports EVM and WebAssembly. Why is accumulation significant? It suggests strong belief in the project’s fundamentals and future growth potential. The Strategic Accumulation of ASTER by an Astar Whale The methodical nature of these withdrawals from Gate.io over several days suggests a calculated strategy rather than a sudden impulsive move. This Astar whale is not just buying, but actively securing their assets off-exchange, which is a common practice for long-term investors. This steady accumulation reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Moreover, it signifies a deep conviction in the Astar Network’s technology and its role in the broader Web3 ecosystem. Such sustained activity by a major holder often prompts other investors to pay closer attention to the asset. It can create a ripple effect, boosting confidence across the community. What This Astar Whale’s Dominance Means for ASTER The accumulation of $126 million by a single Astar whale is not just a statistic; it carries potential implications for the ASTER market. While it doesn’t guarantee future price action, it certainly adds an interesting dynamic. A large holding can influence liquidity and market depth. If the whale decides to sell, it could create significant downward pressure. However, sustained holding suggests the opposite: a belief in future appreciation. The community often views such large investments as a vote of confidence. This can attract new investors and further strengthen the network’s ecosystem. Potential Positive Impact: Increased market confidence, reduced selling pressure on exchanges. Potential Considerations: Future whale selling could impact prices, but currently, it signals bullish sentiment. Key Takeaways from the Astar Whale’s Bold Move The actions of this particular Astar whale offer valuable insights into the behavior of significant market players. For investors, monitoring such movements can be a part of a comprehensive market analysis strategy, though it should never be the sole basis for investment decisions. It underscores the importance of fundamental analysis and understanding the long-term vision of projects like Astar Network. While whales can move markets, the underlying technology and adoption are what truly drive sustainable growth. This unprecedented accumulation by an Astar whale serves as a powerful reminder of the conviction some major players have in the future of specific blockchain projects. As the Astar Network continues to develop its decentralized applications and expand its ecosystem, the movements of its largest holders will undoubtedly remain a focal point for the crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Astar whale in cryptocurrency? A: An Astar whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of ASTER tokens, typically enough to potentially influence the market price or liquidity of the asset. Q2: Why is it significant when an Astar whale accumulates tokens? A: Accumulation by a whale often signals strong confidence in the project’s long-term prospects. It removes tokens from exchange supply, which can reduce immediate selling pressure and indicate a bullish outlook. Q3: What is the Astar Network? A: The Astar Network is a dApp hub on Polkadot that supports multiple virtual machines (EVM and WebAssembly), aiming to be a multi-chain smart contract platform that connects to various Layer 1 blockchains. Q4: How does a whale’s activity affect the market? A: A whale’s large transactions can impact market sentiment, price, and liquidity. Accumulation can be seen as bullish, while large selling could lead to price drops. However, their actions are just one factor among many. Q5: Should I base my investment decisions on whale movements? A: While tracking whale movements can offer insights, it’s not advisable to base investment decisions solely on them. Always conduct thorough research, including fundamental and technical analysis, and consider your own risk tolerance. Did you find this analysis of the Astar whale’s massive accumulation insightful?

The letter, sent to the State Department, Commerce Department, and the Department of Ethics, names two senior figures — David Sacks and Steve Witkoff — and presses for quick answers about their roles. Senators Call For Investigation The senators say Sacks, who advises on AI and crypto, and Witkoff, a special envoy to the Middle East, were involved in a complex deal that connected Abu Dhabi’s MGX, Binance, and a stablecoin called USD1. Reports indicate the deal was first announced in March and was detailed again in a September New York Times piece. According to the senators, the arrangement was not a simple investment but part of a set of actions that could have opened doors for foreign access to US AI systems. Details Of The Transaction At the center is USD1, a token issued by World Liberty Financial, a company tied to the president’s family. Based on reports, MGX moved money in a transaction valued at $2 billion that involved Binance and the USD1 token as part of the settlement. Lawmakers want to know who negotiated which terms, and whether any official acts or policy pushes were influenced by private gain tied to that token. National Security Concerns Raised Warren and Slotkin argue the case raises serious national security questions. They wrote that certain officials appear to have pushed for policy changes that would make advanced US AI technology more accessible to the UAE. The senators warned that “no place in the US government” should be found for mixing official duties with private business interests. They also said that until answers arrive, Congress should be wary of any rules that could benefit politically connected crypto players. Lawmakers Push Back On Industry-Authored Bills Senator Warren has said she supports clearer rules for digital assets but will oppose measures “written by the crypto industry.” Slotkin echoed that view, urging clarity before moving on market reforms and stressing that lawmakers must be sure crypto money is not shaping national security choices. The House passed its version of a digital asset bill, the CLARITY Act , which drew 78 Democratic votes. Yet the Senate measure, championed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, has stalled and faces a slow path forward.

Crypto Liquidations Have Neared $1 Billion Over The Last 24 Hours According to data from CoinGlass, a massive amount of liquidations have occurred in the cryptocurrency derivatives market during the past day. A “liquidation” occurs when an open contract exceeds a certain loss threshold defined by the exchange and undergoes forceful closure. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Triangle Setup Points To $100, Says Analyst Due to the volatility that Bitcoin and other assets have experienced over the last 24 hours, a huge amount of contracts have crossed this threshold. Below is a table that breaks down the relevant numbers related to these liquidations. As is visible, cryptocurrency liquidations have totaled at $967 million inside this window, which is a pretty significant amount. Since the price action in the past day has majorly been in the bearish direction, the positions most affected would be the bullish bets. And indeed, as the data shows, $849 million of the liquidations, representing almost 88% of the total, involved long investors. Ethereum has recently been dominating speculative activity in the market, and it seems the asset has topped the charts during this derivatives flush as well, with $309 million in liquidations. Bitcoin has come second with around $246 million. A mass liquidation event like this latest one isn’t a rare occurrence in the cryptocurrency sector, mainly due to two reasons: coins can be volatile on the regular and extreme amounts of leverage can be easily accessible. Such an event, where a cascade of liquidations occurs, is known as a squeeze. As longs were the party most seriously affected in the latest squeeze, the event would be termed as a long squeeze. This is the second long squeeze that the market has suffered this week, with the other one arriving during Bitcoin’s Monday plummet to $112,000. Here is a chart shared by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode that shows how the previous long squeeze compared against this latest one for Bitcoin: According to Glassnode, the two large long squeezes could actually help prevent more such events in the near future. “This flush of leverage reflects a broad deleveraging event, often resetting market positioning and easing the risk of further cascades,” explains the analytics firm.

52317607,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84509,1758938457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin Price: Why October Is the Make-or-Break Moment Traders Fear,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-price-why-october-is-the-make-or-break-moment-traders/,"October has a unique place in Bitcoin’s history. Known among traders as “Uptober” for its tendency to produce rallies, the month has also delivered sharp corrections when expectations ran too high. As 2025 enters its final quarter, the stakes are higher than ever. Bitcoin is hovering near critical technical levels, and liquidity conditions are shifting rapidly as global markets recalibrate to central bank policy and institutional positioning. Over the past week, Bitcoin has traded within a narrow band, consolidating after a volatile 22 September that saw more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions liquidated across major exchanges. Such resets often define the setup for the following month. Analysts point out that October’s performance frequently sets the tone for year-end rallies or corrections. If Bitcoin manages to break higher, it could pull the entire market with it. If it falters, the rest of the sector may struggle to find footing. Against this backdrop, investors are also eyeing opportunities in emerging tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is beginning to attract serious attention alongside the majors. Technical pressure points From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is battling resistance near $116,000. Multiple attempts to breach this level have been rejected, but each pullback has found support above $110,000. Traders view this tightening range as a coiled spring. A decisive breakout above resistance could trigger momentum toward $125,000 or even $130,000, levels that align with long-term Fibonacci extensions. Conversely, a breakdown below $110,000 might open the door to a retest of $100,000, a psychological level that many see as the ultimate line in the sand for bullish narratives. Volume trends are critical here. On-chain data shows that exchange reserves continue to decline, indicating that long-term holders are withdrawing coins and reducing sell pressure. At the same time, derivatives markets are displaying cautious optimism, with funding rates stabilizing after September’s washout. Together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin is preparing for a major move, one that October will likely decide. MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the spotlight October has historically marked turning points for Bitcoin, with volatility often setting the stage for altcoin rotation. Traders watching this month’s charts are already scouting presales that could ride the same macro wave. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the leading candidates. With over $14 million raised and rapidly climbing stage prices, some investors are eyeing returns in the 200%–400% range as early as its first exchange listings. Over the past 72 hours, its website traffic spiked sharply, suggesting growing retail inflows even as Bitcoin faces resistance. Analysts warn that while BTC’s October could be pivotal, presale tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide diversification into asymmetric ROI opportunities. The fact that the project continues to post new milestones, from social growth to round closures, reinforces the view that it may deliver compelling returns, particularly if Bitcoin stumbles and capital rotates down the risk curve. Macro environment and institutional flows Macro conditions add another layer of complexity. The Federal Reserve’s latest policy shift has reignited risk-on appetite, with traders now expecting further rate cuts by year-end. Historically, looser monetary conditions have boosted Bitcoin and other digital assets, as capital searches for higher returns. Yet the global picture remains mixed. Equity markets are at record highs, and bond yields are drifting lower, but geopolitical risks and slowing growth in major economies create headwinds. Institutional flows continue to play an outsized role. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have seen steady inflows, with BlackRock and Fidelity’s products leading the pack. These funds provide a new baseline of demand that did not exist in previous cycles. However, ETF inflows alone cannot drive prices indefinitely; traders caution that organic retail participation must also return. October, historically a month of renewed retail enthusiasm, could be the moment when both institutional and retail demand converge. Interplay between majors and presales The relationship between Bitcoin and new entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE illustrates a broader market dynamic. When Bitcoin consolidates or struggles with resistance, speculative capital often seeks opportunities in presales and small-cap tokens. This rotation is not random; it reflects the natural desire of investors to balance security with upside. If October proves to be choppy for Bitcoin, presales could see heightened activity as traders look for faster-moving plays. At the same time, a breakout in Bitcoin would likely create a rising-tide effect, lifting sentiment across the board. In such a scenario, MAGACOIN FINANCE could benefit from spillover enthusiasm, gaining visibility as retail investors broaden their search for high-upside opportunities. This dual-path potential is what makes the project so appealing to forward-thinking investors, it doesn’t rely solely on Bitcoin’s performance to thrive. Why October matters more than ever The reason October looms so large in traders’ minds is its tendency to act as a pivot point. In 2017, October’s rally set the stage for the blow-off top in December. In 2021, October delivered gains that were quickly erased by November’s correction, highlighting how quickly sentiment can flip. With ETFs now in play, institutional demand more established, and presales gaining unprecedented traction, October 2025 carries even greater significance. This convergence of technical, macro, and speculative forces means the market could experience sharp moves in either direction. For cautious investors, October offers a chance to evaluate risk management strategies. For aggressive investors, it provides a window to position for potential breakout gains. Either way, the decisions made in this month will likely reverberate through the remainder of the year and beyond. Conclusion October has always been a month of decision for Bitcoin, and 2025 is shaping up to be no different. Resistance levels, macro conditions, and institutional flows are aligning to make the coming weeks critical for defining the market’s next phase. While Bitcoin holds the key to broader sentiment, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are carving their own path, offering investors a shot at exponential upside alongside the majors. Smart investors recognize that the playbook for success is not choosing between one or the other but balancing exposure across both. With Bitcoin preparing for a potential breakout and MAGACOIN FINANCE building momentum from its presale success, October may well become the month that separates cautious observers from those who capture the full scope of opportunity in crypto’s evolving cycle.

The token hovered around the $2.75 support level on Friday, but analysts warned that sustained selling could push prices down toward the $2.65 to $2.45 range. Such a move would represent an 8% to 10% decline, coinciding with a daily fair value gap (FVG) overlapping the 0.50–0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. This area could act as a liquidity magnet while offering a potential springboard for a bullish recovery. Onchain Data Signals Strong Buyer Interest Onchain metrics support the view that XRP may be approaching an important liquidity pocket. Glassnode’s Unrealized Price Distribution (URPD) showed a dense cluster of buyers between $2.45 and $2.55, indicating a strong cost basis for many holders. If price returns to this range, buyers may defend it aggressively, potentially laying the groundwork for a rebound. The altcoin’s current behavior mirrors its fractal pattern from the first quarter. XRP has already tested the $2.65 mark twice, but historical price structures suggest a sweep below this level into the liquid-heavy FVG could occur before a sustainable rally emerges. Repeating Patterns Could Lead to Volatility Market watchers have noted similarities between today’s setup and earlier fractals. Previous patterns showed weakness heading into the weekend, followed by an FVG sweep early the following week. If this plays out again, XRP could revisit the $2.50 zone as soon as Monday. However, analysts caution that historical fractals do not guarantee a repeat performance. A decisive break above $2.90 could invalidate the bearish structure altogether, but current momentum still favors one last dip into the $2.50 area. Compression and ETF News Fuel Uncertainty Sistine Research observed that XRP may be entering a significant expansion phase in the coming months. The analysis highlighted how XRP’s tight price action over the past 10 weeks has compressed its order book, leaving larger gaps between levels. This marks the third compression phase since the US elections in November 2024 and the tightest so far, built on three consecutively higher price points. Such conditions have historically preceded sharp breakouts as built-up liquidity is released. Crypto analyst Pelin Ay pointed to spot market flows as evidence of the battle between buyers and sellers. The 90-day spot taker CVD indicates that sellers remain in control despite brief bursts of buyer strength earlier in 2025. A sustained upside move will require a decisive shift in volume from buyers, which has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, ETF news adds another layer of uncertainty. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF decision has been postponed until Nov. 14, while REX/Osprey’s XRPR product debuted with nearly $38 million in first-day volume. Analysts warn that optimism may already be priced in, heightening the risk of a “sell the news” reaction when decisions are finalized.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-27 02:23:44

Recently, a notable trend has emerged concerning Spot ETH ETFs , signaling a period of caution for many. These investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset, have seen a significant withdrawal of funds. Understanding the Alarming Spot ETH ETFs Outflows On September 26, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs recorded a substantial net outflow of $243 million. This marks the fifth consecutive trading day where more money has left these funds than entered, according to data compiled by TraderT. Such a sustained trend can indicate shifting investor sentiment or broader market pressures. While the overall picture shows outflows, it’s important to look at the nuances. Not all Spot ETH ETFs experienced the same fate. For instance: Ark 21Shares’ TETH saw a net inflow of $8.05 million. Grayscale’s ETHE also recorded a net inflow, totaling $17.91 million. However, these positive movements were overshadowed by much larger withdrawals from other major players: BlackRock’s ETHA experienced a significant net outflow of $195 million. Fidelity’s FETH followed suit with a net outflow of $74.39 million. This disparity suggests that while some funds are attracting capital, others are facing considerable redemption pressures. The concentration of outflows from key funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH is particularly noteworthy, as these are often seen as bellwethers for institutional interest. What Drives Such Significant Spot ETH ETFs Movement? Several factors could contribute to such pronounced movements in Spot ETH ETFs . Market sentiment, often influenced by broader economic conditions or regulatory news, plays a crucial role. When investors perceive increased risk or uncertainty in the wider financial markets, they may opt to withdraw funds from more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the price performance of Ethereum itself can directly impact investor behavior. A period of stagnant or declining ETH prices might prompt investors to re-evaluate their positions in related ETF products. It’s also possible that investors are rebalancing their portfolios, moving capital from one asset class to another in response to changing investment strategies or opportunities. Another potential factor could be profit-taking. If investors had previously entered these Spot ETH ETFs at lower prices, the current outflows could represent a strategic move to lock in gains. Conversely, some investors might be cutting losses if they entered the market at higher price points and are reacting to recent market dips. Navigating the Future of Spot ETH ETFs: Challenges and Insights The consistent net outflows present a challenge for the burgeoning Spot ETH ETFs market. While the approval of these ETFs was a significant milestone for institutional adoption, sustained withdrawals could temper enthusiasm and potentially impact future product development or market liquidity. However, it’s also important to view these movements in context. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and periods of outflows can be followed by periods of strong inflows. For investors, these trends highlight the importance of staying informed and understanding the underlying dynamics of their investments. It’s crucial to look beyond daily fluctuations and consider the long-term potential of Ethereum and the broader crypto ecosystem. The inflows into Ark 21Shares’ TETH and Grayscale’s ETHE, though smaller, indicate that some investors still see value and opportunity in the asset. Key Takeaways for Investors: Monitor Fund-Specific Data: Not all ETFs perform identically. Consider Broader Market Trends: Macroeconomic factors can influence crypto performance. Long-Term Perspective: Volatility is inherent in crypto markets; focus on long-term goals. In conclusion, the recent $243 million net outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs over five consecutive days is a significant event. While specific funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH bore the brunt of these withdrawals, others like Ark 21Shares’ TETH and Grayscale’s ETHE saw modest inflows. This mixed picture underscores the complex nature of investor sentiment and market dynamics within the cryptocurrency space. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these trends will be vital for anyone involved with Ethereum-related investment products. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Spot ETH ETFs? Spot ETH ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are Spot ETH ETFs experiencing outflows? Outflows can be driven by various factors, including shifting investor sentiment due to broader economic conditions, regulatory uncertainty, profit-taking by early investors, or a general decline in Ethereum’s price. Large withdrawals from specific funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH contributed significantly to the recent net outflows. Do these outflows mean institutional interest in Ethereum is waning? Not necessarily. While significant, the outflows could be part of a normal market cycle, including portfolio rebalancing or short-term reactions to market volatility. The fact that some funds like Ark 21Shares’ TETH and Grayscale’s ETHE still saw inflows suggests continued, albeit selective, institutional interest. How do Spot ETH ETFs differ from other Ethereum investment products? Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of Ethereum futures contracts, Spot ETH ETFs directly hold Ethereum. This often appeals to investors seeking more direct exposure to the asset’s current market price. Other products might include direct ETH purchases or trust funds, each with different structures and fee implications. What should investors do in response to these Spot ETH ETFs trends? Investors should conduct their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and consult with a financial advisor. It’s advisable to monitor market trends, understand the specific performance of their chosen ETFs, and maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting impulsively to short-term fluctuations.

Purchases by publicly traded digital-asset treasuries have plummeted dramatically, from 64,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in July to just 12,600 in August, with September’s figures currently at around 15,500. This drop represents a major 76% decrease from the fervor of early summer. Crypto Treasury Firms Valuation Sinks The broader cryptocurrency market has faced additional challenges, with Bitcoin experiencing nearly a 6% decline over the past week, exacerbated by a broader selloff characterized by sudden liquidations. Shares in some treasuries that previously raised capital through PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) deals have seen valuations plummet, with some trading down as much as 97% below their initial issuance prices. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) On The Brink Of A Major Breakout: 800% Rally In Sight One of the reasons behind this shift is regulatory scrutiny, with reports indicating that US authorities are now investigating “unusual trading activity” within digital-asset treasury shares ahead of their acquisitions. Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, alleges that there is limited transparency regarding the crypto acquisition prices of the underlying tokens and the actual share counts, particularly since many PIPE deals include warrants that complicate matters with their volatility and dilution effects. The valuations of some treasury firms, which once enjoyed high market premiums, have drastically declined, with their market value approaching the actual Bitcoin they hold. This shift is measured by the market-cap-to-NAV (net asset value) multiple, which now reflects a concerning trend: the disconnect between stock prices and the value of Bitcoin reserves is closing. Diminished Institutional Support As corporate buyers retreat, Bloomberg asserts that the crypto market is experiencing a “feedback loop” that diminishes institutional support. The report alleges that this absence of a stable capital source undermines demand, leading to a more precarious market environment. The current landscape has given rise to a “two-speed market.” On one hand, derivative markets exhibit significant stress, with demand for longer-dated futures collapsing and $275 million worth of Bitcoin longs liquidated in just 24 hours. Related Reading: Expert Prediction: Bitcoin Price Could Hit $200,000 By June 2026, Claiming 50% Probability Conversely, crypto-related products continue to attract investment, as evidenced by the iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), which garnered $2.5 billion in inflows in September, a substantial increase from $707 million the previous month. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, emphasized that the current weakness in the crypto market is likely a consequence of diminished activity from digital asset treasuries rather than a direct cause of selling pressure. The reduction of these major buyers, he contends, has created a more cautious market environment.

52319692,590774,1758942009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52319692.jpeg,DeFi Community On Alert Following Hypervault’s $3.6 Million Suspected Rug Pull,https://bitcoinist.com/defi-alert-hypervaults-3-6-million-rug-pull/,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol HyperVault is suspected to have executed a “rug pull,” as on-chain analytics account PeckShield noted an abnormal outflow of funds from the protocol, worth close to $3.6 million. DeFi Protocol HyperVault Pulls The Rug According to an X post by on-chain analytics account PeckShield, Hyperliquid-based DeFi protocol HyperVault appears to have pulled a quick one on its users, defrauding them of funds worth almost $3.6 million. PeckShield noted that the stolen funds were bridged from Hyperliquid to Ethereum, swapped into ETH, and then 752 ETH were deposited into Tornado Cash. For the uninitiated, Tornado Cash is a popular crypto mixer that is typically used by hackers to erase their on-chain trail. Notably, UPUMP tokens worth $191,494, USDC worth $107,358, WHYPE worth $1.55 million, and several other tokens were stolen from HyperVault. PeckShield noted that HyperVault have also deactivated all their socials – including the X handle – virtually confirming the rug pull. To explain, a rug pull is a type of crypto scam where developers suddenly abandon a project and drain its funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. It’s common in DeFi and NFT spaces, where anonymity and lack of regulation make quick exits easier. HyperVault offered “unmanaged” auto-compounding vaults, strategy adapters, and keeper-bot harvests. These features helped users route their digital assets to lending, looping, and concentrated liquidity venues on HyperEVM. Another X user HypingBull, commented , saying that they had been warning about HyperVault since September 4. In an X post, the user stated that the protocol’s developers lied to them about audits, adding: I have just reached Pashov (blockchain audit firm) on Telegram, asking if Hypervaut is doing an audit via them. The answer was: “First time I hear the project with this name”. WTF? This is super suspicious. I am withdrawing all the funds from the protocol until the team clarifies what’s going on. Unfortunately, users continued to deposit funds into the DeFi protocol, lured by the protocol’s promised 90% APR yields on HYPE tokens. However, the extraordinarily high-yield promises at the time did not raise the alarm among users. That said, the HYPE token appears to be minimally impacted by this suspected rug pull, as it is trading at $42.89 at the time of writing, up 2.8% on the day. However, the token is down almost 25% over the past week. Crypto Still The Wild West? While the total crypto market cap now hovers over $3.8 trillion, the safety of users continues to be a major factor hindering the industry from mainstream adoption. For example, crypto phishing attacks recorded a significant surge in August 2025, impacting as many as 15,230 victims, resulting in a loss of $12 million in user funds. Similarly, the THORChain Founder lost $1.35 million earlier this month after a deepfake Zoom and Telegram scam. At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $109,488, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.",DeFi|Altcoin|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Ethereum|hype|HyperVault|rug pull|scam|Tornado Cash,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 03:00:09

CRCL's regulatory leadership, rapid USDC circulation growth, and Binance partnership position it to gain market share despite interest rate headwinds. Falling interest rates pressure CRCL's interest income, but robust USDC growth and new revenue streams like the Arc blockchain offset this risk. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expanding, and with stable costs and strong tailwinds from the GENIUS Act, CRCL offers a compelling rebound opportunity. As the stock market falls from recent highs, one thought pervades my opportunistic mindset: which stocks, particularly momentum and growth stocks, have fallen sharper than their fundamentals might justify? What rebound opportunities exist in the crash? While in general I regard most crypto and blockchain highfliers with skepticism, Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) caught my eye recently. The sponsor behind the number-two stablecoin, USDC, has now fallen well below its original $130 IPO price; despite one point reaching above $200 per share. As the stock recedes, the core question on investors’ minds is: can Circle pull off a rebound? Data by YCharts I’m initiating Circle at a buy rating. To address the elephant in the room: the core reason Circle has been falling recently is mostly the same reason other stocks are rising: lower interest rate expectations. Since this hurts Circle’s principal source of revenue (interest income), investors are rightly nervous. And yet I also think the sheer growth of USDC can’t be ignored. Use this dip as a buying opportunity. The U.S. leader in regulated stablecoins First, let’s start with what exactly Circle does. Circle is the sponsor behind one of the largest and best known stablecoins, USDC. For those new to the term, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of an underlying asset: in this case, 1:1 against the U.S. dollar. One of the best ways to think about stablecoins is fulfilling the original promise of crypto: by acting as an efficient means of exchange on the internet, minus the volatility and price fluctuation that has accompanied the speculative activity of other coins. Since there is no scarcity (like Bitcoin) and each USDC is backed by a real U.S. dollar held in reserve, the price does not move. Stablecoin share overview (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) It’s probably not necessary to state that the stablecoin market is growing rapidly. As of the end of Q2, Circle noted that the market cap of stablecoins in circulation grew at a stunning 50% y/y clip to $223 billion. Transactions, meanwhile, grew at an even faster 75% y/y clip as more applications and merchants leverage blockchain technology to process payments. Stablecoins recently grew to more than 1% of U.S. M2 money supply. The stablecoin industry as a whole saw a massive leap in adoption when the GENIUS Act was passed earlier this year by President Trump. GENIUS provided the first regulatory framework for oversight of stablecoins, including auditing reserve balances. Rather than strangle the industry with regulations, this was broadly seen as a positive for mainstream adoption. USDC is only the second largest coin: USDT, or Tether, predates USDC and is roughly 2x larger. And yet regulation is the number one differentiator for USDC. Circle has taken a compliance first attitude toward USDC, while Tether, which is sponsored by a company domiciled in the British Virgin Islands, is less subject to regulation. USDC vs. USDT (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) To me, and to many market observers, the regulatory safety net underpinning USDC is a major reason why Circle is poised to gain market share. The chart below showcases that USDC's share of crypto trading volumes has grown to 10%, up from just 1% in the year-ago quarter. This is just a beginning indication of the potential that USDC has to grow. Key to USDC's market share expansion is a partnership with Binance , which is the largest crypto trading platform in the world. Since December 2024, Binance has made USDC more broadly available to its 240 million global customers. Since the partnership kicked off, USDC has also grown as a share of assets held in custody by Binance, as shown in the chart below: USDC growth (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) Interest income: at risk as rates fall, but circulation growth should offset Now let's turn our attention to the number-one factor that is pushing Circle stock down. Circle generates the lion's share of its revenue from interest held on the cash and short-term securities that back its issuance of USDC. As shown in the chart below, reserve returns have been falling alongside interest rate declines: in Q2, reserve returns of 4.14% (roughly matching current yields on U.S. short term treasury bonds, as measured by the SHV ETF ( SHV )) fell -103 bps y/y. Circle reserve return rate (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) After the close of the quarter, the Fed cut rates by a quarter point, and is expecting two further cuts by year-end. Current estimates are placing rate-cut odds for only one further cut in 2026. So all else equal, rates could fall by 100 bps relative to current levels, which would cut out ~25% of Circle's revenue stream. Note as well that Circle still pays out a large portion of this revenue as ""distribution fees"" to its large crypto wallet partners, namely Coinbase and Binance. As rates have fallen and as Circle has focused on growth, its RLDC margin (revenue less distribution cost) has also dwindled somewhat to 38%, meaning that Circle only generates 38% of clean net revenue for each dollar it earns in interest income. Circle RLDC margin (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) While I agree that interest rate declines are a headwind for Circle, there are two reasons that I think the company will still be able to pull ahead: Circulation growth is far outpacing expected interest rate declines. As I previously mentioned, a ~100 bps fall in interest rates will hurt interest revenue by ~25%, relative to the company's current ~4% reserve return rate. But at the same time, USDC circulation grew at 90% y/y in the most recent quarter. I also think that the recent risk-off attitude in the stock market and the selloff in momentum stocks will push more investors to increase their allocation to cash - and USDC is now a core alternative for cash holdings. Coinbase currently pays a 4.1% yield on USDC held on its platform. All in all, Circle is still well poised for revenue growth as stablecoin participation and usage itself grows, and as Circle's own market share expands. Alternative revenue streams. Circle recently released the Arc blockchain, which is its own payment protocol that is natively designed to support USDC transactions (as an alternative to using USDC on other blockchains, such as Ethereum). Circle can earn ""gas"" fees from transactions on the Arc network, which is a revenue stream that didn't exist entirely in 2024. While it's still early days and we have yet to see how wide of an adoption that Arc can achieve, this initiative helps to boost Circle's horizon beyond earning just interest alone. Healthy adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and reasonable valuation We also think that amid top-line concerns, Circle's growing profitability shouldn't be ignored. In Q2, Circle grew adjusted EBITDA at a 52% y/y pace (again, this is in spite of a 103bps y/y decline in reserve return rates) to $126 million, representing a 50% margin against revenue less distribution and transaction costs (the 38% RLDC margin we discussed earlier). This improved 5 points y/y. Circle adjusted EBITDA (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) Circle is guiding to $475-$490 million in full-year adjusted opex (excluding stock comp), which implies quarterly opex holding stable at ~$125 million per quarter through the balance of the year. Circle outlook (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) The company has also guided to a 40% CAGR in USDC circulation (which should more than offset interest rate pressure), growth in ""other revenue"" including the new Arc blockchain initiative, and RLDC margins stabilizing in the 36-38% range. To me, this is a powerful combination for further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. At face value, Circle looks expensive at a 58x forward adjusted EBITDA that sits slightly above 2x of Coinbase's valuation. Data by YCharts But the reason I think Circle's valuation is quite reasonable is because of its rapid pace of current adjusted EBITDA expansion (with all the factors necessary for continued growth still in place: USDC circulation growth well in excess of interest rate declines, modest opex growth, and stable distribution costs) which makes near-term adjusted EBITDA multiples less reliable. Coinbase, on the other hand, looks cheap relative to Circle: but the vast majority of Coinbase's revenue depends on trading revenue, which is very volatile and fluctuates widely from quarter to quarter, whereas Circle's revenue is generated from a very stable interest income stream. In fact, Coinbase's revenue essentially flatlined in the most recent quarter (a function of lower crypto trading volatility) while adjusted EBITDA declined -14% y/y. Coinbase Q2 highlights (Coinbase Q2 shareholder letter) Key takeaways I'd much rather bank on a stable, predictable company like Circle rather than bet on Coinbase's very volatile trading revenue. In my view, the tailwinds from the passage of the GENIUS act this year is unlocking substantial adoption of stablecoins and, in particular, USDC, which is positioning Circle for tremendous revenue growth in spite of interest rate headwinds.

Analysts and industry figures frequently cite trillions of dollars in debt securities that could transition into digital formats in the coming years. Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a known supporter of XRP, highlighted the unique role the digital asset can play in this transformation. He stated, “Trillions in debt will be tokenized. But only XRP can unlock the liquidity trapped inside.” XRP’s design as a settlement asset makes it capable of handling high-value transactions across borders with minimal friction. Aljarrah’s comments reflect a growing sentiment that XRP is more than just another cryptocurrency. Unlike many digital assets that rely primarily on speculation, XRP has been developed and tested for institutional-grade security and utility. By emphasizing its function in settlement, he draws attention to how XRP could act as a bridge for the massive flow of capital expected to enter blockchain-based debt markets. Trillions in debt will be tokenized. But only #XRP can unlock the liquidity trapped inside. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 25, 2025 XRP’s Role in Liquidity Unlocking Liquidity is central to the functioning of debt markets. Traditional debt instruments, whether sovereign bonds or corporate notes, often face limitations due to complex settlement processes, jurisdictional boundaries, and time delays. Tokenization promises to make these assets easier to issue, transfer, and settle. However, without a suitable settlement asset, tokenization alone does not fully solve the liquidity challenge. This is where XRP’s role becomes significant. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Its ability to facilitate near-instant transactions across multiple networks makes it uniquely positioned to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized debt. By providing a neutral and liquid bridge currency , XRP can enable the release of trapped capital within these markets. This unlocking of liquidity is not theoretical but directly linked to practical settlement needs. Potential Impact on XRP’s Value The adoption of XRP in large-scale debt markets would have a direct effect on demand. Debt securities represent one of the largest segments of global finance, with outstanding amounts measured in the hundreds of trillions. If even a small portion of this capital required settlement through XRP, the upward pressure on its value could be substantial. As Aljarrah suggested, XRP is positioned to be the only asset capable of fulfilling this function effectively. Its existing infrastructure, proven transaction capacity, and focus on real-world use cases create a foundation for growth. This sets it apart from cryptocurrencies that lack utility beyond trading activity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

SOL Price Risks Drop To $150 If This Critical Support Fails,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-price-risks-drop-to-150-if-this-support-fails/,"After hitting a one-month low, Solana (SOL) has bounced from a critical support zone and is attempting to reclaim a crucial psychological barrier before potentially resuming its bullish rally. However, some analysts suggested that the cryptocurrency could retest new lows if the market volatility persists. Related Reading: SUI Retest Ascending Triangle Support Amid 8% Drop – Bounce Or Breakdown Next? Solana Price Retest Major Support On Thursday, Solana lost the $200 level as support after closing the day below this level for the first time in nearly a month. The cryptocurrency has been trading inside the $120-$220 price range since early February, finally breaking out of this range in mid-September. A week ago, the market’s bullish momentum and strong corporate treasury purchases pushed SOL’s price to an eight-month high of $253, leading many investors to anticipate the long-awaited rally to higher levels. However, this week’s pullbacks have sent most cryptocurrencies below crucial levels, with Bitcoin and Ethereum dropping to $108,000 and $3,800, respectively. Meanwhile, Solana has seen a 20% decline in the weekly timeframe, losing the $200 level. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems asserted that SOL was “in freefall after that nasty deviation back into the range.” If Solana fails to hold the current $190-$200 range, the analyst considers it would be “very difficult” to find strong support before the demand zone around $150, a level not seen since the start of July. Similarly, market watcher Wise Crypto also noted that Solana could be in a make-or-break retest, as it retests a critical support zone and the overall market still shows some signs of weakness. According to the post, SOL has been trading within an ascending channel since April, bouncing between the upper and lower boundaries throughout this period. If the market’s recent volatility continues, the cryptocurrency could retest the channel’s support zone, around the $177-$188 levels. “If this zone breaks, the next major support is down below $150 — so caution is key,” they added. SOL Bounce Eyes $200 Reclaim Despite the volatility, Wise Crypto also signaled that “Stochastic RSI is signaling oversold conditions, suggesting a potential bounce could be on the horizon.” As a result, if SOL holds this support area, a move toward the $250 barrier could follow. As Solana approached its major ascending trendline, Crypto Batman noted that SOL has bounced from this level each time it has retested it, suggesting that “In the midst of chaos, you have to look at things from a different perspective.” Notably, SOL bounced from the recent lows on Friday Morning and is currently attempting to break above the $200 psychological barrier. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency must daily close above this key level and continue to hold it over the weekend to transform the pullback into a downside wick deviation in the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Holds Key Support, But Analyst Warns Rally Could Be At Risk Ted Pillows added that if this level is reclaimed, the $208-$210 area, near the 10-day Moving Average (MA), would be the next target. According to the market watcher, reclaiming and holding above that level would be the first bullish sign, which could potentially push Solana’s price toward $216–$220, near the 30-day MA. As of this writing, SOL trades at $199, a 1.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

Within a single trading session, over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, sending shockwaves across exchanges and briefly dragging the price below $110,000. The move rattled retail traders but has not dented long-term conviction among institutions and seasoned investors. For many, these steep selloffs are less about fear and more about opportunity, offering entry points that had previously seemed out of reach. Bitcoin’s history is littered with similar moments. In 2017, multiple 30% drawdowns punctuated the path to record highs. In 2020, a COVID-driven crash reset the market before a rally to $60,000. Each cycle has shown that while volatility is painful, it also creates the conditions for extraordinary upside. With Bitcoin still trading near all-time highs on a multi-year scale, analysts suggest that this correction may once again mark the beginning of a lucrative accumulation phase. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also benefiting from renewed interest in diversification as investors seek both stability and outsized returns. Technical support zones From a charting perspective, Bitcoin remains above critical long-term support levels. Traders point to $100,000 as the ultimate line in the sand. As long as Bitcoin holds this psychological level, the broader uptrend remains intact. Resistance sits near $116,000, where repeated attempts to break higher have been rejected. The narrowing band between support and resistance suggests that a major move is imminent, with October often serving as the catalyst for decisive trends. On-chain data provides further insight. Exchange reserves have been declining, showing that long-term holders are withdrawing coins rather than selling into weakness. Whale wallets have also been active, with accumulation spikes reported during the latest dip. These signals point to conviction among sophisticated investors, many of whom are treating this crash as an attractive opportunity rather than a cause for panic. Macro backdrop favors risk assets The broader economic environment adds another layer of intrigue. The Federal Reserve’s recent policy pivot has reinforced expectations of further rate cuts by year-end. Historically, easing liquidity has been a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as capital flows toward higher-return opportunities. Equity markets are near record highs, while bond yields have softened, creating conditions that often encourage speculative growth sectors. Institutional demand remains a cornerstone of the current cycle. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to record steady inflows, with BlackRock and Fidelity products leading the charge. Unlike previous cycles, these vehicles provide a constant source of new demand, creating a floor under Bitcoin’s price. Analysts argue that as long as these inflows persist, any dips are likely to be short-lived. This structural demand, combined with expanding retail interest, strengthens the case that the latest crash is less a warning and more an invitation. MAGACOIN FINANCE rides the wave of opportunity Market crashes often shake out weak hands but also create generational opportunities for risk-tolerant investors. As Bitcoin dipped sharply this week, speculative focus shifted toward presales that remain uncorrelated to spot drawdowns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging in that narrative. Its presale stages continue selling out despite broader volatility, suggesting strong conviction among buyers. The project’s audits by CertiK and HashEx further reassure participants that smart contract vulnerabilities are minimized. ROI projections vary, but many community analysts talk about 200%–600% upside potential if listings in Q4 materialize. In downturns, traders often seek projects with asymmetric risk-reward profiles, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that bill by offering discounted entry pricing that doesn’t move with Bitcoin’s day-to-day swings. This combination of credibility, traction, and ROI potential makes it one of the more notable dip-era plays. The buy-the-dip psychology Crypto investors have long debated the wisdom of buying into market crashes. For newcomers, sharp pullbacks spark fear and hesitation. For veterans, they are almost expected. Every cycle has produced corrections that, in hindsight, offered the best possible entry points. The key is differentiating between structural breakdowns and healthy resets. Current data suggests the latter: exchange reserves are falling, ETF demand remains steady, and long-term holders are not selling. This backdrop explains why the phrase “buy the dip” has become almost synonymous with crypto investing. It is less about blind optimism and more about understanding that volatility is the price of admission for exponential returns. By pairing stable accumulation in assets like Bitcoin with speculative plays such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors can balance downside risk with upside exposure. This layered strategy ensures that portfolios remain positioned for both immediate rebounds and long-term breakthroughs. Blending stability and speculation The interplay between Bitcoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the spectrum of opportunities in crypto. Bitcoin serves as the anchor: a proven, institutional-grade asset with a limited supply and growing demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the moonshot: a presale token that could multiply many times over if momentum continues. In moments of market stress, both sides of this spectrum gain appeal. Conservative investors seek the safety of Bitcoin’s track record, while risk-tolerant traders chase the exponential upside that new projects offer. This dual strategy has proven effective in past cycles. During Bitcoin’s 2020 recovery, capital rotated into presales and small-cap tokens that delivered life-changing multiples. Investors who balanced both captured the security of Bitcoin’s climb and the explosiveness of altcoin momentum. The current cycle shows every sign of repeating that pattern. Conclusion Bitcoin’s latest crash has rattled markets, but history suggests that dips of this magnitude often precede powerful rallies. With structural demand from ETFs, declining exchange reserves, and strong whale accumulation, the foundations remain intact for another leg higher. October’s performance could determine whether Bitcoin surges or struggles into year-end. For investors, the strategy is clear. Accumulating Bitcoin during crashes offers long-term security, while adding exposure to breakout projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a shot at extraordinary returns. Together, they form a balanced approach that can weather volatility and maximize opportunity. In crypto, fear and fortune often walk side by side, and those who treat the latest crash as a chance to act may be the ones celebrating when the next bull cycle ignites.

SEC, FINRA Scrutinize Suspicious Trading Moves On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that financial regulators have reached out to some of the over 200 companies with Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategies after observing unusual trading activity in the days leading up to the announcement of their crypto treasury strategy. People familiar with the matter told the news media outlet that the SEC and the FINRA have examined unusual trading moves in the shares of multiple unnamed companies that announced that they would adopt a DAT strategy this year. Reportedly, the regulators have raised concerns in letters and conversations about “unusually high trading volumes and sharp stock-price gains” that preceded the announcement that these companies would make cryptocurrencies their core corporate strategy. SEC officials have warned these companies about potential violations of Regulation Fair Disclosure, the WSJ sources alleged. As the news media outlet noted, the rule prohibits public companies from “selectively disclosing material, nonpublic information to investors, analysts, and other market participants who might trade on the information.” According to some lawyers, these types of FINRA letters usually mark the start of serious investigations into insider trading. However, it remains unclear whether the financial regulators are pursuing enforcement actions against any of these companies or investors. Former SEC enforcement lawyer and now SEC defense attorney David Chase told WSJ that “when those go out, it really stirs the pot. It’s typically the first step in an investigation. Whether it goes full, full length, it’s anybody’s guess.” The sources noted that, in some cases, the secrecy of the DAT announcements can be compromised, leading to the unusual stock activity ahead of the official statements. Meanwhile, lawyers who have worked on crypto-treasury deals affirmed that information leaks can also harm pricing transactions. “If the stock price is highly volatile in the days leading up to pricing a transaction, that could actually make it very difficult to agree on a price for the transaction and put it at risk of execution,” Justin Platt, a partner at law firm Goodwin, told WSJ. Crypto DAT’s Momentum Continues Over the past few months, the crypto treasury strategy trend, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, has gained momentum, with 212 new companies announcing plans to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to launch DAT strategies, the WSJ noted, citing data from crypto advisory firm Architect Partners. Throughout September, multiple companies have unveiled crypto treasury strategies focused on Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana (SOL). As reported by Bitcoinist, Solana-focused DATs have seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the strategies this month. Recently, Helius Medical Technology revealed the launch of a $500 million SOL treasury strategy backed by Pantera Capital and Summer Capital. Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Fitell Corporation, a global provider of fitness equipment and health solutions, has unveiled the launch of the first Solana-based digital asset treasury in Australia. Meanwhile, the top crypto treasuries have continued to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the leading digital assets. BitMine, the largest ETH-focused treasury, recently surpassed the 2 million ETH milestone, while Strategy, the leading Bitcoin and crypto treasury, purchased another 850 BTC earlier this week.",Crypto News|bitcoin|BitMine|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Treasury Company|DATs|Digital Asset Treasuries|Ethereum treasury|FINRA|Solana Treasury company|US SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 04:00:51

He stated, “In some of the current offerings we’ve seen 8-10% yields on XRP.” While such yields appear attractive, his priority remains security. He added that he would trade up to 5% of that yield for an insurance policy to insure his tokens against loss with a major insurance company, such as Lloyds of London. This approach emphasizes security over maximum yield. Instead of pursuing the highest return possible, the focus shifts to sustainable income backed by institutional participation . XRP Yield In some of the current offerings we've seen 8-10% yields on XRP. I'll trade 3-5% of that yield for an insurance policy insuring my XRP against loss with a major insurance company like @LloydsofLondon I'm sitting on the sidelines keeping my XRP safe for now. Chat GPT… pic.twitter.com/kMRmqhDASm — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) September 25, 2025 The Search for Sustainable Returns Throughout financial history, investors have been promised high yields that often proved unsustainable. From Charles Ponzi’s 50% return promises in 1920 to Bernie Madoff’s “consistent” 10 to 12% returns, many schemes ended in collapse. Even in modern times, dotcom stocks, subprime mortgage products, and crypto lending platforms offered double-digit returns that led to massive losses when the risks were revealed. The record shows that outsized yields without sufficient protection tend to collapse sooner or later. This background makes the conversation around XRP yield an important one. With current offerings within 8% and 10%, many holders are weighing the potential benefits and the risks of committing their assets. The challenge for investors is not only finding returns but ensuring that those returns are safeguarded. Digital Asset Investor noted that he would rather sit on the sidelines and keep his XRP safe rather than lose it to shady investments due to high yields. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why It Matters for XRP Digital Asset Investor’s position reflects lessons from past financial failures. The image he shared highlights how high-yield products have often collapsed, from Charles Ponzi’s 50% promises to Bernie Madoff’s 10 to 12% fraud and the more recent downfall of crypto lending platforms offering 12 to 20%. These schemes ultimately resulted in huge losses and crises for investors. Rather than chasing similar risky returns, he stated that he would let some of that profit go towards an insurance policy, demonstrating a more mature investment approach that many in the community share, one that focuses on sustainable growth and avoiding the same mistakes behind previous financial collapses. A Step Toward Mainstream Confidence The discussion around insurance in connection with XRP yield offerings reflects a critical step in bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. If major insurers become active in this space, it could give investors additional confidence and attract larger pools of capital. This would strengthen XRP’s reputation and help support long-term adoption and growth . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the Jeju District Court, the total amount involved was about ₩4.34 billion — roughly $3.1 million — and the case has stirred sharp public reaction and industry fallout. Court Hands Suspended Sentence Based on reports , the court sentenced Hwang to two years in prison, but the sentence was suspended for four years, meaning she will not go to jail unless she breaks the terms of probation. Prosecutors had asked for a three-year prison term. The court applied the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes in reaching its verdict. Judges said factors such as full repayment and Hwang’s lack of a prior criminal record weighed in favor of leniency. The Charges And How The Crypto Moved Reports have disclosed that the alleged embezzlement took place across 13 separate transactions in 2022. About ₩4.2 billion of the money was used to buy crypto, while smaller sums covered property taxes and local levies through credit card payments. According to charging documents, the withdrawals were recorded as provisional payments or advances and were later routed from the agency’s accounts into accounts controlled by Hwang. Crypto: Repayments And Admissions Before the verdict, Hwang repaid the full amount, according to media reports and statements from her agency. Two large repayments were made on May 30, 2024 and June 5, 2024, reportedly funded by selling personal assets. Hwang publicly apologized in court and in statements, calling the moves a misjudgment and accepting responsibility for her actions. Her agency has said that, as of mid-June 2025, all financial obligations between the actress and the company were settled. Industry Response And Repercussions Broadcasters reacted quickly. Based on reports, some networks edited Hwang out of programs, and a number of brand deals were paused or canceled. The damage is both legal and reputational. While the court noted that the agency operated as a one-person company and that outside victims were limited, advertisers and networks tend to move fast when a high-profile legal case emerges. Broader Questions About Celebrity Finances Legal observers say the case highlights growing scrutiny of how entertainers handle company funds and crypto investments. South Korea has been tightening rules and oversight around virtual assets, and this verdict could signal stricter enforcement in the future.

If you’ve been following Ethereum, you know that whale movements often precede major market shifts. This time, the data points to an astonishing surge in institutional and large investor interest, signaling strong confidence in Ethereum’s future. What’s Driving This Massive ETH Accumulation? According to a recent report from Lookonchain, the past two days have seen an extraordinary amount of ETH accumulation . A total of 16 prominent whale addresses have collectively withdrawn a staggering 431,000 ETH from major exchanges. This impressive sum is valued at approximately $1.73 billion, showcasing a clear pattern of large-scale buying. These significant withdrawals didn’t come from just one platform. They originated from a diverse range of prominent entities, including Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, and OKX. Such broad-based activity suggests a coordinated or at least widespread belief among institutional players and high-net-worth individuals that Ethereum is poised for significant upside. Why Do Whale Movements Matter for ETH Accumulation? When we observe substantial ETH accumulation by whales, it’s more than just large transactions; it’s a powerful indicator. Whales, by definition, hold enough assets to influence market prices. Their actions are often seen as a barometer for market sentiment and future price direction. Here’s why their recent buying spree is so important: Confidence Signal: Large-scale accumulation suggests these sophisticated investors believe Ethereum’s price will appreciate significantly. Reduced Selling Pressure: Moving ETH off exchanges into private wallets typically means these assets are intended for long-term holding, reducing immediate selling pressure on the market. Market Stability: Consistent accumulation by whales can contribute to market stability by creating a strong demand floor. This trend could be influenced by several factors, including upcoming network upgrades, increasing institutional adoption of blockchain technology, or a general bullish outlook on the broader crypto market. The strategic nature of these withdrawals from various platforms underscores a deliberate move rather than speculative day trading. What Does This ETH Accumulation Signal for the Future? The ongoing ETH accumulation by whales paints a compelling picture for Ethereum’s prospects. This consistent buying behavior, particularly when moving assets off exchanges, often indicates a long-term bullish stance. It suggests that these influential players are positioning themselves for future growth, potentially anticipating a supply shock or increased demand for Ethereum’s ecosystem. For everyday investors, observing such whale activity can provide valuable insights. While it’s not financial advice, understanding these trends helps in gauging market sentiment and potential future movements. The commitment shown by these large holders in acquiring billions worth of ETH could foreshadow a period of sustained growth for the digital asset. In essence, the message is clear: major players are not just dabbling; they are making substantial, strategic investments. This strong vote of confidence through sustained ETH accumulation could be a significant catalyst for Ethereum’s trajectory in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions About ETH Accumulation Q1: What is ETH accumulation? A: ETH accumulation refers to the process where individuals or entities, especially large holders, continuously buy and hold Ethereum (ETH) tokens, often moving them off exchanges into personal wallets. Q2: Who are ‘whales’ in the crypto market? A: ‘Whales’ are individuals or organizations that hold a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions are significant enough to potentially influence market prices and trends. Q3: Why are whales accumulating ETH now? A: Whales may accumulate ETH due to various reasons, including anticipation of future price increases, upcoming network upgrades, increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, or a general bullish outlook on the crypto market. Q4: How does whale accumulation impact ETH’s price? A: Significant whale accumulation can positively impact ETH’s price by reducing the circulating supply on exchanges, signaling strong market confidence, and creating a demand floor, which can lead to upward price pressure. Q5: Where did the whales withdraw their ETH from? A: According to the report, the whales withdrew their ETH from several prominent platforms, including Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, and OKX.

If you’ve been following the digital asset space, you might have heard about a significant shake-up involving crypto futures liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, the market witnessed a staggering $128 million in forced liquidations within the perpetual futures market, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge. This dramatic event underscores the risks and rewards present in leveraged trading, leaving many wondering what exactly happened and what it means for the broader crypto landscape. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the jargon, crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader no longer has sufficient margin to keep the position open, often due to a rapid adverse price movement. Essentially, it’s the market telling a trader, “Your bet went wrong, and your collateral is gone.” These liquidations are a common, albeit often painful, aspect of futures trading and can provide insights into market sentiment and areas of high leverage. In the recent 24-hour period, we saw these forced closures impact various assets. The total amount was substantial, signaling significant market movement and exposing traders who were perhaps over-leveraged or on the wrong side of price action. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone participating in or observing the crypto market. Ethereum’s Dominance: Unpacking ETH Liquidations Ethereum (ETH) took center stage in this latest wave of crypto futures liquidations , accounting for a massive $68.02 million. What’s particularly interesting is the breakdown: 66.23% of these ETH liquidations were short positions. This means a majority of traders betting on ETH’s price to fall were caught off guard as the asset moved upwards, forcing their positions to close. This strong upward price pressure on ETH likely triggered a cascade, leading to a substantial number of short sellers being wiped out. This dominance by ETH in the liquidation figures suggests a strong, perhaps unexpected, bullish movement for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Traders anticipating a downturn found themselves on the losing end, highlighting the unpredictable nature of even established assets like Ethereum. It’s a powerful reminder that market sentiment can shift rapidly, punishing those with highly leveraged positions against the prevailing trend. Bitcoin and XPL: A Glimpse into Broader Crypto Futures Liquidations While ETH led, other cryptocurrencies also experienced significant crypto futures liquidations . Bitcoin (BTC), the market leader, saw $25.92 million liquidated. Unlike ETH, a majority of BTC liquidations (58.39%) were long positions. This indicates that traders betting on BTC’s price to rise were hit, suggesting a downward price movement for Bitcoin during the same period. This divergence between ETH and BTC liquidations paints a picture of a nuanced market, where different assets react to various catalysts. Adding to the mix, XPL experienced $34.60 million in liquidations, with 53.1% being long positions. The presence of XPL in such a significant liquidation event, alongside crypto giants like ETH and BTC, is noteworthy. It shows that even smaller-cap assets are not immune to the volatility and leveraged trading risks prevalent in the futures market. These figures collectively emphasize the widespread impact of market fluctuations on leveraged positions across the entire crypto ecosystem. Navigating Volatility: Protecting Your Trades from Crypto Futures Liquidations So, what can traders learn from these substantial crypto futures liquidations ? The primary takeaway is the importance of robust risk management. Leveraged trading amplifies both gains and losses, making it a double-edged sword. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessive leverage, as it significantly increases your liquidation risk. Start with lower leverage and understand its implications. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These are crucial tools that automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a certain point, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical indicators, and broader economic trends that can influence crypto prices. Understand Market Sentiment: While challenging, gauging overall market sentiment can help you avoid betting against strong trends. By implementing these strategies, traders can better protect themselves from the abrupt and often costly impact of forced liquidations, making their trading journey more sustainable. In conclusion, the past 24 hours saw a dramatic display of market forces, with $128 million in crypto futures liquidations , prominently led by Ethereum. This event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and amplified risks associated with leveraged trading in the digital asset space. While painful for some, these liquidations offer valuable lessons on risk management and the importance of cautious participation. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these dynamics becomes paramount for every participant. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidations Here are some common questions regarding crypto futures liquidations: Q: What exactly is a crypto futures liquidation? A: A crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This typically happens when the market price moves significantly against their open position. Q: Why did ETH lead the recent liquidations? A: ETH led the recent liquidations primarily because a large number of traders had opened “short” positions, betting on its price to fall. When ETH’s price unexpectedly rose, these short positions were forced to close, leading to substantial liquidations. Q: Are liquidations always bad for the market? A: While liquidations are painful for individual traders, they are a natural part of a leveraged market. They can help deleverage the market, removing excessive risk and sometimes paving the way for more stable price movements. However, large cascades can also trigger further volatility. Q: How can I avoid being liquidated in crypto futures trading? A: To avoid liquidation, it’s crucial to manage your risk. This includes using appropriate leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and not over-committing your capital to highly volatile positions. Q: What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? A: A “long” liquidation occurs when a trader betting on a price increase (a long position) is forced to close because the price falls. A “short” liquidation happens when a trader betting on a price decrease (a short position) is forced to close because the price rises.

He noted that XRP has hit the “E Wave support Level as we discussed yesterday.” He also reminded followers that it is “better to keep an eye on the 50.00% Fibonacci Support.” His comments indicate that XRP remains within the structure he outlined earlier and is now testing the lower support levels that could define its trajectory. XRP hits the E Wave support Level as we discussed yesterday. It was a clear, simple chart. Better to keep an eye on the 50.00% Fibonacci Support. Chin-up #XRPArmy , we are getting there. https://t.co/AOvBsdHE45 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) September 25, 2025 Background to the Analysis The day before this update, Dark Defender had presented a chart showing XRP’s corrective structure. He explained that the market was nearing the end of the ABCDE formation and highlighted that the asset was preparing for the final phase of consolidation . According to his analysis, reclaiming the $3.333 price level would mark the critical breakout point. He described this stage as a setup where nothing would stop further gains once that level is secured, pointing toward a path that could eventually lead XRP to double-digit prices . The structure he laid out involved an extended corrective wave that has been developing over recent months. With the latest update confirming a touch of the E Wave support, it appears that the corrective action is reaching its conclusion. This brings attention back to the near-term levels that could act as the launch point for the next rally . Significance of the Current Support The update stressed the importance of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. This line, which sits near $2.64, represents a zone that has historically served as a decisive area during market corrections. Holding this level would give XRP the foundation to confirm the end of the consolidation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As XRP trades at $2.78, Dark Defender’s framework implies that the asset is positioned to turn upward after testing the $2.64 support level. Climbing back to $3.333 would complete the reversal from the drawn-out corrective pattern, providing the technical validation for a push toward a new all-time high . What Comes Next for XRP The combination of the ABCDE pattern nearing completion and XRP holding near Fibonacci support presents a critical period for the asset. Traders monitoring the structure are watching to see if it can maintain the E Wave support and whether momentum will build in favor of a breakout. Dark Defender has emphasized that XRP is “getting there,” indicating the steady progress of the chart formation. The consolidation phase is being tested at its final stage, with the technical markers aligning for a potential rally.

Wyckoff Structure Points to Final Phase Solana (SOL) is trading at $202 with a daily turnover of $11.19 billion. The token has regained 3% in the past 24 hours, but has dumped by over 15% over the past week. Analysts suggest the decline may be part of a longer structure that still points upward. ZYN posted a chart presenting SOL crossing the phases of Wyckoff accumulation. According to the chart, Solana is transitioning from Phase D to Phase E, which is based on the Son of Wyckoff theory, a concept where markets tend to break above. The token has traded between $120 and $210, with the current dip portrayed as the final shakeout before a run-up. Source: ZYN/X ZYN commented, “$SOL is in the final phase of its Wyckoff accumulation. This is probably the last big dip before a big rally in Q4.” He added, “I think anyone buying SOL at these levels will be happy in 2-3 months. $500 SOL is programmed this cycle.” Key Levels and Market Signals Wise Crypto shared a separate chart showing SOL trading at a critical support zone around $180–$177.

The outcome could determine whether institutional flows begin to support Solana in the same way they did for Bitcoin and Ethereum after spot ETFs gained approval. Yet, it maintains a cautious stance. Data from Polymarket shows traders pegging the probability that Solana would have a new all-time high in 2025 at just 34%. ETF filings and technical structures have fed optimism, but all the same, the sentiment expresses doubt about how fast Solana can make the move up.

If approved, the fund will be known under the ticker “XXX”. It is meant to provide investors returns that closely correspond to an index of the S&P 500 and another tracking futures contracts for XRP – called the S&P XRP Futures 75/25 Blend Index. In its structure, 75% of the Cyber Hornet ETF portfolio will be allocated to S&P 500 stocks, while the remaining 25% goes into XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The fund can also hold XRP directly or use ETPs to balance its exposure. Cyber Hornet listed two other similar offerings in its SEC filing Cyber Hornet also has two more ETFs in the works for Ethereum and Solana . The Ethereum version will be listed as “EEE,” and the Solana one as “SSS.” All of the funds have similar 75/25 models, mixing shares with futures contracts. Ethereum exposure comes from CME Ether futures and direct purchases. Meanwhile, the fund’s Solana share will track the S&P Solana Futures Index. This move coincides with growing investor interest — REX-Osprey’s Solana staking ETF just set a new asset record. Investors will pay a 0.95% management fee annually for the Cyber Hornet ETFs, but there are no shareholder trading fees. The SEC calculates that $10,000 invested would result in about $100 in fees after one year and $312 after three. The ETFs will also rebalance every month to keep the 75/25 split intact, though Cyber Hornet may adjust more frequently if markets get volatile. Moreover, the funds may trade slightly higher or lower than their underlying value, just like most ETFs. The ETFs are also set to trade on Nasdaq if approved. Individual investors will trade shares on the open market, while authorized participants manage 25,000-share creation and redemption units. The filings show Cyber Hornet’s push to link stock market benchmarks with crypto diversity. If launched, they’d be the first funds to unite XRP, ETH, and SOL with S&P 500 performance. The US SEC is investigating trading activity before companies announced ETF strategies The US SEC is still working with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to look into potentially abnormal trades made right before companies unveiled treasury management and ETF strategies. Investigators are probing whether trades were made using privileged information, a potential case of insider trading or manipulation. Significant price jumps in the hours triggered the inquiry before companies revealed treasury and ETF strategies. Analysts say the SEC is paying closer attention to strange trading patterns than ever. As firms adopt ETFs and digital assets for treasury use, oversight is tightening to safeguard market order. The probe remains in its early phase and hasn’t resulted in enforcement yet, but it signals a tougher stance on potential abuse. The inquiry builds on the SEC’s ongoing look at ETF structures and the quality of corporate transparency. Regulators have long been wary of sudden ETF volume jumps that don’t align with available information. Still, the SEC recently cleared the path for a wave of new crypto-related exchange-traded funds. The agency approved generic listing standards f or commodity-based exchange-traded products, allowing crypto funds to move through the approval process much faster. With these standards now applied across Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca, issuers no longer need individual approvals under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934. Previously, launching a spot crypto fund required a lengthy application, public comment, and SEC review. This is why nearly all existing crypto ETFs have focused on Bitcoin and Ether—the largest digital assets by market capitalization. The new approach is intended to speed up launch timelines, slash administrative costs, and make more digital assets available to investors in an ETF structure.

Recently, Mike Novogratz, the insightful CEO of Galaxy Digital, shared a compelling vision that could ignite an unprecedented Bitcoin rally . He suggests that the key to unlocking a monumental surge in BTC’s value might not come from typical crypto developments, but from a crucial political appointment within the U.S. financial system. What Could Spark the Next Bitcoin Rally? Novogratz points directly to a critical decision on the horizon: the selection of the next U.S. Federal Reserve chair. This seemingly conventional political move could, in fact, be the single biggest catalyst for a monumental Bitcoin rally . But how exactly does a Fed chair’s philosophy influence the world’s leading cryptocurrency? The ‘Dove’ Factor: Novogratz speculates that if President Donald Trump nominates a ‘dove’ – a central banker who strongly favors lower interest rates and a looser monetary policy – to succeed current Chairman Jerome Powell, the economic landscape could shift dramatically. A ‘dove’ prioritizes economic growth and employment over strict inflation control. Major Interest Rate Cuts: A dovish Fed chair would likely pursue significant interest rate cuts. This action aims to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, encouraging increased spending and investment across the economy. Impact on Risk Assets: Historically, periods of sustained low interest rates and an expanded money supply tend to favor riskier assets. Investors often seek higher returns outside traditional, low-yield savings accounts and bonds, leading them to assets like stocks, real estate, and increasingly, cryptocurrencies. This specific scenario, Novogratz believes, could create the perfect storm for an explosive Bitcoin rally , potentially pushing its price to an astonishing $200,000. It’s a bold prediction that highlights the growing interconnectedness of global finance. Understanding the Fed’s Influence on a Potential Bitcoin Rally It might seem surprising that decisions made by a central bank could so directly affect a decentralized asset like Bitcoin. However, the Federal Reserve’s actions ripple through global financial markets, influencing everything from stock valuations to commodity prices, and significantly, the sentiment around cryptocurrencies. Monetary Policy and Inflation Hedge: When the Fed implements policies that cut interest rates and expand the money supply, it often leads to concerns about inflation. Bitcoin, with its strictly limited supply cap of 21 million coins, is frequently seen by investors as ‘digital gold’ – a robust hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies caused by inflation. U.S. Dollar Weakness: A sustained dovish monetary stance can lead to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. As the dollar’s purchasing power declines, investors typically look for alternative stores of value to protect their wealth. Bitcoin has emerged as a prominent candidate in this search, attracting capital from traditional markets. Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates and policies like quantitative easing inject more liquidity into the financial system. A significant portion of this newly available capital often flows into speculative assets, including the crypto market, providing the necessary fuel for a substantial Bitcoin rally . The growing correlation between macroeconomic policies and Bitcoin’s price performance has become increasingly evident, particularly over the past few years. This makes the upcoming Fed chair selection a truly pivotal event for anyone interested in the future of digital assets. Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Rally: Key Considerations for Investors While the prospect of a $200,000 Bitcoin rally is undeniably exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach such predictions with a well-informed and balanced perspective. Market dynamics are incredibly complex, and numerous factors beyond a single appointment can influence outcomes. Not a Guaranteed Outcome: Novogratz’s prediction is based on a specific political and economic scenario. There is no absolute guarantee that a ‘dove’ will be nominated, or that their policies will unfold exactly as anticipated by the market. Political landscapes can shift rapidly. Inherent Market Volatility: Even with strong bullish catalysts, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Significant price swings, both upwards and downwards, are a common characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. Investors should always be prepared for potential dips as well as surges. Importance of Diversification: A robust and resilient investment strategy typically involves diversification. While Bitcoin offers immense potential returns, it is often wise to balance portfolios across various asset classes to mitigate risk and ensure stability. Stay Continuously Informed: Keeping abreast of both macroeconomic developments, such as Fed policy shifts, and crypto-specific news is absolutely essential. Understanding the intricate interplay between traditional finance and the digital asset space provides a much clearer picture for making informed decisions. The potential for a monumental Bitcoin rally hinges on a delicate balance of political decisions, economic indicators, and subsequent market reactions. Prudent investors will monitor these developments closely, understanding both the opportunities and the inherent risks. Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin and Fed Decisions Mike Novogratz’s insightful commentary highlights a fascinating and increasingly important intersection between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. The idea that a single, high-profile appointment could unleash an ‘explosive’ Bitcoin rally to $200,000 underscores the growing influence of macroeconomic factors on digital assets. While the future remains inherently uncertain, the heightened anticipation surrounding the next Fed chair pick adds another layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s already captivating journey. This potential catalyst serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market is deeply intertwined with broader global economic forces, making informed awareness more critical than ever for both seasoned and new investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘dove’ in the context of the Federal Reserve? A ‘dove’ refers to a central banker who typically favors policies that prioritize economic growth and employment, often through lower interest rates and a more expansive money supply, even if it risks slightly higher inflation. This contrasts with a ‘hawk,’ who prioritizes controlling inflation through tighter monetary policy. Q2: How do interest rate cuts typically affect cryptocurrency prices? Interest rate cuts generally make traditional savings and investments less attractive due to lower returns. This encourages investors to seek higher yields in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can fuel a Bitcoin rally as capital flows into the market. Q3: Is Mike Novogratz’s $200,000 Bitcoin prediction guaranteed? No, Novogratz’s prediction is an analysis based on a specific economic and political scenario (the nomination of a dovish Fed chair and subsequent interest rate cuts). It is not a guarantee, as market outcomes are influenced by many complex and unpredictable factors. Q4: What should investors do if they believe a Bitcoin rally is coming? Investors should conduct their own thorough research, consider their risk tolerance, and potentially consult with a financial advisor. Diversification, staying informed about market trends and macroeconomic policies, and being prepared for volatility are always recommended strategies. Q5: Why is Bitcoin considered a hedge against inflation? Bitcoin is often viewed as an inflation hedge because its supply is strictly limited to 21 million coins, making it a scarce asset. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s scarcity means it cannot be devalued by government money printing, thus potentially preserving purchasing power during inflationary periods.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Participating In Loss-Taking In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the reaction to the recent Bitcoin price decline from the short-term holders (STHs) . The STHs refer to the BTC holders who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, the STHs with their relatively low amount of holding time are considered to represent the weak hands of the market. Like usual, this cohort has also panicked in the face of the latest price volatility. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the loss transactions made by the cohort’s members to wallets connected with centralized exchanges. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin STHs deposited nearly 32,000 BTC at a loss to exchanges during the crash from earlier in the week. Generally, holders transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to make use of one of the services that they provide, which can include selling. Considering the nature of the STHs, these loss deposits were likely made with distribution in mind. Thus, these investors reacted to the plummet by capitulating . The latest decline in BTC’s price to levels under $109,000 has been met with a similar reaction, with the 24-hour value of the metric hitting the 29,700 tokens mark. In total, the STHs have participated in capitulation of more than 60,000 BTC, worth a whopping $6.5 billion, across these two loss-taking waves. “That’s a clear sign of heavy stress across the market,” notes the analyst. In some other news, CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is flashing a “bear” signal for the cryptocurrency, as Maartunn has pointed out in another X post . The Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator uses the data of several popular on-chain metrics to determine what phase of the cycle the asset is currently in. According to the indicator, BTC is in a bearish phase at the moment. The 365-day moving average (MA) of the metric has also been on the way down for a while now, which also doesn’t tend to be a positive signal. “Historically, most BTC gains happen when this metric is rising, not falling,” explains the analyst. BTC Price Bitcoin has come down to the $108,900 level following a decline of more than 5.5%.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Capitulation|Bitcoin Loss-Taking|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 06:00:41

XRP outperformed Ethereum for five consecutive months this year, and this latest surge confirms that the pattern continues. Investors in South Korea are directing higher levels of liquidity toward XRP compared to Ethereum, a shift that reflects changes in market confidence and trading behavior. Ethereum maintains a higher global market capitalization. However, the repeated instances of XRP outpacing it in direct exchange activity suggest investor interest is moving in a different direction . The continuation of this trend could shape expectations surrounding the long-debated possibility of XRP overtaking Ethereum in influence and adoption. Can XRP Take Over the Market? For years, parts of the crypto community have claimed that XRP has the potential to flip Ethereum . Each time XRP overtakes Ethereum in regional or global trading performance, the argument for this shift gains more weight. The latest volumes on Upbit show that XRP not only competes with Ethereum but also maintains a clear lead in one of the most active crypto markets worldwide. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Traders have long looked at South Korea as a key indicator of retail enthusiasm and short-term momentum. XRP’s current position as the most traded asset on Upbit gives it an advantage that goes beyond daily volume. This sustained trading interest can establish XRP as a preferred digital asset for liquidity-driven use cases. There has also been some debate on surpassing Bitcoin. While this is a difficult feat, the XRP army is convinced that the digital asset can flip Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s Expanding Role in the Market The fact that XRP continues to outpace Ethereum and Bitcoin in South Korean markets suggests it is achieving a stronger position among both retail and institutional participants in the region. With $330 million in daily activity, XRP’s dominance cannot be dismissed as a temporary shift. Instead, it reflects a consistent trend with a margin that could rise further.
