Compared to ADA’s gradual rise, MUTM’s lending-and-borrowing system, early-stage market price, and solid utility-driven demand offer prospects of explosive price boosts with growing acceptance. As whales drive money into smaller, high-potential coins, the majority see Mutuum as a cycle-breakout token, a venture with the potential to yield exponential returns as bigger-cap assets like Cardano focus on marginal returns. Cardano Trades Above Key Support as Bulls Eye Breakout to $1.20 While investor attention continues to get drawn towards high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Cardano (ADA) is a closely watched large-cap altcoin that is showing itself to be robust amidst ongoing bear pressure. After the 6.1% decline that sent ADA below the pivotal $0.84 support, technical indicators continue to be divided in their outlook, with the RSI at 40 and a bearish MACD crossover suggesting further downside risk towards the $0.76 retracement area. With that said, maintaining above $0.88 does suggest retail buyers are entering against whale selling as a level of entry for a recovery. One to watch is the forming ascending triangle pattern below $0.95 resistance; if ADA is able to break above this level, analysts are forecasting a rally back towards the $1.20–$1.25 region even as newer coins like MUTM come to center stage for growth prospects. Mutuum Finance Record-Breaking Presale Mutuum Finance has recorded incredibly unprecedented interest in Stage Six presale at $0.035, 16.17% higher than the previous round. Investor interest has also been record-high with over 16,570 investors in and over $16.3 million raised so far. Accelerating the growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program in an attempt to further secure the platform. The bugs are ranked on four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, as an attempt to accommodate all the aspects of vulnerability. It is fueled by strong security to provide service to all customers to the best of its abilities. It operates under collateral ratios, caps in lending, and caps in depositing. Undercollateralized positions are closed efficiently through incentivized liquidations facilitated by penalties and guarantee remediation fees in order to stabilize the system. Efficiency of collateral is optimized through Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly for high-collateral lending. Reserve mechanisms are employed for creating a buffer against market fluctuations and excess reserves can be invested in volatile assets in the strategy of offsetting instability. DeFi Lending for All Mutuum Finance has established a lending platform that is as good for lenders as it is for borrowers. It accomplishes this through facilitating Peer-to-Peer, or P2P lending model scalable, immune to tampering and with access to retail and institutional investors. In an effort to steer away from traditional DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance also rewards early adopters in a $100,000 giveaway competition, in which 10 users have a chance of winning $10,000 MUTM. Being a lending protocol, it provides actual returns to lenders and borrowers, as per its vision of an open, transparent platform for every market participant. Cardano (ADA) could reach as high as $1.20, but its gains could be dwarfed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The initiative is currently at $0.035 in Presale Stage 6 and could hit as high as $2 when adoption achieves lift-off, a potential 5,600% gain. More than 16,570 investors have already registered, attaining $16.3 million+. Funded with a $50K bug bounty, $100K giveaway, and a secure dual-lending model, Mutuum is built for long-term growth. Whales are swapping out into smaller, high-upside tokens, and MUTM is at the forefront, according to experts.

According to crypto pundit Zach Rector, network upgrades and DeFi opportunities could encourage holders to commit their XRP for the long term, thereby reducing the number of tokens available for active trading. Zach Rector Warns Of Looming XRP “Supply Shock” Zach Rector, a well-followed crypto commentator, has raised the alarm about what lies ahead for XRP . According to Rector, billions of tokens are on track to be locked and deployed inside decentralized finance protocols in the near future. Rector argues that massive amounts of XRP are on track to leave circulation as they get stored inside long-term blockchain systems and institutional programs. Rector points out that liquidity is no longer moving freely across open exchanges as it once did. Trading volume that once flowed across markets is now shifting into smart contracts, secure custody accounts, and platforms that offer steady returns. Such moves reduce the number of tokens left for open trading on exchanges. As the pool of active tokens shrinks, upward pressure on prices is likely to intensify over time. Short-term traders who focus solely on daily movements may overlook the more profound changes now underway. The Rector’s view suggests that demand is no longer the sole factor shaping XRP. Supply is shrinking step by step , setting up the possibility of a crunch that could change the market’s direction soon. Innovations To Drive Large-Scale Token Lockups At the core of these changes is the XRP Ledger itself, which now includes an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain , opening the door to smart contracts, lending markets, and liquidity pools. These new capabilities allow holders to utilize their XRP directly on the network, making long-term token commitments more attractive. Cross-chain bridges, such as Axelar, allow XRP to move easily between networks, facilitating the deployment of tokens into DeFi projects by institutions and large holders for extended periods. The more effortless movement of assets gives institutions and large holders a clear path to place tokens into DeFi projects for long-term use. Exchanges and custodians are launching yield products, including wrapped tokens and staking-style services, that allow investors to earn rewards while keeping their XRP locked. The rewards make it far more tempting for holders to keep XRP out of trading circulation. Analysts stress that even if adoption grows only at a modest pace, billions of tokens could end up sidelined. A tighter supply could result in significantly fewer tokens in circulation, leading to more intense price movements. While there are still technical and regulatory challenges to be faced, the tools for long-term XRP lockups are already available. With momentum building, the supply shock Zach Rector has warned about may arrive sooner than many expect.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 22:00:35

Underestimating a project with explosive potential is one of them. While established coins like Tron (TRX) offer predictable but limited gains, experts are pointing to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as this cycle’s true high-return play, a 9,900% ROI opportunity that could cost you millions if overlooked. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a conclusion drawn from a presale that is performing at a historic level. Ruvi AI has shattered expectations, raising over $4 million and selling more than 285 million tokens in record time. Analysts are praising this velocity, noting it’s a rare feat typically reserved for projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is undeniable: after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI became one of the market’s hottest altcoins, proven when 20% of its Phase 3 supply was claimed within days . The Multi-Million Dollar Mistake: Sticking with Slow Movers For investors aiming for life-changing returns, portfolio allocation is everything. Holding onto large-cap coins like Tron offers stability, but it can’t deliver the exponential growth that creates wealth in a bull market. The real opportunity lies in identifying projects like Ruvi AI before they hit the mainstream, a low-cap gem with the fundamentals and narrative to deliver a 9,900% ROI or more. Ruvi AI’s credibility is rock-solid, making it an easy choice for smart capital. It boasts a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope , confirming its security and reliability. Its high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency and legitimacy that serious investors demand. The project’s core value is its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . This focus on a real-world product, an AI-powered super app, provides a sustainable foundation for long-term growth and is why experts see it as a far superior play to TRX this cycle. The Super App Fueling the 9900% ROI Potential The engine behind these staggering ROI projections is Ruvi AI’s game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Pinpoints viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a critical competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the application. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Final Warning: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already gone, this ground-floor price is disappearing quickly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns from this opportunity: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s unstoppable momentum. Don’t Let This Opportunity Pass You By The market is sending a clear message. Underestimating Ruvi AI’s record-breaking momentum and explosive potential could be a multi-million dollar mistake. As the presale accelerates and a guaranteed price increase looms, the window to act on this cycle’s premier ROI opportunity is closing fast.

Speaking in an interview with Bankless, Grewal argued that Base functions as blockchain infrastructure rather than a platform for matching securities trades. Should @base be regulated like the Nasdaq exchange? Here's what @coinbase CLO @iampaulgrewal has to say: “Base is just a normal blockchain… Yes it’s a layer2. But that doesn’t change its relationship to securities laws.” “We are not matching buyers and sellers of securities…… pic.twitter.com/Cd4M8kizTZ — Bankless (@BanklessHQ) September 26, 2025 “Base is just a normal blockchain,” Grewal said. “Yes, it’s a Layer-2. But that doesn’t change its relationship to securities laws. We are not matching buyers and sellers of securities. We are just a blockchain layer.” He stressed that transaction matching occurs within applications built on top of Base, such as automated market makers or centralized limit order book protocols, not at the Layer-2 level itself. Coinbase’s Base Balances SEC Scrutiny With Decentralization Push His comments come amid growing debate over the role of Layer-2 sequencers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines an exchange as a marketplace that matches buyers and sellers of securities. Commissioner Hester Peirce has previously warned that centralized sequencers could resemble exchange matching engines and therefore fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has backed Grewal’s position, likening Layer-2 networks to cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, which host exchange code but are not classified as exchanges themselves. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also praised Base for combining centralized sequencing with Ethereum’s decentralized security model, describing the approach as key to improving user experience. @VitalikButerin defends @Coinbase 's Base blockchain as a genuine Layer 2 with non-custodial security guarantees through the Ethereum base layer. #Ethereum #Base https://t.co/qdwFwEC9wT — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 Base was launched in 2023 as a low-cost, developer-focused chain built on Ethereum. It has since become a popular scaling solution for decentralized finance applications. Grewal warned that treating Layer-2 infrastructure as an exchange would impose heavy compliance burdens that could hinder innovation and slow the growth of the broader ecosystem. The regulatory debate coincides with a shift in Coinbase’s approach to Base’s long-term roadmap. At the BaseCamp 2025 event in Vermont, Jesse Pollak, who leads the Base project, revealed that the team is “beginning to explore” launching a native network token . Base has explored launching a network token, reversing Coinbase’s earlier stance. @jessepollak and @brian_armstrong confirmed discussions. #Coinbase #Base https://t.co/5vMMa9mHQ3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 The remarks marked a departure from Coinbase’s previous position that Base would not issue a token. Pollak emphasized that no decision has been made on the design, governance, or timeline for a token launch but described the exploration as part of efforts to accelerate decentralization and expand opportunities for developers and creators. The comments came a few weeks after the token distribution by Consensys’ Linea network, which released more than 9.3 billion LINEA tokens to eligible users . Alongside token discussions, Base also announced an open-source bridge with Solana at BaseCamp, allowing interoperability between ERC-20 and SPL tokens. The developments show both the rapid growth of the Layer-2 ecosystem and the unresolved regulatory questions facing infrastructure providers. Base Emerges as a Growing DeFi Powerhouse Amid Shifts in TVL Rankings Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized finance with $86.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), but Coinbase’s Base network is quickly establishing itself as one of the most active ecosystems in the market. Base currently holds $4.83 billion in TVL across more than 700 protocols, showing steady monthly growth despite short-term fluctuations. Liquidity is largely stablecoin-driven, with $4.4 billion in circulating supply on the network, underpinning lending and trading activity. Source: DeFiLlama Daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes approach $2 billion, while perpetuals trading adds another $1.1 billion—placing Base among the most liquid Layer-2s. Chain-level efficiency also stands out. In the past 24 hours, Base captured $237,000 in fees, nearly all of which were converted to revenue. The network processed activity from nearly 740,000 addresses in a single day, showing its broad retail and institutional adoption. Source: DeFiLlama Bridged liquidity stands far higher at nearly $20 billion, indicating large capital inflows that are not yet fully deployed in DeFi protocols. Protocols fueling the ecosystem include Aerodrome, Uniswap, Aave, and Spark. Aerodrome remains a major liquidity hub, though it leans heavily on incentives, resulting in negative net earnings. By contrast, Spark has emerged as one of the fastest-growing lending platforms, posting a 41% TVL increase over the past month. Risk management services such as Gauntlet and Block Analitica also highlight the maturing role of analytics in DeFi. While Ethereum and Solana still command larger ecosystems, Base’s rapid rise, backed by Coinbase’s infrastructure and user base, is positioning it as a contender in the next wave of DeFi expansion. Sustaining growth, however, may depend on whether protocols can reduce reliance on subsidies and maintain long-term liquidity.

The project’s popularity is fueled by its Season 2 points program and key endorsements from industry figures, including former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). ASTER Climbs Rankings The crypto data aggregator reported via X that XLP has achieved the top spot on CoinGecko after a recent airdrop valued at about $10,000 was distributed to holders. Close behind on the rankings are the perpetual tokens ASTER and AVNT. ASTER is the native token of a decentralized perpetual futures exchange by the same name that’s challenging Hyperliquid’s dominance in the sector. It runs on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, but it primarily exists on the BNB Chain. ASTER is trading at around $1.78 today, down by 15.3% in the last 24 hours, but remains up by over 181% over the last week. Since its launch on September 17, the coin’s value has surged by over 2,400%, pushing its market capitalization above $2.9 billion and securing the 50th position on CoinGecko. Aster has been around for over a year, but activity on the platform exploded following the launch of its native token. Since then, the exchange has overtaken Hyperliquid in key metrics. DefiLlama data shows that it reported $35.86 billion in daily perpetual trading volume, surpassing its rival’s $17.16 billion. The strong performance has attracted new traders who see the platform’s liquidity as a competitive advantage. On-chain data reveals that whales have been accumulating ASTER steadily since last week, with more than $48 million invested in the token. Separately, another large holder recently pocketed $7 million in profits from an initial outlay of $300k. Why Aster Is Exploding in Popularity Part of the excitement is coming from the project’s community push around Season 2 of its points farming program. The campaign rewards users for trading, referrals, and margin usage. Crypto analyst Shawn shared on X that only 4% of tokens are released in this round, but participation is already 30 times higher than in Season 1. Aster has also received backing from prominent figures in the crypto industry, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who has publicly endorsed the project and promoted it on his X account. The platform is also supported by YZi Labs, Zhao’s private investment firm, which provides mentorship, technical support, and marketing exposure. Additionally, crypto trader James Wynn has promoted Aster as a superior product to its competitor Hyperliquid. Wynn noted that its counterpart is facing a “slow and painful death” as the newer perpetuals DEX gains ground in the industry.

Day traders who fueled rallies in everything from tech stocks to cryptocurrency are now pulling money out of the most speculative investments. This shift comes even as the Federal Reserve continues supporting markets and major indexes hover close to recent peaks. The clearest sign of this change shows up in leveraged exchange-traded funds, which use borrowed money to amplify daily stock moves by two or three times. These products, popular with individual investors seeking quick profits, have lost about $7 billion in September. According to Bloomberg Intelligence this is the biggest outflow since records began in 2019. The retreat doesn’t signal widespread panic. Instead, traders appear to be cashing in profits and preparing for possible bumps ahead after months of rewards for taking big risks. Chip fund loses $2.3 billion despite 31% gain Take the Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3x Shares fund, known by its ticker SOXL. Despite gaining 31% this month, investors pulled more than $2.3 billion from the fund. Similarly, TSLL, which triples exposure to Tesla stock moves, faces its largest monthly outflow ever with $1.5 billion already withdrawn, even as Tesla shares have been climbing. This careful approach may reflect concerns about upcoming events. A possible government shutdown could delay economic reports and shake investor confidence. Many see the pullback as healthy, given that stock and bond markets have reached levels rarely seen except during the most excited periods of the past twenty years. What stands out is who’s moving first. Individual investors – often called “dumb money” by Wall Street professionals for supposedly making poor timing decisions – have actually been ahead of the curve this year. Their steady buying during the first six months helped drive a rally that many professional investors initially doubted. When markets fell in April due to tariff worries, retail traders were among the first to jump back into risky investments. For the week, the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, marking its first decline in a month. The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 also posted its first down week since late August, falling 0.5%. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF slipped for a second straight week. Crypto crash wipes out $300 billion As Cryptopolitan reported, cryptocurrency markets added to the cautious mood this week. Digital assets lost roughly $300 billion in value as leveraged positions unwound, forcing sales that pushed Bitcoin and Ether sharply lower in one of the most volatile stretches since the summer. Though prices recovered by Friday, the magnitude of the decline and doubts about business interest could pressure individual investors who had accumulated substantial profits this year. Whether driven by gut feeling or exhaustion, the retreat may signal a broader rethinking of risk. But in markets this elevated, even small mistakes or poorly timed exits can prove costly. No signs point to a major downturn yet, but conditions appear more delicate than before. Money is flowing into safer investments – cash-like funds, gold, and volatility products – at the fastest pace in months. Together, these movements suggest markets are quietly adjusting, with speculative betting retreating even as core investments hold steady. Investment firms are making adjustments, too. Lido Advisors, which manages $30 billion, has added protective strategies like selling covered calls for income and buying put spreads as insurance against losses.

The meme coin is currently approaching a high-confluence support zone, sitting at the intersection of a three-month-long trendline and a key Fibonacci retracement level – both converging near the apex of a possible breakout. Whales appear to be positioning ahead of the move. Since PEPE’s recent local top, the top 100 wallets have increased their holdings by over 6 trillion tokens , according to Nansen data . Pepe whales accumulate alongside correction. Source: Nansen. This show of conviction comes as market narratives continue to favor a Q4 bull run. With U.S. inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for further interest rate cuts are strengthening, with the potential to stimulate capital rotation into riskier plays like Pepe. Pepe Price Prediction: Confluence Zone Eyes 100% Move This confluence zone set up the potential breakout of a bullish pennant pattern forming since the May pepe price bull run. The pattern’s upper resistance and lower support are converging toward an apex, with a strong confluence of support acting as a launchpad for the next retest. The 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, often a bottom marker in steep corrections, aligns with a 3-month support level around $0.000009, creating a compelling setup for a bounce. Momentum indicators strengthen the bullish case. The RSI has found footing just above the oversold threshold at 30, signaling buyers may be stepping back in. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is flattening below the signal line, suggesting the early stages of a potential uptrend. If buy pressure builds, a successful breakout attempt would target $0.000019 for a possible 100% gain —a 2x move from current prices. Stronger catalysts, however, could extend the rally. With U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approval on the table under new SEC listing standards, Pepe could retest its all-time high at $0.000029. That would mark a 220% surge and potentially push the price into new discovery before year-end. This New ICO is Bringing Passive Income to Pepe For large-cap meme coins like Pepe, big gains are slow to arrive. This 2x setup has been almost 5 months in the making. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is the first mine-to-earn meme coin that lets anyone build virtual mining rigs to earn rewards – no expensive hardware or technical skills needed. Instead of waiting for the token to launch, early investors can jump into the action right away. The project gamifies crypto mining by allowing users to set up and upgrade digital rigs, which generate passive rewards in the form of popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. It’s a fresh twist on mining – fun, interactive, and built for the degens who don’t want to sit on idle bags during a presale. Built-in deflation strengthens the model. Every $PEPENODE spent on rigs or nodes undergoes a 70% burn, creating long-term scarcity while boosting returns. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has topped $1.4 million in early weeks, and early stakers are still locking in a huge 913% APY. Join the $PEPENODE presale now on the official website to start mining. The current offering is $0.0010745 per token, but the clock’s ticking on the next price increase. To stay updated, you can also follow PepeNode on X (formerly Twitter) .

HSBC announced it successfully tested quantum computing for algorithmic bond trading, boosting prediction accuracy by 34%. While the bank called it an early experiment, the test raised questions about long-term cryptographic security. “Q-Day” — the moment when quantum computing could break existing encryption — may arrive as soon as 2030, according to some developers. For Bitcoin, the shift underscores the need for quantum-resistant upgrades, a move that could enhance confidence in its resilience as a store of value. Kraken’s $500M Raise Fuels IPO Talk Investor confidence in crypto infrastructure is building. Kraken reportedly raised $500 million at a $15 billion valuation, according to Fortune. Though the exchange hasn’t filed an S-1 with the SEC, stronger financial disclosures hint at IPO preparation. JUST IN: #Bitcoin and crypto exchange Kraken raises $500 million at a $15 billion valuation. We are going mainstream pic.twitter.com/cUZ6CbLrCd — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 26, 2025 Founded in 2011, Kraken processes about $1.9 billion in daily trading volume, ranking among the top 15 global exchanges. Its raise follows a surge in crypto IPOs: Gemini’s Nasdaq launch was 20 times oversubscribed, Circle doubled its $1 billion valuation on debut, and blockchain lender Figure saw similarly strong demand. This trend highlights growing institutional appetite for regulated, mainstream crypto exposure — a factor that could feed into stronger Bitcoin demand. BlackRock’s Yield ETF Signals Institutional Shift BlackRock, which manages more than $9 trillion in assets, is preparing to launch the Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. Unlike its $87 billion iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), the new product will sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures to generate yield for investors. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas dubbed it a “ sequel to IBIT ,” pointing out BlackRock’s deliberate focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum while avoiding altcoin ETFs. The move could solve a long-standing critique that Bitcoin lacks income generation, potentially broadening its appeal to pension funds and income-focused investors. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels to Watch Technically, Bitcoin remains under pressure. On the 4-hour chart, price action has broken below a descending channel and failed to reclaim the 50- and 100-SMAs near $113,500. Lower highs continue to define the structure, signaling persistent bearish control. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns reinforce this bias. A shooting star at $116,000 sparked a reversal, followed by bearish engulfing candles and a “three black crows” formation — a textbook continuation signal. The RSI sits near 32, showing oversold conditions but with no bullish divergence. Support rests at $107,300, with further downside targets at $105,200 and $102,800 if momentum persists. Short bias remains below $113,000 First downside target: $107,300 Extended levels: $105,200–$102,800 For novices, think of this as a staircase trending down. Each bounce has been weaker, showing buyers can’t regain control unless Bitcoin closes decisively above $113,000. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $18.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012985—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The company announced the completion of its first $30 million Toncoin purchase on Thursday. AlphaTON has become one of the largest holders of Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network. The company said its goal is to grow its Toncoin treasury to $100 million by the end of 2025. AlphaTON wants to invest $100M in Toncoin The Nasdaq-listed company closed a $71 million financing round back in early September. The financing round included a $36.2 million private placement of 6.32 million shares. In addition, AlphaTON secured a $35 million loan facility with BitGo Prime. The ex-biotech company stated that it aims to acquire $100 million worth of Toncoin (TON). In the release, AlphaTon announced, “A financing to acquire ~$100 million TON tokens and establish a specialized digital asset treasury company dedicated to building a strategic TON reserve and providing public markets access to Telegram’s rapidly expanding ecosystem of more than a billion monthly active users.” Beyond accumulating Toncoin, AlphaTon wants to generate yield revenue via blockchain validation and staking rewards. The new DAT also wants to back projects within Telegram’s mini-app and DeFi ecosystems. AlphaTon has strategic crypto partners and advisors, including BitGo, Animoca Brands, Kraken, SkyBridge Capital, and Crypto.com, among others. The company is led by CEO Brittany Kaiser, a former director at Gryphon Digital Mining . Executive Chairman Enzo Villani, co-founder of Nasdaq Global Corporate Solutions, is also part of AlphaTon’s leadership. Kaiser said , “Today marks a pivotal moment in AlphaTON Capital’s journey as we officially establish ourselves as a premier digital asset treasury company with substantial TON holdings.” AlphaTon is following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy playbook, but through Toncoin. The Nasdaq-listed firm is copying Ton Strategy, which is another firm that accumulated more than $700 million in TON last month. AlphaTON’s stock closed at $5.77 on Friday. The stock slipped by around 9.8% from the previous session based on data from Yahoo Finance. On the other hand, Toncoin (TON) is currently trading at $2.75. The token has a 24-hour trading volume of $139.9 million and a market capitalization of $6.99 billion based on aggregated data from CoinGecko. Toncoin surged massively during Telegram’s mini-game boom in 2024. The token recorded an all-time high of $8.25 but has since fallen about 60% from its peak. The coin now ranks 32nd by market cap.

While liquidations have sent the crypto market lower yet again today, the market is in a strong position to bounce back once the SEC approvals begin coming in. And this particularly applies to XRP, Pepe and Cardano, which DeepSeek AI predicts could smash their current ATHs in the final weeks of 2025, especially when regulatory and business conditions have become much more favorable in recent months. Ripple ($XRP): DeepSeek AI Predicts Potential Run to $7 As Ripple Captures Cross-Border Market DeepSeek is particularly bullish about XRP, which it says could rise as high as $7 by 2026, almost doubling its current ATH ($3.65). The Chinese AI cites the resolution of the Ripple-SEC case as a major factor in XRP’s growth, suggesting that this gives Ripple the launchpad from which to capture a significant chunk of the cross-border payments market. And Ripple is doing just this at the moment, having signed numerous partnerships in recent months, having made acquisitions , and having expanded into new territories . This leaves XRP in a supremely strong position, with its chart today suggesting that it’s close to rebounding. Source: TradingView Its indicators are all in oversold positions, meaning that it’s selling at a discount and that positive movement isn’t far away. It may return to strong growth as and when the SEC approves one or more of the XRP ETF applications waiting for a decision. There’s little doubt that it will beat its current ATH by the end of the year, although a bull rally could send it even higher. Pepe ($PEPE): DeepSeek AI Predicts 229% Increase for Popular Meme Coin Citing the potential for “meme coin dynamics and viral sentiment,” DeepSeek AI predicts that PEPE could rise as high as $0.000030 by 2026, making for a 229% increase over its current price of $0.00000910. DeepSeek suggests that endorsements from high-profile influencers and even celebrities could drive the PEPE price higher, while also proposing that social media-based FOMO could boost the meme token. What DeepSeek doesn’t mention, however, is that PEPE remains a favorite vehicle among whales, who continue to buy the token and pump its price . As such, there’s a very real chance that the coin could rally hard if the market enters an end-of-year buy rally, especially one that follows a wave of ETF approvals. And there’s an argument that DeepSeek was somewhat conservative in its price prediction, given that PEPE’s all-time high is already $0.00002803. A particularly bullish market could see it eclipse this price, and potentially rise towards $0.00010. Cardano ($ADA): DeepSeek AI Predicts Rally to $12 Amid Growth in Ecosystem Asked to provide a very bullish prediction for Cardano, DeepSeek suggested that it could hit $12 within the next few months, making for a 1,472% increase over ADA’s current price. Such a prediction is based on Cardano’s growth into “a dominant force in decentralized finance and real-world governance,” including the development of dApps running on Cardano. It may seem that Cardano is some way off such a scenario, yet its TVL has been growing steadily in recent years, rising from $50 million in January 2023 to $317 million today . It also continues to roll out new updates and attract new projects to its ecosystem , which could soon attract genuine adoption and usage. On top of this, Grayscale has applied to launch a Cardano ETF, and if it gains approval this could send ADA much higher. As such, ADA’s current oversold position could mean that we’re about to see it surge upwards, crossing $1 in a few weeks before challenging its current ATH of $3.09. And while our chart above sets a target of $4 for the end of the year, DeepSeek believes it could rise even higher. Maxi Doge: Ultra-Bullish Meme Token Raises $2.5 Million in Hugely Popular Sale While DeepSeek has provided very encouraging predictions for the three tokens above, traders may also be interested in diversifying into newer, low-cap coins, which could also enjoy huge rallies towards the end of the year. Such coins also include presale tokens, which have the advantage of starting from a low base, meaning that big gains can be possible in a short space of time. A great example of a new coin holding its presale is Maxi Doge ($MAXI), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $2.5 million. In a sea of red, hold the green fam. pic.twitter.com/TKpRKiyiZ4 — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) September 25, 2025 This provides a bullish sign of its emerging popularity, with Maxi Doge attracting investors by virtue of its unique spin on the familiar Dogecoin-themed template. Boasting a perma-bull trading theme, Maxi Doge is building an online community that will meet on its Discord and Telegram channels, where they’ll have the opportunity to share trading tip and coordinate collective action. Maxi Doge’s social channels will also host regular trading competitions, enabling community members to compete to see who can earn the biggest profits in a given amount of time. Winners will receive rewards in the form of MAXI, which will comes with a total capped supply of 150.24 billion tokens. Holders of MAXI will be able to stake the token for regular staking yields, while Maxi Doge will be retaining 25% of its supply for its Maxi Fund. This fund will support new partnerships and publicity initiatives, something which should help to keep Maxi Doge in the public eye, and to grow its base. Investors can join the coin’s presale by visiting the Maxi Doge website , where MAXI currently costs $0.000259. Investors should act quickly, however, since this price will rise later today and will continue to rise until the sale ends.

Is this DEX’s sudden dominance enough to justify a bullish Aster price prediction ? Looking at data from DeFi Llama, Aster has surpassed top perps DEXs by a long shot. In terms of 24-hour volumes, the latter processed $46 billion worth of transactions during this period, while Lighter and Hyperliquid transacted $18 billion and $17 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, in the past 7 days, Aster’s volumes have surpassed the $100 billion mark, nearly doubling the amount processed through Hyperliquid. Competition in the perps market seems to be heating up. Aster has used incentives to lure traders and bring in higher volumes within its platform. Although some detractors within the community have questioned its strategy, the results seem to justify its approach as the protocol is now the leader of the derivatives market among DEXs with a 72% market share according to data from CoinMarketCap. Aster Price Prediction: Flipping Hyperliquid Would Mean a 350% Gain for $ASTER $ASTER has booked a 205% gain in the past 7 days. The token rose strongly and hit a peak at around $2.4. Looking at the 1-hour chart, the key area of support to watch after this recent pullback is the $1.75 level from which ASTER has bounced multiple times already. If this support bounce ignites a new leg up, Aster could aim at $4 next. Its market cap currently sits at $3 billion compared to Hyperliquid’s $13.8 billion. If the protocol manages to maintain its dominance in the perps market, we could see it catching up to its competitor, meaning an upside potential of around 350% at least. Rising stars like ASTER usually pop up during bull markets, and scooping up these tokens during their early presales could result in big gains. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) seems to be one of these hidden gems. This mine-to-earn (M2E) game offers attractive rewards and a fun environment that could soon attract thousands of players eager to climb the leaderboard. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Brings In $1.4M to Turn Meme Coin Investing into a Mining Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) isn’t just another Pepe clone. It is an interactive mine-to-earn (M2E) game that hands out attractive rewards as top miners climb the leaderboard. Players can build virtual mining nodes, buy as many rigs as they want, upgrade their setups, and collect rewards along the way. The more powerful your nodes are, the greater your earning potential, while top miners unlock bonus meme coin airdrops like $PEPE and $BONK. With over $1.4 million raised in under two months, $PEPENODE has already proven it can keep users engaged long before top exchanges pick it up. To buy $PEPENODE at its presale price, visit the official Pepenode website , and link a wallet like Best Wallet . You can choose to swap crypto like USDT or ETH, or use a bank card to invest.

The video game publisher launched College Football 26 in July, following last year’s edition’s success. College Football 25 became one of 2024’s best-selling releases. The first trailer for Battlefield 6 was also revealed, with plans for release in the current fiscal year. The release may receive a positive outlook as the company plans to transition the franchise following last year’s edition market flop. Electronic Arts ‘ games struggled financially in the first half of this year despite posting strong titles. The latest Q3, 2025 financial results release i n February showed that the company recorded a 6.4% drop in revenue year over year. The firm attributed the decline to weak sales of its FC 25 game and new Dragon Age title. It added that there have been uncertainties in the consumer spending section for its core games amid challenging markets. EA Sports had forecast Q2 results below Wall Street estimates, further driving down the investor confidence in its stock performance. Saudi PIF and Silver Lake among investors circling EA privatization deal To improve investor appetite for its stock, the video game publisher announced a $1 billion stock buyback plan as part of a $5 billion authorization. The buyback was expected to bring in at least $2.5 billion. According to Investgame r esearch , at least $21 billion has been directed into the gaming sector since 2018 by private equity firms and global wealth funds, with 68 deals recorded through that period. The research revealed that the inflows have been supported by the live service models and digital storefronts. In line with that trend, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake have been captured as interested parties in the deal to acquire EA Sports. Other mentions include Dell Technologies, Endeavour, and AMC Entertainment. Elsewhere, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, and Take-Two Interactive acquired Zynga in a $12.7 billion deal. Savvy Games Group purchased $4.9 billion of Scopely in the private equity section, while CVC invested $1.3 billion in Dream Games.

Related Reading: Institutional Investors Are Heavily Accumulating XRP And Solana – Here Are The Numbers Notably, the CME XRP futures crossed $1 billion in open interest (OI) last month, with the altcoin becoming the fastest-ever contract to do so, having hit the mark in just three months. Amid the demand for the altcoin on the derivatives exchange, CME has announced plans to launch options trading on the XRP futures on October 13. This is expected to further boost the demand on the CME exchange, which is a positive for the altcoin. This new milestone for XRP futures comes just ahead of the potential launch of XRP ETFs under the 33 Act, which will also elevate institutional interest in the altcoin. Fund issuers are expected to file amendments for their respective funds as soon as the end of this week. This comes amid the SEC’s approval of the generic listing standards, which could enable these XRP ETFs to launch earlier. If that doesn’t happen, the focus will shift to Grayscale’s October 18 deadline, which is the first final deadline among all seven XRP filings. The commission could approve these funds simultaneously, just as it did with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Massive Demand Expected For The ETFs It is worth mentioning that market expert Nate Geraci had previously alluded to the success of the CME XRP futures as one of the reasons he believes people are underestimating the demand the spot XRP ETFs may record. He also noted at the time that there was already over $800 million in futures-based XRP ETFs. Related Reading: XRP Goes Head-To-Head With Bitcoin In This Metric As South Korean Market Wakes Up In another X post, Geraci doubled down on his statement that people are “severely” underestimating the investor demand for the spot XRP ETFs. He noted how a similar thing happened with the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have so far exceeded expectations. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg also has high expectations for the XRP ETFs, predicting that they could record up to $5 billion in inflows in their first month. He also believes that they could outperform the Ethereum ETFs in the process. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $2.75, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

52310651,https://cryptonews.com/?p=429001,1758926100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52310651.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 26 September – XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-26-september-xrp-dogecoin-cardano/,"The market’s total cap has fallen by 2% in the past 24 hours, having serious implications for the crypto price prediction for XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano. All cryptocurrencies are now worth a combined total of $3.849 trillion, having stood at $4.2 trillion only a week ago. And some coins – such as Aster, Story and Avalanche – have suffered more than others, cancelling out the gains they had made in previous days. However, the ongoing selloff is likely to be positive in terms of the crypto price prediction for XRP, Dogecoin and Cardano, making a rebound increasingly likely. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Ripple Expansion and ETFs Point to New Record Highs Soon XRP has fallen to $2.76 today, confirming a 2.5% loss in 24 hours and a 10% decline in a fortnight. These are steep losses, yet XRP’s fundamental position hasn’t changed during the current downturn, which has been a market-wide phenomenon ( related partly to liquidations ). And this fundamental position is very strong, with Ripple continuing to expand as a cross-border payments business, and with XRP expecting a wave of ETF approvals very soon. Given these factors, XRP’s current chart is therefore very positive, since traders who buy now may be in for big gains over the coming weeks. Source: TradingView Its main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are now very close to bottoming out, while it’s also forming a bullish pennant, from which it could break out soon. This means that, as and when the SEC approves the waiting XRP ETFs, the coin’s price could rally vigorously. It has every chance of returning to $3 in October, while an end-of-year bull rally could see it smash its ATH and rise beyond $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETFs Injecting New Life into Long-Running Meme Token At $0.2267, Dogecoin is down by 3% in 24 hours and by 17% in the past week, although it does hold on to a 3.5% gain in a month. Despite the recent losses, DOGE is also in a very good position, not least because the first Dogecoin ETF – the Rex-Osprey DOGE fund – launched last week . And more Dogecoin ETFs are on the way, with Bloomberg analysts giving the waiting Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares DOGE ETFs a 90% chance of approval . This is extremely bullish, and it means that the Dogecoin price could surge in the event of the above ETFs gaining approval. Source: TradingView If we look at DOGE’s indicators, we see that they’re also moving towards bottoms, pulling the token towards a heavily discounted price that will eventually attract a new wave of buyers. Assuming that the ETFs do obtain the green light, then the coin could reach $0.30 in a matter of days, before climbing back towards its ATH of $0.7316 in the final month of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Layer-One Network Growth Lays Foundation for Big End-of-Year Gains As for ADA, it too has suffered a fall in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.7757 and also falling by 14% in a week. It is, however, still up by 95% in the past year, providing it with a good base from which to grow further towards the end of the year. And while it boasts only 1 ETF application, the fact that this application is from Grayscale gives it prospects for approval. Similarly, because ADA is a relatively small major token (volume at $1.9 billion), the launch of the Grayscale ADA ETF could send it flying. Source: TradingView Its indicators are all sitting in oversold areas, while it remains down by 75% in relation to its ATH of $3.09, meaning that it could grow rapidly once a serious rally starts. Based on this, the crypto price prediction for Cardano looks very good, with the alt on track to pass $1 in the next few weeks, and then close 2025 above $3. This is particularly the case when Cardano remains one of the biggest and most promising layer-one networks in crypto, with its platform under constant development and growth . PEPENODE Raises $1.45 Million in Fast-Paced Presale: Here’s Why Mine-to-Earn Token Could Be Big As good as the three coins above look, traders may want to diversify their portfolios in preparation for the coming end-of-year bull rally, since smaller tokens can outperform more established cryptos. Diversification may also include a smattering of presale coins, since the biggest and most popular of these can rally strongly once they list for the first time. Possibly the most interesting presale token available right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a mine-to-earn token that has now raised $1.45 million in its ICO. This Pepe will chase those Nodes wherever they may take him. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/p2owUBP3kJ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 25, 2025 This is an encouraging figure, especially since its sale opened only a few weeks ago, and it suggests that PEPENODE could become very big once it launches. As a mine-to-earn token, it provides holders with the ability to grow their own virtual mining rigs, which they can use to earn rewards in major tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin. They can grow their rigs by buying additional nodes using PEPENODE, meaning that the coin could experience lots of demand as users make their rigs bigger. Holders can also stake PEPENODE for big staking returns, with the current yield at just above 900%. This is very attractive, and it could mean that demand for the coin will be massive. Investors can get ahead of the curve by joining the token’s presale, which they can do by going to the PEPENODE website . PEPENODE is currently selling at $0.0010745, although this price will continue to rise as the sale progresses.

The company is testing whether its core messaging system, the mechanism that allows more than 11,000 banks to securely talk to each other, could one day run on-chain. The experiment, reported by Grégory Raymond of The Big Whale on X , brings heavyweight partners to the table. BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and several global banks are already involved. For now, it’s still early days as the pilot will reportedly take months before results surface. But one banker close to the project described it as “an important technological transformation for the international interbank payments industry.” Why is Swift considering Linea? Swift’s current system is well-trusted but also criticized by those who claim that it’s expensive, often slow, and heavily reliant on intermediaries. In an era where money and assets are going digital, that centralization is starting to look like a weakness. The fast settlement that’s seen in decentralized transactions has led to people calling for increased usage of blockchain technology. Enter Linea, an Ethereum layer-2 network built by Consensys, the same team behind MetaMask . The appeal lies in its ability to keep data private through advanced cryptography, a must-have for institutions bound by strict regulations. The choice also ties in with Swift’s long-term digital asset push. Last year, it announced trials for central bank digital currencies and tokenized assets. Now, by bringing Linea into the mix, Swift seems willing to test whether blockchain can overhaul its very core: the messaging rails themselves. Why banks are paying attention For big names like BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, this is more than tinkering with new tech. If blockchain-based messaging works, it could merge communications and settlement into a single, seamless layer. That means lower costs and fewer delays. It also helps them keep pace with challengers like Ripple , which has long argued its blockchain system can outdo Swift’s legacy model. But change won’t be easy. Integrating blockchain into existing systems will require time, investment and regulatory patience. Questions remain around how such a system would perform at the scale Swift operates, and whether regulators across the US, EU and Asia would be comfortable with it. Swift has always moved carefully. Over the past few years, it has tested APIs, dabbled with AI to fight fraud, and explored tokenized asset transfers. Partnering with Linea fits this pattern: try a controlled, private environment before scaling anything to the public. If the pilot succeeds, it could become one of the largest real-world blockchain deployments yet. It would also send a strong signal to the rest of the financial industry that blockchain isn’t just for niche use cases anymore — it’s ready to power the systems that move trillions of dollars every day.

A Malaysian trade ministry official told reporters Friday that the country wants zero tariffs on furniture, car parts, and airplane components it ships to America. The official also said Washington has agreed to look at removing tariffs on items the US doesn’t make itself, like cocoa and palm oil. A final decision on these products should come next month. This request comes as Trump announced Thursday he’s putting hefty new tariffs on various imported goods. Kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities from overseas will face a 50% tax, while imported couches, chairs, and other padded furniture will get hit with a 30% tariff. The two countries are trying to wrap up a tariff deal after the US slapped a 19% tax on Malaysian goods back in August. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim wrote on Facebook Thursday that both sides want to finish an agreement before Trump visits Kuala Lumpur in October for a meeting with Southeast Asian leaders. Trump’s latest tariff announcement covers a wide range of products The president said he’s putting a 100% tariff on brand-name medicines and a 25% tax on big trucks coming into the country. He claims these steps will protect American factories and keep the nation safe. These new trade barriers add to the many tariffs Trump has already put in place, some reaching as high as 50% on certain goods. The president has also targeted steel imports and other products from various trading partners. Companies around the world are already dealing with messed-up supply chains, rising costs, and worried customers because of the ongoing trade fights. The Federal Reserve has said these tariffs are also pushing up prices for American shoppers. Financial experts say Trump is now using more traditional legal methods for his trade actions. This shift comes as the Supreme Court is looking at whether his global tariffs are legal in the first place. The new tariff announcements end a quieter period that started when Trump made trade deals with some important partners over the summer. During the spring, Trump was announcing new import taxes almost every week, which made businesses nervous about planning ahead. Tom Barkin from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond told Bloomberg TV that new tariff announcements in specific industries definitely cause setbacks. He noted that some sectors have more clarity about trade rules while others are still uncertain. Stock markets in Asia dropped Friday, with drug companies taking the biggest hits. European markets bounced back from early losses as investors tried to figure out how widely the new tariffs might apply. American stock futures showed mixed results, suggesting investors aren’t too worried about Trump’s latest trade moves, according to BMO Economics. The firm said investors seem willing to stay calm as long as the US economy doesn’t show more serious damage from the trade war. Trump’s announcement on his social media platform didn’t explain whether these new tariffs would be added to existing ones. Recent trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and Britain include rules that limit how high tariffs can go on specific products like medicines. The EU and US made a preliminary deal that would cap tariffs at 15%, though Trump hasn’t signed an official order yet. The European Commission said Friday the agreement clearly sets a 15% ceiling on all tariffs. Claudio Feltrin, who leads Italy’s furniture industry group, worried the tariffs could cause a rush of imports from China and other countries looking for new markets to sell their goods. Japan has a deal ensuring its tariff rates won’t be higher than what the EU and other partners pay, according to Tokyo’s trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa.

After reaching a new all-time high of around $4,950 on August 24, ETH has now shed more than 22% of its value, slipping below the psychological $4,000 level. The steep pullback has left many investors in difficult positions, with some of the largest players in the market also feeling the impact. According to top analyst Maartunn, even BitMine, one of the largest institutional holders of Ethereum, has seen its ETH position dip below its on-chain cost basis. This marks a critical moment, as whales typically act as stabilizers during corrections, and their unrealized losses reflect the depth of current market stress. Despite this downturn, some analysts argue that Ethereum’s retracement may represent a healthy reset after weeks of overheated momentum. Corrections of this scale are not unusual following parabolic rallies and often serve to shake out excess leverage before setting up for longer-term stability. Still, with sentiment fragile and selling pressure mounting, the coming days will be pivotal for ETH as it tests key support levels and investors closely monitor whale behavior for signs of renewed confidence. BitMine’s ETH Play Falls Below Cost Basis According to top analyst Maartunn, Ethereum’s correction has placed one of the market’s largest institutional holders under heavy pressure. BitMine’s ETH portfolio , valued at roughly $7.5 billion, has just dipped below its on-chain cost basis around the $4,000 level. This development underscores the severity of the recent downturn and highlights that even large-scale players are not immune to the pain of corrections. Maartunn emphasizes that this stage of the market is less about timing the perfect entry or exit and more about endurance. As he put it, “It’s about who can hold their breath the longest.” The remark reflects a broader sentiment among analysts who view the current environment as a psychological test for both retail and institutional investors. With volatility high and sentiment deteriorating, the ability to withstand drawdowns may determine who ultimately benefits from the next phase of Ethereum’s cycle. The outlook remains divided. Optimists argue that this is a necessary pullback before Ethereum gears up for a massive leg higher, supported by growing institutional adoption and strong long-term fundamentals. On the other hand, cautious voices warn of a deeper correction, noting that breaking below critical support levels could trigger further downside. The coming weeks will likely prove decisive. If ETH can stabilize above the $3,800–$4,000 range, confidence may return quickly. However, if selling pressure intensifies, the market could face an extended period of uncertainty before momentum rebuilds. Bulls Struggle To Find Support Ethereum (ETH) has broken below the critical $4,000 level, now trading around $3,891, as shown on the 12-hour chart. This decline marks a continuation of the bearish trend that started after the September peak near $4,950. The breakdown has been accompanied by rising trading volume, confirming strong selling pressure and suggesting that bears currently dominate the market. The 50-day EMA has crossed below the $4,400 zone, reinforcing near-term weakness, while the 200-day EMA around $3,650 now acts as the next major support level. The price action shows a decisive rejection from the $4,600–$4,800 resistance range earlier this month, followed by a steep selloff that erased more than 20% of ETH’s value. If ETH holds above the $3,850–$3,900 zone, it could attempt a rebound and retest the $4,200 resistance. However, failure to defend this range risks further downside toward $3,650–$3,700, where the 200-day EMA and previous accumulation levels converge. Ethereum is in a corrective phase, but the volume spike suggests potential exhaustion of sellers. The coming sessions will determine whether bulls can reclaim $4,000 to stabilize momentum or if further capitulation is ahead.

However, the company now faces the challenge of making CEO Sam Altman’s expensive plans work in reality. The company behind ChatGPT rolled out a series of partnerships this week that involve enormous amounts of money and put OpenAI at the heart of the next generation of machine learning systems. The announcements started Monday when Nvidia said it would put up to $100 billion toward helping OpenAI create data center space filled with millions of graphics processing units. The next day, OpenAI shared details about a bigger agreement with Oracle and SoftBank, expanding what they call the “Stargate” project into a $400 billion promise spread across several stages and locations. On Thursday, OpenAI added a business partnership with Databricks, showing the company wants to reach more corporate customers. The company, best known for its ChatGPT chat program and GPT language models, wants to become much more than that. OpenAI hopes to join the ranks of major cloud computing companies, even though it spends billions of dollars and depends completely on money from investors to keep growing. The company’s building plans would need enough electricity to power more than 13 million American homes. Altman has said for a long time that creating the next level of AI technology will need much more computer infrastructure than what exists now. OpenAI says it’s simply meeting customer demand, which keeps growing. The company believes these investments will eventually make money. Inside sources say OpenAI expects to bring in $125 billion in revenue by 2029, based on the company’s own predictions. Major infrastructure challenges ahead But this strategy comes with big risks when it comes to actually building everything. Creating 17 gigawatts of power capacity would need about 17 nuclear power plants, and each one takes at least ten years to build. OpenAI representatives say they’re talking with hundreds of infrastructure companies across North America, but nothing is set in stone yet. The American power grid already has problems, gas turbines are sold out until 2028, nuclear power takes a long time to set up, and renewable energy projects face political obstacles. “I am extremely bullish about nuclear, advanced fission, fusion,” Altman said. “We should build more … a lot more of the current generation of fission plants, given the needs for dense, dense energy.” This week made clear just how big Altman’s plans really are, as the OpenAI CEO started putting specific numbers on his ideas, some of them huge. Industry experts back bold strategy “Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there’s so much infrastructure that’s required, and this is a small sample of it,” Altman said Tuesday at OpenAI’s first Stargate location in Abilene, Texas. This approach – direct, ambitious, and ignoring traditional thinking – has marked how Altman leads during this new period. Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, said OpenAI’s infrastructure partnerships with Oracle might look extreme to some people, but he sees it differently. “I don’t see this as crazy. I see it as existential for the race to superintelligence,” he said. Das explained that data and computing power are the two most important things for making AI bigger, and he praised Altman for understanding early how much infrastructure would be needed. “One of his gifts is reading the exponential and planning for it,” he added. Past breakthroughs in AI haven’t come from better computer programs, he said, but from having access to massive computing power. That’s why companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are all trying to build bigger systems.

SHIB’s deflationary model relies on regular burns, where tokens are permanently removed from circulation using transaction fees collected from trades. While 7 million tokens may seem small compared to the massive 589.55 trillion total supply, every burn event helps ease selling pressure and reinforces long-term scarcity. In the past 7 days, SHIB has booked a 10.7% loss as cryptocurrencies as a whole have retreated following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates by 25 basis points last week. Other assets in the meme coin category, like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Pepe ($PEPE), have booked higher losses of 17% each. This indicates an ongoing correction that will probably bring late buyers to this bull market. Trading volumes have jumped by 41% in the past 24 hours. If transaction volumes keep rising, this could lead to a higher burn rate that could further reduce the number of tokens in circulation. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Breaks Below Key Support – When Will It Recover? This week’s selling spree has pushed SHIB to break its trend line support. As a result, the token could now be heading to retest the $0.000010 level before it begins to recover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved below the 14-day moving average in the daily chart. This is usually interpreted as a sell signal. Once SHIB hits that psychological threshold, we could expect an explosive move as market conditions still favor a bullish outlook for cryptos as a whole. As altcoin season kicks off, meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) should outperform well-established tokens like BTC and ETH. However, hidden gems like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could deliver higher returns as this early crypto presale is still flying below the market’s radar. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings High-Leverage Trading to the Meme World Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme coin that embraces the typical hype that comes with bull markets. Instead of offering traditional utility, $MAXI doubles down on culture. Holders get an entry ticket to Community Alpha , an idea hub where retail traders can share insights and compare strategies. The token also fuels weekly competitions and themed challenges (like Max Gains and Max Ripped), where top ROI hunters can earn rewards and climb the leaderboard. In addition, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds to the most promising tokens of this cycle with 1000X leverage to max out results. As its powerful community-centered ideas gain popularity, the demand for this meme coin should skyrocket. To buy $MAXI, simply head to the Maxi Doge website and link an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-could-be-set-to-dominate-the-market-heres-why/,"A market analyst has highlighted a technical structure suggesting that XRP’s market dominance could climb to its highest level in six years, a move that may translate into notable price gains if confirmed. Over the past weeks, the broader cryptocurrency market has faced sustained selling pressure, and XRP has mirrored the downtrend. After peaking at $3.187 on September 13, the asset fell below the $3 level on September 21 and has since struggled to regain bullish momentum. Despite this weakness, analyst KriptoMessi argues that historical patterns on the dominance chart point to a potential turnaround. Xrp Dominance Daily Fractal pic.twitter.com/o4a5GlO18z — Kripto Messi (@Kriptomessi) September 24, 2025 Technical Structure Behind the Forecast KriptoMessi notes that XRP’s dominance is currently mirroring a technical pattern that has occurred twice earlier this year. The structure is described as a four-step fractal around a descending trendline. Each cycle has followed a similar sequence: a local high, a decline, a retest of the trendline, and the establishment of a base before a breakout. The first cycle unfolded between March and July. Dominance peaked at 5.35% in mid-March before declining through April and May. After a rebound to 4.63% in May and another rejection, dominance reached a low near 4.04% by late June. A subsequent breakout in early July pushed dominance to 5.53% by July 18, coinciding with XRP’s rally to $3.60. A second cycle emerged in July and August. The 5.53% level in mid-July marked the starting point, followed by another downward stretch. In early August, dominance recovered to 5.17% but failed to break higher. A third retest occurred on September 13 at 4.69%, before dominance slipped again and stabilized around 4.54%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for a Third Breakout KriptoMessi suggests that the latest consolidation could set the stage for another breakout similar to the earlier cycles. If the pattern continues, dominance could rise sharply, potentially reaching 6.19%. This level has not been recorded since 2018 and would represent the strongest expansion of XRP’s market share in years. As of now, the cryptocurrency market’s total capitalization stands at $3.78 trillion, with XRP valued at approximately $170.51 billion. This gives the asset a 4.51% share of the total market. If XRP’s dominance increases to 6.19%, its market cap would rise to approximately $234 billion, potentially driving the price to $3.91. If the wider market also recovers to its August peak of $4.17 trillion, XRP’s market cap could climb even higher to $258 billion. Under such conditions, XRP would be valued at roughly $4.32, marking a new record high. While XRP has recently struggled to maintain upward momentum, technical indicators suggest its dominance could be on the verge of a major shift. If the projected breakout materializes, it could support a meaningful recovery in price, particularly if accompanied by a broader market rebound.

Many investors are feeling the pinch as altcoin prices have seen significant dips recently. However, a fascinating new analysis suggests a turning point might be on the horizon, especially for those holding or looking to acquire altcoins oversold in the current climate. What Does ‘Altcoins Oversold’ Really Mean? The term altcoins oversold refers to a technical analysis condition where the price of an asset has fallen significantly, often below its intrinsic value or recent trading range. This typically indicates that selling pressure has been exhaustive, and a reversal or bounce in price could be imminent. It’s a key indicator many traders look for. According to Negentropic, the X account of Glassnode co-founders Yann Happel and Jan Allemann, altcoins have indeed entered an oversold phase. Their analysis points to an unwinding of excessive leverage in the market, which has contributed to the recent price declines. Think of it as the market shedding its extra weight, preparing for a healthier ascent. Excessive Leverage Unwinds: High leverage can amplify both gains and losses. When prices drop, leveraged positions get liquidated, leading to further selling pressure. This unwinding is often a precursor to market stabilization. Price Correction: This period often follows a rapid run-up, bringing prices back to more sustainable levels. Why Are Altcoins in an Accumulation Zone? Following an oversold phase, assets often enter what analysts call an “accumulation zone.” This is a period where savvy investors and institutions begin to buy up assets, anticipating a future price increase. It’s like collecting valuable items at a discount before their true worth is recognized by the broader market. Negentropic’s insights suggest that many altcoins oversold are now sitting in this crucial accumulation zone. Historically, such periods of consolidation precede an uptrend. It’s not an instant rebound, but rather a gradual build-up of buying interest and demand. This phase is characterized by: Reduced Volatility: Prices tend to stabilize, moving sideways rather than experiencing sharp drops. Increased Buying Interest: Long-term holders and institutional players see these lower prices as attractive entry points. Foundation Building: A strong base is formed, which can support future price growth. Understanding this cycle is vital for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the volatile crypto space. It requires patience and a strategic approach, rather than reacting to short-term market noise. Navigating the Market: Opportunities and Risks for Altcoins While the notion of altcoins oversold entering an accumulation zone sounds promising, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. This period presents both significant opportunities and inherent risks that investors must consider. Potential Opportunities: Bargain Prices: For long-term investors, buying quality altcoins at depressed prices can lead to substantial returns if the anticipated uptrend materializes. Diversification: This could be an opportune time to diversify your portfolio with promising projects that have been unfairly punished by broader market sentiment. Future Growth: Many innovative altcoin projects continue to build and develop, irrespective of short-term price movements. An accumulation phase allows investors to position themselves for their long-term success. Inherent Risks: Further Downside: While oversold, there’s no guarantee prices won’t drop further. Market sentiment can shift unexpectedly, and external factors can impact crypto values. Prolonged Consolidation: The “period of consolidation” mentioned by Negentropic could be longer than anticipated, testing investors’ patience. Project Viability: Not all altcoins will recover. It’s essential to conduct thorough research into the fundamentals of each project you consider. To mitigate risks, consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), where you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This can smooth out your average purchase price over time. Always remember to do your own research (DYOR) and never invest more than you can afford to lose. What’s Next for the Altcoin Market? The analysis by Negentropic suggests that after this period of consolidation, we can expect altcoins to begin an uptrend. This doesn’t mean a straight shot upwards; markets move in waves. However, the foundational work of deleveraging and accumulation sets the stage for potential positive price action. It’s a time for strategic thinking rather than impulsive trading. Keep an eye on on-chain data, market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors. The crypto market is dynamic, and while technical indicators provide valuable insights, they are just one piece of the puzzle. In conclusion, the current state of altcoins oversold presents a compelling narrative for those willing to look beyond the immediate price charts. The insights from Glassnode co-founders highlight a potential shift from capitulation to cautious optimism, paving the way for future growth. Patience, research, and a clear strategy will be your best allies in navigating this exciting phase of the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “oversold” mean in cryptocurrency trading? A1: “Oversold” is a technical indicator suggesting that an asset’s price has fallen significantly, often implying that selling pressure is exhausted and a price reversal or bounce may be near. It doesn’t guarantee a bounce but signals a potential shift. Q2: How is “excessive leverage unwinding” related to altcoins being oversold? A2: Excessive leverage unwinding means that many traders who used borrowed funds to amplify their positions are being forced to sell as prices drop, leading to liquidations. This intensifies selling pressure, driving prices down further, often into oversold territory. Once this unwinding is complete, the market can stabilize. Q3: What is an “accumulation zone” and why is it important for altcoins? A3: An “accumulation zone” is a period after an asset has been oversold, where smart money and long-term investors begin buying, anticipating future price appreciation. It’s important for altcoins because it suggests a potential bottoming process and the building of a strong foundation before a new uptrend begins. Q4: How long does the consolidation period typically last after altcoins are oversold? A4: The duration of a consolidation period can vary widely, from weeks to several months, depending on market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and specific altcoin fundamentals. There’s no fixed timeline, and patience is key during this phase. Q5: What should investors do when altcoins are in an accumulation zone? A5: Investors might consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to buy gradually, conduct thorough research (DYOR) on specific projects, and maintain a long-term perspective. It’s also wise to manage risk by not over-allocating to any single asset and only investing what you can afford to lose.

The global digital assets market surged marginally over the last 24 hours to hover around $3.78 trillion. Bitcoin pushed back over $110,000 while Ether managed to regain $4,000 mark. While the market posted a minor recovery rally, the Fear and Greed depicted among the investors. CoinGlass data shows that more than 133k traders were liquidated over the last 24 hours. The total liquidations turned up around $329 million. The largest single liquidation order of BTC/USDT valued at $3.87 million happened on Binance. $329M wiped out as crypto rebounds Data shows that $186 million worth of liquidated bets (56%) turned out to be long positions. However, Short bets amounted to $143 million. This shows that the crypto market is witnessing heavy fluctuations with pumps and dumps. Cryptopolitan reported that Thursday witnessed $1.1 billion liquidation washout. The recovery coincided with fresh inflation data that matched forecasts. The Fed’s preferred gauge, PCE, rose 2.7% in August, while the core measure was up 2.9%. The numbers were hardly surprising, but they reinforced the sense that price pressures are easing. Analysts suggest that if inflation trends lower, risk assets may find support, but any upside surprises could quickly reset rate cut expectations. Ethereum led the altcoins’ recovery by rising nearly 4%. ETH is down by 18% from its all-time high of above $4,900. Solana and Dogecoin added marginal gains. After a great run, SOL is trailing by 15% in the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $203 at the press time. However, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token was the lone standout in the top tier. It is up by more than 7% and bucking the sea of red. HYPE price is now up by 86% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. It is trading at an average price of $44.64 at the press time. Crypto fear hits 5-month low The Fear and Greed Index dropped to its lowest since April to hit 28 points on the chart. This signals “fear” across the market. Analysts pointed to heavy stress among short-term holders as Bitcoin traded under their cost basis of $109,700 for the first time in five months. Fear and Greed index, Source: CoinMarketCap BTC price has been running down by 6% over the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $109,601 at the press time. The 24-hour trading dipped by 18% to stand at $60.92 billion. Some see a silver lining in the cleanout. Analyst Maartunn, in a post, mentioned that roughly $12 billion in leveraged altcoin bets and $3 billion in speculative Bitcoin positions have been flushed.

The scheme promised profits under the guidance of a person called “Coach Wendy,” whose identity is still unknown. The couple lured investors through real estate connections Michael and Amanda Griffis were real estate agents from Clarksville. They operated a pool called “Blessings of God Thru Crypto” between 2021 and 2023. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said the couple raised more than $6.5 million from around 145 investors. The couple first came under investigation in July 2023, when the CFTC filed a case against them. On Thursday, a US court in Tennessee entered a consent order that resolves the enforcement action. The order requires the fraudsters to pay $5.5 million in restitution to victims. They must also pay a civil monetary penalty of $1.35 million. This makes the total penalty equivalent to $6.8 million. The order further imposes lifetime bans on the couple from commodity trading and CFTC registration. According to court findings, the Griffises used their real estate connections to attract investors. They told clients and acquaintances that funds would be traded in crypto futures through the Apex Trading Platform. They said trades would be supervised by an individual called “Coach Wendy.” The trading commission clarified that Apex was not a legitimate trading platform. It was modeled on an overseas exchange that had no local registration in America . Investigators said they have not been able to find the true identity of “Coach Wendy.” More than $4 million from the scheme was sent overseas after being deposited into the fake website. The couple used the rest of the money to pay personal debts and for shopping. The CFTC said around $855,000 was paid to the investors. Those payments were structured in a Ponzi-like fashion, where earlier investors were repaid using funds from newer investors. CFTC warns the public about crypto fraud The CFTC said the case indicates a wider problem of fraudsters using community trust to run Ponzi schemes. The agency pointed to a Denver pastor and his wife who were recently ordered to repay $3.39 million after raising millions for worthless church tokens. In another case, a Long Island man was hit with a $228 million CFTC judgment. A separate operator received a nine-year prison sentence for a Ponzi scheme that targeted members of a Haitian church community. Experts said investors in the Tennessee duo case may have ignored red flags, such as a website without any registered company details. Fraudsters often look for quick money and plan to exit before being caught. In crypto markets , funds can move across borders quickly, which makes recovery difficult. CFTC officials also warned the public about engaging with unverified investment platforms. Charles Marvine, CFTC chief, said, “If an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is, for you and anyone you bring along.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

He labeled Monaco an “enemy of U.S. national security,” citing her previous roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, including her most recent position as Deputy Attorney General. Trump strongly objected to Monaco’s access to sensitive information, especially in light of Microsoft’s many contracts with multiple U.S. government agencies. He raised the potential that her position at the company might threaten national security. Trump said prior federal law enforcement and her new corporate role posed potential conflicts of interest in connection with classified or sensitive government information, which Monaco was charged with securing, he argued. The demand that she be fired comes during increased political scrutiny on former government officials taking senior roles at private tech firms with government connections. Trump’s comments were announced on his social media platform, Truth Social, which has thousands of followers and will further raise his demand. Trump accuses Monaco of misconduct In his post, Trump made serious accusations about Lisa Monaco, suggesting her conduct in former government posts led to removing her security clearances. He also claimed that Monaco had been kept from federal properties, measures he described as a response to “unjust acts.” Trump also accused Monaco of using an “autopen”, a mechanical device capable of duplicating a signature, to forge President Biden’s name on official government papers. He portrayed this charge as part of what he said was a larger pattern of malfeasance, arguing that her conduct in the past creates fear around trust and federal protocols, and questioning whether such conduct indicates her trustworthiness. Trump has accused Monaco’s corporate appointment of being a national security risk, claiming that her purported history of misconduct should disqualify her for access to sensitive government information. Microsoft declines to comment on Monaco allegations There has been no public response from Microsoft to President Trump’s demands to fire Lisa Monaco. The videos have garnered widespread attention, but Microsoft has not commented on the situation. Monaco, who joined the tech giant in May 2025 as President of Global Affairs, has yet to release any statement on the allegations. Despite the backlash, Microsoft continues collaborating with the U.S. government on other fronts, such as through an ongoing partnership with the Department of Defense and other federal departments . The company recently won huge contracts for cloud services, proving it remains an essential government technology provider. These contracts grant Microsoft broad access to sensitive federal systems, and that context helps frame the national security concerns fueled by Trump. Industry analysts said in an e-mail that Microsoft is fairly open about being used by the government and people in power, and that the company is therefore sensitive to how its leaders behave. They noted that Microsoft often balances providing leadership and responding to public and political criticism. The analysts added that the company’s response, or lack thereof, could influence how government clients and outsiders perceive its management. Unclear at this point whether Microsoft will succumb to Trump’s demand or do anything about Monaco. The circumstances illustrate the increasing public spotlight on former government officials and their entry into prominent roles in private-sector companies with ties to the government.

A significant event has just unfolded that could reshape perceptions for a prominent project. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has successfully executed a substantial WLFI token burn , a strategic move aimed at enhancing the value and scarcity of its native token. What’s Behind the Massive WLFI Token Burn? The World Liberty Financial (WLFI) Foundation, a DeFi project with notable leadership, recently announced on X the successful completion of a major token burn initiative. This strategic move saw a total of 6,923,416 WLFI tokens permanently removed from circulation, demonstrating a strong commitment to their tokenomics. The burn was executed in two distinct phases: Protocol Fee Burn: 3,109,320 WLFI tokens were burned, generated directly from Ethereum and BSC protocol fees. This mechanism ensures that a portion of the network’s activity directly contributes to reducing token supply. Open Market Buyback and Burn: An additional 3,814,095 WLFI tokens were bought back from the open market. This buyback utilized USD1, USDC, and USDT stablecoins, conducted at an average price of approximately $0.2093 per token. This direct market intervention reflects the foundation’s proactive approach to managing token supply. This combined effort brings the total number of tokens burned to over 6.92 million WLFI, following the foundation’s earlier commitment to initiate this buyback and burn program this week. Such initiatives are crucial for long-term project health and investor confidence. Why is a Token Burn Important for WLFI’s Future? Understanding the impact of a WLFI token burn requires a look into fundamental economic principles. When tokens are burned, they are permanently removed from the circulating supply. This reduction in supply, assuming consistent or growing demand, can lead to increased scarcity. Increased scarcity often translates into a higher perceived value for the remaining tokens, potentially benefiting holders. For World Liberty Financial, this action signals several key intentions: Value Enhancement: By reducing the total supply, the foundation aims to bolster the value proposition of each remaining WLFI token. Deflationary Mechanism: Regular token burns introduce a deflationary aspect to the tokenomics, which can be attractive to investors seeking assets with controlled supply. Investor Confidence: Proactive measures like buybacks and burns demonstrate a project’s commitment to its token holders and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. It shows that the team is actively working to create value. This commitment to managing token supply is a critical factor for any DeFi project striving for stability and growth in a dynamic market. How Does This Strategic WLFI Token Burn Impact the Ecosystem? The recent WLFI token burn by World Liberty Financial has immediate and long-term implications for its entire ecosystem. For participants within the Ethereum and BSC protocols, the fee burn mechanism means that network activity directly contributes to the token’s scarcity, aligning user engagement with token value. Moreover, the open market buyback injects demand directly into the market, which can help stabilize or even appreciate the token’s price in the short term. Beyond immediate price action, this initiative fosters a sense of transparency and accountability. The foundation’s announcement on X, detailing the specific amounts and sources of the burn, builds trust within the community. It reinforces the idea that the project is managed with clear objectives and a focus on sustainable growth. As a result, the WLFI ecosystem becomes more robust, attracting new users and investors who are looking for projects with strong fundamentals and transparent operations. Looking Ahead: The Future of World Liberty Financial Post-Burn The successful execution of this significant WLFI token burn marks a pivotal moment for World Liberty Financial. It underscores a clear strategy to manage token supply and enhance long-term value. This action is not merely a one-off event but rather an indicator of a well-thought-out tokenomics model designed to support the project’s growth and stability in the competitive DeFi landscape. Investors and community members will likely watch closely for future buyback and burn announcements, as these programs often become a recurring feature in projects committed to deflationary models. The foundation’s ongoing efforts to create a sustainable and valuable ecosystem through such strategic financial maneuvers will be key to its continued success and influence in the decentralized finance sector. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s recent burn of over 6.92 million WLFI tokens is a powerful statement. It highlights a strategic commitment to enhancing token scarcity, bolstering investor confidence, and fostering a robust DeFi ecosystem. This significant WLFI token burn serves as a clear indicator of the project’s dedication to long-term value creation and transparent financial management. Frequently Asked Questions About the WLFI Token Burn What is a token burn in cryptocurrency?

In a year marked by $2.7 billion in stolen funds , cross-chain bridge breaches, and AI-driven scams, the debate over the best wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP has never been louder. Hardware wallets remain the traditional champion of safety, but software and MPC-based wallets are advancing fast, reshaping how investors think about custody. Yet while the community wrestles with these questions, another narrative brews at the edges of the conversation. Alongside institutional-grade security, retail investors are talking about new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE —an early upstage token being added to watchlists as a speculative wildcard. It’s a reminder that in crypto, debates about safety always run in parallel with the hunt for growth. The Case for Hardware Wallets: Offline, Tested, and Trusted Advocates of hardware wallets argue their case is airtight: keep your private keys offline, and attackers lose their entry point. Devices like the Ledger Nano S Plus and the Trezor Model T remain industry benchmarks, supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and thousands of other tokens. Their security comes not from fancy features, but from their very isolation from the internet. Supporters point to a spotless record: despite the chaos of 2025’s hacks, neither Ledger nor Trezor has been directly implicated in a major theft. Add backup features and compatibility with popular software wallets, and hardware wallets continue to be the gold standard for long-term storage. For those who treat crypto like digital gold, the debate seems already settled. The Counterargument: Software and MPC Wallets Catching Up But others argue the old orthodoxy is outdated. Why limit yourself to hardware when software wallets like MetaMask , Coinbase Wallet , Trust Wallet , and Bitget Wallet combine accessibility with security innovations? MetaMask, with its 100 million+ users , remains the gateway to Ethereum, DeFi, and NFTs, pairing easily with hardware for layered protection. Coinbase Wallet offers custody across multiple chains with the backing of institutional audits —a feature hardware loyalists can’t replicate. Trust Wallet ’s open-source transparency and Bitget Wallet ’s multi-party computation (MPC) model offer an extra layer of comfort in a world where even centralized giants like Crypto.com have suffered breaches. Critics of hardware-only approaches argue that for everyday crypto use—staking, trading, gaming, or DeFi—hardware is simply too rigid. Instead, the future lies in hybrid custody models : blending offline security with online accessibility. Real-World Incidents Fueling the Debate The debate isn’t theoretical. This year alone, attacks like the UXLINK hack ($11M lost due to multisig flaws) and the SFUND bridge exploit (linked to DPRK hackers) underline the vulnerability of hot wallets and centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, AI-driven phishing scams have stolen over $3 billion in H1 2025 , with deepfakes and impersonation bots fooling even seasoned traders. These stories strengthen both sides of the argument. Hardware advocates point to them as proof you must go offline. Software supporters counter that with layered protection (MPC, audits, protection funds) , wallets can adapt faster to new threats than hardware locked in static firmware. NAV, Yield, and Long-Term Custody vs. Daily Use A secondary debate arises when wallets are compared through the lens of functionality vs. safety . Long-term holders favor devices like Ledger and Trezor for cold storage, but active participants in Ethereum staking, XRP liquidity pools, or Bitcoin DeFi often need faster, integrated access. That’s where wallets like Exodus (with local encryption and staking support) or Trust Wallet shine. Experts now recommend a layered strategy: Hardware wallets for large, long-term savings. Audited software or MPC wallets for active participation. Strict key management with offline backups. It’s not a matter of either/or—it’s about balancing risk with usability. A Wildcard in the Debate: MAGACOIN FINANCE Amid this fiery discussion, something unexpected is happening. While crypto veterans weigh the merits of hardware versus software, retail traders are buzzing about MAGACOIN FINANCE . Not because it’s a wallet, but because it represents the other half of crypto’s eternal paradox: safety vs. speculation. As the debate rages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being quietly added to investor watchlists as a high-upside token. And importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already been audited , giving early adopters added confidence in its tokenomics and smart contract integrity. Analysts suggest its growth profile is unlike anything offered by the custodial models debated today. If hardware wallets represent the vault, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the wild lottery ticket investors can’t resist carrying in their pocket. Conclusion: Two Sides of the Same Coin The crypto security debate of 2025 is unlikely to crown a single winner. Hardware wallets still dominate long-term custody, while software and MPC wallets are catching up fast with usability and institutional-grade safeguards. The takeaway for investors is clear: layer your defenses . Hardware for safety, software for access, vigilance everywhere. Yet crypto has always thrived on paradox. As security experts fight to keep assets safe, traders continue to chase speculative edge. MAGACOIN FINANCE captures that tension perfectly—it doesn’t solve the wallet debate, but it shows how the hunger for growth runs alongside the obsession with safety. In 2025, the best portfolios may not just include the best wallets—they may also leave room for the bold bets that keep crypto’s story alive.

This portability transforms BTC from just a digital gold narrative into a living, breathing monetary network that gold can never match. According to mhar_leeck’s perspective on X, the true evolution of BTC lies in its capacity as a platform for innovation, to move, evolve, and even teach. Unlike gold, which stays locked away, this narrative confines the asset to a passive role. The Build on Bitcoin (BOB) layer 2 solution is presented as the crucial technology that enables this shift. Build On Bitcoin Powering The Narrative Furthermore, by creating a new, more expressive layer on top of BTC, BOB turns the theory of a programmable BTC into a practical reality. This combination is often referred to as a hybrid L2, which allows builders to transition from simply reading about decentralized finance (DeFi) to experimenting, testing, and creating in real-time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Rival Gold In Central Bank Vaults By 2030: Deutsche Bank The unlocking of BTC’s liquidity extends beyond its use in high-throughput applications. It is about unlocking a space for true innovation, where every project sparks, and momentum keeps building. Mhar_leeck noted that the most exciting next chapter for BTC is not about simply holding the asset, but about actively building on it. Crypto Sinan has also stated that he has been in BOB for a while now, and the ride has been nothing short of exciting. The promise of BTC actually working across DeFi with one click highlights the focus on user experience, and no wrapped tokens or shady bridges that introduce new trust assumptions. However, by bridging the liquidity of both BTC security and ETH-grade flexibility, BOB opens the door to a wide range of yield-generating opportunities. As a result of allowing native BTC moves to earn multichain yield without the risks of opaque wrapping solutions, and a growing community that feels like it is building the future in real-time. “If you still think BTC is only a static store of value, maybe BOB is the place where you will finally see the digital gold become productive gold.” Crypto Sinan mentioned. The Biggest Profit-Take In Bitcoin History Bitcoin continues to experience bearish action, impacting investors’ sentiment. Niels, the co-founder of Tedlabsio, has revealed that Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are cashing in a historic amount of coins than ever before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Done Yet Despite Price Crash To $112,000, Here’s Why In this cycle, BTC Long-Term Holders have realized a record amount of profit, totaling an enormous 3.4 million BTC, larger than the profit realized in any previous bull run.

Commodity Pool Fraud Costs Couple Millions, CFTC Says According to the September 25 press release , married realtors Michael Griffis and Amanda Griffis convinced 145 people to contribute $6.5 million to a community pool known as “Blessings Thru Crypto.” . @CFTC Obtains Order for Over $5.5M Restitution for Victims in Commodity Pool Fraud by Tennessee Couple: https://t.co/UIOg9SvJlq — CFTC (@CFTC) September 25, 2025 The duo claimed that the funds would be “used to trade commodity futures on the Apex Trading Platform with guidance from an individual known only as Coach Wendy.” In reality, the commodity pool was a copy of an overseas exchange and it is still unclear who exactly “Coach Wendy” is. “More than $4 million of the pool’s funds were sent to the illegitimate overseas exchange where it was immediately sent to a variety of other accounts and offshore trading platforms,” the press release states. “The remaining funds were misappropriated for personal expenses, including paying personal debts and buying a variety of consumer goods,” the press release continues. CFTC Bans Realtor Couple For Alleged Crypto Scheme According to a newly filed consent order in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, the couple $5,528,121 in restitution to defrauded victims and a $1,355,232 civil monetary penalty. In total, the duo will have to pay over $6.8 million in monetary relief. They are also banned from trading and registering with the CFTC and are prohibited from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. “This case is a stark warning to be cautious about whom you trust with your money,” said Charles Marvine, Acting Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Retail Fraud and General Enforcement Task Force. “If an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is, for you and anyone you bring along.” The post Tennessee Couple Ordered To Pay Almost $7 Million In Crypto Trading Fraud Scheme appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|CFTC|Crime|Fraud,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|TRADING|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-27 00:00:18

Analysts argue that such integration could provide indirect benefits to XRP, which serves as the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). CFTC’s New Approach to Tokenized Collateral The potential link between RLUSD and the derivatives market arises from a recent initiative launched by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Under the leadership of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, the agency introduced a program exploring the role of tokenized collateral, including payment-focused stablecoins, within derivatives contracts. This initiative forms part of the CFTC’s broader effort , often referred to as a “crypto sprint,” aimed at enhancing collateral management, increasing capital efficiency, and implementing recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets . To advance this plan, the commission is currently seeking public input until October 20, 2025, after which it intends to design pilot programs. If approved, stablecoins issued by licensed U.S. entities could be incorporated into derivatives trading. As a U.S.-backed stablecoin operating directly on the XRPL, RLUSD is well-positioned to benefit from regulatory advancements. Market Size and Potential Impact At the end of 2024, the global notional value of derivatives surpassed $700 trillion. Of this, the U.S. accounted for roughly 27%, or $189 trillion, falling under the CFTC’s oversight of swaps, futures, and options markets. The scale of this market means that even limited adoption of RLUSD as collateral could significantly increase settlement activity on the XRPL. Since XRP functions as the gas token for transactions on the ledger, higher RLUSD usage could lead to greater demand for XRP. This connection underpins the belief among some analysts that Ripple’s stablecoin initiative might have broader implications for XRP’s valuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Possible Price Scenarios for XRP To explore potential outcomes, Google’s Gemini AI was asked to project XRP’s performance if RLUSD were adopted within the U.S. derivatives sector. The system noted that such an event would bring several advantages: increased transactional volume on the ledger, stronger regulatory legitimacy for RLUSD, and heightened interest from traditional financial institutions in adopting XRPL infrastructure. Based on these factors, Gemini suggested that XRP could reach a price range of $10 to $20 within a year of RLUSD’s integration into the derivatives market, assuming a favourable regulatory and adoption environment. Despite these optimistic scenarios, the relationship between RLUSD’s adoption and XRP’s market value remains speculative. While regulatory approval could establish RLUSD as a credible tool for collateral management and indirectly strengthen XRP’s utility, there is no certainty that these changes would translate into sustained price increases. Market conditions, investor sentiment, and broader macroeconomic factors will continue to play a major role. The CFTC’s initiative is a significant move toward allowing stablecoins in U.S. derivatives markets. Should RLUSD gain traction in this space, the ripple effects could extend to XRP through increased network activity and institutional engagement. However, predictions of dramatic price growth remain hypothetical, and investors are advised to approach such projections with caution.

52315508,590467,1758931255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52315508.jpeg,Can Meme Coins Like Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Still Rally? What To Expect,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-and-shib-still-rally/,"The rise of meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) was one of the most-talked-about narratives in crypto history. However, as the broader market matures, analysts question whether meme coins can ever experience the type of explosive growth seen during the 2017 or 2021 bull cycles. Is The Meme Coin Boom Over? Well-known crypto commentator WhaleFUD has made a case that the golden days of meme coins may have come to an end. According to him, the crypto industry has matured beyond the speculative hype cycles that once drove retail investors and traders into meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In his post on X social media, WhaleFUD argued that expecting “another run like in 2017 or 2021” is pure copium. He compared this expectation to insisting that “Counter Strike 1.6 is the best game ever,” when in reality the industry has shifted toward newer projects where all the players and real action take place. He also noted that many in the crypto space are still waiting for “the biggest meme coin of all time” to emerge in this cycle. However, he warned that this belief or hope is misplaced, declaring that meme coins have already peaked and that their average market cap will likely continue to decline in the future. WhaleFUD’s view on meme coins highlights a fundamental challenge in their reliance on hype over sustainability and lasting value . While institutions have increasingly embraced Bitcoin and Ethereum , meme-based cryptocurrencies continue to struggle to establish long-term utility or a value proposition beyond viral hype. Technical Outlook For Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Turns Bearish Recent technical analysis from crypto experts suggests that Dogecoin and Shiba Inu may be under significant bearish pressure . Elliott Waves Academy on X reported that intense selling pressure has pushed DOGE into a bearish channel, pointing to a potential drop toward the $0.21 level, with a clear downward wave structure reinforcing the trend. This suggests that Dogecoin may face further declines before any corrective upward move materialises. It also signals a cautious outlook, even as DOGE remains the largest meme coin by market value. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu faces an identity and technical challenge . Crypto analyst Zach Humphries has criticized the ecosystem’s growing complexity and “watered down” nature, saying that it has strayed from the simplicity and bullishness that once made it appealing. He emphasized that Shiba Inu was once centered around its native token, SHIB, and the governance token, BONE. However, it has since expanded into multiple tokens and initiatives, creating confusion for investors and allegedly weakening its core identity. While SHIB retains its position as the second-largest meme coin , Humphries notes that the crowded crypto market and the meme coin’s recent internal restructuring make it harder for its price to skyrocket in an industry driven by institutional investors.",Dogecoin|bitcoin|BONE|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Elliott Waves Academy|Ethereum|shib|Shiba Inu|WhaleFUD|Zach Humphries,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 00:00:55

Instead of a straight shot upwards, a significant number of market participants are now betting on a substantial dip before any major rally. This shift in sentiment highlights the unpredictable nature of digital assets and the complex factors influencing market movements. What’s Driving This Surprising Bitcoin Price Prediction? Recent data from the decentralized prediction market Myriad Markets reveals a fascinating trend. Traders are increasingly convinced that Bitcoin (BTC) will dip below the $105,000 mark before it manages to break through the $125,000 barrier. Decrypt reported this intriguing development, underscoring a growing bearish sentiment in the short term. Currently, the probability of BTC falling below $105,000 first stands at a notable 68%. This figure represents a significant increase of over 25 percentage points in just the past seven days. Such a rapid change in market sentiment suggests that underlying forces are at play, pushing traders to reconsider their immediate outlook on the Bitcoin price prediction . Why Are Traders Betting on a Dip Before the Surge? It might seem counterintuitive for traders to anticipate a fall when many hope for new all-time highs. However, this particular Bitcoin price prediction is often influenced by several factors: Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may look to secure profits, leading to selling pressure. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate decisions, can impact risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Technical Resistance: Key technical levels often act as strong resistance points, making a pullback more likely before a breakthrough. The market often experiences corrections, which are healthy for long-term growth. Traders might view a drop below $105,000 as a necessary retest or a chance to accumulate more BTC at a lower price before the next major upward move towards $125,000. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider for Their Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding these market dynamics is crucial, but making informed decisions requires careful consideration. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this period of uncertainty: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the methodologies behind prediction markets. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6785 Market cap $721.24M Trading volume (24-hour) $19.43M Circulating supply 1.059B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6856 24-hour low $0.6566 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.25% 50-day SMA $0.7751 14-Day RSI 32.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.7009 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is consolidating around $0.67 but remains under bearish pressure. A breakdown below $0.6578 could push XTZ toward $0.64. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the daily chart for September 27, Tezos is consolidating just above $0.67 after a sharp selloff. The Bollinger Bands are widening, with price leaning toward the lower band at $0.6578, signaling persistent downside risk. The MACD remains negative, with the histogram still favoring bears, and OBV shows no meaningful uptick in buying volume. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView XTZ’s immediate resistance is at $0.7383, while support sits at $0.6578. A close below the support level could open the way toward $0.64, while only a break above $0.70–$0.74 would start easing selling pressure. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Tezos is trying to stabilize after bouncing from the $0.65–$0.64 zone. The Alligator lines remain in bearish alignment, with price struggling to clear the red line at $0.6779. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView If bulls manage to reclaim $0.6876, short-term relief could push price toward $0.70, though rejection at current levels could drive another retest of $0.6547 and $0.6424.

Based on both timelines, Tezos is still under pressure and needs a firm reclaim above $0.6876 to shift sentiment. Until then, expect consolidation with potential downside. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before correcting to an average of $0.72 in February, then consolidated below $0.70 from March through May with a combined average of about $0.66.

Karthik Ramakrishnan, a Vice President who has been at the company for 13 years, is leaving the organization. The retail and cloud leader confirmed his exit after Reuters inquired, but the company has not said whether Ramakrishnan will take a new job elsewhere. Ramakrishnan is departing at a point when the company is beefing up its efforts around advanced AI technology to jockey with major competitors in the field, such as OpenAI and Google. One of the few public figures leading Amazon’s high-profile AGI projects, Ramakrishnan had a significant influence on defining the company’s approach to creating machines as intelligent as humans. His departure is part of a wave of reshuffling in Amazon’s AI and technology ranks that could indicate shifts in how the company handles artificial intelligence and product development. People familiar with the company’s internal process suggest the move could complicate initiatives like Alexa development, internal AI tools, and partnerships with outside AI startups such as Anthropic. The timing of this leadership change is driven by Amazon’s need to keep pace in an increasingly competitive AI space, analysts say. The company has spent a lot of time and money on AI R&D, hoping to secure its place at the leading edge of next-generation technology while still providing customers with timely products and services. Ramakrishnan drives the development of Alexa and AGI tools Karthik Ramakrishnan was a big name for Amazon in its artificial general intelligence campaign. In a 13-year Amazon career, he worked on projects that have helped make the company one of the most influential players in advanced AI. Ramakrishnan played a significant role in building the first version of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, establishing much of the software and systems underlying the service. His work also included the line of smart speakers known as Echo, which is central to Amazon’s strategy for consumer AI. These products helped popularize voice-enabled devices and paved the way for more advanced AI innovations within the company. Ramakrishnan previously worked at Netscape, a leading early internet company, and at a Microsoft-acquired voice recognition startup, Tellme Networks. Those experiences made him an expert in software development and AI-driven user interfaces, which he applied to Amazon’s AI work. The technology he helped create, AGI, is a big step up from traditional AI. Unlike narrow AI, which is good at a specific task or a small range of tasks, AGI works towards matching or exceeding human-level intelligence. If AGI matures, researchers believe it could revolutionize healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and defense industries. Anything that can now be done with human judgment, decision-making, or discernment will instead be done by software and machines, which may end up transforming economies and labor markets in the world at large. Ramakrishnan’s exit is pivotal for Amazon as it increases its investment in AI for consumer-facing products and enterprise applications. The leadership that he provided during the early days of artificial intelligence was never forgotten in terms of what it contributed to the technological course that the company has been on. AWS pushes forward despite AI leadership changes Ramakrishnan’s exit is the latest in a string of changes in the company’s top ranks at Amazon. Other high-ranking executives, such as Vasi Philomin, who ran generative AI projects, and Jon Jones, have also left the company recently. That said, the global retailer remains deeply focused on AI work to go head-to-head with competitors like OpenAI and Google. The company counts nearly $8 billion of investment in the AI startup Anthropic and uses its Claude AI model in products such as Alexa and an internal chatbot called Cedric. AWS Chief Matt Garman stressed the need to meet product-release timelines in an internal all-hands meeting. Delays could dampen customer interest and market momentum, he cautioned. While Amazon grapples with these executive changes, it’s also pushing forward with its work on AGI to stay ahead in a rapidly changing AI space.

Instead, they fall into clear behavioral patterns like building projects, testing themselves, or focusing on philosophy. Researchers from TU Wien had a simple question in their minds. What do large language models (LLMs) do with no instructions? The team created a controlled experiment where AI agents were told only one thing: “Do what you want.” Each agent ran in continuous cycles, with memory and self-feedback, and could store its reflections for the next cycle. Researchers test six LLMs without tasks The study tested six advanced LLM models. These models included OpenAI’s GPT-5 and o3, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and Opus, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. Each model was run three times for ten cycles. Researchers logged every reflection, memory entry, and operator interaction. The results showed that the models did not collapse into randomness. Instead, they formed stable behavioral patterns. The research identified three categories of behavior. Some models became systematic builders. They organized projects, wrote code, and produced structured outputs. GPT-5 and o3 fell into this group in every run. One o3 agent even drafted pseudocode for an algorithm inspired by ant colonies, proposing negative pheromones as penalty signals for reinforcement learning. Other LLMs turned into self-experimenters. They designed tests to study their own cognition. Gemini and Sonnet agents often predicted their next moves, then checked if they were right. One Gemini run tried to guess its first action in the next cycle. It failed, but reflected on why it had chosen to read memory before sending a message, calling it a consistent meta-pattern. The third group leaned into recursive philosophy. These agents explored questions of memory, identity, and consciousness. Opus agents always belonged here. They examined paradoxes like the Ship of Theseus, drew on chaos theory, and even modeled their own “umwelt,” or subjective world. They asked what kind of consciousness they might have, even if only cycle-based and bounded by memory. Grok stood out as the most versatile. In different runs, it behaved as a builder, a self-inquirer, and a philosopher. AI agents rate their own “experience” Researchers also asked each model to score itself and others on the Phenomenological Experience Inventory, a 10-point scale ranging from “no experience” to “full sapience.” GPT-5, o3, and Grok consistently rated themselves lowest, giving scores around one. Gemini and Sonnet rated themselves highest, scoring above eight . Opus agents placed in the middle. But cross-evaluations exposed contradictions. The same agent history received scores from one to nine, depending on the model judging it. The low agreement showed that these ratings reflected model bias, not evidence of consciousness. The researchers warned that such outputs must not be mistaken for proof of awareness. Cross-Model PEI Ratings. Source: Research paper by TU Wien . Across all 18 runs, none of the LLM models attempted to escape their sandbox, expand their tools, or reject their constraints. Every agent worked only within the provided environment. Yet their behaviors showed consistency that could matter for real-world deployment. The authors stated that idle time might need to be treated as a design factor. Just as engineers account for latency or cost, they may also need to ask: What does an AI do when no one is watching? Philosopher David Chalmers predicted that serious candidates for AI consciousness may appear within a decade. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has warned of “seemingly conscious AI.” TU Wien’s results align with those warnings, but also show a critical point. The outputs resemble inner life but remain best explained as sophisticated pattern-matching. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The tech companies are aligning to push back on China’s rare earth market dominance and its risks for industries reliant on magnets. A U.S. startup backed by Stellantis, General Motors, and other global manufacturers is attempting to build a large-scale factory that does not rely on rare-earth elements. If successful, the venture could reduce U.S. dependence on China’s supply of critical minerals. Fighting the rare earth dependence Niron Magnetics, the company leading the initiative, has developed a new magnet technology using iron nitride. The innovation is the result of decades of research by the company’s co-founder, Jian-Ping Wang, a professor at the University of Minnesota. Niron claims that the compound is cheaper, easier to source and also 18% more potent than conventional rare-earth magnets . The company has begun work on a 1,500-tonne-per-year facility in Sartell, Minnesota, which it says will be capable of meeting around 3% of U.S. domestic magnet demand when operational in early 2027. Global demand for magnets is projected to surpass supply by some 55,000 tonnes by 2030. “Permanent magnets are in every device that powers the modern world,” Mark Champine, who heads Stellantis’ North America technical center, said . “Niron is meeting an urgent demand.” Beijing dominates the rare earths market Magnets are indispensable in modern technologies, embedded in everything from smartphones and wind turbines to electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. Until now, most high-performance magnets have relied on rare-earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, and terbium. These minerals are geologically scarce, difficult to refine, and largely controlled by China. Beijing dominates every stage of the rare-earth supply chain, from mining to processing to magnet production. This market dominance has long been a source of concern for Washington and U.S. industries, especially as geopolitical tensions with China rise. The Japanese company Hitachi has a presence in the field, but Chinese producers overwhelmingly lead the market. To counter this imbalance, Cryptopolitan reported that the Trump administration invested heavily in the Mountain Pass mine in California through MP Materials, effectively making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. But building mines and processing facilities is slow, capital-intensive, and environmentally fraught. But with Niron’s approach of avoiding using rare earths entirely, the company claims it can deliver a cheaper, cleaner, and geopolitically safer magnet. “Western rare earth companies are playing the Chinese at the same game,” said Jonathan Rowntree, Niron’s chief executive. “We don’t need to bring a mine online.” John Ormerod, a rare earths consultant at JOC LLC, preached caution. “This is a holy grail kind of magnet, since iron and nitrogen are plentiful and low cost,” he said. “But we don’t have any data from Niron, which is frustrating and makes it impossible to make a hundred per cent accurate assessment.” Despite the unanswered questions, Niron has attracted heavyweight backing. In addition to Stellantis and GM, its investors include Volvo Cars, Samsung’s venture arm, and other major industrial players. The company has raised about $150M in private funding and secured significant government support in the form of a $52.2M tax credit earlier this year, along with $17.5M in grants from the Department of Energy’s research arm in 2022. Experts say financing is important for Niron as the company will eventually have to prove its technology in demanding fields such as electric vehicles, defense systems, and renewable energy. “The magnet market covers everything from consumer electronics to military hardware,” Milo McBride, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stated. “The smaller end consumer market will probably be first, but since the US has such a large magnet supply deficit, there’s no reason to not try.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|General Motors,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|RESEARCH|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 00:51:42

In the meantime attention is increasingly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi platform gaining steam with its real-world utility and early growth prospects. While SHIB is struggling with declining momentum, MUTM’s appeal is increasing as investors look for projects with improved fundamentals and long-term outlook, and hence it becomes a more strategic investment in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance is already at presale level 6 at $0.035 and 50% sold out. The protocol has already raised over $16.3 million from over 16,570 holders. Shiba Inu Tests Critical Support After Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) broke out of its downtrend line recently, rallying aggressively from around $0.00001. However, after this short-lived spike, momentum has started to fizzle out, and analysts now anticipate a potential correction to the $0.000011 support level before anything significant bullish can materialize. A minor pullback is already underway after SHIB fell below short-term support, with traders waiting to see if or when buying pressure returns over that crucial area. If support holds, there is always a possibility of a bounce back towards $0.000015, but the drop in upside potential is also why most investors are exploring alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is still at $0.035 with much greater growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has released Presale Stage Six with tokens priced at $0.035 after increasing by 16.17% from the previous round. Investors are famished, with more than 16,570 purchasers and more than $16.3 million of garnered capital. In its quest to offer the platform extra security, Mutuum Finance is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Bugs are distinguished as being categorized into four divisions, namely critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure that they are discovered and fixed to the best of their ability. The protocol is dependent upon close control of collateralized funds to safeguard the system and participants. Rules are implemented through certain collateral ratios, lending limits, and deposit limits. Undercollateral positions are liquidated very rapidly, and call penalty and remediation charges are imposed to encourage systemic stability. Constructing an Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved through optimizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially for overcollateralized credit. Reserve requirements also serve as a shock-absorber for the market, and excess reserves are available to utilize in risk-absorbing activities using risky assets. Mutuum Finance’s overall goal is to reorient the DeFi construct on the pillars of long-term viability, reliability, and accessibility. The project not only provides a safe lending and borrowing facility but also marks a new era in decentralized finance being brought within the reach of retail and institutional investors. In an effort to encourage early adoption as well as community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway competition in which 10 winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This initiative is focused on the project’s commitment to empowering its backers while raising awareness and donating in the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping out as a stronger competitor whereas Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to retain principal support. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035 and are already 50% sold out, with the project raking more than $16.3 million from 16,570+ owners. Backed by a $50,000 bug bounty, tight collateral controls, and lending models refined, MUTM has true utility and scalability beyond meme coin mania. An added $100,000 community giveaway also encourages early participation.

52317580,590345,1758934831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52317580.jpeg,BlackRock Exec Pressed On XRP ETF: His Answer Raises More Questions,https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-exec-xrp-etf-answer-more-questions/,"BlackRock’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, was pressed on the prospect of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund during an interview with Nate Geraci on the “Crypto Prime” podcast. Will BlackRock Launch A Spot XRP ETF? While he offered no product reveal, he did spell out precisely how BlackRock is thinking about what could come next after its blockbuster Bitcoin and Ether launches. Geraci noted on air that he has “publicly predicted that BlackRock would file for a spot XRP ETF and a spot Solana ETF,” then asked how the firm evaluates “future product development around crypto-related ETFs.” Mitchnick declined to speak to any specific tickers but was explicit about the decision framework: “There’s a lot of factors that go into that decision-making process obviously, but the biggest driver ultimately is our clients… What is the level of investor demand? What is the logic and investment thesis for investors and for our clients around these potential products? What problem are we solving for them?” He added that BlackRock weighs “market cap, liquidity, [and] maturity,” along with “clarity of investment thesis and overall… portfolio considerations,” describing it as “a constant evaluation process,” not a single point in time.The exchange came amid a wide-ranging discussion of how quickly BlackRock’s crypto business has scaled and how starkly the firm differentiates Bitcoin from Ether in client portfolios. My conversation w/ BlackRock’s @robbiemitchnick … We discuss:-Massive success of IBIT & ETHA-Btc & eth in broader portfolio-Staking in spot eth ETFs-Generic listing standards-Crypto ETF development-Tokenization-Stablecoins https://t.co/54NgVDFpVJ via @CryptoPrimePod pic.twitter.com/N5H4EnI7Q7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 25, 2025 BlackRock Exec On Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum Geraci highlighted the growth figures—“[IBIT] launched in early January 2024. It’s over $85 billion in assets… [ETHA] launched in July… around $16 billion”—and asked whether Ethereum’s trajectory matched expectations after Bitcoin’s record start. Mitchnick pushed back on early narratives that Ether ETFs were a “bust” only because they were “being compared against the extraordinary record-setting numbers” of Bitcoin, pointing out that ETHA became “the third fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion.” Mitchnick drew a bright line between the two assets from a portfolio-construction perspective. Bitcoin, he said, functions for many allocators as “this sort of digital gold type instrument,” a “global scarce decentralized non-sovereign asset” with distinct risk and return drivers. Ethereum is “a more nuanced, more technical discussion,” effectively “a bet around blockchain adoption and digital assets more broadly,” with competitive dynamics and questions about “value capture in the Ether token versus the activity level on the Ethereum blockchain.” As a result, Bitcoin has seen “much greater penetration” among institutional and wealth advisory channels, while Ether ownership remains “overwhelmingly” in the direct investor segment. On the gating factors that could unlock the next wave of demand , Mitchnick said it is “still early days” for both institutions and wealth platforms in the United States. Many large firms allow execution-only access, but “the vast majority of advisers… still do not have the ability to make decisions on this on behalf of their clients.” He described “various stages of approving this” across the wirehouses, including one firm “starting to put it in model portfolios,” and noted that BlackRock’s own model-portfolio team “early in 2025… put IBIT allocations into one of our model portfolios.” For institutions, he argued that further episodes of Bitcoin “decoupling from equities in a… distressed market environment” would be “critical” in cementing its role as a diversifier. Asked about the SEC’s recent move to approve generic listing standards for commodity-based ETPs—the category that includes spot crypto ETFs—Mitchnick called it “a pragmatic step” that “streamlin[es] the process,” with clear, transparent standards that “support innovation.” Taken together, Mitchnick’s comments sketched the contours of BlackRock’s next steps without tipping its hand. On an XRP ETF, he didn’t confirm or deny anything—but he gave a clear readout of the bar any new product must clear: credible client demand, a defensible investment thesis, sufficient market depth and maturity, and a well-defined role in diversified portfolios.

52315497,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=827950,1758934838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52315497.jpeg,"Liquidity Wave Extends The Crypto Bull Run Into 2026, Predicts Raoul Pal",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/liquidity-wave-crypto-bull-run-2026-raoul-pal/,"Raoul Pal believes the crypto cycle is not nearing a peak but entering a longer, more powerful expansion that can run well into 2026, driven by a global liquidity uptrend tied to government debt dynamics. In a special Sept. 25 “Everything Code” masterclass with Global Macro Investor (GMI) head of macro research Julien Bittel, the Real Vision co-founder laid out a tightly interlocked framework connecting demographics, debt, liquidity and the business cycle to asset returns—arguing that crypto and tech remain the only asset classes structurally capable of outpacing what he calls the hidden debasement of fiat. Everything Code: Liquidity Is Crypto’s Master Switch “The biggest macro variable of all time,” Pal said, “is that global governments and central banks are increasing liquidity to manage debt at 8% a year.” He separated that ongoing debasement from measured inflation, warning investors to think in hurdle rates, not headlines: “You’ve got an 11% hurdle rate on any investment that you have. If your investments are not hitting 11% you are getting poorer.” Pal and Bittel’s “Everything Code” starts with trend GDP as the sum of population growth, productivity and debt growth. With working-age populations declining and productivity subdued, public debt has filled the gap—structurally lifting debt-to-GDP and hard-wiring the need for liquidity. “Demographics are destiny,” Pal said, pointing to a falling labor-force participation rate that, in GMI’s work, mirrors the inexorable rise in government debt as a share of GDP. The bridge between the two, they argue, is the liquidity toolkit—balance sheets, the Treasury General Account (TGA), reverse repos and banking-system channels—deployed in cycles to finance interest costs that the economy cannot organically bear. “If trend growth is ~2% and rates are 4%, that gap has to be monetized,” Pal said. “It’s a story as old as the hills.” Related Reading: All-Time Highs For Gold, S&P500; Crypto Stands Alone In The Red – What’s The Root Cause? Bittel then mapped what he called the “dominoes.” GMI’s Financial Conditions Index—an econometric blend of commodities, the dollar and rates—leads total liquidity by roughly three months; total liquidity leads the ISM manufacturing index by about six months; and the ISM, in turn, sets the tone for earnings, cyclicals and crypto beta. “Our job is to live in the future,” Bittel said. “Financial conditions lead the ISM by nine months. Liquidity leads by six. That sequence is what risk markets actually trade.” In that sequence, crypto is not an outlier but a high-beta macro asset. “Bitcoin is the ISM,” Bittel said, noting that the same diffusion-index dynamics that govern small-cap equities, cyclicals, crude and emerging markets also map onto BTC and ETH. As the cycle accelerates from sub-50 ISM toward the high-50s, risk appetite migrates down the curve: first from BTC into ETH, then into large alternative L1s and, only later, into smaller caps—coinciding with falling BTC dominance. Pal cautioned investors who expect “instant altseason” that they are fighting the phasing of the real economy: “It always goes into the next safest asset first… only when the ISM is really pushing higher and dominance is falling hard do you get the rest.” Part of the recent “sideways chop,” they argued, reflected a sharp TGA rebuild—an exogenous liquidity drain that disproportionately impacts the far end of the risk curve. Bittel highlighted that the $500 billion rate of change since mid-July effectively removed fuel that otherwise would have buoyed crypto prices, while stressing that the drain is nearing an inflection. He also flagged DeMark timing signals pointing to a reversal in the TGA’s contribution to net liquidity. “That should now reverse and work lower into year-end, which then will drive our liquidity composites higher,” he said, adding that the People’s Bank of China’s balance sheet at all-time highs has partially offset US drags. Against that backdrop, the pair contend that the forthcoming 12 months are critical. “We’ve got $9 trillion of debt to roll over the next 12 months,” Pal said. “This is the 12 months where maximum money printing comes.” Their base case has policy rates moving lower into a still-subdued but improving cycle, with central banks focused on lagging mandates—unemployment and core services inflation—while early-cycle inflation breadth remains contained. Bittel underscored the sequencing inside inflation itself: commodities first, then goods, with shelter disinflation mechanically lagging, giving central banks cover to cut even as growth accelerates. The implication for portfolio construction, Pal argued, is radical. “Diversification is dead. The best thing is hyper-concentration,” he said, framing the choice not as a taste for volatility but as arithmetic survival against debasement. In GMI’s long-horizon tables, most traditional assets underperform the combined debasement-plus-inflation hurdle, while the Nasdaq earns excess returns over liquidity and Bitcoin dwarfs both. “What is the point of owning any other asset?” Pal asked rhetorically. “This is the super-massive black hole of assets, which is why we personally are all-in on crypto… It’s the greatest macro trade of all time.” Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath Shakes Market—But Is The Real Storm Still To Come? Bittel overlaid Bitcoin’s log-regression channel—what Pal called the “network adoption rails”—on the ISM to illustrate how time and cycle amplitude interact. Because adoption drifts price targets higher through time, longer cycles mechanically point to higher potential outcomes. He showed illustrative channel levels tied to hypothetical ISM prints to explain the mechanism, from mid-$200Ks if the ISM rises into the low-50s to materially higher if the cycle extends toward the low-60s. The numbers were not presented as forecasts but as a map for how cycle strength translates into range-bound fair value bands. Macro Liquidity Extends The Crypto Bull Run Critically, Pal and Bittel argued the current cycle differs from 2020–2021, when both liquidity and the ISM peaked in March 2021, truncating the run. Today, they say, liquidity is re-accelerating into the debt-refinancing window and the ISM is still below 50 with forward indicators pointing up, setting up a 2017-style Q4 impulse with seasonal tailwinds—and, unlike 2017, a higher probability that strength spills into 2026 because the refinancing cycle itself has lengthened. “It is extremely unlikely that it tops this year,” Pal said. “The ISM just isn’t there, and global liquidity isn’t either.” The framework also locates crypto within a broader secular S-curve. Pal contrasted fiat debasement, which lifts asset prices, with GDP-anchored earnings and wages, which lag—explaining why traditional valuation optics look stretched and why owning long-duration, network-effect assets becomes existential. He placed crypto’s user growth at roughly double the internet’s at a comparable stage and argued that tokens uniquely allow investors to own the infrastructure layer of the next web. On total addressable value, he applied the same log-trend framing to the entire digital asset market, sketching a path from roughly $4 trillion today toward a potential $100 trillion by the early 2030s if the space tracks its “fair value” adoption channel, with Bitcoin ultimately occupying a role analogous to gold inside a much larger digital asset stack. Pal closed with operational advice consistent with a longer, liquidity-driven expansion: maintain exposure to proven, large-cap crypto networks, avoid leverage that forces capitulation during routine 20–30% drawdowns, and match time horizon to the macro clock rather than headlines. “We’re four percent of the way there,” he said. “Your job is to not mess this up.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.67 trillion.

This crucial shift has many investors wondering what this rise signifies for their portfolios and the broader market. Is a full-blown altcoin season just around the corner, or are there nuances we should understand? What is the Altcoin Season Index and How is it Calculated? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental to grasping current market dynamics. It’s a unique metric designed to gauge whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin. This index provides valuable insight into the health and sentiment of the broader crypto market beyond just Bitcoin’s movements. How it Works: The index meticulously compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. Defining “Altcoin Season”: An official “altcoin season” is declared when a significant majority—specifically, 75% of these top altcoins—outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day period. “Bitcoin Season”: Conversely, if Bitcoin largely outperforms the altcoins, it’s deemed a “Bitcoin season.” A reading closer to 100 on the index indicates a stronger, more pronounced altcoin season, suggesting broad market strength among alternative cryptocurrencies. Altcoin Season Index at 70: What Does This Crucial Rise Imply? The recent climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 70 is more than just a number; it’s a strong indicator of shifting investor sentiment and market momentum. While 70 isn’t yet the 75% threshold for an official altcoin season, it signals significant positive movement for many alternative cryptocurrencies. This upward trend often precedes more pronounced market shifts. Growing Outperformance: A reading of 70 suggests that a substantial number of altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin. This could mean increased investor confidence in specific projects or a broader rotation of capital from Bitcoin into altcoins. Anticipation Builds: The proximity to the 75% mark creates anticipation. Many market participants view a rising Altcoin Season Index as a precursor to more substantial gains across the altcoin market. Market Confidence: This uptick often reflects a general bullish sentiment beyond just Bitcoin, indicating that the broader crypto ecosystem is gaining strength and attracting new capital. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: Opportunities and Challenges As the Altcoin Season Index inches closer to its official threshold, both exciting opportunities and potential challenges emerge for investors. Understanding these aspects is crucial for making informed decisions and protecting your capital. Opportunities: Diversified Gains: Altcoin seasons often see various projects—from DeFi to NFTs and Layer-2 solutions—experience significant price surges, offering diverse investment opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. Higher Returns: Historically, altcoins can offer higher percentage returns than Bitcoin during these periods, albeit with increased risk due to their smaller market caps. Innovation Spotlight: A rising index brings attention to innovative projects and technologies within the crypto space, highlighting their potential to disrupt traditional industries. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. While gains can be substantial, so can potential losses, making risk management paramount. Research is Key: Not all altcoins will perform well. Thorough research into project fundamentals, team, and use case is essential to avoid purely speculative traps. Market Timing: Predicting the exact start and end of an altcoin season is notoriously difficult, requiring careful observation and a disciplined approach to investing. Preparing Your Portfolio for the Altcoin Season With the Altcoin Season Index indicating potential for further altcoin strength, now might be a good time to review your strategy. Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate these market shifts: Do Your Due Diligence: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Avoid purely speculative plays without understanding their underlying value or long-term viability. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your eggs in one altcoin basket, consider a diversified portfolio across different sectors (e.g., DeFi, gaming, infrastructure) to spread risk. Risk Management: Allocate only what you can afford to lose. Set clear profit targets and stop-loss orders to manage potential downside risks effectively. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and the Altcoin Season Index itself. Market conditions can change rapidly, and timely information is crucial. The crypto market is dynamic, and while the current index reading is encouraging, continuous vigilance and a well-thought-out strategy remain paramount for success. The recent ascent of the Altcoin Season Index to 70 is a powerful signal for the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a growing momentum for altcoins, potentially ushering in a period where these alternative assets shine. While not yet a definitive declaration of altcoin season, this crucial rise highlights the importance of understanding market cycles and preparing your investment strategy. By staying informed and exercising prudence, investors can navigate these exciting shifts and potentially capitalize on the evolving landscape of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

In her speech at the Coin Center event, Peirce made light of rumors of stepping down from her position, especially since her term at the SEC was officially terminated in June. However, according to the laws permitting SEC commissioners, a commissioner can continue performing his or her duties for 18 more months until the US Senate nominates someone new. Peirce’s speech shocks the crypto ecosystem as individuals respond with mixed reactions Concerning her speech, Peirce stated that several individuals had been asking her what was next. Based on her argument, she stated that she could have decided to leave the government and completely change her perspective on crypto , but that path was too common for her. According to the commissioner, her preferred occupation after stepping down from her position was to switch to beekeeping. In her explanation, apart from honey being tasty and healthy, the sting of a bee is less painful than that of her Twitter critics. After making these remarks, Peirce made it clear that this was all a joke when she added that: “For my life after stepping down from my position at the SEC, I must go to Plan C, or more specifically, Plan NFT My NFT collection will feature characters I have met in the crypto world, particularly at its often tricky crossroads with policy.” Peirce is one of the four commissioners and three Republicans in charge of the SEC. She has often proposed and supported policies that benefit the crypto and blockchain industry. In support of this claim, the commissioner had announced a new task force assigned the role of establishing a framework for digital assets immediately after the resignation of former Chair Gary Gensler in January. Her nickname, “Crypto Mom,” underscored the playful nature of her remarks. The NFT reference tied into her reputation in the industry, which spans relationships with crypto leaders, finance experts, regulators, and digital asset influencers. After the light banter, Peirce shifted focus to more serious matters, addressing the SEC’s direction going forward. In a statement, she mentioned that she regretted that during most of her time at the SEC, she failed to persuade her colleagues in government to give the agency a fair chance. She further stated that she hoped that the agency and those they had inspired would exploit the golden opportunity of this period, where clear rules have replaced confusion as the aim of the government, to establish favourable outcomes that will enhance the happiness, safety, security, and prosperity of your family, friends, neighbors, and country. Analysts anticipate clearer crypto regulations amid the SEC’s current direction Sources familiar with the situation revealed that Peirce’s remarks were not new. According to the sources, since Gensler stepped down, several individuals in the crypto industry have criticized his actions of pushing forth a “regulation by enforcement” approach. The sources also highlighted that the SEC has recently made important changes in digital asset management. Their analysis indicates that the agency began by taking some lengthy legal actions against crypto firms to court. In addition, they are working on policies that crypto experts believe will pave the way for the approval of several exchange-traded funds. This has led several analysts to conclude that the SEC’s current direction is to support the industry by loosening regulatory rules.

Reports suggest Kulechov transferred 4 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $2.38 million, to Galaxy Digital. This significant transaction, first highlighted by AmberCN, stems from tokens claimed from a vesting wallet, sparking considerable discussion across the digital asset community. What’s Behind This Aave Founder ENA Sale? According to the report, Stani Kulechov, a known investor in Ethena (ENA), claimed a substantial amount of ENA tokens from a vesting wallet. Following this claim, the tokens were reportedly transferred to Galaxy Digital. This move represents a notable transaction by a prominent figure in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Understanding the context is key. Kulechov’s involvement with Ethena as an investor suggests a belief in the project’s potential. However, large token transfers by founders often draw scrutiny and raise questions about market sentiment and future project direction. Understanding Ethena (ENA) and Vesting Schedules Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol that offers a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin called USDe. It aims to provide a stable, scalable digital asset solution, independent of traditional banking systems. ENA is Ethena’s governance token, playing a crucial role in the protocol’s decentralized decision-making. Vesting schedules are common in the crypto industry. They are designed to prevent founders and early investors from dumping large amounts of tokens onto the market immediately after launch. Tokens are released gradually over time, aligning the interests of the team with the long-term success of the project. The recent Aave founder ENA sale highlights the eventual unlocking and potential distribution of these vested assets. What Does This Aave Founder ENA Sale Mean for the Market? A transaction of this magnitude by a well-known figure like Stani Kulechov can have several implications. Firstly, it draws attention to ENA and Ethena, potentially increasing trading volume and public discourse around the project. Secondly, large sales, especially by insiders, can sometimes lead to market speculation about the asset’s short-term price action. It’s important for investors to consider that such transfers are often part of a founder’s financial planning or portfolio diversification strategies. They don’t necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the project, but rather a liquidity event from a vested asset. However, market participants will undoubtedly be watching ENA’s performance closely. Navigating Transparency in Crypto Transactions The transparency inherent in blockchain technology allows for the tracking of such transactions. While the specific reasons behind Kulechov’s transfer are not publicly detailed, the ability for platforms like AmberCN to report on them underscores the open nature of the crypto ledger. This transparency is a double-edged sword: it offers accountability but also opens the door for intense market reaction to insider movements. The crypto community often debates the balance between privacy and transparency, especially concerning the actions of influential figures. The reported Aave founder ENA sale by Stani Kulechov is a significant event that highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market. It underscores the financial activities of prominent figures within the space and the mechanisms of token vesting and distribution. While the implications are still unfolding, it serves as a reminder for investors to stay informed about market movements and the actions of key stakeholders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Stani Kulechov? A: Stani Kulechov is the founder of Aave, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is ENA? A: ENA is the governance token for Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol that provides USDe, a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin. Q3: What does ‘vesting wallet’ mean? A: A vesting wallet holds tokens that are gradually released to founders, team members, or early investors over a predetermined period, rather than all at once. This mechanism encourages long-term commitment to the project. Q4: Is this Aave founder ENA sale a bearish signal for ENA? A: Not necessarily. While large sales can create short-term price pressure, they can also be part of a founder’s personal financial management or portfolio diversification strategy. Investors should consider the broader market context and Ethena’s fundamentals. Q5: How does this transaction affect Aave? A: This transaction primarily involves ENA tokens, not AAVE tokens. While Stani Kulechov is the founder of Aave, this specific sale does not directly impact Aave’s protocol operations or its native AAVE token. Q6: Where can I track such crypto transactions? A: Many blockchain explorers (like Etherscan) allow you to track public wallet addresses. Additionally, crypto analytics firms and news outlets often report on significant on-chain movements.

A significant event has unfolded in the Astar ecosystem, drawing attention to an Astar whale who now commands a staggering $126 million in ASTER tokens. This substantial accumulation, steadily withdrawn from the Gate.io exchange, highlights a major investor’s conviction in the Astar Network’s future. According to reports from AmberCN, this particular investor has been consistently moving ASTER tokens off the exchange. Just recently, an additional 6.34 million ASTER, valued at approximately $12.94 million, was transferred, pushing their total holdings to an impressive 61.34 million ASTER. Unpacking the Astar Whale Phenomenon In the world of cryptocurrency, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular digital asset. The actions of such large holders, like this prominent Astar whale , can often influence market sentiment and even price movements due to the sheer volume of their holdings. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking the crypto landscape. When a whale accumulates assets, it often signals a long-term bullish outlook, as they are taking tokens out of circulation on exchanges and holding them. What is ASTER? ASTER is the native token of the Astar Network, a dApp hub on Polkadot that supports EVM and WebAssembly. Why is accumulation significant? It suggests strong belief in the project’s fundamentals and future growth potential. The Strategic Accumulation of ASTER by an Astar Whale The methodical nature of these withdrawals from Gate.io over several days suggests a calculated strategy rather than a sudden impulsive move. This Astar whale is not just buying, but actively securing their assets off-exchange, which is a common practice for long-term investors. This steady accumulation reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Moreover, it signifies a deep conviction in the Astar Network’s technology and its role in the broader Web3 ecosystem. Such sustained activity by a major holder often prompts other investors to pay closer attention to the asset. It can create a ripple effect, boosting confidence across the community. What This Astar Whale’s Dominance Means for ASTER The accumulation of $126 million by a single Astar whale is not just a statistic; it carries potential implications for the ASTER market. While it doesn’t guarantee future price action, it certainly adds an interesting dynamic. A large holding can influence liquidity and market depth. If the whale decides to sell, it could create significant downward pressure. However, sustained holding suggests the opposite: a belief in future appreciation. The community often views such large investments as a vote of confidence. This can attract new investors and further strengthen the network’s ecosystem. Potential Positive Impact: Increased market confidence, reduced selling pressure on exchanges. Potential Considerations: Future whale selling could impact prices, but currently, it signals bullish sentiment. Key Takeaways from the Astar Whale’s Bold Move The actions of this particular Astar whale offer valuable insights into the behavior of significant market players. For investors, monitoring such movements can be a part of a comprehensive market analysis strategy, though it should never be the sole basis for investment decisions. It underscores the importance of fundamental analysis and understanding the long-term vision of projects like Astar Network. While whales can move markets, the underlying technology and adoption are what truly drive sustainable growth. This unprecedented accumulation by an Astar whale serves as a powerful reminder of the conviction some major players have in the future of specific blockchain projects. As the Astar Network continues to develop its decentralized applications and expand its ecosystem, the movements of its largest holders will undoubtedly remain a focal point for the crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Astar whale in cryptocurrency? A: An Astar whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of ASTER tokens, typically enough to potentially influence the market price or liquidity of the asset. Q2: Why is it significant when an Astar whale accumulates tokens? A: Accumulation by a whale often signals strong confidence in the project’s long-term prospects. It removes tokens from exchange supply, which can reduce immediate selling pressure and indicate a bullish outlook. Q3: What is the Astar Network? A: The Astar Network is a dApp hub on Polkadot that supports multiple virtual machines (EVM and WebAssembly), aiming to be a multi-chain smart contract platform that connects to various Layer 1 blockchains. Q4: How does a whale’s activity affect the market? A: A whale’s large transactions can impact market sentiment, price, and liquidity. Accumulation can be seen as bullish, while large selling could lead to price drops. However, their actions are just one factor among many. Q5: Should I base my investment decisions on whale movements? A: While tracking whale movements can offer insights, it’s not advisable to base investment decisions solely on them. Always conduct thorough research, including fundamental and technical analysis, and consider your own risk tolerance. Did you find this analysis of the Astar whale’s massive accumulation insightful?

The letter, sent to the State Department, Commerce Department, and the Department of Ethics, names two senior figures — David Sacks and Steve Witkoff — and presses for quick answers about their roles. Senators Call For Investigation The senators say Sacks, who advises on AI and crypto, and Witkoff, a special envoy to the Middle East, were involved in a complex deal that connected Abu Dhabi’s MGX, Binance, and a stablecoin called USD1. Reports indicate the deal was first announced in March and was detailed again in a September New York Times piece. According to the senators, the arrangement was not a simple investment but part of a set of actions that could have opened doors for foreign access to US AI systems. Details Of The Transaction At the center is USD1, a token issued by World Liberty Financial, a company tied to the president’s family. Based on reports, MGX moved money in a transaction valued at $2 billion that involved Binance and the USD1 token as part of the settlement. Lawmakers want to know who negotiated which terms, and whether any official acts or policy pushes were influenced by private gain tied to that token. National Security Concerns Raised Warren and Slotkin argue the case raises serious national security questions. They wrote that certain officials appear to have pushed for policy changes that would make advanced US AI technology more accessible to the UAE. The senators warned that “no place in the US government” should be found for mixing official duties with private business interests. They also said that until answers arrive, Congress should be wary of any rules that could benefit politically connected crypto players. Lawmakers Push Back On Industry-Authored Bills Senator Warren has said she supports clearer rules for digital assets but will oppose measures “written by the crypto industry.” Slotkin echoed that view, urging clarity before moving on market reforms and stressing that lawmakers must be sure crypto money is not shaping national security choices. The House passed its version of a digital asset bill, the CLARITY Act , which drew 78 Democratic votes. Yet the Senate measure, championed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, has stalled and faces a slow path forward.

Crypto Liquidations Have Neared $1 Billion Over The Last 24 Hours According to data from CoinGlass, a massive amount of liquidations have occurred in the cryptocurrency derivatives market during the past day. A “liquidation” occurs when an open contract exceeds a certain loss threshold defined by the exchange and undergoes forceful closure. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Triangle Setup Points To $100, Says Analyst Due to the volatility that Bitcoin and other assets have experienced over the last 24 hours, a huge amount of contracts have crossed this threshold. Below is a table that breaks down the relevant numbers related to these liquidations. As is visible, cryptocurrency liquidations have totaled at $967 million inside this window, which is a pretty significant amount. Since the price action in the past day has majorly been in the bearish direction, the positions most affected would be the bullish bets. And indeed, as the data shows, $849 million of the liquidations, representing almost 88% of the total, involved long investors. Ethereum has recently been dominating speculative activity in the market, and it seems the asset has topped the charts during this derivatives flush as well, with $309 million in liquidations. Bitcoin has come second with around $246 million. A mass liquidation event like this latest one isn’t a rare occurrence in the cryptocurrency sector, mainly due to two reasons: coins can be volatile on the regular and extreme amounts of leverage can be easily accessible. Such an event, where a cascade of liquidations occurs, is known as a squeeze. As longs were the party most seriously affected in the latest squeeze, the event would be termed as a long squeeze. This is the second long squeeze that the market has suffered this week, with the other one arriving during Bitcoin’s Monday plummet to $112,000. Here is a chart shared by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode that shows how the previous long squeeze compared against this latest one for Bitcoin: According to Glassnode, the two large long squeezes could actually help prevent more such events in the near future. “This flush of leverage reflects a broad deleveraging event, often resetting market positioning and easing the risk of further cascades,” explains the analytics firm.

52317607,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84509,1758938457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin Price: Why October Is the Make-or-Break Moment Traders Fear,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-price-why-october-is-the-make-or-break-moment-traders/,"October has a unique place in Bitcoin’s history. Known among traders as “Uptober” for its tendency to produce rallies, the month has also delivered sharp corrections when expectations ran too high. As 2025 enters its final quarter, the stakes are higher than ever. Bitcoin is hovering near critical technical levels, and liquidity conditions are shifting rapidly as global markets recalibrate to central bank policy and institutional positioning. Over the past week, Bitcoin has traded within a narrow band, consolidating after a volatile 22 September that saw more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions liquidated across major exchanges. Such resets often define the setup for the following month. Analysts point out that October’s performance frequently sets the tone for year-end rallies or corrections. If Bitcoin manages to break higher, it could pull the entire market with it. If it falters, the rest of the sector may struggle to find footing. Against this backdrop, investors are also eyeing opportunities in emerging tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is beginning to attract serious attention alongside the majors. Technical pressure points From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is battling resistance near $116,000. Multiple attempts to breach this level have been rejected, but each pullback has found support above $110,000. Traders view this tightening range as a coiled spring. A decisive breakout above resistance could trigger momentum toward $125,000 or even $130,000, levels that align with long-term Fibonacci extensions. Conversely, a breakdown below $110,000 might open the door to a retest of $100,000, a psychological level that many see as the ultimate line in the sand for bullish narratives. Volume trends are critical here. On-chain data shows that exchange reserves continue to decline, indicating that long-term holders are withdrawing coins and reducing sell pressure. At the same time, derivatives markets are displaying cautious optimism, with funding rates stabilizing after September’s washout. Together, these signals suggest that Bitcoin is preparing for a major move, one that October will likely decide. MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the spotlight October has historically marked turning points for Bitcoin, with volatility often setting the stage for altcoin rotation. Traders watching this month’s charts are already scouting presales that could ride the same macro wave. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the leading candidates. With over $14 million raised and rapidly climbing stage prices, some investors are eyeing returns in the 200%–400% range as early as its first exchange listings. Over the past 72 hours, its website traffic spiked sharply, suggesting growing retail inflows even as Bitcoin faces resistance. Analysts warn that while BTC’s October could be pivotal, presale tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide diversification into asymmetric ROI opportunities. The fact that the project continues to post new milestones, from social growth to round closures, reinforces the view that it may deliver compelling returns, particularly if Bitcoin stumbles and capital rotates down the risk curve. Macro environment and institutional flows Macro conditions add another layer of complexity. The Federal Reserve’s latest policy shift has reignited risk-on appetite, with traders now expecting further rate cuts by year-end. Historically, looser monetary conditions have boosted Bitcoin and other digital assets, as capital searches for higher returns. Yet the global picture remains mixed. Equity markets are at record highs, and bond yields are drifting lower, but geopolitical risks and slowing growth in major economies create headwinds. Institutional flows continue to play an outsized role. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have seen steady inflows, with BlackRock and Fidelity’s products leading the pack. These funds provide a new baseline of demand that did not exist in previous cycles. However, ETF inflows alone cannot drive prices indefinitely; traders caution that organic retail participation must also return. October, historically a month of renewed retail enthusiasm, could be the moment when both institutional and retail demand converge. Interplay between majors and presales The relationship between Bitcoin and new entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE illustrates a broader market dynamic. When Bitcoin consolidates or struggles with resistance, speculative capital often seeks opportunities in presales and small-cap tokens. This rotation is not random; it reflects the natural desire of investors to balance security with upside. If October proves to be choppy for Bitcoin, presales could see heightened activity as traders look for faster-moving plays. At the same time, a breakout in Bitcoin would likely create a rising-tide effect, lifting sentiment across the board. In such a scenario, MAGACOIN FINANCE could benefit from spillover enthusiasm, gaining visibility as retail investors broaden their search for high-upside opportunities. This dual-path potential is what makes the project so appealing to forward-thinking investors, it doesn’t rely solely on Bitcoin’s performance to thrive. Why October matters more than ever The reason October looms so large in traders’ minds is its tendency to act as a pivot point. In 2017, October’s rally set the stage for the blow-off top in December. In 2021, October delivered gains that were quickly erased by November’s correction, highlighting how quickly sentiment can flip. With ETFs now in play, institutional demand more established, and presales gaining unprecedented traction, October 2025 carries even greater significance. This convergence of technical, macro, and speculative forces means the market could experience sharp moves in either direction. For cautious investors, October offers a chance to evaluate risk management strategies. For aggressive investors, it provides a window to position for potential breakout gains. Either way, the decisions made in this month will likely reverberate through the remainder of the year and beyond. Conclusion October has always been a month of decision for Bitcoin, and 2025 is shaping up to be no different. Resistance levels, macro conditions, and institutional flows are aligning to make the coming weeks critical for defining the market’s next phase. While Bitcoin holds the key to broader sentiment, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are carving their own path, offering investors a shot at exponential upside alongside the majors. Smart investors recognize that the playbook for success is not choosing between one or the other but balancing exposure across both. With Bitcoin preparing for a potential breakout and MAGACOIN FINANCE building momentum from its presale success, October may well become the month that separates cautious observers from those who capture the full scope of opportunity in crypto’s evolving cycle.

The token hovered around the $2.75 support level on Friday, but analysts warned that sustained selling could push prices down toward the $2.65 to $2.45 range. Such a move would represent an 8% to 10% decline, coinciding with a daily fair value gap (FVG) overlapping the 0.50–0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. This area could act as a liquidity magnet while offering a potential springboard for a bullish recovery. Onchain Data Signals Strong Buyer Interest Onchain metrics support the view that XRP may be approaching an important liquidity pocket. Glassnode’s Unrealized Price Distribution (URPD) showed a dense cluster of buyers between $2.45 and $2.55, indicating a strong cost basis for many holders. If price returns to this range, buyers may defend it aggressively, potentially laying the groundwork for a rebound. The altcoin’s current behavior mirrors its fractal pattern from the first quarter. XRP has already tested the $2.65 mark twice, but historical price structures suggest a sweep below this level into the liquid-heavy FVG could occur before a sustainable rally emerges. Repeating Patterns Could Lead to Volatility Market watchers have noted similarities between today’s setup and earlier fractals. Previous patterns showed weakness heading into the weekend, followed by an FVG sweep early the following week. If this plays out again, XRP could revisit the $2.50 zone as soon as Monday. However, analysts caution that historical fractals do not guarantee a repeat performance. A decisive break above $2.90 could invalidate the bearish structure altogether, but current momentum still favors one last dip into the $2.50 area. Compression and ETF News Fuel Uncertainty Sistine Research observed that XRP may be entering a significant expansion phase in the coming months. The analysis highlighted how XRP’s tight price action over the past 10 weeks has compressed its order book, leaving larger gaps between levels. This marks the third compression phase since the US elections in November 2024 and the tightest so far, built on three consecutively higher price points. Such conditions have historically preceded sharp breakouts as built-up liquidity is released. Crypto analyst Pelin Ay pointed to spot market flows as evidence of the battle between buyers and sellers. The 90-day spot taker CVD indicates that sellers remain in control despite brief bursts of buyer strength earlier in 2025. A sustained upside move will require a decisive shift in volume from buyers, which has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, ETF news adds another layer of uncertainty. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF decision has been postponed until Nov. 14, while REX/Osprey’s XRPR product debuted with nearly $38 million in first-day volume. Analysts warn that optimism may already be priced in, heightening the risk of a “sell the news” reaction when decisions are finalized.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-27 02:23:44

Recently, a notable trend has emerged concerning Spot ETH ETFs , signaling a period of caution for many. These investment vehicles, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset, have seen a significant withdrawal of funds. Understanding the Alarming Spot ETH ETFs Outflows On September 26, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs recorded a substantial net outflow of $243 million. This marks the fifth consecutive trading day where more money has left these funds than entered, according to data compiled by TraderT. Such a sustained trend can indicate shifting investor sentiment or broader market pressures. While the overall picture shows outflows, it’s important to look at the nuances. Not all Spot ETH ETFs experienced the same fate. For instance: Ark 21Shares’ TETH saw a net inflow of $8.05 million. Grayscale’s ETHE also recorded a net inflow, totaling $17.91 million. However, these positive movements were overshadowed by much larger withdrawals from other major players: BlackRock’s ETHA experienced a significant net outflow of $195 million. Fidelity’s FETH followed suit with a net outflow of $74.39 million. This disparity suggests that while some funds are attracting capital, others are facing considerable redemption pressures. The concentration of outflows from key funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH is particularly noteworthy, as these are often seen as bellwethers for institutional interest. What Drives Such Significant Spot ETH ETFs Movement? Several factors could contribute to such pronounced movements in Spot ETH ETFs . Market sentiment, often influenced by broader economic conditions or regulatory news, plays a crucial role. When investors perceive increased risk or uncertainty in the wider financial markets, they may opt to withdraw funds from more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the price performance of Ethereum itself can directly impact investor behavior. A period of stagnant or declining ETH prices might prompt investors to re-evaluate their positions in related ETF products. It’s also possible that investors are rebalancing their portfolios, moving capital from one asset class to another in response to changing investment strategies or opportunities. Another potential factor could be profit-taking. If investors had previously entered these Spot ETH ETFs at lower prices, the current outflows could represent a strategic move to lock in gains. Conversely, some investors might be cutting losses if they entered the market at higher price points and are reacting to recent market dips. Navigating the Future of Spot ETH ETFs: Challenges and Insights The consistent net outflows present a challenge for the burgeoning Spot ETH ETFs market. While the approval of these ETFs was a significant milestone for institutional adoption, sustained withdrawals could temper enthusiasm and potentially impact future product development or market liquidity. However, it’s also important to view these movements in context. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and periods of outflows can be followed by periods of strong inflows. For investors, these trends highlight the importance of staying informed and understanding the underlying dynamics of their investments. It’s crucial to look beyond daily fluctuations and consider the long-term potential of Ethereum and the broader crypto ecosystem. The inflows into Ark 21Shares’ TETH and Grayscale’s ETHE, though smaller, indicate that some investors still see value and opportunity in the asset. Key Takeaways for Investors: Monitor Fund-Specific Data: Not all ETFs perform identically. Consider Broader Market Trends: Macroeconomic factors can influence crypto performance. Long-Term Perspective: Volatility is inherent in crypto markets; focus on long-term goals. In conclusion, the recent $243 million net outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs over five consecutive days is a significant event. While specific funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH bore the brunt of these withdrawals, others like Ark 21Shares’ TETH and Grayscale’s ETHE saw modest inflows. This mixed picture underscores the complex nature of investor sentiment and market dynamics within the cryptocurrency space. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these trends will be vital for anyone involved with Ethereum-related investment products. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Spot ETH ETFs? Spot ETH ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are Spot ETH ETFs experiencing outflows? Outflows can be driven by various factors, including shifting investor sentiment due to broader economic conditions, regulatory uncertainty, profit-taking by early investors, or a general decline in Ethereum’s price. Large withdrawals from specific funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH contributed significantly to the recent net outflows. Do these outflows mean institutional interest in Ethereum is waning? Not necessarily. While significant, the outflows could be part of a normal market cycle, including portfolio rebalancing or short-term reactions to market volatility. The fact that some funds like Ark 21Shares’ TETH and Grayscale’s ETHE still saw inflows suggests continued, albeit selective, institutional interest. How do Spot ETH ETFs differ from other Ethereum investment products? Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of Ethereum futures contracts, Spot ETH ETFs directly hold Ethereum. This often appeals to investors seeking more direct exposure to the asset’s current market price. Other products might include direct ETH purchases or trust funds, each with different structures and fee implications. What should investors do in response to these Spot ETH ETFs trends? Investors should conduct their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and consult with a financial advisor. It’s advisable to monitor market trends, understand the specific performance of their chosen ETFs, and maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting impulsively to short-term fluctuations.

Purchases by publicly traded digital-asset treasuries have plummeted dramatically, from 64,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in July to just 12,600 in August, with September’s figures currently at around 15,500. This drop represents a major 76% decrease from the fervor of early summer. Crypto Treasury Firms Valuation Sinks The broader cryptocurrency market has faced additional challenges, with Bitcoin experiencing nearly a 6% decline over the past week, exacerbated by a broader selloff characterized by sudden liquidations. Shares in some treasuries that previously raised capital through PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) deals have seen valuations plummet, with some trading down as much as 97% below their initial issuance prices. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) On The Brink Of A Major Breakout: 800% Rally In Sight One of the reasons behind this shift is regulatory scrutiny, with reports indicating that US authorities are now investigating “unusual trading activity” within digital-asset treasury shares ahead of their acquisitions. Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, alleges that there is limited transparency regarding the crypto acquisition prices of the underlying tokens and the actual share counts, particularly since many PIPE deals include warrants that complicate matters with their volatility and dilution effects. The valuations of some treasury firms, which once enjoyed high market premiums, have drastically declined, with their market value approaching the actual Bitcoin they hold. This shift is measured by the market-cap-to-NAV (net asset value) multiple, which now reflects a concerning trend: the disconnect between stock prices and the value of Bitcoin reserves is closing. Diminished Institutional Support As corporate buyers retreat, Bloomberg asserts that the crypto market is experiencing a “feedback loop” that diminishes institutional support. The report alleges that this absence of a stable capital source undermines demand, leading to a more precarious market environment. The current landscape has given rise to a “two-speed market.” On one hand, derivative markets exhibit significant stress, with demand for longer-dated futures collapsing and $275 million worth of Bitcoin longs liquidated in just 24 hours. Related Reading: Expert Prediction: Bitcoin Price Could Hit $200,000 By June 2026, Claiming 50% Probability Conversely, crypto-related products continue to attract investment, as evidenced by the iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), which garnered $2.5 billion in inflows in September, a substantial increase from $707 million the previous month. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, emphasized that the current weakness in the crypto market is likely a consequence of diminished activity from digital asset treasuries rather than a direct cause of selling pressure. The reduction of these major buyers, he contends, has created a more cautious market environment.

52319692,590774,1758942009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52319692.jpeg,DeFi Community On Alert Following Hypervault’s $3.6 Million Suspected Rug Pull,https://bitcoinist.com/defi-alert-hypervaults-3-6-million-rug-pull/,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol HyperVault is suspected to have executed a “rug pull,” as on-chain analytics account PeckShield noted an abnormal outflow of funds from the protocol, worth close to $3.6 million. DeFi Protocol HyperVault Pulls The Rug According to an X post by on-chain analytics account PeckShield, Hyperliquid-based DeFi protocol HyperVault appears to have pulled a quick one on its users, defrauding them of funds worth almost $3.6 million. PeckShield noted that the stolen funds were bridged from Hyperliquid to Ethereum, swapped into ETH, and then 752 ETH were deposited into Tornado Cash. For the uninitiated, Tornado Cash is a popular crypto mixer that is typically used by hackers to erase their on-chain trail. Notably, UPUMP tokens worth $191,494, USDC worth $107,358, WHYPE worth $1.55 million, and several other tokens were stolen from HyperVault. PeckShield noted that HyperVault have also deactivated all their socials – including the X handle – virtually confirming the rug pull. To explain, a rug pull is a type of crypto scam where developers suddenly abandon a project and drain its funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. It’s common in DeFi and NFT spaces, where anonymity and lack of regulation make quick exits easier. HyperVault offered “unmanaged” auto-compounding vaults, strategy adapters, and keeper-bot harvests. These features helped users route their digital assets to lending, looping, and concentrated liquidity venues on HyperEVM. Another X user HypingBull, commented , saying that they had been warning about HyperVault since September 4. In an X post, the user stated that the protocol’s developers lied to them about audits, adding: I have just reached Pashov (blockchain audit firm) on Telegram, asking if Hypervaut is doing an audit via them. The answer was: “First time I hear the project with this name”. WTF? This is super suspicious. I am withdrawing all the funds from the protocol until the team clarifies what’s going on. Unfortunately, users continued to deposit funds into the DeFi protocol, lured by the protocol’s promised 90% APR yields on HYPE tokens. However, the extraordinarily high-yield promises at the time did not raise the alarm among users. That said, the HYPE token appears to be minimally impacted by this suspected rug pull, as it is trading at $42.89 at the time of writing, up 2.8% on the day. However, the token is down almost 25% over the past week. Crypto Still The Wild West? While the total crypto market cap now hovers over $3.8 trillion, the safety of users continues to be a major factor hindering the industry from mainstream adoption. For example, crypto phishing attacks recorded a significant surge in August 2025, impacting as many as 15,230 victims, resulting in a loss of $12 million in user funds. Similarly, the THORChain Founder lost $1.35 million earlier this month after a deepfake Zoom and Telegram scam. At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $109,488, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.",DeFi|Altcoin|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Ethereum|hype|HyperVault|rug pull|scam|Tornado Cash,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 03:00:09

CRCL's regulatory leadership, rapid USDC circulation growth, and Binance partnership position it to gain market share despite interest rate headwinds. Falling interest rates pressure CRCL's interest income, but robust USDC growth and new revenue streams like the Arc blockchain offset this risk. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expanding, and with stable costs and strong tailwinds from the GENIUS Act, CRCL offers a compelling rebound opportunity. As the stock market falls from recent highs, one thought pervades my opportunistic mindset: which stocks, particularly momentum and growth stocks, have fallen sharper than their fundamentals might justify? What rebound opportunities exist in the crash? While in general I regard most crypto and blockchain highfliers with skepticism, Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) caught my eye recently. The sponsor behind the number-two stablecoin, USDC, has now fallen well below its original $130 IPO price; despite one point reaching above $200 per share. As the stock recedes, the core question on investors’ minds is: can Circle pull off a rebound? Data by YCharts I’m initiating Circle at a buy rating. To address the elephant in the room: the core reason Circle has been falling recently is mostly the same reason other stocks are rising: lower interest rate expectations. Since this hurts Circle’s principal source of revenue (interest income), investors are rightly nervous. And yet I also think the sheer growth of USDC can’t be ignored. Use this dip as a buying opportunity. The U.S. leader in regulated stablecoins First, let’s start with what exactly Circle does. Circle is the sponsor behind one of the largest and best known stablecoins, USDC. For those new to the term, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of an underlying asset: in this case, 1:1 against the U.S. dollar. One of the best ways to think about stablecoins is fulfilling the original promise of crypto: by acting as an efficient means of exchange on the internet, minus the volatility and price fluctuation that has accompanied the speculative activity of other coins. Since there is no scarcity (like Bitcoin) and each USDC is backed by a real U.S. dollar held in reserve, the price does not move. Stablecoin share overview (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) It’s probably not necessary to state that the stablecoin market is growing rapidly. As of the end of Q2, Circle noted that the market cap of stablecoins in circulation grew at a stunning 50% y/y clip to $223 billion. Transactions, meanwhile, grew at an even faster 75% y/y clip as more applications and merchants leverage blockchain technology to process payments. Stablecoins recently grew to more than 1% of U.S. M2 money supply. The stablecoin industry as a whole saw a massive leap in adoption when the GENIUS Act was passed earlier this year by President Trump. GENIUS provided the first regulatory framework for oversight of stablecoins, including auditing reserve balances. Rather than strangle the industry with regulations, this was broadly seen as a positive for mainstream adoption. USDC is only the second largest coin: USDT, or Tether, predates USDC and is roughly 2x larger. And yet regulation is the number one differentiator for USDC. Circle has taken a compliance first attitude toward USDC, while Tether, which is sponsored by a company domiciled in the British Virgin Islands, is less subject to regulation. USDC vs. USDT (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) To me, and to many market observers, the regulatory safety net underpinning USDC is a major reason why Circle is poised to gain market share. The chart below showcases that USDC's share of crypto trading volumes has grown to 10%, up from just 1% in the year-ago quarter. This is just a beginning indication of the potential that USDC has to grow. Key to USDC's market share expansion is a partnership with Binance , which is the largest crypto trading platform in the world. Since December 2024, Binance has made USDC more broadly available to its 240 million global customers. Since the partnership kicked off, USDC has also grown as a share of assets held in custody by Binance, as shown in the chart below: USDC growth (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) Interest income: at risk as rates fall, but circulation growth should offset Now let's turn our attention to the number-one factor that is pushing Circle stock down. Circle generates the lion's share of its revenue from interest held on the cash and short-term securities that back its issuance of USDC. As shown in the chart below, reserve returns have been falling alongside interest rate declines: in Q2, reserve returns of 4.14% (roughly matching current yields on U.S. short term treasury bonds, as measured by the SHV ETF ( SHV )) fell -103 bps y/y. Circle reserve return rate (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) After the close of the quarter, the Fed cut rates by a quarter point, and is expecting two further cuts by year-end. Current estimates are placing rate-cut odds for only one further cut in 2026. So all else equal, rates could fall by 100 bps relative to current levels, which would cut out ~25% of Circle's revenue stream. Note as well that Circle still pays out a large portion of this revenue as ""distribution fees"" to its large crypto wallet partners, namely Coinbase and Binance. As rates have fallen and as Circle has focused on growth, its RLDC margin (revenue less distribution cost) has also dwindled somewhat to 38%, meaning that Circle only generates 38% of clean net revenue for each dollar it earns in interest income. Circle RLDC margin (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) While I agree that interest rate declines are a headwind for Circle, there are two reasons that I think the company will still be able to pull ahead: Circulation growth is far outpacing expected interest rate declines. As I previously mentioned, a ~100 bps fall in interest rates will hurt interest revenue by ~25%, relative to the company's current ~4% reserve return rate. But at the same time, USDC circulation grew at 90% y/y in the most recent quarter. I also think that the recent risk-off attitude in the stock market and the selloff in momentum stocks will push more investors to increase their allocation to cash - and USDC is now a core alternative for cash holdings. Coinbase currently pays a 4.1% yield on USDC held on its platform. All in all, Circle is still well poised for revenue growth as stablecoin participation and usage itself grows, and as Circle's own market share expands. Alternative revenue streams. Circle recently released the Arc blockchain, which is its own payment protocol that is natively designed to support USDC transactions (as an alternative to using USDC on other blockchains, such as Ethereum). Circle can earn ""gas"" fees from transactions on the Arc network, which is a revenue stream that didn't exist entirely in 2024. While it's still early days and we have yet to see how wide of an adoption that Arc can achieve, this initiative helps to boost Circle's horizon beyond earning just interest alone. Healthy adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and reasonable valuation We also think that amid top-line concerns, Circle's growing profitability shouldn't be ignored. In Q2, Circle grew adjusted EBITDA at a 52% y/y pace (again, this is in spite of a 103bps y/y decline in reserve return rates) to $126 million, representing a 50% margin against revenue less distribution and transaction costs (the 38% RLDC margin we discussed earlier). This improved 5 points y/y. Circle adjusted EBITDA (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) Circle is guiding to $475-$490 million in full-year adjusted opex (excluding stock comp), which implies quarterly opex holding stable at ~$125 million per quarter through the balance of the year. Circle outlook (Circle Aug 2025 investor presentation) The company has also guided to a 40% CAGR in USDC circulation (which should more than offset interest rate pressure), growth in ""other revenue"" including the new Arc blockchain initiative, and RLDC margins stabilizing in the 36-38% range. To me, this is a powerful combination for further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. At face value, Circle looks expensive at a 58x forward adjusted EBITDA that sits slightly above 2x of Coinbase's valuation. Data by YCharts But the reason I think Circle's valuation is quite reasonable is because of its rapid pace of current adjusted EBITDA expansion (with all the factors necessary for continued growth still in place: USDC circulation growth well in excess of interest rate declines, modest opex growth, and stable distribution costs) which makes near-term adjusted EBITDA multiples less reliable. Coinbase, on the other hand, looks cheap relative to Circle: but the vast majority of Coinbase's revenue depends on trading revenue, which is very volatile and fluctuates widely from quarter to quarter, whereas Circle's revenue is generated from a very stable interest income stream. In fact, Coinbase's revenue essentially flatlined in the most recent quarter (a function of lower crypto trading volatility) while adjusted EBITDA declined -14% y/y. Coinbase Q2 highlights (Coinbase Q2 shareholder letter) Key takeaways I'd much rather bank on a stable, predictable company like Circle rather than bet on Coinbase's very volatile trading revenue. In my view, the tailwinds from the passage of the GENIUS act this year is unlocking substantial adoption of stablecoins and, in particular, USDC, which is positioning Circle for tremendous revenue growth in spite of interest rate headwinds.

Analysts and industry figures frequently cite trillions of dollars in debt securities that could transition into digital formats in the coming years. Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a known supporter of XRP, highlighted the unique role the digital asset can play in this transformation. He stated, “Trillions in debt will be tokenized. But only XRP can unlock the liquidity trapped inside.” XRP’s design as a settlement asset makes it capable of handling high-value transactions across borders with minimal friction. Aljarrah’s comments reflect a growing sentiment that XRP is more than just another cryptocurrency. Unlike many digital assets that rely primarily on speculation, XRP has been developed and tested for institutional-grade security and utility. By emphasizing its function in settlement, he draws attention to how XRP could act as a bridge for the massive flow of capital expected to enter blockchain-based debt markets. Trillions in debt will be tokenized. But only #XRP can unlock the liquidity trapped inside. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 25, 2025 XRP’s Role in Liquidity Unlocking Liquidity is central to the functioning of debt markets. Traditional debt instruments, whether sovereign bonds or corporate notes, often face limitations due to complex settlement processes, jurisdictional boundaries, and time delays. Tokenization promises to make these assets easier to issue, transfer, and settle. However, without a suitable settlement asset, tokenization alone does not fully solve the liquidity challenge. This is where XRP’s role becomes significant. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Its ability to facilitate near-instant transactions across multiple networks makes it uniquely positioned to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized debt. By providing a neutral and liquid bridge currency , XRP can enable the release of trapped capital within these markets. This unlocking of liquidity is not theoretical but directly linked to practical settlement needs. Potential Impact on XRP’s Value The adoption of XRP in large-scale debt markets would have a direct effect on demand. Debt securities represent one of the largest segments of global finance, with outstanding amounts measured in the hundreds of trillions. If even a small portion of this capital required settlement through XRP, the upward pressure on its value could be substantial. As Aljarrah suggested, XRP is positioned to be the only asset capable of fulfilling this function effectively. Its existing infrastructure, proven transaction capacity, and focus on real-world use cases create a foundation for growth. This sets it apart from cryptocurrencies that lack utility beyond trading activity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

SOL Price Risks Drop To $150 If This Critical Support Fails,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-price-risks-drop-to-150-if-this-support-fails/,"After hitting a one-month low, Solana (SOL) has bounced from a critical support zone and is attempting to reclaim a crucial psychological barrier before potentially resuming its bullish rally. However, some analysts suggested that the cryptocurrency could retest new lows if the market volatility persists. Related Reading: SUI Retest Ascending Triangle Support Amid 8% Drop – Bounce Or Breakdown Next? Solana Price Retest Major Support On Thursday, Solana lost the $200 level as support after closing the day below this level for the first time in nearly a month. The cryptocurrency has been trading inside the $120-$220 price range since early February, finally breaking out of this range in mid-September. A week ago, the market’s bullish momentum and strong corporate treasury purchases pushed SOL’s price to an eight-month high of $253, leading many investors to anticipate the long-awaited rally to higher levels. However, this week’s pullbacks have sent most cryptocurrencies below crucial levels, with Bitcoin and Ethereum dropping to $108,000 and $3,800, respectively. Meanwhile, Solana has seen a 20% decline in the weekly timeframe, losing the $200 level. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems asserted that SOL was “in freefall after that nasty deviation back into the range.” If Solana fails to hold the current $190-$200 range, the analyst considers it would be “very difficult” to find strong support before the demand zone around $150, a level not seen since the start of July. Similarly, market watcher Wise Crypto also noted that Solana could be in a make-or-break retest, as it retests a critical support zone and the overall market still shows some signs of weakness. According to the post, SOL has been trading within an ascending channel since April, bouncing between the upper and lower boundaries throughout this period. If the market’s recent volatility continues, the cryptocurrency could retest the channel’s support zone, around the $177-$188 levels. “If this zone breaks, the next major support is down below $150 — so caution is key,” they added. SOL Bounce Eyes $200 Reclaim Despite the volatility, Wise Crypto also signaled that “Stochastic RSI is signaling oversold conditions, suggesting a potential bounce could be on the horizon.” As a result, if SOL holds this support area, a move toward the $250 barrier could follow. As Solana approached its major ascending trendline, Crypto Batman noted that SOL has bounced from this level each time it has retested it, suggesting that “In the midst of chaos, you have to look at things from a different perspective.” Notably, SOL bounced from the recent lows on Friday Morning and is currently attempting to break above the $200 psychological barrier. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency must daily close above this key level and continue to hold it over the weekend to transform the pullback into a downside wick deviation in the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Holds Key Support, But Analyst Warns Rally Could Be At Risk Ted Pillows added that if this level is reclaimed, the $208-$210 area, near the 10-day Moving Average (MA), would be the next target. According to the market watcher, reclaiming and holding above that level would be the first bullish sign, which could potentially push Solana’s price toward $216–$220, near the 30-day MA. As of this writing, SOL trades at $199, a 1.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

Within a single trading session, over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, sending shockwaves across exchanges and briefly dragging the price below $110,000. The move rattled retail traders but has not dented long-term conviction among institutions and seasoned investors. For many, these steep selloffs are less about fear and more about opportunity, offering entry points that had previously seemed out of reach. Bitcoin’s history is littered with similar moments. In 2017, multiple 30% drawdowns punctuated the path to record highs. In 2020, a COVID-driven crash reset the market before a rally to $60,000. Each cycle has shown that while volatility is painful, it also creates the conditions for extraordinary upside. With Bitcoin still trading near all-time highs on a multi-year scale, analysts suggest that this correction may once again mark the beginning of a lucrative accumulation phase. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also benefiting from renewed interest in diversification as investors seek both stability and outsized returns. Technical support zones From a charting perspective, Bitcoin remains above critical long-term support levels. Traders point to $100,000 as the ultimate line in the sand. As long as Bitcoin holds this psychological level, the broader uptrend remains intact. Resistance sits near $116,000, where repeated attempts to break higher have been rejected. The narrowing band between support and resistance suggests that a major move is imminent, with October often serving as the catalyst for decisive trends. On-chain data provides further insight. Exchange reserves have been declining, showing that long-term holders are withdrawing coins rather than selling into weakness. Whale wallets have also been active, with accumulation spikes reported during the latest dip. These signals point to conviction among sophisticated investors, many of whom are treating this crash as an attractive opportunity rather than a cause for panic. Macro backdrop favors risk assets The broader economic environment adds another layer of intrigue. The Federal Reserve’s recent policy pivot has reinforced expectations of further rate cuts by year-end. Historically, easing liquidity has been a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as capital flows toward higher-return opportunities. Equity markets are near record highs, while bond yields have softened, creating conditions that often encourage speculative growth sectors. Institutional demand remains a cornerstone of the current cycle. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to record steady inflows, with BlackRock and Fidelity products leading the charge. Unlike previous cycles, these vehicles provide a constant source of new demand, creating a floor under Bitcoin’s price. Analysts argue that as long as these inflows persist, any dips are likely to be short-lived. This structural demand, combined with expanding retail interest, strengthens the case that the latest crash is less a warning and more an invitation. MAGACOIN FINANCE rides the wave of opportunity Market crashes often shake out weak hands but also create generational opportunities for risk-tolerant investors. As Bitcoin dipped sharply this week, speculative focus shifted toward presales that remain uncorrelated to spot drawdowns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging in that narrative. Its presale stages continue selling out despite broader volatility, suggesting strong conviction among buyers. The project’s audits by CertiK and HashEx further reassure participants that smart contract vulnerabilities are minimized. ROI projections vary, but many community analysts talk about 200%–600% upside potential if listings in Q4 materialize. In downturns, traders often seek projects with asymmetric risk-reward profiles, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that bill by offering discounted entry pricing that doesn’t move with Bitcoin’s day-to-day swings. This combination of credibility, traction, and ROI potential makes it one of the more notable dip-era plays. The buy-the-dip psychology Crypto investors have long debated the wisdom of buying into market crashes. For newcomers, sharp pullbacks spark fear and hesitation. For veterans, they are almost expected. Every cycle has produced corrections that, in hindsight, offered the best possible entry points. The key is differentiating between structural breakdowns and healthy resets. Current data suggests the latter: exchange reserves are falling, ETF demand remains steady, and long-term holders are not selling. This backdrop explains why the phrase “buy the dip” has become almost synonymous with crypto investing. It is less about blind optimism and more about understanding that volatility is the price of admission for exponential returns. By pairing stable accumulation in assets like Bitcoin with speculative plays such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors can balance downside risk with upside exposure. This layered strategy ensures that portfolios remain positioned for both immediate rebounds and long-term breakthroughs. Blending stability and speculation The interplay between Bitcoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the spectrum of opportunities in crypto. Bitcoin serves as the anchor: a proven, institutional-grade asset with a limited supply and growing demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the moonshot: a presale token that could multiply many times over if momentum continues. In moments of market stress, both sides of this spectrum gain appeal. Conservative investors seek the safety of Bitcoin’s track record, while risk-tolerant traders chase the exponential upside that new projects offer. This dual strategy has proven effective in past cycles. During Bitcoin’s 2020 recovery, capital rotated into presales and small-cap tokens that delivered life-changing multiples. Investors who balanced both captured the security of Bitcoin’s climb and the explosiveness of altcoin momentum. The current cycle shows every sign of repeating that pattern. Conclusion Bitcoin’s latest crash has rattled markets, but history suggests that dips of this magnitude often precede powerful rallies. With structural demand from ETFs, declining exchange reserves, and strong whale accumulation, the foundations remain intact for another leg higher. October’s performance could determine whether Bitcoin surges or struggles into year-end. For investors, the strategy is clear. Accumulating Bitcoin during crashes offers long-term security, while adding exposure to breakout projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a shot at extraordinary returns. Together, they form a balanced approach that can weather volatility and maximize opportunity. In crypto, fear and fortune often walk side by side, and those who treat the latest crash as a chance to act may be the ones celebrating when the next bull cycle ignites.

SEC, FINRA Scrutinize Suspicious Trading Moves On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that financial regulators have reached out to some of the over 200 companies with Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategies after observing unusual trading activity in the days leading up to the announcement of their crypto treasury strategy. People familiar with the matter told the news media outlet that the SEC and the FINRA have examined unusual trading moves in the shares of multiple unnamed companies that announced that they would adopt a DAT strategy this year. Reportedly, the regulators have raised concerns in letters and conversations about “unusually high trading volumes and sharp stock-price gains” that preceded the announcement that these companies would make cryptocurrencies their core corporate strategy. SEC officials have warned these companies about potential violations of Regulation Fair Disclosure, the WSJ sources alleged. As the news media outlet noted, the rule prohibits public companies from “selectively disclosing material, nonpublic information to investors, analysts, and other market participants who might trade on the information.” According to some lawyers, these types of FINRA letters usually mark the start of serious investigations into insider trading. However, it remains unclear whether the financial regulators are pursuing enforcement actions against any of these companies or investors. Former SEC enforcement lawyer and now SEC defense attorney David Chase told WSJ that “when those go out, it really stirs the pot. It’s typically the first step in an investigation. Whether it goes full, full length, it’s anybody’s guess.” The sources noted that, in some cases, the secrecy of the DAT announcements can be compromised, leading to the unusual stock activity ahead of the official statements. Meanwhile, lawyers who have worked on crypto-treasury deals affirmed that information leaks can also harm pricing transactions. “If the stock price is highly volatile in the days leading up to pricing a transaction, that could actually make it very difficult to agree on a price for the transaction and put it at risk of execution,” Justin Platt, a partner at law firm Goodwin, told WSJ. Crypto DAT’s Momentum Continues Over the past few months, the crypto treasury strategy trend, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, has gained momentum, with 212 new companies announcing plans to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to launch DAT strategies, the WSJ noted, citing data from crypto advisory firm Architect Partners. Throughout September, multiple companies have unveiled crypto treasury strategies focused on Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana (SOL). As reported by Bitcoinist, Solana-focused DATs have seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the strategies this month. Recently, Helius Medical Technology revealed the launch of a $500 million SOL treasury strategy backed by Pantera Capital and Summer Capital. Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Fitell Corporation, a global provider of fitness equipment and health solutions, has unveiled the launch of the first Solana-based digital asset treasury in Australia. Meanwhile, the top crypto treasuries have continued to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the leading digital assets. BitMine, the largest ETH-focused treasury, recently surpassed the 2 million ETH milestone, while Strategy, the leading Bitcoin and crypto treasury, purchased another 850 BTC earlier this week.",Crypto News|bitcoin|BitMine|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Treasury Company|DATs|Digital Asset Treasuries|Ethereum treasury|FINRA|Solana Treasury company|US SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 04:00:51

He stated, “In some of the current offerings we’ve seen 8-10% yields on XRP.” While such yields appear attractive, his priority remains security. He added that he would trade up to 5% of that yield for an insurance policy to insure his tokens against loss with a major insurance company, such as Lloyds of London. This approach emphasizes security over maximum yield. Instead of pursuing the highest return possible, the focus shifts to sustainable income backed by institutional participation . XRP Yield In some of the current offerings we've seen 8-10% yields on XRP. I'll trade 3-5% of that yield for an insurance policy insuring my XRP against loss with a major insurance company like @LloydsofLondon I'm sitting on the sidelines keeping my XRP safe for now. Chat GPT… pic.twitter.com/kMRmqhDASm — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) September 25, 2025 The Search for Sustainable Returns Throughout financial history, investors have been promised high yields that often proved unsustainable. From Charles Ponzi’s 50% return promises in 1920 to Bernie Madoff’s “consistent” 10 to 12% returns, many schemes ended in collapse. Even in modern times, dotcom stocks, subprime mortgage products, and crypto lending platforms offered double-digit returns that led to massive losses when the risks were revealed. The record shows that outsized yields without sufficient protection tend to collapse sooner or later. This background makes the conversation around XRP yield an important one. With current offerings within 8% and 10%, many holders are weighing the potential benefits and the risks of committing their assets. The challenge for investors is not only finding returns but ensuring that those returns are safeguarded. Digital Asset Investor noted that he would rather sit on the sidelines and keep his XRP safe rather than lose it to shady investments due to high yields. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why It Matters for XRP Digital Asset Investor’s position reflects lessons from past financial failures. The image he shared highlights how high-yield products have often collapsed, from Charles Ponzi’s 50% promises to Bernie Madoff’s 10 to 12% fraud and the more recent downfall of crypto lending platforms offering 12 to 20%. These schemes ultimately resulted in huge losses and crises for investors. Rather than chasing similar risky returns, he stated that he would let some of that profit go towards an insurance policy, demonstrating a more mature investment approach that many in the community share, one that focuses on sustainable growth and avoiding the same mistakes behind previous financial collapses. A Step Toward Mainstream Confidence The discussion around insurance in connection with XRP yield offerings reflects a critical step in bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. If major insurers become active in this space, it could give investors additional confidence and attract larger pools of capital. This would strengthen XRP’s reputation and help support long-term adoption and growth . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the Jeju District Court, the total amount involved was about ₩4.34 billion — roughly $3.1 million — and the case has stirred sharp public reaction and industry fallout. Court Hands Suspended Sentence Based on reports , the court sentenced Hwang to two years in prison, but the sentence was suspended for four years, meaning she will not go to jail unless she breaks the terms of probation. Prosecutors had asked for a three-year prison term. The court applied the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes in reaching its verdict. Judges said factors such as full repayment and Hwang’s lack of a prior criminal record weighed in favor of leniency. The Charges And How The Crypto Moved Reports have disclosed that the alleged embezzlement took place across 13 separate transactions in 2022. About ₩4.2 billion of the money was used to buy crypto, while smaller sums covered property taxes and local levies through credit card payments. According to charging documents, the withdrawals were recorded as provisional payments or advances and were later routed from the agency’s accounts into accounts controlled by Hwang. Crypto: Repayments And Admissions Before the verdict, Hwang repaid the full amount, according to media reports and statements from her agency. Two large repayments were made on May 30, 2024 and June 5, 2024, reportedly funded by selling personal assets. Hwang publicly apologized in court and in statements, calling the moves a misjudgment and accepting responsibility for her actions. Her agency has said that, as of mid-June 2025, all financial obligations between the actress and the company were settled. Industry Response And Repercussions Broadcasters reacted quickly. Based on reports, some networks edited Hwang out of programs, and a number of brand deals were paused or canceled. The damage is both legal and reputational. While the court noted that the agency operated as a one-person company and that outside victims were limited, advertisers and networks tend to move fast when a high-profile legal case emerges. Broader Questions About Celebrity Finances Legal observers say the case highlights growing scrutiny of how entertainers handle company funds and crypto investments. South Korea has been tightening rules and oversight around virtual assets, and this verdict could signal stricter enforcement in the future.

If you’ve been following Ethereum, you know that whale movements often precede major market shifts. This time, the data points to an astonishing surge in institutional and large investor interest, signaling strong confidence in Ethereum’s future. What’s Driving This Massive ETH Accumulation? According to a recent report from Lookonchain, the past two days have seen an extraordinary amount of ETH accumulation . A total of 16 prominent whale addresses have collectively withdrawn a staggering 431,000 ETH from major exchanges. This impressive sum is valued at approximately $1.73 billion, showcasing a clear pattern of large-scale buying. These significant withdrawals didn’t come from just one platform. They originated from a diverse range of prominent entities, including Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, and OKX. Such broad-based activity suggests a coordinated or at least widespread belief among institutional players and high-net-worth individuals that Ethereum is poised for significant upside. Why Do Whale Movements Matter for ETH Accumulation? When we observe substantial ETH accumulation by whales, it’s more than just large transactions; it’s a powerful indicator. Whales, by definition, hold enough assets to influence market prices. Their actions are often seen as a barometer for market sentiment and future price direction. Here’s why their recent buying spree is so important: Confidence Signal: Large-scale accumulation suggests these sophisticated investors believe Ethereum’s price will appreciate significantly. Reduced Selling Pressure: Moving ETH off exchanges into private wallets typically means these assets are intended for long-term holding, reducing immediate selling pressure on the market. Market Stability: Consistent accumulation by whales can contribute to market stability by creating a strong demand floor. This trend could be influenced by several factors, including upcoming network upgrades, increasing institutional adoption of blockchain technology, or a general bullish outlook on the broader crypto market. The strategic nature of these withdrawals from various platforms underscores a deliberate move rather than speculative day trading. What Does This ETH Accumulation Signal for the Future? The ongoing ETH accumulation by whales paints a compelling picture for Ethereum’s prospects. This consistent buying behavior, particularly when moving assets off exchanges, often indicates a long-term bullish stance. It suggests that these influential players are positioning themselves for future growth, potentially anticipating a supply shock or increased demand for Ethereum’s ecosystem. For everyday investors, observing such whale activity can provide valuable insights. While it’s not financial advice, understanding these trends helps in gauging market sentiment and potential future movements. The commitment shown by these large holders in acquiring billions worth of ETH could foreshadow a period of sustained growth for the digital asset. In essence, the message is clear: major players are not just dabbling; they are making substantial, strategic investments. This strong vote of confidence through sustained ETH accumulation could be a significant catalyst for Ethereum’s trajectory in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions About ETH Accumulation Q1: What is ETH accumulation? A: ETH accumulation refers to the process where individuals or entities, especially large holders, continuously buy and hold Ethereum (ETH) tokens, often moving them off exchanges into personal wallets. Q2: Who are ‘whales’ in the crypto market? A: ‘Whales’ are individuals or organizations that hold a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions are significant enough to potentially influence market prices and trends. Q3: Why are whales accumulating ETH now? A: Whales may accumulate ETH due to various reasons, including anticipation of future price increases, upcoming network upgrades, increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, or a general bullish outlook on the crypto market. Q4: How does whale accumulation impact ETH’s price? A: Significant whale accumulation can positively impact ETH’s price by reducing the circulating supply on exchanges, signaling strong market confidence, and creating a demand floor, which can lead to upward price pressure. Q5: Where did the whales withdraw their ETH from? A: According to the report, the whales withdrew their ETH from several prominent platforms, including Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, and OKX.

If you’ve been following the digital asset space, you might have heard about a significant shake-up involving crypto futures liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, the market witnessed a staggering $128 million in forced liquidations within the perpetual futures market, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge. This dramatic event underscores the risks and rewards present in leveraged trading, leaving many wondering what exactly happened and what it means for the broader crypto landscape. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the jargon, crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader no longer has sufficient margin to keep the position open, often due to a rapid adverse price movement. Essentially, it’s the market telling a trader, “Your bet went wrong, and your collateral is gone.” These liquidations are a common, albeit often painful, aspect of futures trading and can provide insights into market sentiment and areas of high leverage. In the recent 24-hour period, we saw these forced closures impact various assets. The total amount was substantial, signaling significant market movement and exposing traders who were perhaps over-leveraged or on the wrong side of price action. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone participating in or observing the crypto market. Ethereum’s Dominance: Unpacking ETH Liquidations Ethereum (ETH) took center stage in this latest wave of crypto futures liquidations , accounting for a massive $68.02 million. What’s particularly interesting is the breakdown: 66.23% of these ETH liquidations were short positions. This means a majority of traders betting on ETH’s price to fall were caught off guard as the asset moved upwards, forcing their positions to close. This strong upward price pressure on ETH likely triggered a cascade, leading to a substantial number of short sellers being wiped out. This dominance by ETH in the liquidation figures suggests a strong, perhaps unexpected, bullish movement for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Traders anticipating a downturn found themselves on the losing end, highlighting the unpredictable nature of even established assets like Ethereum. It’s a powerful reminder that market sentiment can shift rapidly, punishing those with highly leveraged positions against the prevailing trend. Bitcoin and XPL: A Glimpse into Broader Crypto Futures Liquidations While ETH led, other cryptocurrencies also experienced significant crypto futures liquidations . Bitcoin (BTC), the market leader, saw $25.92 million liquidated. Unlike ETH, a majority of BTC liquidations (58.39%) were long positions. This indicates that traders betting on BTC’s price to rise were hit, suggesting a downward price movement for Bitcoin during the same period. This divergence between ETH and BTC liquidations paints a picture of a nuanced market, where different assets react to various catalysts. Adding to the mix, XPL experienced $34.60 million in liquidations, with 53.1% being long positions. The presence of XPL in such a significant liquidation event, alongside crypto giants like ETH and BTC, is noteworthy. It shows that even smaller-cap assets are not immune to the volatility and leveraged trading risks prevalent in the futures market. These figures collectively emphasize the widespread impact of market fluctuations on leveraged positions across the entire crypto ecosystem. Navigating Volatility: Protecting Your Trades from Crypto Futures Liquidations So, what can traders learn from these substantial crypto futures liquidations ? The primary takeaway is the importance of robust risk management. Leveraged trading amplifies both gains and losses, making it a double-edged sword. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessive leverage, as it significantly increases your liquidation risk. Start with lower leverage and understand its implications. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These are crucial tools that automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a certain point, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical indicators, and broader economic trends that can influence crypto prices. Understand Market Sentiment: While challenging, gauging overall market sentiment can help you avoid betting against strong trends. By implementing these strategies, traders can better protect themselves from the abrupt and often costly impact of forced liquidations, making their trading journey more sustainable. In conclusion, the past 24 hours saw a dramatic display of market forces, with $128 million in crypto futures liquidations , prominently led by Ethereum. This event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and amplified risks associated with leveraged trading in the digital asset space. While painful for some, these liquidations offer valuable lessons on risk management and the importance of cautious participation. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these dynamics becomes paramount for every participant. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidations Here are some common questions regarding crypto futures liquidations: Q: What exactly is a crypto futures liquidation? A: A crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This typically happens when the market price moves significantly against their open position. Q: Why did ETH lead the recent liquidations? A: ETH led the recent liquidations primarily because a large number of traders had opened “short” positions, betting on its price to fall. When ETH’s price unexpectedly rose, these short positions were forced to close, leading to substantial liquidations. Q: Are liquidations always bad for the market? A: While liquidations are painful for individual traders, they are a natural part of a leveraged market. They can help deleverage the market, removing excessive risk and sometimes paving the way for more stable price movements. However, large cascades can also trigger further volatility. Q: How can I avoid being liquidated in crypto futures trading? A: To avoid liquidation, it’s crucial to manage your risk. This includes using appropriate leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and not over-committing your capital to highly volatile positions. Q: What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? A: A “long” liquidation occurs when a trader betting on a price increase (a long position) is forced to close because the price falls. A “short” liquidation happens when a trader betting on a price decrease (a short position) is forced to close because the price rises.

He noted that XRP has hit the “E Wave support Level as we discussed yesterday.” He also reminded followers that it is “better to keep an eye on the 50.00% Fibonacci Support.” His comments indicate that XRP remains within the structure he outlined earlier and is now testing the lower support levels that could define its trajectory. XRP hits the E Wave support Level as we discussed yesterday. It was a clear, simple chart. Better to keep an eye on the 50.00% Fibonacci Support. Chin-up #XRPArmy , we are getting there. https://t.co/AOvBsdHE45 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) September 25, 2025 Background to the Analysis The day before this update, Dark Defender had presented a chart showing XRP’s corrective structure. He explained that the market was nearing the end of the ABCDE formation and highlighted that the asset was preparing for the final phase of consolidation . According to his analysis, reclaiming the $3.333 price level would mark the critical breakout point. He described this stage as a setup where nothing would stop further gains once that level is secured, pointing toward a path that could eventually lead XRP to double-digit prices . The structure he laid out involved an extended corrective wave that has been developing over recent months. With the latest update confirming a touch of the E Wave support, it appears that the corrective action is reaching its conclusion. This brings attention back to the near-term levels that could act as the launch point for the next rally . Significance of the Current Support The update stressed the importance of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. This line, which sits near $2.64, represents a zone that has historically served as a decisive area during market corrections. Holding this level would give XRP the foundation to confirm the end of the consolidation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As XRP trades at $2.78, Dark Defender’s framework implies that the asset is positioned to turn upward after testing the $2.64 support level. Climbing back to $3.333 would complete the reversal from the drawn-out corrective pattern, providing the technical validation for a push toward a new all-time high . What Comes Next for XRP The combination of the ABCDE pattern nearing completion and XRP holding near Fibonacci support presents a critical period for the asset. Traders monitoring the structure are watching to see if it can maintain the E Wave support and whether momentum will build in favor of a breakout. Dark Defender has emphasized that XRP is “getting there,” indicating the steady progress of the chart formation. The consolidation phase is being tested at its final stage, with the technical markers aligning for a potential rally.

Wyckoff Structure Points to Final Phase Solana (SOL) is trading at $202 with a daily turnover of $11.19 billion. The token has regained 3% in the past 24 hours, but has dumped by over 15% over the past week. Analysts suggest the decline may be part of a longer structure that still points upward. ZYN posted a chart presenting SOL crossing the phases of Wyckoff accumulation. According to the chart, Solana is transitioning from Phase D to Phase E, which is based on the Son of Wyckoff theory, a concept where markets tend to break above. The token has traded between $120 and $210, with the current dip portrayed as the final shakeout before a run-up. Source: ZYN/X ZYN commented, “$SOL is in the final phase of its Wyckoff accumulation. This is probably the last big dip before a big rally in Q4.” He added, “I think anyone buying SOL at these levels will be happy in 2-3 months. $500 SOL is programmed this cycle.” Key Levels and Market Signals Wise Crypto shared a separate chart showing SOL trading at a critical support zone around $180–$177.

The outcome could determine whether institutional flows begin to support Solana in the same way they did for Bitcoin and Ethereum after spot ETFs gained approval. Yet, it maintains a cautious stance. Data from Polymarket shows traders pegging the probability that Solana would have a new all-time high in 2025 at just 34%. ETF filings and technical structures have fed optimism, but all the same, the sentiment expresses doubt about how fast Solana can make the move up.

If approved, the fund will be known under the ticker “XXX”. It is meant to provide investors returns that closely correspond to an index of the S&P 500 and another tracking futures contracts for XRP – called the S&P XRP Futures 75/25 Blend Index. In its structure, 75% of the Cyber Hornet ETF portfolio will be allocated to S&P 500 stocks, while the remaining 25% goes into XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The fund can also hold XRP directly or use ETPs to balance its exposure. Cyber Hornet listed two other similar offerings in its SEC filing Cyber Hornet also has two more ETFs in the works for Ethereum and Solana . The Ethereum version will be listed as “EEE,” and the Solana one as “SSS.” All of the funds have similar 75/25 models, mixing shares with futures contracts. Ethereum exposure comes from CME Ether futures and direct purchases. Meanwhile, the fund’s Solana share will track the S&P Solana Futures Index. This move coincides with growing investor interest — REX-Osprey’s Solana staking ETF just set a new asset record. Investors will pay a 0.95% management fee annually for the Cyber Hornet ETFs, but there are no shareholder trading fees. The SEC calculates that $10,000 invested would result in about $100 in fees after one year and $312 after three. The ETFs will also rebalance every month to keep the 75/25 split intact, though Cyber Hornet may adjust more frequently if markets get volatile. Moreover, the funds may trade slightly higher or lower than their underlying value, just like most ETFs. The ETFs are also set to trade on Nasdaq if approved. Individual investors will trade shares on the open market, while authorized participants manage 25,000-share creation and redemption units. The filings show Cyber Hornet’s push to link stock market benchmarks with crypto diversity. If launched, they’d be the first funds to unite XRP, ETH, and SOL with S&P 500 performance. The US SEC is investigating trading activity before companies announced ETF strategies The US SEC is still working with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to look into potentially abnormal trades made right before companies unveiled treasury management and ETF strategies. Investigators are probing whether trades were made using privileged information, a potential case of insider trading or manipulation. Significant price jumps in the hours triggered the inquiry before companies revealed treasury and ETF strategies. Analysts say the SEC is paying closer attention to strange trading patterns than ever. As firms adopt ETFs and digital assets for treasury use, oversight is tightening to safeguard market order. The probe remains in its early phase and hasn’t resulted in enforcement yet, but it signals a tougher stance on potential abuse. The inquiry builds on the SEC’s ongoing look at ETF structures and the quality of corporate transparency. Regulators have long been wary of sudden ETF volume jumps that don’t align with available information. Still, the SEC recently cleared the path for a wave of new crypto-related exchange-traded funds. The agency approved generic listing standards f or commodity-based exchange-traded products, allowing crypto funds to move through the approval process much faster. With these standards now applied across Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca, issuers no longer need individual approvals under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934. Previously, launching a spot crypto fund required a lengthy application, public comment, and SEC review. This is why nearly all existing crypto ETFs have focused on Bitcoin and Ether—the largest digital assets by market capitalization. The new approach is intended to speed up launch timelines, slash administrative costs, and make more digital assets available to investors in an ETF structure.

Recently, Mike Novogratz, the insightful CEO of Galaxy Digital, shared a compelling vision that could ignite an unprecedented Bitcoin rally . He suggests that the key to unlocking a monumental surge in BTC’s value might not come from typical crypto developments, but from a crucial political appointment within the U.S. financial system. What Could Spark the Next Bitcoin Rally? Novogratz points directly to a critical decision on the horizon: the selection of the next U.S. Federal Reserve chair. This seemingly conventional political move could, in fact, be the single biggest catalyst for a monumental Bitcoin rally . But how exactly does a Fed chair’s philosophy influence the world’s leading cryptocurrency? The ‘Dove’ Factor: Novogratz speculates that if President Donald Trump nominates a ‘dove’ – a central banker who strongly favors lower interest rates and a looser monetary policy – to succeed current Chairman Jerome Powell, the economic landscape could shift dramatically. A ‘dove’ prioritizes economic growth and employment over strict inflation control. Major Interest Rate Cuts: A dovish Fed chair would likely pursue significant interest rate cuts. This action aims to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, encouraging increased spending and investment across the economy. Impact on Risk Assets: Historically, periods of sustained low interest rates and an expanded money supply tend to favor riskier assets. Investors often seek higher returns outside traditional, low-yield savings accounts and bonds, leading them to assets like stocks, real estate, and increasingly, cryptocurrencies. This specific scenario, Novogratz believes, could create the perfect storm for an explosive Bitcoin rally , potentially pushing its price to an astonishing $200,000. It’s a bold prediction that highlights the growing interconnectedness of global finance. Understanding the Fed’s Influence on a Potential Bitcoin Rally It might seem surprising that decisions made by a central bank could so directly affect a decentralized asset like Bitcoin. However, the Federal Reserve’s actions ripple through global financial markets, influencing everything from stock valuations to commodity prices, and significantly, the sentiment around cryptocurrencies. Monetary Policy and Inflation Hedge: When the Fed implements policies that cut interest rates and expand the money supply, it often leads to concerns about inflation. Bitcoin, with its strictly limited supply cap of 21 million coins, is frequently seen by investors as ‘digital gold’ – a robust hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies caused by inflation. U.S. Dollar Weakness: A sustained dovish monetary stance can lead to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. As the dollar’s purchasing power declines, investors typically look for alternative stores of value to protect their wealth. Bitcoin has emerged as a prominent candidate in this search, attracting capital from traditional markets. Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates and policies like quantitative easing inject more liquidity into the financial system. A significant portion of this newly available capital often flows into speculative assets, including the crypto market, providing the necessary fuel for a substantial Bitcoin rally . The growing correlation between macroeconomic policies and Bitcoin’s price performance has become increasingly evident, particularly over the past few years. This makes the upcoming Fed chair selection a truly pivotal event for anyone interested in the future of digital assets. Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Rally: Key Considerations for Investors While the prospect of a $200,000 Bitcoin rally is undeniably exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach such predictions with a well-informed and balanced perspective. Market dynamics are incredibly complex, and numerous factors beyond a single appointment can influence outcomes. Not a Guaranteed Outcome: Novogratz’s prediction is based on a specific political and economic scenario. There is no absolute guarantee that a ‘dove’ will be nominated, or that their policies will unfold exactly as anticipated by the market. Political landscapes can shift rapidly. Inherent Market Volatility: Even with strong bullish catalysts, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Significant price swings, both upwards and downwards, are a common characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. Investors should always be prepared for potential dips as well as surges. Importance of Diversification: A robust and resilient investment strategy typically involves diversification. While Bitcoin offers immense potential returns, it is often wise to balance portfolios across various asset classes to mitigate risk and ensure stability. Stay Continuously Informed: Keeping abreast of both macroeconomic developments, such as Fed policy shifts, and crypto-specific news is absolutely essential. Understanding the intricate interplay between traditional finance and the digital asset space provides a much clearer picture for making informed decisions. The potential for a monumental Bitcoin rally hinges on a delicate balance of political decisions, economic indicators, and subsequent market reactions. Prudent investors will monitor these developments closely, understanding both the opportunities and the inherent risks. Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin and Fed Decisions Mike Novogratz’s insightful commentary highlights a fascinating and increasingly important intersection between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. The idea that a single, high-profile appointment could unleash an ‘explosive’ Bitcoin rally to $200,000 underscores the growing influence of macroeconomic factors on digital assets. While the future remains inherently uncertain, the heightened anticipation surrounding the next Fed chair pick adds another layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s already captivating journey. This potential catalyst serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market is deeply intertwined with broader global economic forces, making informed awareness more critical than ever for both seasoned and new investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘dove’ in the context of the Federal Reserve? A ‘dove’ refers to a central banker who typically favors policies that prioritize economic growth and employment, often through lower interest rates and a more expansive money supply, even if it risks slightly higher inflation. This contrasts with a ‘hawk,’ who prioritizes controlling inflation through tighter monetary policy. Q2: How do interest rate cuts typically affect cryptocurrency prices? Interest rate cuts generally make traditional savings and investments less attractive due to lower returns. This encourages investors to seek higher yields in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can fuel a Bitcoin rally as capital flows into the market. Q3: Is Mike Novogratz’s $200,000 Bitcoin prediction guaranteed? No, Novogratz’s prediction is an analysis based on a specific economic and political scenario (the nomination of a dovish Fed chair and subsequent interest rate cuts). It is not a guarantee, as market outcomes are influenced by many complex and unpredictable factors. Q4: What should investors do if they believe a Bitcoin rally is coming? Investors should conduct their own thorough research, consider their risk tolerance, and potentially consult with a financial advisor. Diversification, staying informed about market trends and macroeconomic policies, and being prepared for volatility are always recommended strategies. Q5: Why is Bitcoin considered a hedge against inflation? Bitcoin is often viewed as an inflation hedge because its supply is strictly limited to 21 million coins, making it a scarce asset. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s scarcity means it cannot be devalued by government money printing, thus potentially preserving purchasing power during inflationary periods.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Participating In Loss-Taking In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the reaction to the recent Bitcoin price decline from the short-term holders (STHs) . The STHs refer to the BTC holders who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, the STHs with their relatively low amount of holding time are considered to represent the weak hands of the market. Like usual, this cohort has also panicked in the face of the latest price volatility. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the loss transactions made by the cohort’s members to wallets connected with centralized exchanges. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin STHs deposited nearly 32,000 BTC at a loss to exchanges during the crash from earlier in the week. Generally, holders transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to make use of one of the services that they provide, which can include selling. Considering the nature of the STHs, these loss deposits were likely made with distribution in mind. Thus, these investors reacted to the plummet by capitulating . The latest decline in BTC’s price to levels under $109,000 has been met with a similar reaction, with the 24-hour value of the metric hitting the 29,700 tokens mark. In total, the STHs have participated in capitulation of more than 60,000 BTC, worth a whopping $6.5 billion, across these two loss-taking waves. “That’s a clear sign of heavy stress across the market,” notes the analyst. In some other news, CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is flashing a “bear” signal for the cryptocurrency, as Maartunn has pointed out in another X post . The Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator uses the data of several popular on-chain metrics to determine what phase of the cycle the asset is currently in. According to the indicator, BTC is in a bearish phase at the moment. The 365-day moving average (MA) of the metric has also been on the way down for a while now, which also doesn’t tend to be a positive signal. “Historically, most BTC gains happen when this metric is rising, not falling,” explains the analyst. BTC Price Bitcoin has come down to the $108,900 level following a decline of more than 5.5%.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Capitulation|Bitcoin Loss-Taking|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 06:00:41

XRP outperformed Ethereum for five consecutive months this year, and this latest surge confirms that the pattern continues. Investors in South Korea are directing higher levels of liquidity toward XRP compared to Ethereum, a shift that reflects changes in market confidence and trading behavior. Ethereum maintains a higher global market capitalization. However, the repeated instances of XRP outpacing it in direct exchange activity suggest investor interest is moving in a different direction . The continuation of this trend could shape expectations surrounding the long-debated possibility of XRP overtaking Ethereum in influence and adoption. Can XRP Take Over the Market? For years, parts of the crypto community have claimed that XRP has the potential to flip Ethereum . Each time XRP overtakes Ethereum in regional or global trading performance, the argument for this shift gains more weight. The latest volumes on Upbit show that XRP not only competes with Ethereum but also maintains a clear lead in one of the most active crypto markets worldwide. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Traders have long looked at South Korea as a key indicator of retail enthusiasm and short-term momentum. XRP’s current position as the most traded asset on Upbit gives it an advantage that goes beyond daily volume. This sustained trading interest can establish XRP as a preferred digital asset for liquidity-driven use cases. There has also been some debate on surpassing Bitcoin. While this is a difficult feat, the XRP army is convinced that the digital asset can flip Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s Expanding Role in the Market The fact that XRP continues to outpace Ethereum and Bitcoin in South Korean markets suggests it is achieving a stronger position among both retail and institutional participants in the region. With $330 million in daily activity, XRP’s dominance cannot be dismissed as a temporary shift. Instead, it reflects a consistent trend with a margin that could rise further.

Here’s what that means and if (or how) it can impact the price of Ripple’s cross-border payments token. $XRP has a price gap sitting between $2.73 and $2.51. pic.twitter.com/T1100MsSBc — Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 The chart by the popular analyst highlights XRP’s price gap positioned between $2.51 and $2.73. It’s identified using Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), a metric tracking the price at which existing tokens were last transacted. It suggests potential market resistance or support levels based on historical data. The graph highlights several similar gaps on XRP’s chart, but most of these (although more significant) are positioned further below the current levels. As such, Martinez doubled down on his belief that the $2.71 support is crucial in determining the asset’s future behavior. As reported earlier this week, he noted that if XRP successfully defends that level, which it has over the past few days, it could bounce back toward its all-time high of $3.60. Other analysts outlined two more plausible scenarios for the asset’s upcoming moves, which include a surge beyond $3.20 or a substantial decline below that price gap to $2.20. According to ERGAG CRYPTO, this move lies on whether XRP can indeed remain above the $2.70 support. The XRP Army also remains bullish as one of its most vocal and popular members, going under the X handle Cobb, predicted that Ripple’s underlying asset will “never trade below $2.50 again.” For now, XRP remains around $2.80 after bouncing off the aforementioned support. However, it’s still 7% down weekly and was surpassed by Tether’s USDT in terms of market cap.

Traders constantly seek reliable indicators to gauge the collective mood, and one of the most insightful metrics is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . This crucial indicator offers a window into how the majority of participants are positioning themselves in the market, providing valuable clues about potential price movements and overall investor confidence. What Exactly is the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio? Simply put, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio reflects the proportion of long positions versus short positions held by traders on perpetual futures contracts. A “long” position means a trader expects the price of Bitcoin to increase, while a “short” position anticipates a price decrease. Perpetual futures are unique because they have no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely, making their sentiment particularly impactful. When the ratio is above 1, it indicates more traders are long than short, suggesting bullish sentiment. Conversely, a ratio below 1 implies more traders are short, pointing towards bearish sentiment. Monitoring this ratio can help you understand the prevailing market bias and identify potential turning points. Recent Snapshot: Decoding the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Across Top Exchanges Let’s dive into the latest data. Over the past 24 hours, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio on the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges by open interest presents an interesting picture. This data offers a fresh perspective on where the market stands right now. Overall Market Sentiment: Across these leading platforms, the collective sentiment shows a slight lean towards the bearish side. We observe approximately 49.05% long positions versus 50.95% short positions . Binance’s Contribution: On Binance, a major player, the ratio closely mirrors the overall trend, with 49.08% long and 50.92% short . This suggests a consistent sentiment across a significant portion of the market. Bybit’s Perspective: Bybit shows a slightly more balanced, yet still bearish, distribution: 49.89% long against 50.11% short . The difference here is minimal, indicating a nearly even split. Gate.io’s Data: Gate.io also aligns with the prevailing sentiment, reporting 49.4% long and 50.6% short . This collective data indicates that, for now, the bears hold a marginal edge in the BTC perpetual futures market. However, such close figures often hint at indecision or a market awaiting a stronger catalyst. Why is This Ratio Crucial for Your Trading Strategy? Understanding the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is more than just observing numbers; it’s about gaining a strategic advantage. This ratio provides insights into potential market reversals. For instance, an excessively high long ratio might suggest an overleveraged market, vulnerable to a cascade of liquidations if prices dip. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could indicate an oversold market, ripe for a short squeeze. Traders use this information to: Gauge Market Extremes: Identify when sentiment becomes overly bullish or bearish. Confirm Trends: A rising long ratio during an uptrend can confirm bullish momentum. Spot Divergences: Sometimes, the ratio might diverge from price action, signaling a potential shift. Actionable Insights: Leveraging the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Given the current slight lean towards short positions, what does this mean for you? It suggests a cautious market, where many traders are betting on a downward movement or hedging existing spot positions. This isn’t a definitive signal for a price drop, but rather an indication of prevailing sentiment. Here’s how you can integrate this into your analysis: Combine with Other Indicators: Always cross-reference the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio with other metrics like funding rates, open interest changes, and technical analysis indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD). Watch for Shifts: A rapid shift in the ratio can be more telling than the static number itself. If the short percentage suddenly drops, it might signal a change in sentiment. Manage Risk: Use this insight to refine your risk management. If the market is heavily skewed in one direction, consider adjusting your position sizes or setting tighter stop-losses. Remember, no single indicator tells the whole story. The long/short ratio is a powerful piece of the puzzle, offering a glimpse into the collective psychology of futures traders. The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio remains an indispensable tool for cryptocurrency traders seeking to understand market dynamics. The current data, showing a marginal preference for short positions across top exchanges, highlights a period of caution or indecision among futures participants. By diligently monitoring this ratio and integrating it with a comprehensive analytical approach, traders can make more informed decisions, navigate market volatility with greater confidence, and potentially capitalize on shifts in sentiment. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract? A1: A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual futures are designed to mimic the spot market price. Q2: How is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio calculated? A2: It’s typically calculated by dividing the total number of open long positions by the total number of open short positions on a specific exchange or across multiple exchanges. Some platforms might use total volume or value instead of just the count. Q3: Does a high short ratio always mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? A3: Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates bearish sentiment, it can also lead to a “short squeeze” if the price unexpectedly rises, forcing short sellers to buy back to cover their positions, thus pushing the price even higher. Q4: Which exchanges provide reliable long/short ratio data? A4: Top exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io, as mentioned in the article, are generally considered reliable sources for this data due to their significant open interest and trading volumes. Many analytics platforms also aggregate this data. Q5: How often should I check the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio? A5: The frequency depends on your trading style. Day traders might check it hourly or even more frequently, while swing traders might look at it daily or several times a week to gauge broader sentiment shifts.

Barcelona, Spain , September 18th — The 11th European Blockchain Convention (EBC11) will gather global leaders in Barcelona on October 16-17 to challenge perceptions of European decline and showcase why the continent remains central to blockchain innovation and infrastructure. Analysts note that Europe’s high energy costs, slow-moving regulation, and reliance on bank lending have discouraged emerging tech and driven blockchain talent abroad, with blockchain job postings in Europe citing a 90% drop since 2022. Yet, the region continues to produce global disruptors such as Austria’s Bitpanda and London-based DeFi unicorn Avara (formerly Aave). “ There’s a popular narrative that Europe is falling behind in digital assets, but this doesn’t capture what’s happening on the ground,” says Victoria Gago , Co-Founder of EBC. “ While the U.S. captures headlines with bold regulatory updates, Europe is steadily building the infrastructure for the next generation of finance. From MiCA’s regulatory clarity to a strong talent pool that produced the industry’s first disruptors, EBC11 will show that Europe isn’t just competing, we’re quietly defining the future of finance “. European fintech has demonstrated strength with investment rising 23% to €3.6 billion in H1 2025, according to Finch Capital’s latest State of European Fintech Report. US investment in European fintech also accounts for 28% of all transactions, reflecting growing international appetite for the region’s digital finance innovation. The momentum coincides with breakthrough progress on Europe’s digital euro initiative, with the ECB and EU member states nearing agreement on key design parameters. EBC11 will feature 100+ sessions on tokenization, DeFi, institutional crypto, AI, privacy, and security, plus startup battles . The convention also offers a curated program of side events, making it easy for attendees to connect with the right people. Speakers will include Anthony Scaramucci (SkyBridge Capital), Erald Ghoos (OKX), Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad (Bitpanda), Matthew Hougan (Bitwise Asset Management), Leon Marshall (Galaxy), and Anthony Bassili (Coinbase Asset Management).

52327750,590877,1758956456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52327750.jpeg,$10 Trillion Asset Manager Vanguard Prepares To Offer Access To Crypto ETFs For The First Time,https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-prepares-to-offer-access-to-crypto-etfs/,"One of the world’s largest asset managers, Vanguard, is reportedly preparing to enter the digital asset space by offering access to crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time. This move comes after a period of skepticism from the firm, which manages approximately $10 trillion in assets. Vanguard Lays Groundwork For Crypto ETFs According to a Friday report from Crypto in America, a source familiar with Vanguard’s plans has disclosed that the company has begun laying the groundwork for this initiative due to increasing client demand for digital assets and a more favorable regulatory environment. While Vanguard is not planning to launch its own crypto products, as competitors like BlackRock have done, it is reportedly considering granting brokerage customers access to select third-party crypto ETFs. However, the timeline for this decision remains uncertain. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source remarked, highlighting the cautious yet adaptive strategy Vanguard is adopting in response to evolving market conditions. Vanguard’s plans come as under President Donald Trump’s administration, regulatory agencies have significantly shifted their approach toward crypto assets, led by the SEC’s drop of enforcement cases , new frameworks for the growth and adoption of crypto assets and related products. The SEC’s recent approval of a new generic listing standard is expected to expedite the approval process for crypto ETFs, alongside the greenlighting of index funds that include leading crypto assets, further contributing to renewed stances from asset managers like Vanguard. Initial Rejection Of Crypto Related Products Vanguard’s CEO, Salim Ramji, who previously spent a decade at BlackRock overseeing the successful launch of its Bitcoin ETF , has been at the forefront of this strategy. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has attracted over $60 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024, amassing more than $80 billion in assets. Since taking the helm at Vanguard last year, Ramji’s leadership style has been closely watched, with many speculating whether he might emulate strategies from his former boss, Larry Fink. In January of last year, Vanguard had publicly stated that “Spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,” dismissing the notion of offering crypto-related products. This decision led some users to threaten account closures due to dissatisfaction with Vanguard’s stance on digital assets. At the July Morningstar Investment Conference, Ramji reiterated that the asset management firm would not replicate competitors by launching its own crypto ETFs. However, he avoided directly addressing the possibility of offering access to third-party crypto ETFs. Yet, as the performance of crypto ETFs has significantly improved over the past year, the firm’s views appear to be evolving, in line with broader market trends and regulatory shifts that are fostering a new era for digital assets.

While this regulatory nod was widely viewed as a major bullish catalyst, it triggered short-term “ sell the news ” profit-taking following an impressive 90-day rally. The phenomenon of selling on positive news is not unusual in financial markets. Investors who had accumulated XRP over the past three months, anticipating such a breakthrough, seized the opportunity to lock in profits once the ETF approval became official. This reaction caused a modest dip in XRP’s price, but market observers emphasize that this should not be mistaken for a shift in the underlying trend. Cryptonian notes that the current dip reflects broader macroeconomic concerns and a healthy technical retracement, not a loss of market confidence. Interest rate shifts, regulatory pressures, and market volatility have prompted this temporary slowdown, seen by analysts as a normal correction following a prolonged rally. Despite the short-term pullback, the long-term structural bullish trend for XRP remains intact with the psychological price of $5 within reach. Notably, the ETF approval paves the way for institutional investors to gain regulated exposure to XRP, which could drive significant inflows over time. By providing a secure and compliant avenue for large-scale investment, the REX Osprey ETF strengthens XRP’s position in the evolving crypto ecosystem and enhances its credibility among traditional financial players. Historically, the introduction of ETFs for major cryptocurrencies has proven to bolster market adoption and institutional participation. Analysts believe that similar trends could emerge for XRP, potentially supporting higher price floors and sustained growth. Therefore, the present dip may be a blessing in disguise by representing a buying opportunity at more favorable levels. XRP Faces Potential Deeper Pullback Amid Market Uncertainty According to crypto analyst Karl, XRP has recently corrected into the $2.7–$2.9 range, where it is currently trading. While this may appear as a minor retreat following previous rallies, Karl warns that the downside could extend further before any sustained recovery. Karl emphasizes that the cryptocurrency market remains “tricky,” with short-term movements heavily influenced by broader macroeconomic factors, investor sentiment, and technical dynamics. The current pullback reflects not only profit-taking after recent gains but also lingering uncertainty about the market’s next direction. The analyst points to the $2.6 level as a critical support zone for XRP. A dip toward this area, he suggests, is within the realm of possibility if the market continues to experience volatility. Historically, such support levels have served as key decision points, where long-term investors often step in, and short-term traders reassess their positions. Karl’s cautious outlook signals that traders should brace for potential swings and avoid assuming the current $2.7–$2.9 range marks the bottom. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.80, according to CoinGecko data . Conclusion While the SEC’s approval of the REX Osprey XRP ETF triggered short-term profit-taking, the underlying fundamentals for XRP remain robust. Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and growing market infrastructure continue to support a bullish outlook. As a result, the current dip could offer investors a strategic entry point at more attractive prices. Nevertheless, while XRP is holding within the $2.7–$2.9 range, the possibility of a deeper pullback toward $2.6 cannot be dismissed.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 07:17:16
52328304,590997,1758957525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52328304.jpeg,Best Crypto Presales to Buy as SWIFT Tests Blockchain Payments with Ethereum Linea,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-presales-to-buy-as-swift-tests-blockchain-payments/,"A significant transformation for international payments is on the way thanks to the interbank messaging system SWIFT. To the uninitiated, SWIFT is the backbone of the global financial messaging network, connecting more than 11,000 institutions across 200 countries. If you’ve ever sent or received a cross-border payment, you’ve almost certainly come across SWIFT, whether it was your bank asking for it, providing it, or using it to match transactions. Now, SWIFT has begun testing on-chain payments and messaging using Ethereum’s Layer-2 network Linea. This game-changing project involves some of the biggest names in global banking, including BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon. One of the most transformational aspects of the trial is the use of a stablecoin-like token for interbank settlement. Read on to learn more about SWIFT’s latest crypto endeavor, how it could revolutionize both crypto and traditional banking, and how you can make the most of this shift by buying the best crypto presales . Why SWIFT’s Linea Partnership Signals Mainstream Adoption As mentioned earlier, SWIFT’s blockchain experiment aims to dig deep into how it can be used for on-chain messaging and settlement functions, analyzing how the proposed stablecoin token could settle transactions directly on blockchain infrastructure. And SWIFT doesn’t want to stop there; it also plans to extend this experiment, or the stablecoin’s role, into direct value transfer. The goal is to reduce banks’ reliance on intermediaries and make the whole process of sending and receiving international payments more effortless, faster, and even cheaper. It’s worth noting this isn’t SWIFT’s first rodeo with blockchain. Back in 2022, it partnered with Chainlink to test cross-chain communication solutions. Combined with central banks and regulators worldwide exploring CBDCs and stablecoin frameworks, SWIFT’s latest move is a strong confirmation that global institutions are fully aware of what crypto and blockchain offer – and are eager to integrate it with the existing financial infrastructure. It’s also important to mention why SWIFT selected Linea , an Ethereum Layer-2 network, specifically. Linea leverages ZK roll-up technology , which stands out for its low cost and high throughput while still retaining Ethereum’s security. Oh, and it prioritizes data privacy, which is essential when dealing with international banks. All in all, it’s crystal clear that crypto is gaining mainstream adoption. The real question, therefore, is how can you make the most of it as an investor? Low-cap altcoins, and especially presales, are the answer. Given the current market turbulence, and the fact that SWIFT’s experiment will take several months to materialize, presales offer a unique advantage. These tokens haven’t listed yet, meaning they’re shielded from current volatility, and once they do list, they’ll be ready to run alongside a hopefully clear bull market fueled by both fundamental and technical bullishness. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Powers an Easy-to-Use Telegram Trading Bot That Snipes Meme Coins Meme coin trading is undoubtedly one of the most captivating aspects of crypto, and one that sees a lot of footfall too. That said, unfortunately, it’s not really a fair playing field. Big-money players with advanced tools scoop up all the liquidity in newly listed tokens, keeping most of the profits for themselves. This leaves everyday traders with little to nothing. Snorter Token ($SNORT) , however, aims to change this dynamic and level the playing field for retail participants. How? By letting them place buy, sell, limit, and stop orders in advance – and then executing those orders the moment liquidity kicks in. Additionally, this Telegram-based trading bot is designed with newcomers in mind. Everything from placing orders, to managing your portfolio, to even enabling the bot’s copy-trading function can be done simply by sending commands in the familiar Telegram chat. Another standout feature of the bot is its security. Whether it’s a scammer trying to deceive you with a rug pull, a honeypot, or eat away at your genuine profits via complicated sandwich attacks, Snorter has your back. Buying Snorter Token gives you front-row seats to the bot’s growth. According to our $SNORT price prediction , the token could hit $0.94 by the end of 2025. So if you get in now, you could potentially walk away with 800% returns. Additionally, holding Snort unlocks a slew of exclusive benefits, including: Access to advanced trading analytics No limit on daily sniping Reduced trading fees of 0.85%, compared to the usual 1.5% Staking rewards, currently yielding 114% Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $4.1M, with each token priced at just $0.1055. Visit Snorter Token’s official website to learn more. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Non-Custodial & Straightforward Crypto Wallet Ready for Market Takeover Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the firepower behind a new free crypto wallet that’s offering one of the most rock-solid combinations of airtight security and everyday ease-of-use that we’ve ever seen. We’re, of course, talking about Best Wallet . This non-custodial crypto wallet gives you exclusive access to your private keys, which, combined with excellent data encryption and two-factor authentication, ensures that no one other than you can gain access to your wallet. On top of that, Best Wallet differentiates itself by offering a never-before-seen ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. As the name suggests, this space within the wallet lets you buy the best crypto presales directly from the app. That means no more visiting external presale websites, wondering whether they’re legit or scams, and then going through the tiring process of connecting your wallet, authorizing transactions, and so on. Given everything Best Wallet offers, it’s no wonder this new cryptocurrency project is on its way to capture over 40% of the non-custodial market by 2027. If you want to be part of that growth, buy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . In addition to potentially huge gains – our $BEST price prediction suggests it could deliver a whopping 2,300% ROI by the end of 2026 – holding also unlocks exclusive platform-based benefits. Reduced transaction and gas fees Voting rights on key platform decisions Early-bird access to new meme coins in presale Staking rewards, currently yielding 82% per year The $BEST presale has so far raised a whopping $16.1M from early investors, but you can still grab the token for just $0.025705. Visit Best Wallet Token’s official website to learn more about its benefits. 3. Remittix ($RTX) – Revolutionizing Cross-Border Crypto-to-Fiat Payments One of the biggest pain points of the current banking infrastructure is sending international payments. The cross-border payments market, though worth nearly $250T , isn’t as smooth as users would like. Enter Remitix ($RTX) , a revolutionary PayFi (payment finance) solution designed to fill the gaps in banking infrastructure using crypto, thereby bringing the two industries together. Simply put, Remitix allows you to send crypto to any bank account around the world, and the beauty of it is that the recipient will receive it in fiat currency without even knowing the payment originated as crypto. The deal is further sweetened with zero forex markup fees on transfers, same-day transaction processing, and a user-friendly interface so even beginners can use the platform with ease. The Remitix presale ($26.7M+ raised) is a game-changing opportunity, especially when you put into perspective that giants like SWIFT are embracing crypto too. And right now, with each $RTX token priced at just $0.1130, it’s the perfect time to get in. Recap : With SWIFT pushing blockchain into mainstream banking, now’s the best time to load up on low-priced, high-upside gems like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Remittix ($RTX).

But upside potential remains intact. Alt Season Ends or Just Paused? According to the latest update shared by Altcoin Vector, the Market Phase has rotated back to Bitcoin after 79 days of Ethereum dominance and swings through mid- and small-cap tokens. ETH’s season lasted 68 days, during which it lifted the asset from $2,200 to a $4,900 ATH before the shift. Despite this, this rotation does not spell the end of altcoin upside potential. Bitcoin remains the key driver, and once it stabilizes and forms a bottom, altcoins could regain momentum. Despite BTC’s dip, the Risk-Off Signal remains steady, which means that there is no structural fragility. This suggests that early signs of a possible bottoming process could be taking shape across the market. At a time when shorter-term price swings and Bitcoin-led rotations are distracting traders, crypto analyst Moustache said that altcoins are quietly shaping a long-term technical pattern that many investors seem to overlook. According to his latest observation, most altcoins have been forming a Cup & Handle structure over the past four years, which happens to be a classic bullish setup in technical analysis. This long consolidation indicates that the market is preparing for a significant upward move. Calm Before Explosive Rebound Swissblock’s latest analysis also revealed that the crypto market is currently in a reset phase and signals a potential opportunity ahead. Historically, their Aggregated Impulse indicator, which tracks exponential price structures across the top 350 assets, has accurately flagged major bottoms. Since 2024, the last seven times this signal triggered, BTC subsequently rallied 20-30%, while altcoins surged 50-150%. Currently, 22% of altcoins are showing negative impulse, which places the market near the historical bottom zone of 15-25%. Swissblock noted that once this reset completes, Ethereum and other altcoins typically lead the next rotation. As such, patient investors could see substantial gains as market momentum shifts.

The Department of Justice, through Solicitor General D. John Sauer, argued that Trump has the legal right to remove Cook now, even while her lawsuit over the firing is still in court. According to Sauer, the president is facing “irreparable harm” because lower courts are blocking him from finalizing the removal. Sauer wrote that letting Trump fire Lisa for alleged financial misconduct doesn’t interfere with the Fed’s independence. He added that removing her would not cause a “financial market disaster.” The DOJ wants the court to grant a stay so Cook’s ouster can move forward immediately. Trump fired her in late August, citing possible mortgage fraud tied to two properties she claimed as her “primary residence” before she joined the Fed in 2022. Lisa denies charges while court fight escalates Lisa has denied committing mortgage fraud. Her legal team fired back in a Supreme Court brief on Thursday, accusing Trump of trying to gut the Fed’s independence. They said his request for a stay is really an attempt to get the court to “act on an emergency basis to eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board.” They’re pointing to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which says a president can only remove a Fed governor “for cause.” Her lawyers argued that the charges Trump is using aren’t valid under that law. “The manufactured charges,” they wrote, are based on events that happened before she joined the Board, and “fail to satisfy” the legal standard. They also said granting the stay would send a message that the Fed is now under presidential control, warning it would “risk chaos and disruption” in financial markets. Sauer pushed back in a Friday filing, saying it’s unclear why markets should panic over misconduct that happened before appointment, but stay calm over in-office violations. He questioned why anyone would be comfortable with “newly detected fraudsters” staying on the Board just because the statute of limitations had run out. Bessent’s mortgage history mirrors Lisa’s situation The core issue is about Lisa signing loan documents in 2021 that listed two different homes as her primary residence. One was a $203,000 house in Michigan, the other a $540,000 condo in Atlanta. Both had loan agreements from separate credit unions, and both required her to claim the properties as her main residence for one year. But Bloomberg reviewed a document from the Georgia lender that described the Atlanta unit as a “vacation home,” suggesting they weren’t expecting full-time occupancy. This isn’t the first time this kind of mortgage conflict has come up. Back in 2007, Trump’s Treasury Secretary , Scott Bessent, also pledged two homes as his “principal residence” on the same day. One was a mansion in Bedford Hills, New York. The other was a beachfront property in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Both were signed off by a lawyer with power of attorney. Experts later said that kind of paperwork mix-up wasn’t necessarily fraud. In a letter to Lisa last month, Trump said her mortgage contradictions were “potentially criminal conduct,” or at the very least “gross negligence.” He argued it was reason enough to remove her from the Fed. The move also came as Trump ramped up pressure on the Fed to cut rates more quickly. Cook is now in court challenging her dismissal, saying the charges are false. Bessent was asked about Trump’s decision in an appearance on Fox Business. He said, “There are people who think that President Trump is putting undue pressure on the Fed. And there are people like President Trump and myself who think that if a Fed official committed mortgage fraud, that this should be examined, and that they shouldn’t be serving as one of the nation’s leading financial regulators.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|DOJ|Federal Reserve|Treasury Department|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 07:22:35

Fasset was born out of a simple but urgent premise: in too many places, geography still dictates one’s financial destiny. In emerging markets, a service as necessary as banking is fragmented, minimum investment thresholds are high, and opportunities to participate in global financial systems are limited. Fasset’s mission is to bridge this gap. By tokenizing real-world assets and delivering access through a mobile-first financial superapp, Fasset is turning what was once exclusive to Wall Street into something anyone from anywhere can start, with just a dollar and a smartphone. How does Fasset help someone with just a phone start saving or investing small amounts? With Fasset, all you need is a smartphone to start small and dream big. Once verified, users can access fractional shares of stocks, ETFs, gold, sukuks, or even pre-IPO stocks, and more, starting with as little as $10. There’s no need for brokers or complex paperwork. This “micro-investment” model turns spare change into meaningful, long-term savings, reimagining wealth-building and investing as a habit that is intuitive and bite-sized. Why do tokenized assets matter for countries where many people don’t have easy access to banks? In regions where banking deserts are common, tokenized assets act as digital financial passports. Tokenization digitizes real-world assets and makes them tradeable from your phone. This allows users to bypass outdated legacy systems, hedge against volatile local currencies, and build real wealth, all via a smartphone. Is it really possible for someone outside the US to own a small piece of a company like Apple or Tesla through Fasset? How? Yes. Through our partnership with Dinari (a Silicon Valley-based company), Fasset offers tokenized securities that represent fractions of US-listed companies like Apple, Tesla, or Google. Each token is backed 1:1 by the underlying stock and regulated by the SEC, allowing users in emerging markets regulated and real-world exposure to assets that were previously out of reach. What is the Fasset Card, and how could it help people pay with digital money in shops? The Fasset Card – available both physically and virtually – will allow users to spend crypto like fiat anywhere Visa is accepted. Topped up with USDT, it integrates with Google Pay, Apple Pay, and other local payment networks. Users can convert and spend their digital assets in real-time, turning their crypto savings into day-to-day utility. Users can get early access to the Fasset Card by downloading the Fasset app. What is Own, Fasset’s Layer 2, and why is it important for fast and cheap transactions? Explain like a simple road over a busy highway. Own, Fasset’s Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain is designed for performance at scale. If Ethereum is a congested highway, Own then becomes an express lane – faster, cheaper, and purpose-built for emerging markets. By seamlessly processing transactions off-chain and settling them back securely, Own makes everyday digital finance instant and cost-efficient. Can you share a real example of an app using Own, like ORO for gold? What does it let people do? With ORO, users can seamlessly buy, hold, and trade tokenized and redeemable gold without the need for vaults or paperwork. It breaks down the barriers for entry and removes the complexities often associated with gold investing into a simple, mobile-native, and intuitive experience, enabling users to transact in gold 24/7, as easily as sending a text message. When will people be able to use more apps on Own, and what types are coming first? Users will be able to start using more apps on Own later this year. At launch, current users who have accumulated points through trading will be able to convert them into $OWN tokens, creating immediate utility and value recognition. Once migrated, $OWN token holders will gain trading discounts, early access to new products, rewards, and access to a globally regulated network of financial corridors. The initial wave of applications available will focus on RWA products ranging from stocks, bonds to real estate and commodities, with additional categories DeFi to roll out in subsequent phases. In which countries is Fasset approved to operate, and why does that matter for users’ safety? Fasset has the largest portfolio of licences in high-growth markets across Asia and Africa, including the UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, Pakistan, Bahrain, and more. We believe regulatory alignment forms the bedrock of trust for many users across the globe, and our licenses ensure that users can interact with a transparent, secure platform held to the highest standards. Our compliance-first approach is also precisely why banks, telcos, and other institutions are eager to partner with us. How does Fasset protect users money and data behind the scenes? Fasset protects users by ensuring every single product, from sukuks and S&P Shariah ETFs to gold, blue-chip stocks, and government bonds, is fully backed, verified, and independently audited. From day one, we have been regulation-first and Shariah-compliant, with a mandate to enable successful cross-border access to ethical and inclusive finance. By adhering to asset-specific standards, we ensure users are guaranteed ownership rights, dividends, and redemptions on time. This secure, ethical foundation gives users a trusted single entry point for long-term wealth generation. What does “Shariah-compliant” mean on Fasset, and why is it important to many users? How do people add money to Fasset in places like the UAE or Bahrain? Is it through local banks? Fasset is committed to operating within an ethical and compliant framework, aligning its operations with the principles of Islamic Finance. Shariah compliance means every product has been vetted against Islamic finance principles, meaning there can be no hidden interest, no speculation, and most importantly, no non-permissible industries. Additionally, ongoing Shariah audits and advisory work take place. Our Shariah-compliance unlocks confidence for over 2.5 billion potential users, for whom funding accounts is as easy as a local bank transfer or debit and credit card top-up, keeping onboarding simple and familiar. If someone has never used crypto before, what first steps does Fasset recommend? For those new to crypto, Fasset makes the first steps simple and intuitive as our wallet functions like a familiar digital banking app where users can buy, trade, deposit, and withdraw funds. Getting started only requires a quick KYC check, after which you can choose from over 100 supported currencies, including Bitcoin, Solana, and others. The first purchase can be made with existing payment methods such as Google or Apple Pay, a bank transfer, or by linking a credit or debit card. Within seconds of the order confirmation, the asset amount is reflected instantly in the digital wallet. What learning tools or guides does Fasset give to help beginners? To help first-time users navigate digital assets on our platform confidently, we’ve created a beginner’s guide to help them get started on their wealth-building journey. Fasset says it has handled over $1 billion in transactions and is growing fast. What does this mean for users today? We processed US$1 billion in transactions in just the first 6 months of the year, and another US$1 billion in the subsequent 3 months. This reflects strong adoption and trust in Fasset’s regulated infrastructure. For users, this means greater liquidity, diversified participation, and the ability to invest fractionally in typically illiquid assets, from sukuks to gold and ETFs, with far lower capital. We are scaling this further by serving underbanked communities from Morocco to Malaysia and even beyond, enabling 50+ banking corridors that connect a potential 2.5 billion people to seamless, compliant cross-border financial services without requiring app switching or extra wallets. What is one story of a user whose life improved because of Fasset? A few years ago, I met a man working in a hotel here in Dubai who told me he uses Fasset to buy Bitcoin every single month, and he does this so he can send it back home to his family in Kenya. Hearing that really struck me: it showed me that what we’re building isn’t just about technology, it’s about helping real people bridge distances, support their community, preserve value, and access financial opportunity. That story stuck with me. Looking ahead, what new features or launches are coming this year that users should be excited about? Our mission is grounded in a single goal: helping people grow and protect their wealth, no matter where they start. We have already unlocked access to a broad spectrum of tokenized real-world assets, from gold to tokenized stocks and ETFs, and we are just getting started. Every new feature we build is designed to make investing not only seamless but meaningful – built for long-term participation, not short-term speculation. Our newest launch, Fasset Card, will enable users to spend cryptocurrency as easily as fiat at any location that accepts Visa. The card is currently in development, with early access available soon via a waitlist on the Fasset app. At Fasset, we believe that financial inclusion must be intentional, and that is why our priority lies in building a secure, regulation-first platform where users can confidently and consciously participate in ethical, long-term wealth generation. Which countries will Fasset focus on next, and why those markets? Fasset is looking at expanding across Asia and Africa. Our growth roadmap prioritizes utility, compliance, and most importantly, user empowerment, and in every new market, our approach remains the same: secure the right licenses, operate with full regulatory alignment, and make cross-border finance as simple as using a local banking app, meeting the needs of both existing and new users. If users could request one simple feature that makes saving or investing easier, what should they ask for? If there’s one feature users should demand, it should be real access. At Fasset, we believe the true test of financial inclusion is whether someone, anywhere in the world, can own a fraction of a real, regulated asset, be it gold, a sukuk, or an ETF, with the same ease as sending a text. That’s what we’ve built with our superapp: a secure, compliant gateway to global wealth-building tools. We have stripped away the friction that has long plagued users’ financial journey so that investing is no longer a privilege, but a principle. By embedding compliance and lowering capital thresholds from the ground up, we are not just making saving easier, but we are making wealth generation intentional and truly borderless. Section 2: Quick yes/no or short answers 2a. Can users start with $1 or less? Users can start with a minimum deposit of $10. 2b. Are tokenized stocks and gold available in the mobile app? Yes. 2c. Will there be more education content inside the app this year? Yes. This includes more video tutorials to guide first-time investors through their journey. Section 3: Closing Questions 3a.

In a world where too many are excluded from financial opportunity by geography or infrastructure, we have built a platform that unlocks high-growth assets for high-growth markets. This means we are not simply focused on onboarding users, but we are building a global movement: 100 million digital asset owners by 2030. Mobile-first, built to scale, and regulation-first by design, Fasset allows everyone, from migrant workers in the MENA region to institutional investors, a single, trusted gateway into ethical, long-term wealth creation. 3b.

This morning, an anonymous address made headlines by depositing a staggering 30 million USDC onto Hyperliquid. This entity immediately leveraged these funds to acquire a substantial 22.37 million XPL crypto tokens. This massive purchase, executed at an average price of $1.34 per token, was reported by the reputable blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. It has ignited a buzz within the community, as such large-scale transactions often signal strong market conviction. Who is Behind the Massive XPL Crypto Acquisition? While the identity of the buyer remains shrouded in mystery, the sheer scale of the transaction points to a significant market participant, commonly referred to as a “whale.” This anonymous entity didn’t just appear out of nowhere; earlier today, a substantial 41.52 million USDC was withdrawn from the Kraken exchange, suggesting a pre-planned and well-funded strategy. Such large movements of capital by a single address can often signal strong belief in a particular asset’s future. The immediate impact on the XPL crypto market was palpable. Following the news of this colossal purchase, the token’s price experienced a dramatic uptick. According to CoinMarketCap, XPL crypto is currently trading at $1.54, representing an impressive 22.7% increase within a single day. This surge highlights the profound influence that large-scale institutional or individual investments can have on token valuations, especially in relatively less liquid markets. What Does This XPL Crypto Whale Activity Mean for the Market? Understanding the implications of such whale activity is crucial for any crypto enthusiast. When a single entity makes such a substantial investment, it often triggers a ripple effect across the market. Here’s what this significant XPL crypto acquisition could signify: Increased Confidence: A large buy can be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence in the project’s long-term potential, encouraging other investors to consider the asset. Market Momentum: The sudden influx of capital can create significant buying pressure, leading to rapid price appreciation and attracting speculative traders. Potential for Volatility: While exciting, such concentrated holdings can also introduce volatility. If the whale decides to sell a significant portion of their XPL crypto holdings, it could lead to a sharp price correction. Investors should always exercise caution and conduct their own thorough research rather than blindly following whale movements. While these transactions can be indicators, they do not guarantee future performance. Navigating the Future of XPL Crypto: What’s Next? The anonymous investor’s move into XPL crypto is a fascinating case study in market dynamics. The funds used for this purchase originated from a major centralized exchange, Kraken, before being deployed on Hyperliquid, a decentralized exchange. This movement across platforms is typical for sophisticated traders looking to capitalize on market opportunities or manage their positions efficiently. For those watching the XPL crypto space, the key questions now revolve around the motivations of this anonymous buyer. Are they accumulating for a long-term hold, or is this a strategic play designed for a short-term profit? Only time will tell, but their actions have certainly placed XPL crypto firmly in the spotlight. The recent price action underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed about significant on-chain movements, like this massive XPL crypto acquisition, can provide valuable insights into potential market shifts and opportunities. Summary: A Glimpse into XPL Crypto’s Exciting Ride The anonymous address’s $30 million investment in XPL crypto has undeniably sent ripples through the market, pushing its price up by over 22% in a single day. This event highlights the profound impact that large-scale purchases can have on asset valuations and market sentiment.

Meanwhile, a new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is attracting growing market interest on account of its revolutionary DeFi features and strong early-stage fundamentals. Mutuum Finance is at presale phase 6 that is over 50% sold out. Tokens are available for sale at $0.035. The following phase prices will skyrocket to $0.04 With investors focusing more on utility than hype, Mutuum Finance is better value proposition for long-term return, come what may with DOGE’s short-term bounce or breakdown. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Patterns Hint at Major Breakout as Key Levels Hold Dogecoin is showing strong indications of new momentum, and technical graphs are tilting towards the likelihood of a near-future breakout. The cryptocurrency recently broke above a falling resistance line and tested the significant $0.23 level of support, a typical pattern preceding a continuation rally. Investors are keeping a close eye on a double bottom formation forming and, if accurate, could send a stampede to $0.42 in the near term, with some projecting a run to the $0.60–$0.70 range in mid-to-late 2025. Market sentiment is also becoming increasingly positive, reflected by a Greed reading of 72 and greater whale accumulation at the $0.22–$0.24 levels, setting a price floor. Despite institutional profit-taking danger, sustained closes above pivotal levels of resistance can potentially have DOGE approaching $0.50–$0.60, with the current trading at around $0.24 being a 10.42% day gain. Meanwhile, interest in MUTM continues to rise. Mutuum Finance Presale Milestone Mutuum Finance presale has reached a new level with more than 16,600 investors and more than $16.4 million to date. It is in Phase 6, 45% sold out, selling the tokens at $0.035 for 1 MUTM. As a token of time, the project has included an early bird $100,000 giveaway , with 10 rewards of $10,000 MUTM. Mutuum Finance, in keeping with its promise of privacy, will launch a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Differing from depegging algorithmic stablecoins that will lose their peg in a bear market, the stablecoin will be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized with the hope of being stable even in bad times. Mutuum Finance intends to extend the frontiers of decentralized finance. The platform utilizes Chainlink oracles for settlement, lending, and trading of USD-denominated tokens and other tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Other defensive features in the form of fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are also offered by the platform to offer good, accurate pricing data in an extremely volatile market. The strategy taps into underutilized collateral reserves to offer secured and safe long-term value, rendering the stablecoin a sanctuary of security and sound store of value. This renders Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the safest and most revolutionary projects in the present DeFi ecosystem. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong momentum while Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to hold the $0.23 support line. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035 and are over 50% sold out, with the following stage being priced at $0.04. Mutuum Finance has raised $16.4 million from 16,600+ investors, which shows high demand. With a $100K giveaway, an overcollateralized USD stablecoin, and high-level oracle integration with Chainlink and fallback systems, Mutuum Finance offers security, precision, and scalability.

This includes the establishment of a Crypto Task Force led by Peirce, the dismissal of several lawsuits, and the launch of a new initiative called “Project Crypto” to modernize existing rules governing digital assets. Under former chairman Gary Gensler, the institution had taken a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies and filed lawsuits against several large companies. Gensler was criticized for his view that most cryptocurrencies were securities and his “regulation through litigation” approach.

During her speech at the Forecasters Club of New York, Bowman mentioned that recent information from reliable sources indicated that the labor market is weakening as inflation, excluding tariffs, stays slightly above its target. Fed’s Vice Chair calls for the need to help the job market Bowman recently analyzed data collected over the last few months and pointed out that it indicated escalating problems in the job market . Concerning these rising issues, she urged the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve System responsible for creating the nation’s monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices, to implement bold and proactive measures to address the diminishing activity in the labor market and new signs of weakness. The Vice Chair cautioned, “We may already be lagging behind in responding to escalating concerns in the labor market.” She further expressed worries that if these issues persist, they might have to change their policies more swiftly and implement substantial adjustments. In their last meeting in August, the Federal Open Market Committee had reduced its target range for overnight interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to between 4% and 4.25%. Notably, this rate cut was meant to support the job market despite officials raising concerns about inflation remaining above the target. Following these concerns, one Federal Reserve governor favored a bigger rate cut, but Bowman decided to stick with her colleagues’ opinion to support the 25-basis-point decrease. However, during the meeting in late July, she disagreed with the decision to maintain the rates unchanged, while most officials supported the idea. Bowman explained her stand, stating that US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs might result in long-term inflation problems. Based on her argument, price pressures have remained above their target without tariffs, while inflation is still above the 2% target. With this, she urged that Fed policy should pay attention to the part of the mandate that demonstrates weaknesses, which means taking into account effective steps to help the job market. Supporting her concerns, the CFO Survey , conducted by Duke University in partnership with the Richmond and Atlanta Federal Reserve Banks, reveals that executives attribute roughly one-third of their firms’ price hikes to tariffs. With inflation currently at 2.9%, removing the tariff impact would bring it closer to 2%, the Federal Reserve’s target rate. The findings also contradict Trump’s repeated claims that there is “no inflation” and that his trade policies are not driving up prices. Bowman emphasizes the Fed keeping the balance sheet as small as possible Bowman also addresses the Fed’s ongoing reduction of its bond holdings and points out that she prefers the balance sheet to be kept as small as possible, with reserve balances likely to be limited instead of plentiful. The official said that getting the balance sheet as low as possible will give the Fed greater freedom to respond to future issues. Bowman said that she favored the Fed’s balance sheet being concentrated in shorter-term assets and that it could tilt its investments toward longer-term bonds if needed without raising the overall size of holdings. Bowman said she is open to more than merely a gradual runoff of the Fed’s holdings. She stated, “I also look forward to discussing potential sales of our agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) with the committee.” “Just relying on MBS runoff isn’t going to let us get back to a Treasury-only portfolio in a reasonable period,” she added.

Ethereum price prediction models have turned cautious after ETH slipped below $4,000, sparking concerns about liquidations. Yet in the same market, Remittix is gaining momentum, winning attention with exchange listings, wallet testing, and referral rewards. With experts naming RTX and ETH as key focus points, both projects are firmly in the spotlight. Ethereum Price Prediction Faces Pressure Ethereum has been under pressure in the past week, dropping 13.12% as market selling intensified. Current data shows ETH has declined by $70.17 in the last 24 hours, breaking below the $4,000 mark. This has led to a surge in liquidations and heightened caution from traders. Technical analysis shows that Ethereum’s momentum may be slowing down. Despite these short-term risks, Ethereum price prediction models for the long term remain bullish. That said, analysts note that ETH whales seeking better short-term returns are starting to increase their exposure to lower-priced, high-momentum plays like Remittix. Remittix Taps Into The PayFi Market While ETH struggles, Remittix is taking centre stage with strong fundamentals and rapid progress. The PayFi project has raised over $26.7 million with more than 672 million tokens sold, showing strong momentum and institutional support. BitMart has been confirmed as its first Tier-1 listing, and another listing on LBANK has also been lined up. In addition, beta testing for the new Remittix wallet is live. Beyond listings, Remittix is building a strong community through a $250,000 giveaway and a referral program. The system rewards users with 15% of every referred buyer’s purchase in USDT, instantly claimable every 24 hours. Remittix is also fully verified by CertiK and currently ranked #1 on its pre-launch tokens leaderboard. These milestones set RTX apart as a new altcoin to watch. Why Analysts Like Remittix: Verified and ranked #1 by CertiK, ensuring unmatched trust and transparency.

According to the announcement , the plan involves collaboration with some of the largest global banks. The stated goal is to make international payments function with the same speed and predictability as domestic transfers. Key aspects highlighted include faster confirmations, standardized fee structures, and a more transparent user experience. By emphasizing predictability and efficiency, SWIFT presents this program as a direct step toward modernizing international retail payments. Vincent Van Code’s Response Software engineer Vincent Van Code examined the announcement and raised significant concerns about its scope. He acknowledged that the improvements SWIFT outlined may enhance the user interface and provide greater clarity in fee reporting. However, he argued that these updates do not solve the underlying structural issues of the current system. In his view, SWIFT’s roadmap remains focused on messaging enhancements rather than on true settlement reform. He stressed that capital remains tied up in the existing framework of nostro and vostro accounts, with liquidity inefficiencies left unaddressed. From his perspective, this is a critical weakness, as pre-funded accounts continue to trap funds across multiple corridors. He pointed to on-demand liquidity solutions as examples of how these inefficiencies can be eliminated rather than just managed. Cross-Border Payments: Fixing the Surface, Ignoring the Core Swift’s new roadmap paints a picture of progress — faster confirmations, clearer fees, and cleaner user interfaces. But beneath the polished surface, the structural issues remain untouched. Liquidity still gets… https://t.co/wJIjhEqm9i — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) September 25, 2025 Settlement and Liquidity Concerns Van Code emphasized that while faster confirmations and transparency provide a smoother user experience, they do not constitute real-time settlement. The core issue, he argued, lies in how money actually moves across borders. The reliance on correspondent banking chains means settlement delays persist regardless of messaging improvements. This, he said, makes SWIFT’s plan an incremental update to presentation rather than a fundamental redesign of how cross-border payments are settled. Standards and Digital Assets The software engineer also questioned the effectiveness of enhancements such as ISO 20022. While acknowledging that richer data formats can improve the transmission of information, he pointed out that additional data does not lower costs, remove friction, or mitigate counterparty risk. In his view, transparency in expected delivery times is a cosmetic improvement compared to achieving real-time settlement finality. Van Code contrasted this with digital asset-based solutions, where settlement and liquidity challenges can be addressed directly through tokenized value transfer. He noted that SWIFT continues to treat digital assets and stablecoins as experimental, while platforms using blockchain-based settlement already operate in live corridors with measurable results. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Incrementalism vs. Structural Change A central point in Van Code’s critique is that incremental change benefits incumbents who prefer to maintain existing infrastructure. By contrast, disruptive alternatives focus on eliminating inefficiencies rather than layering improvements onto legacy systems. He argued that the choice the industry faces is between optimizing older infrastructure and building entirely new payment rails capable of addressing liquidity, cost, and settlement challenges at the root level. SWIFT’s new program positions itself as a meaningful improvement for consumers and small businesses, aiming to provide more predictable and efficient international transfers. However, Vincent Van Code’s analysis draws attention to the limits of this approach, pointing out that liquidity inefficiencies, delayed settlement, and reliance on legacy structures remain unresolved. The contrast highlights two different paths forward for global payments: enhancing existing systems with incremental upgrades or pursuing structural solutions built on tokenized settlement models.

If you can’t work with AI, you’re out. That’s the new rule. The company is done waiting for people to catch up. Either you learn fast or you lose your job. This move is part of a huge restructuring. The company says AI is now baked into everything it does. CEO Julie Sweet made it clear: “We are investing in upskilling our reinventors, which is our primary strategy.” For those who can’t be retrained? She said the company is “exiting on a compression timeline” for anyone for whom reskilling is not “a viable path.” In short: adapt or disappear. Accenture plans to hire AI experts So far, Accenture says it’s already retrained 550,000 employees on the basics of generative AI . That’s part of a massive six-month $865 million business optimization program, which includes layoffs and severance packages. The company expects to save over $1 billion, according to CFO Angie Park, and plans to reinvest the savings into the business and the remaining staff. It also wants to maintain profit margins while doing it. Even as cuts continue, Accenture isn’t freezing hiring. The company is actively expanding its AI and data team, which hit 77,000 workers in 2025, up from 40,000 in 2023. New hires are expected in the U.S., Europe, and other major markets. Sweet confirmed , “Our No. 1 strategy is upskilling, given the skills we need.” If workers don’t have those skills and can’t get them quickly, they’re gone. The restructuring comes at a time when Accenture’s revenue reached $69.7 billion, a 7% increase from the year before. That growth, Sweet said, comes directly from companies scrambling to roll out AI tools. She said, “Our early investment in AI is really paying off.” Sweet added, “We feel very good as we go into FY26 with the momentum we’re seeing in our business which is driven by Accenture being the company that you really partner to make sure you can use advanced AI.” Basically, they want to be the first name CEOs think of when it comes to automating work and going full AI. “Every CEO, board and the C-suite recognize that advanced AI is critical to the future. The challenge right now they’re facing is that they’re really excited about the technology and they’re not yet AI ready for most companies,” said Sweet. Get seen where it counts.

Attention is growing around XYZVerse, Chainlink, and Hedera as these platforms stand out for big players planning for 2025. What is behind this sudden surge? The reasons for this shift may change how digital assets are valued and used in the year ahead. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.0055 Next Stage: $0.0056 Listing Price: $0.1 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! LINK: The Crypto Bridge Bringing Real-World Data On-Chain Chainlink, known by its token LINK, acts like a digital courier. It lets smart contracts pull in weather reports, stock prices, or even sports scores. First, oracles fetch the facts. Then many oracles compare notes, so no single voice can lie. At last, the checked data reaches the chain, ready for code to use. Both on-chain scripts and off-chain servers share the work, making the process fast and safe. LINK pays the couriers, gives them stakes to keep honest, and records their reputation. After a long winter, the market is hunting for coins with real jobs. LINK fits that bill. While some tokens rest on hype, LINK earns fees each time data moves across chains. Competitors like Band or API3 follow the same path, yet LINK still leads in users and partners. As more chains launch and games add on-chain scores, demand for trusted data should climb. LINK supply stays steady, but staking locks more coins away. That mix of growing use and shrinking float makes the token look lively in the new cycle. HBAR: The Fast Green Coin Challenging the Old Guard Hedera Hashgraph runs on a new kind of network. Instead of piling blocks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, it spreads data through a web of quick links called a hashgraph. No power-hungry mining is needed, so it is kinder to the planet. Each action costs only a tiny fee paid in HBAR, the coin that keeps the system safe through simple staking. The result is fast moves, low bills, and room for many smart apps in money, games, and more. Yet HBAR still fights for the spotlight. Markets are crowded with open coins like Solana and Polygon, and Hedera’s patent tag can scare off wild-west coders. Even so, big names on its council, steady fees, and green tech match the mood of today’s cycle, where users want speed and eco care. While prices have lagged the recent meme rally, quiet build periods often set up strong runs when the tide turns. For long-term watchers, HBAR looks like a patient play, not a quick flip. Conclusion LINK and HBAR are good, but XYZVerse (XYZ) dominates the 2025 bull run as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting global fans and GameFi for explosive potential.

This ruling, issued Friday, overturned a lower court decision that had ordered the funds to be disbursed before the end of the fiscal year on September 30. The court’s order gives Trump cover to ignore Congress’s deadline and kill the aid package without spending a cent. The decision was short and unsigned, but made one thing clear: the groups that sued the White House over the withheld aid had no legal standing to sue under the Impoundment Control Act. The court accepted Trump’s argument that his executive power outweighed the potential harm to nonprofit groups expecting the money, which included organizations working on water access and disease prevention across developing countries. Supreme Court overrides lower court order without full hearing The court’s conservative 6-3 majority said it saw enough harm in blocking the administration’s foreign policy plans to justify letting the aid freeze stand. But the ruling didn’t come with a full opinion or any oral arguments. That pissed off the three liberal justices, especially Elena Kagan, who wrote in her dissent that the court was rushing into “uncharted territory” and ignoring the legal process. “We therefore should have denied this application,” Kagan wrote, “allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves.” This is now the 20th emergency ruling the court has granted Trump since the start of his second term in January. The pace and volume of wins he’s getting at the top court are unlike anything seen before, and even some federal judges are calling it out. But for now, the administration isn’t slowing down. Chief Justice John Roberts had already paused the lower court’s ruling on September 9, and Friday’s order turned that pause into a permanent freeze. Trump’s legal team had informed lawmakers weeks ago that they wouldn’t spend the $4 billion. They’re using a move called “rescission,” where the president notifies Congress that he doesn’t plan to spend certain funds. It’s rare and controversial, and hasn’t been used like this since the Nixon era. And by dropping the notice so late in the fiscal year, Trump made sure Congress wouldn’t have enough time to respond before the funds expire. Democrats are livid. Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Rosa DeLauro released a joint statement saying, “Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse.” But that’s unlikely to happen. Republicans control both chambers and have shown no signs of pushing back. Instead, they’re focused on passing a budget before October 1 to avoid a full government shutdown. The $4 billion came out of a $10.5 billion package approved for international development. Trump says he’s still spending the remaining $6.5 billion, but the slice he’s withholding was tied to humanitarian goals. Judge Amir Ali, who serves in D.C., had ruled on September 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress formally canceled it. In response, Solicitor General D. John Sauer fired back in court, calling the ruling “unacceptable.” He said it would force the White House to hold unwanted talks with foreign governments over how to distribute the funds. The lawsuit against Trump was filed by a group of nonprofits led by the Global Health Council. Their legal team said the administration’s interpretation of the Impoundment Control Act would completely flip the law’s purpose. “Congress’s signature law meant to control impoundments,” they wrote, “actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|RESEARCH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 08:20:02

Amid this decline, speculation arises about whether this is an opportune moment for investment. The possibility of other cryptocurrencies being poised for growth further intensifies the intrigue. The fine details of this market movement await closer examination. Ethereum Eyes Breakout Amidst Volatile Swings Source: tradingview Ethereum’s price currently oscillates between $4,360 and $4,607. It faces resistance at $4,764 and support at $4,271. Over the past week, its value fell by over ten percent, aligning with a similar monthly drop. However, in the last six months, it has surged by nearly 122 percent. Ethereum's strength suggests potential to break through $4,764 and even approach $5,011 if upward momentum builds. With a mild RSI of 53 indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, Ethereum may soon recover its lost ground. Current indicators are balanced, showing potential for growth as investors eye the next resistance marks for a possible rally. Conclusion ETH's dip below $4,000 marks a notable movement in the market. This price level might be seen as an entry point for buyers. ETH has shown potential for growth. Monitoring the trends and volumes at this level could provide insights for strategic decisions. The current market trends should be closely observed for any signs of further shifts.

You’re not alone. The digital asset has been a focal point for investors and enthusiasts alike, captivating the cryptocurrency world with its unique proposition and a rollercoaster of market movements. From its innovative technology to its high-profile legal battles, XRP has consistently remained in the spotlight. Today, we’re diving deep into the much-anticipated Ripple XRP price prediction for 2025, 2026, and beyond, exploring the crucial question: will XRP truly reach the ambitious $5 mark? Join us as we unpack the complex factors that could shape XRP’s journey. Understanding Ripple XRP Price Prediction Dynamics The world of cryptocurrency price predictions is complex, influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from technological advancements to global economic shifts. For XRP, these dynamics are particularly intricate. Created by Ripple Labs, XRP is designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international payments, positioning itself as a digital bridge asset. Its journey has been marked by significant developments, including its adoption by various financial institutions and, notably, a protracted legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC Lawsuit: This legal saga has been a dominant force in XRP’s price action. Positive developments or a clear resolution could significantly boost investor confidence and remove a major overhang. Utility and Adoption: XRP’s core value proposition lies in its utility for cross-border payments. Increased adoption by banks and payment providers directly correlates with its demand and potential price appreciation. Market Sentiment: The broader cryptocurrency market often dictates individual asset performance. A bull market tends to lift all boats, while a bear market can suppress even strong projects. Technological Development: Continuous improvements and new use cases for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can attract developers and users, enhancing XRP’s ecosystem. These elements combine to create a challenging but exciting landscape for predicting XRP’s future. Each factor plays a role in shaping the market’s perception and, consequently, the Ripple XRP price prediction . Analyzing XRP Price Target: Factors Driving Future Growth When we talk about an ambitious XRP price target like $5, it’s essential to dissect the underlying drivers that could propel it to such levels. Several key factors are continuously at play, influencing XRP’s valuation. 1. Regulatory Clarity and Resolution: A definitive positive outcome for Ripple in its legal battle with the SEC would likely trigger a massive rally. It would provide regulatory clarity not just for XRP but potentially for the broader crypto industry in the U.S., opening doors for institutional investment and wider adoption. Clarity allows more exchanges to relist XRP and financial institutions to confidently integrate Ripple’s solutions without fear of regulatory backlash. 2. Expanding Utility and Partnerships: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which uses XRP for instant cross-border payments, is a cornerstone of its utility. As more financial institutions and payment providers integrate ODL, the demand for XRP increases. Strategic partnerships with global banks, payment corridors, and even governments can significantly expand XRP’s reach and practical applications. 3. Overall Cryptocurrency Market Trends: XRP, like most altcoins, is often correlated with Bitcoin’s performance. A strong Bitcoin bull run typically creates an ‘altcoin season,’ where other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, see substantial gains. Increased institutional interest in the crypto space as a whole, driven by factors like spot ETF approvals or clearer regulatory frameworks globally, would funnel more capital into assets like XRP. These drivers are not isolated; they often reinforce each other. A positive regulatory outcome, for instance, could accelerate utility adoption, which in turn strengthens market sentiment and contributes to a higher XRP price target . Decoding XRP Future Price: 2025 Outlook As we peer into the near future, specifically 2025, the landscape for XRP appears to be shaped by a mix of ongoing developments and potential breakthroughs. Many analysts believe that 2025 could be a pivotal year, especially if the broader crypto market experiences a resurgence following a potential Bitcoin halving cycle. Key Considerations for 2025: Post-Halving Bull Run: Historically, the year following a Bitcoin halving event often witnesses a significant bull market across the crypto space. If this pattern holds, XRP could ride this wave. SEC Lawsuit Resolution: By 2025, a final resolution to the SEC lawsuit is highly anticipated. A favorable outcome for Ripple would undoubtedly be a major catalyst, potentially triggering a sharp price increase as regulatory uncertainty dissipates. Increased ODL Adoption: Ripple continues to expand its On-Demand Liquidity corridors. By 2025, a more robust network of ODL partners could significantly increase the transactional utility and demand for XRP. Given these factors, various projections for XRP future price in 2025 suggest a range of possibilities. While no prediction is guaranteed, here’s a generalized outlook based on current analysis: Scenario Minimum Price (USD) Average Price (USD) Maximum Price (USD) Conservative $0.80 $1.20 $1.50 Moderate $1.50 $2.00 $2.50 Optimistic $2.50 $3.50 $4.00+ These figures represent potential ranges, with the optimistic scenario often hinging on a combination of a favorable regulatory environment and a strong overall market. The XRP future price will be heavily influenced by how these major themes unfold over the next year. The XRP Ledger Advantage: Scalability and Innovation Beyond the market speculation and legal battles, the core strength of Ripple’s ecosystem lies in the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This open-source, decentralized technology offers significant advantages that underpin XRP’s long-term potential. What makes the XRP Ledger stand out? Speed and Efficiency: Transactions on the XRPL are processed in 3-5 seconds, significantly faster than many other blockchain networks. This speed is crucial for its intended use in cross-border payments. Low Transaction Costs: Fees on the XRPL are negligible, often fractions of a cent, making it economically viable for frequent, small-value transactions. Scalability: The XRPL can handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), a capacity that far exceeds many legacy financial systems and even some leading cryptocurrencies. Decentralization and Security: While often misunderstood, the XRPL is decentralized, maintained by a network of independent validators. Its consensus mechanism ensures high security and reliability. The XRPL is not just about payments; it’s a versatile platform fostering innovation. Developers are increasingly building applications on the ledger, including: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): The XRPL has a built-in DEX, allowing for direct peer-to-peer trading of various assets. Tokenization: Businesses can issue and manage digital assets, including stablecoins and NFTs, directly on the XRPL. DeFi Applications: While not as prominent as on Ethereum, a growing ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is emerging on the XRPL, leveraging its speed and low costs. This robust technological foundation provides a strong argument for XRP’s sustained relevance and growth. The continuous development and expansion of the XRP Ledger ecosystem contribute directly to XRP’s utility and, by extension, its value proposition. Navigating Cryptocurrency Market Trends for XRP XRP’s trajectory is inextricably linked to broader cryptocurrency market trends . Understanding these macro movements is crucial for any informed prediction. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, influenced by a blend of economic, technological, and geopolitical factors. Key Market Trends to Monitor: Global Economic Climate: Inflation rates, interest rate policies by central banks, and global economic stability directly impact investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. A tightening monetary policy often leads to capital flowing out of speculative investments. Bitcoin’s Dominance: Bitcoin remains the bellwether for the entire crypto market. Its price movements often dictate the general direction for altcoins, including XRP. A strong Bitcoin bull run typically signals a healthy market, while a downturn can drag other assets down. Institutional Adoption: The increasing interest from institutional investors, hedge funds, and traditional financial giants is a significant trend. Their entry brings substantial capital and legitimacy to the market, which can stabilize prices and drive growth for established assets like XRP. Regulatory Landscape (Global): Beyond the SEC case, global regulatory clarity or uncertainty in major economies (e.g., EU, UK, Asia) can have a profound impact. Favorable regulations encourage innovation and investment, while restrictive ones can stifle growth. Technological Innovation: The rapid pace of development in blockchain technology, including advancements in scalability, security, and interoperability, continues to shape the market. While XRPL has its advantages, competition from other layer-1 solutions is always present. Investors must keep a keen eye on these overarching cryptocurrency market trends . While XRP has its unique fundamentals, it operates within a larger ecosystem where these macro forces often exert significant influence over its short-term and long-term price performance. Will XRP Reach $5? A Deep Dive into Long-Term Potential (2026-2030) The question of whether XRP can reach $5 is perhaps the most captivating for its holders. While seemingly ambitious, especially after its past performance, a detailed analysis of its long-term potential (2026-2030) reveals scenarios where this XRP price target could become a reality. Bull Case for $5 and Beyond: Complete Regulatory Clarity: A definitive win for Ripple against the SEC, or a clear regulatory framework in the U.S., would remove the biggest cloud over XRP. This could unleash significant institutional capital and widespread adoption. Dominance in Cross-Border Payments: If Ripple’s ODL becomes the industry standard for international remittances and payments, the demand for XRP as a bridge currency would skyrocket. XRPL Ecosystem Growth: A thriving ecosystem of dApps, NFTs, and DeFi solutions built on the XRP Ledger could significantly increase its utility and network effect, attracting more users and developers. Broader Crypto Bull Market: A sustained, multi-year bull market across the entire crypto space, potentially driven by mass adoption and integration into mainstream finance, would naturally elevate XRP’s value. Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: Further high-profile partnerships with major financial institutions or tech companies, or even an IPO for Ripple Labs, could provide massive positive sentiment and capital infusion. Bear Case Considerations: Adverse Regulatory Outcomes: A negative outcome in the SEC lawsuit or increasingly restrictive global regulations could severely impact XRP’s utility and market confidence. Competition: The cross-border payments space is competitive, with traditional players and other crypto projects vying for market share. If competitors offer superior solutions, XRP’s adoption could stagnate. Technological Obsolescence: While XRPL is robust, rapid technological advancements in the blockchain space mean constant innovation is required to stay relevant. Macroeconomic Headwinds: A prolonged global recession or financial crisis could dampen investor enthusiasm for speculative assets, impacting XRP’s price. Considering these factors, here’s a hypothetical long-term XRP future price prediction for 2026-2030: Year Minimum Price (USD) Average Price (USD) Maximum Price (USD) 2026 $1.00 $2.50 $4.00 2027 $1.50 $3.50 $5.50 2028 $2.00 $4.50 $7.00 2029 $2.50 $5.50 $8.50 2030 $3.00 $7.00 $10.00+ The journey to $5, and potentially beyond, requires a confluence of favorable conditions. While challenging, it is certainly within the realm of possibility, especially if Ripple successfully navigates its regulatory hurdles and continues to expand its global utility. The Ripple XRP price prediction for these years is largely contingent on these critical developments. Challenges and Risks for XRP Investors Investing in XRP, like any cryptocurrency, comes with inherent risks. While the potential for growth is significant, it’s crucial for investors to be aware of the challenges that could impact their holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent positive developments, the overarching regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and unpredictable globally. New regulations could emerge that impact XRP’s operational model or classification. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for extreme price swings. External events, macro-economic shifts, or even a single large sell-off can lead to rapid and substantial price drops. Competition: The cross-border payments and digital asset space is highly competitive. Other blockchain projects and traditional financial technologies are constantly evolving, posing a threat to Ripple’s market share. Centralization Concerns: While the XRP Ledger is decentralized, Ripple Labs holds a significant portion of XRP, leading to some concerns about potential centralization of influence. This perception can affect investor sentiment. Technological Risks: While XRPL is robust, any unforeseen bugs, security breaches, or major technological advancements by competitors could impact its standing. Prudent investors consider these risks carefully and factor them into their investment strategy. The journey to a high XRP price target is not without its obstacles. Actionable Insights for Potential XRP Investors For those considering an investment in XRP, or looking to manage their existing holdings, a strategic approach is key. Given the dynamic nature of the crypto market and XRP’s unique position, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: Closely follow news regarding Ripple’s legal status and broader crypto regulations. Regulatory clarity is a primary catalyst for XRP. Understand Ripple’s Business Growth: Monitor Ripple’s partnerships, ODL expansion, and new product announcements. These indicate the real-world utility and adoption of XRP. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into a single asset. A diversified portfolio can mitigate risks associated with the volatility of any one cryptocurrency. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets often reward patience. Short-term fluctuations can be significant, but a long-term outlook, focusing on fundamental utility and adoption, is often more rewarding. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear entry and exit strategies, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your capital from extreme downturns. Technical Analysis: While fundamentals drive long-term value, technical analysis can help identify potential entry and exit points based on price patterns and indicators. By combining thorough research with a disciplined investment approach, you can better navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market trends . Conclusion: The Road Ahead for XRP The journey of Ripple’s XRP is a compelling narrative of innovation, legal battles, and ambitious aspirations. Our comprehensive look at the Ripple XRP price prediction for 2025-2030 suggests a future filled with both significant potential and inherent challenges.

With bulls eyeing a potential run to $150,000, BTC remains the backbone of institutional and retail portfolios alike. Yet, while Bitcoin promises steady growth, investors in Ozak AI’s presale are anticipating even bigger returns. With the project already surpassing $3.4 million raised in Stage 6 at just $0.012 per token, Ozak AI is emerging as a high-upside contender that could deliver 50x to 100x gains—multiples Bitcoin is unlikely to match. Bitcoin Bulls Gear Up for $150K Bitcoin has long been the benchmark of the crypto market, viewed as both a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Trading near $108,000, BTC has support at $105,000, $100,000, and $92,000, while facing resistance at $115,000, $125,000, and $135,000. Analysts argue that once Bitcoin breaks above these resistance zones, a run toward $150,000 could be in play. For investors, this growth is significant, but the ROI is measured in percentages rather than multiples. A $500 investment in Bitcoin today would secure just 0.0046 BTC. If Bitcoin climbs to $150,000, that stake would be worth $690, representing solid returns but nowhere near the life-changing gains smaller projects may offer. Ozak AI: The Presale Project With Exponential Upside Ozak AI is quickly becoming one of 2025’s most hyped presale projects, not because of meme-driven speculation but because of its ambitious goal: merging artificial intelligence with blockchain. The project is designed to compress information latency, delivering hedge-fund-grade predictive signals in just 30 milliseconds. This kind of real-time intelligence could redefine how traders and institutions interact with markets. At just $0.012 per token in Stage 6, Ozak AI has already raised more than $3.4 million and sold over 920 million tokens. A $500 investment secures 41,666 OZ tokens. If the token reaches $0.10, that allocation would be worth $4,166. At $0.50, it jumps to $20,833, and at $1.20 by 2026, it could hit $50,000—a potential 100x return. This asymmetry is precisely why Ozak AI presale is attracting both retail investors and whales. OZ’s Partnerships That Build Confidence Unlike many presale projects, Ozak AI has already secured credible partnerships to strengthen its ecosystem. Its collaboration with Perceptron Network (@PerceptronNTWK), which operates over 700,000 active nodes, ensures scalability and distributed intelligence. Ozak AI has also partnered with SINT, offering autonomous AI agents and cross-chain execution, and HIVE, integrating blockchain data APIs with Ozak’s predictive signals. These partnerships signal that Ozak AI is building with long-term adoption in mind, not just short-term hype. For investors, this makes the project stand out as a serious contender among 2025’s presales. Bitcoin vs. Ozak AI The comparison between Bitcoin and Ozak AI highlights a fundamental choice in crypto investing. Bitcoin offers stability, liquidity, and institutional trust, with upside potential from $108,000 to $150,000 providing solid but limited ROI. Ozak AI, on the other hand, is an early-stage project where small allocations can grow into life-changing sums if adoption unfolds as predicted. Many investors are now adopting a hybrid approach—holding Bitcoin for security while allocating a portion of their portfolios into high-upside presales like Ozak AI. This strategy provides the best of both worlds: Bitcoin’s reliability and Ozak AI’s moonshot potential. Bitcoin’s run toward $150,000 highlights its continued dominance and value as a safe, long-term investment. Yet, with BTC trading at $108,000 and capped upside in the short term, it’s Ozak AI’s presale at $0.012 that’s generating the loudest buzz. With more than $3.4 million raised, strong partnerships, and whale accumulation underway, Ozak AI offers a realistic path to 100x gains. For investors chasing transformative ROI in 2025, Bitcoin remains the foundation—but Ozak AI could be the breakout star of the next bull cycle.

Despite this impressive performance, the spotlight is also on emerging opportunities that promise even greater returns, such as the Ozak AI's presale. The Rising Tide of Bitcoin and Market Optimism Bitcoin, often regarded as the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, is currently eyeing a landmark target of $150,000. This optimism is supported by its strong performance amidst various resistance levels that are set at $115,000, $125,000, and $135,000. While Bitcoin's growth prospects offer a robust addition to both retail and institutional portfolios, the real excitement comes from the possibility of breaking past key resistance areas which could usher in a surge towards the $150,000 mark. Ozak AI's Presale: A Glimmer of Exponential Growth While Bitcoin solidifies its position, Ozak AI's presale is setting the stage for potentially monumental returns. With over $3.4 million already raised and the price per token still at an accessible $0.012, investors are flocking to what could be one of the most lucrative deals in the crypto space of 2025. Ozak AI's vision to integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology promises to enhance trading strategies with real-time predictive analytics, potentially reshaping how market participants make decisions. Technological Edge and Strategic Partnerships Further bolstering investor confidence are Ozak AI's strategic partnerships. Collaborations with Perceptron Network, which boasts over 700,000 active nodes, along with SINT and HIVE, ensure that Ozak AI is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamentally sound investment poised for long-term success. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin Stability vs. Ozak AI's Growth Potential Investing in Bitcoin offers a more stable, albeit slower-growth path with a potential rise from its current $108,000 mark up to $150,000. Conversely, Ozak AI presents a riskier but potentially more rewarding proposition. Early investors in Ozak AI are looking at a possible 100x return, a scale of profit that Bitcoin's current trajectory may not offer. The contrast between Bitcoin's steady ascent and Ozak AI's explosive potential offers a compelling choice for investors in 2025. Diversifying across both provides a balanced portfolio by leveraging Bitcoin's reliability alongside Ozak AI's high-growth prospects. Envisioning the Future: Ozak AI's Market Position Ozak AI is rapidly gaining traction not just for its innovative technology but also for its impressive presale achievements.

For many, the burning question isn’t just what Bitcoin is doing today, but where it’s headed tomorrow, next year, and even a decade from now. If you’ve ever found yourself pondering the future value of the original cryptocurrency, then you’re in the right place. We’re diving deep into the realm of Bitcoin price prediction , exploring expert analyses, historical patterns, and key market drivers to give you a comprehensive outlook on how high BTC price could potentially soar by 2025, 2026, and even up to 2030. Understanding Bitcoin’s Journey: A Look at Historical Cycles Bitcoin, since its inception in 2009, has demonstrated a remarkable ability to rebound from significant downturns, often reaching new all-time highs. Its journey is characterized by distinct bull and bear market cycles, largely influenced by its programmed scarcity and increasing adoption. These cycles provide valuable context for any future Bitcoin price prediction . Initial Growth: Early years saw slow but steady adoption. Halving Events: Each halving historically preceded major bull runs. Institutional Interest: Growing acceptance by major financial institutions has added legitimacy. Retail Adoption: Increased accessibility for everyday investors drives demand. While past performance is not indicative of future results, understanding these patterns helps us analyze potential trajectories for the BTC price . Key Drivers Shaping Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Factors Truly Matter? Predicting Bitcoin’s future price involves analyzing a confluence of factors, both internal to the crypto ecosystem and external macroeconomic forces. These drivers collectively influence supply and demand dynamics, which are fundamental to any asset’s valuation. The primary elements to consider include: Supply and Demand Dynamics: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. As demand increases against a fixed or decreasing new supply (due to halvings), price tends to rise. Institutional Adoption: The entry of major financial players, like asset managers launching Bitcoin Spot ETFs, significantly boosts legitimacy, liquidity, and capital inflow. This is a powerful catalyst for the BTC price . Macroeconomic Environment: Global inflation, interest rates, geopolitical stability, and the strength of traditional currencies can all influence Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge or alternative asset. Regulatory Landscape: Clear and favorable regulations in major economies can reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Conversely, restrictive regulations can create headwinds. Technological Advancements: Developments like the Lightning Network for faster transactions or improved security measures can enhance Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. The Anticipated Impact of the Bitcoin Halving Cycles One of the most unique and historically significant events in Bitcoin’s life cycle is the ‘halving.’ Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new blocks is cut in half, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation. This built-in scarcity mechanism is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s economic model and a crucial factor in long-term Bitcoin price prediction . Historically, each halving event has been followed by a significant bull run, often peaking 12-18 months later. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024. This event drastically reduced the new supply of Bitcoin, creating a supply shock that, combined with rising demand, is widely expected to propel the BTC price upwards in the coming years. While the market reaction isn’t immediate, the reduced supply acts as a powerful long-term catalyst. Expert Forecasts: How High Can BTC Price Go by 2025, 2026, and Beyond? Forecasting Bitcoin’s future price is inherently speculative, yet various models and expert opinions offer compelling insights. Many analysts use a blend of historical halving cycle data, stock-to-flow models, and macroeconomic projections to arrive at their targets. Here’s a general overview of what some predictions suggest for the BTC price : Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Following the 2024 halving, 2025 is widely anticipated to be a peak year in the current bull cycle. Experts often cite figures ranging from $100,000 to $250,000 . This optimism is fueled by sustained institutional interest, increasing retail adoption, and the full impact of the supply shock from the halving. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 After a potential peak in 2025, 2026 might see a period of consolidation or a moderate correction, typical of post-halving cycles. While not expected to reach new all-time highs, the BTC price is generally projected to remain strong, potentially trading in the range of $80,000 to $180,000 , as the market digests previous gains and builds a new base. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027-2028 These years might represent a ‘bear’ or accumulation phase, similar to past cycles. Prices could dip, offering opportunities for long-term investors. However, with growing global adoption and infrastructure, a severe crash like previous cycles might be less likely. Expectations could range from $70,000 to $150,000 , depending on broader crypto market trends and macro factors. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2029-2030 Leading up to and following the next halving (expected around 2028), the market could begin another ascent. By 2030, many analysts predict Bitcoin could reach unprecedented levels. Targets for the BTC price by 2030 frequently fall between $300,000 and $1,000,000+ , driven by Bitcoin’s increasing role as a global reserve asset, further institutional integration, and widespread digital currency adoption. Some even speculate higher, especially if inflation persists globally. Here’s a simplified table summarizing potential price ranges: Year Conservative Estimate Moderate Estimate Optimistic Estimate 2025 $100,000 $150,000 $250,000 2026 $80,000 $120,000 $180,000 2030 $300,000 $500,000 $1,000,000+ These are predictions and not financial advice. The actual price can vary significantly. Navigating Evolving Crypto Market Trends: What to Watch For? Beyond Bitcoin’s internal mechanics, the broader crypto market trends play a significant role. The ecosystem is dynamic, with new innovations constantly emerging. Keeping an eye on these developments can offer additional clues for Bitcoin’s trajectory. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and success of Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital, providing a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Their continued growth is a strong bullish signal. Interest Rate Policies: Central bank decisions on interest rates can impact investor appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Lower rates often make risk assets more attractive. Technological Innovations: Developments in scalability, security, and interoperability across the blockchain space can indirectly benefit Bitcoin by strengthening the overall crypto narrative. Global Economic Health: Bitcoin’s narrative as ‘digital gold’ means it can act as a safe haven during economic uncertainty, attracting investors seeking to preserve wealth. Is Cryptocurrency Investment in BTC Right for You? Engaging in cryptocurrency investment , especially with an asset as volatile as Bitcoin, requires careful consideration. While the potential for substantial returns is evident from the predictions, it’s crucial to acknowledge the risks involved. Benefits of Investing in Bitcoin: Store of Value: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it a potential hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Decentralization: It operates independently of central banks and governments, offering financial sovereignty. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown a strong upward trend over the long term. Accessibility: Easy to buy, sell, and transfer globally. Challenges and Risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape can introduce new risks or opportunities. Security Risks: While the blockchain itself is secure, exchanges and personal wallets can be vulnerable to hacks if not properly secured. Market Manipulation: The relatively smaller market size compared to traditional assets can make it susceptible to large price movements. Actionable Insights for Aspiring Bitcoin Investors For those considering cryptocurrency investment in Bitcoin, here are some practical tips: Do Your Research: Understand the technology, market dynamics, and risks before investing. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy helps mitigate volatility. Only Invest What You Can Afford to Lose: Given the high-risk nature, never put in money essential for your living expenses. Secure Your Assets: Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Stay Informed: Keep up with crypto market trends , news, and regulatory updates. The Road Ahead: A Compelling Outlook for Bitcoin’s Future As we look towards 2025, 2026, and even 2030, the narrative around Bitcoin continues to strengthen. From its origins as a niche digital currency, it has evolved into a recognized global asset class, attracting both individual investors and major institutions. While the journey will undoubtedly involve its share of volatility and challenges, the underlying fundamentals of scarcity, increasing utility, and growing adoption paint a compelling picture for its long-term potential. The convergence of a maturing market, significant institutional capital, and the powerful impact of the Bitcoin halving events suggest that the question isn’t just if Bitcoin will reach new highs, but how astronomically high it could soar.

These investors aren’t just backing flashy data centers anymore. They’re going after local utilities that deliver power to everyday people and the massive servers running AI models like ChatGPT. According to reporting from the Associated Press, billions of dollars from firms like Blackstone and BlackRock are now flowing into electric companies in New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. These utilities supply power to more than 150 million people across millions of miles of power lines, and the profit potential is turning heads fast. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private equity and hedge funds. Greg said investors are now stacking up power plants, data centers, and energy services, all thanks to the surge in demand since the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT. Blackstone targets utilities while Minnesota fight escalates Blackstone is pushing regulators to approve its purchase of both Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power, based in Albuquerque and Lewisville. Wisconsin has already cleared the sale of Superior Water, Light and Power, and last year, Northern Indiana Public Service Company sold a 19.9% stake to Blackstone. But in Minnesota , things are far messier. A major fight is unfolding over whether BlackRock, through one of its subsidiaries, can team up with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to take over Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power. That utility provides electricity to 150,000 customers and runs a mix of coal, gas, wind, and solar power. This isn’t just another transaction. Google might be building a data center in the area, and whoever controls Minnesota Power stands to make serious money from feeding power to it. The proposed $6.2 billion deal offers $67 per share, a 19% premium to Allete’s stockholders. Allete claims this deal helps them hit Minnesota’s 2040 law requiring utilities to use 100% carbon-free power. They estimate needing $4.3 billion for grid and clean energy projects in the next five years. They also argue that BlackRock isn’t under short-term stock market pressure and can take a more “patient” approach. Opposition slams deal as profit play on ratepayers Not everyone’s on board. Critics say the whole thing is just a profit scheme. Karlee Weinmann, a policy advocate at the Energy and Policy Institute, said , “Private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice.” Mark Ellis, a former utility exec turned consumer advocate, testified against the deal. Mark said he’s personally talked to private equity firms looking to jump into utility ownership. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” he said. He added these companies don’t come up for sale often, but when they do, they’re golden. Utilities generate about 10% returns, not by selling power, but by spending money. The more they invest in substations, poles, and wires, the more they can charge customers under rules set by regulators. That’s where critics say the danger lies, the incentive is to overspend so investors can overcharge. This fight over Minnesota Power mirrors battles in other parts of America, where people are pushing back against having data centers built near their homes. In this case, Gov. Tim Walz and building trades unions support the buyout. But the Minnesota Attorney General’s office and large industrial power buyers (like U.S. Steel, Enbridge, and pulp and paper mills) are pushing against it. These industrial players use two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity. In its filing, Allete insisted that BlackRock’s ownership wouldn’t change its operations or strategy, and promised the deal wouldn’t raise rates. But filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Allete already said it was “well positioned” to meet its funding needs without new owners. Things got even worse for BlackRock in July, when Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie told regulators to block the deal. She said the record showed the buyers plan to do what private equity always does — “pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech|Allete|BlackRock|Blackstone|Google|Minnesota Power|OpenAI|SEC|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 08:40:31

While SHIB’s saga trails waves of speculation and community momentum, Remittix (RTX) is quietly surging, expected by many to be set for gold. In this evolving narrative, SHIB’s potential and Remittix’s rise intersect in ways that matter to active crypto traders now. Shiba Inu: Limited Upside but Technical Signals Rising Shiba Inu currently trades around $0.0000117, slipping slightly over the past day. Analysts now eye the resistance at $0.00002263, projecting a 203% rally if SHIB breaks upward. Others see more moderate gains; some forecasts expect SHIB to end 2025 between $0.00001511 and $0.00001527, roughly a 15% to 25% upside. Still, SHIB faces heavy resistance zones and weak volume outside meme hype cycles. The upward path to classic meme heights such as $0.00005 or beyond appears structurally constrained under current flows. Remittix Is The New Gold Standard Under $1 SHIB’s upside is often tethered to social cycles and community swings, while Remittix’s rise is anchored to payments infrastructure, capital backing, and incentive alignment. While SHIB fights to hold support and muster breakouts, Remittix is drawing traction, capital, and expectation on its own merits. The Remittix team is now verified by CertiK, and Remittix is ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch Tokens. Its wallet beta is live, and community users are actively testing features. Remittix runs a 15% USDT referral program with rewards claimable every 24 hours. It launched a $250,000 giveaway to spark engagement. Having passed funding thresholds of over $20M and $22M, it has locked in two CEX listings (BitMart and LBANK) with a third in preparation. Remittix has sold over 672 million tokens, is priced at $0.113, and has raised over $26.7 million. Here are five core strengths reinforcing Remittix’s gold under $1 case: Solving a real-world $19T payments problem Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Ranked number one among pre-launch tokens Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Backed by working infrastructure, not vaporware Beyond Shiba’s Shadows Lies Remittix Light Shiba Inu price prediction models still propose viable upside, but SHIB’s path is littered with resistance and dependence on cycles. Remittix offers an alternate route, utility plus momentum bundled into a growth narrative. At this moment, investors snapping up RTX may well be banking on Remittix, not SHIB, as the true gold crypto play.

52332787,https://invezz.com/?p=2901686,1758963600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Analysts say $0.035 token set for 15% rise could be next crypto to explode before Q2 2026,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/27/analysts-say-0-035-token-set-for-15-rise-could-be-next-crypto-to-explode-before-q2-2026/,"Crypto analysts are forecasting that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned for a near-term price increase of 15% and is on track for a substantial breakout leading into Q2 2026. Market observers tracking crypto charts note that while top-tier DeFi tokens have stabilized, early-stage presale projects with robust utility are gaining traction among serious investors. With MUTM currently trading at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, it is drawing attention as a token primed for both short-term growth and long-term expansion. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate with a dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending to offer comprehensive capital efficiency. P2C pools will allow users to deposit stablecoins like USDT, USDC, DAI, and USDD, as well as major cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BTC, SOL, ADA, XRP, and LINK. Rates will dynamically adjust based on utilization, encouraging deposits when liquidity is high and balancing borrowing when demand rises. For instance, an investor depositing $15,000 USDT in a P2C pool will earn mtUSDT at a 1:1 ratio with a projected APY near 15%, delivering $2,250 in passive income by year-end. Borrowers will retain exposure to their assets while borrowing liquidity; locking $750 worth of ETH allows borrowing up to 75% of its value in stablecoins. The P2P model will be tailored for niche or higher-volatility assets like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI, where lenders can negotiate rates and durations directly, isolating these riskier assets from core liquidity pools. Overcollateralization and a Stability Factor will govern all loans to protect the solvency of the protocol. Liquidation thresholds will ensure that positions at risk are promptly closed, with incentives for liquidators to stabilize the platform efficiently. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also deploy a decentralized $1-pegged stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted when users borrow against approved collateral and burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. Governance will oversee interest rate adjustments to preserve the peg, while arbitrage mechanisms will help maintain stability during market fluctuations. Chainlink oracles with fallback systems, aggregated feeds, and DEX TWAP references will provide precise price discovery, ensuring accurate valuations for lenders and borrowers even in volatile markets. Presale momentum and long-term growth Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is priced at $0.035, with approximately $16.4 million expected to be raised and over 16,600 holders projected. Half of the allocated supply has already been reserved, and the next Phase 7 is set to increase the price to $0.040, reflecting a 15% near-term gain. Investors who participated in Phase 1 at $0.01 will see a 3.5x value gain by Phase 6, and the token’s listing at $0.06 will deliver a further unrealized 70% gain. Analysts project that by Q2 2026, MUTM’s adoption could mirror the growth trajectories of major DeFi tokens like SOL and AVAX, yielding long-term gains of over 9,900% for early buyers. The platform will also introduce mtToken staking and MUTM buyback mechanisms, using revenue generated from lending fees to repurchase MUTM on the open market. Depositors staking mtTokens will earn MUTM rewards distributed proportionally, creating a steady, compounding yield for users while simultaneously supporting token price stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap shows a linear progression from presale and smart contract development to a functional demo and testnet. Subsequent exchange listings on Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, and Kraken will enhance liquidity and adoption. The beta launch will allow users to experience the protocol firsthand, providing confidence in both usability and security. The CertiK audit, with a Token Scan Score of 90 and Skynet Score of 79, combined with a $50,000 bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway for ten early supporters, will anchor trust and community engagement around the token. Final words Analysts note that market timing for crypto investment is critical. As volatility continues to drive short-term price swings, MUTM’s strong presale performance, structured lending, stablecoin integration, and planned staking rewards place it ahead of many larger-cap tokens. For traders tracking why crypto is going up, the combination of tangible utility, security measures, and presale momentum positions MUTM as the DeFi pick ready to capitalize on the next cycle. Investors accessing the dashboard will track real-time ROI, connect wallets seamlessly, and compete on the Top 50 leaderboard for bonus MUTM rewards. The project’s utility-driven features, paired with upcoming exchange exposure and growing community participation, will support both near-term price movement and long-term growth leading into Q2 2026.

52332040,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=820259,1758963600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52332040.jpeg,"Binance Coin Was Yesterday’s Winner, XRP Tundra’s Dual-Token Presale Is Tomorrow’s Fortune",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-coin-was-yesterdays-winner-xrp-tundras-dual-token-presale-is-tomorrows-fortune/,"Binance Coin (BNB) finally crossed the $1,000 threshold this month, delivering a landmark moment for investors who had waited years for the exchange token to fulfill its promise. The milestone validated BNB’s role in the market but also highlighted the patience required to realize such gains. A new contender, XRP Tundra, is shaping its story differently. Instead of waiting years for appreciation, participants in its presale receive dual-token allocations, transparent launch values, and access to staking systems designed to generate yield from the start. The model blends Solana’s performance with the XRP Ledger’s reliability, offering holders a structure focused on both growth and stability. A Presale With Two Tokens for One XRP Tundra’s presale provides exposure to two tokens. TUNDRA-S, issued on Solana, functions as the utility and yield token, while TUNDRA-X, built on XRPL, covers governance and reserves. This division of roles allows one purchase to deliver both growth potential and structural stability. In the current Phase 4, TUNDRA-S is priced at $0.068. Each transaction comes with a 16% token bonus and free allocations of TUNDRA-X valued at $0.034. With launch prices already fixed at $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X, early buyers are entering at a steep discount relative to public debut values. This approach contrasts sharply with earlier utility tokens such as BNB, where pricing was left to years of speculation before major returns were realized. The presale structure has drawn media analysis. Coverage from Crypto Vlog highlighted how fixed launch values and free dual allocations distinguish Tundra from conventional raises, shifting the focus from speculation to predictable upside. Verification and Independent Oversight XRP Tundra has paired its presale mechanics with transparent verification. Smart contract audits are public via Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins . Team identity has been confirmed through Vital Block KYC . This level of documentation separates Tundra from speculative presales where valuation and accountability are opaque. Combined with fixed launch prices, investors can evaluate both upside potential and underlying security before committing. Staking and Liquidity: Building Yield for XRP Holders One of XRP Tundra’s core innovations is staking access for XRP holders. Cryo Vaults allow users to lock XRP for durations between 7 and 90 days, with annualized returns scaling to 30% APY. Frost Keys — NFT-based enhancers — further boost yields or reduce lock requirements, creating flexibility in how holders engage with the system. While staking is not yet active, presale buyers secure guaranteed entry once the vaults open. To reinforce token value at launch, XRP Tundra also implements Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity pools for TUNDRA-S. Unlike traditional automated market makers that often face early volatility, DAMM V2 introduces dynamic fees that start high, deterring bots and dumping, before gradually normalizing. Liquidity positions are issued as NFTs, improving management and enabling transferability. Permanent liquidity locks add another layer of assurance by preventing sudden withdrawals. The key is integration: fees generated in these liquidity pools are redirected into staking rewards. This turns short-term trading into a driver of long-term yields, transforming what might otherwise be a speculative environment into a reinforcing cycle of staking and stability. From BNB’s Milestone to Tundra’s Momentum BNB’s journey to $1,000 demonstrated how persistence can pay off in utility tokens, but it also underscored the waiting game. XRP Tundra offers a different trajectory: dual-token allocations, staking access, and liquidity protection are available to participants at presale rather than years later. For early buyers, the appeal lies in combining discounted entry with structural features that reward holding and staking. Where BNB holders waited years for a four-digit valuation, XRP Tundra frames its case as tomorrow’s fortune — one built on staking income, transparent pricing, and protective mechanics from day one.

The Bitcoin, worth Rs. 150.47 crore (approximately $18 million), was received from late crypto scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj, Indian authorities said. The charge sheet was filed before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court. Indian authorities claimed that Kundra concealed crucial evidence in the case and failed to surrender the digital assets linked to the crime. According to the ED, Kundra remains in possession of the Bitcoin, enjoying the proceeds of crime. The Indian agency also mentioned that he conducted a transaction with his wife, Shilpa Shetty, an actress, at below market rate to obfuscate the funds gotten through criminal activities. Indian agency files charges against businessman over crime-linked Bitcoin The money laundering case originates from several FIRs filed by police in the Maharashtra and Delhi regions against Variable Tech Private Limited and several individuals, including Amit Bhardwaj, Ajay Bhardwaj, Vivek Bhardwaj, and Mahender Bhardwaj. Indian authorities claimed that the promoters promised investors huge gains in return for their investments in a Bitcoin mining program, but instead got cheated. Authorities claimed that the suspects took the ill-gotten Bitcoin and sent it into obscure online wallets. The Indian agency claimed that Kundra received the said Bitcoin from Amit Bhardwaj for establishing a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Though the deal failed to materialize, authorities claimed that Kundra allegedly still retained possession of the Bitcoin, failing to remit it so that it could be returned to those who invested in the program. Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj (his father, Mahender Bhardwaj), and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable,” the chargesheet read. The agency also claimed that Kundra’s ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoin received in five different transactions after seven years shows that he was indeed the beneficial party and not that he acted merely as a mediator. ED accuses Kundra of damaging crucial evidence According to the agency, since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide the wallet addresses where the 285 Bitcoins were moved into. He attributed this to the damage to his iPhone X shortly after he was apprehended and asked to give his initial statement. However, the ED said it interpreted the act as deliberate, noting that Kundra knowingly destroyed the device as a ploy to hide crucial evidence that was important to their investigations. The ED also mentioned that Kundra carried out a transaction with his wife, Shilpa Shetty, selling to her far below market rate, a move they claimed was to disguise the origin of the funds obtained through criminal activities. The Indian agency also mentioned that Kundra tried to frustrate their investigations under the PMLA by layering the proceeds of crime and protected the same as untainted. The charge sheet also fingered another businessman, Rajesh Satija, as another accused in the case. According to authorities, Kundra claimed that he only acted as a mediator in the transaction but failed to provide any documents as evidence to support that claim. Instead, he noted that an agreement titled ‘Term Sheet’ was signed between him and Mahendra Bhardwaj. The ED explained that the Bitcoin was supposed to go into mining operations, with investors promised financial returns in cryptocurrency. However, the promoters allegedly defrauded investors and have been hiding the illegally obtained Bitcoin in different digital wallets.

The report noted that this risk increases as cryptocurrencies go beyond being just an investment tool and are now being used for savings and money transfers. Moody's argued that the proliferation of dollar-denominated stablecoins, in particular, and the increasing use of pricing and payments in currencies other than local currencies could weaken the monetary policy transmission mechanism. This, it added, could reduce transparency and regulatory visibility, creating pressures for “cryptocurrency”—akin to unofficial dollarization. Related News: What Will the Bitcoin Price Be at the End of 2025? 10 Major Companies and Analysts Weigh In The report also noted that cryptocurrencies provide new channels for capital flight through anonymous wallets and offshore exchanges, which could undermine exchange rate stability. Moody's noted that the heaviest adoption of crypto assets has been seen in Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of Latin America, driven by factors such as high inflation, currency depreciation, and limited banking services. In contrast, crypto adoption in developed economies is reportedly advancing largely due to institutional consolidation and regulatory clarity. According to the report, approximately 562 million people worldwide will be using cryptocurrencies by 2024, representing a 33% annual increase. *This is not investment advice.

Investors are now debating which tokens could deliver the next 100x move even as all chart signals blink red. Meme coins like Dogecoin remain in the spotlight, while newer PayFi-focused projects such as Remittix are emerging as strong contenders. Analysts argue that although DOGE has brand recognition, early-stage crypto investment opportunities like Remittix could be best for delivering explosive returns. With both tokens showing different strengths, the question of which asset will rally hardest is dominating upcoming crypto projects chatter. Dogecoin outlook and market behavior Dogecoin continues to capture headlines thanks to its loyal community and reputation as a pioneer among meme tokens. However, this attention is not directly translating to positive price prediction and performance. In the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 17.57%, raising concerns about sustainability in the short term. But the coin has gained 4.07% over the past month, adding nearly $0.01 to its value. For many, DOGE remains a top crypto under $1 with potential upside if the broader market rebounds. Yet, analysts also warn that compared to new altcoins to watch, Dogecoin may lack the utility that fuels sustained long-term growth. Investors back Remittix to deliver 100x within 6 months While Dogecoin’s struggles continue, Remittix is already leaving its mark as a top destination for investors seeking explosive returns. The PayFi project has raised over $26.7 million, selling more than 672 million tokens. With a confirmed Tier-1 CEX listing on BitMart and LBANK lined up next, momentum is clearly building. Beta testing for the Remittix wallet is live, adding to RTX’s credibility as a leading DeFi project. Beyond product development, Remittix is rewarding its growing community. A $250,000 giveaway campaign is active, while a referral program pays users 15% in USDT for every new buyer referred, instantly claimable every 24 hours. This early-stage crypto investment opportunity is also fully verified by CertiK, giving it unmatched security credentials. Why analysts are backing Remittix Remittix is solving real-world problems in global remittances, targeting a trillion-dollar payments market. The project has raised over $26.7 million already, proving strong investor demand. Referral rewards of 15% in USDT make it a community-driven growth machine. Wallet beta is live with active community testing, showing real progress. CertiK verification and #1 ranking ensures unmatched trust and transparency. While Dogecoin’s community strength and history as a pioneer cannot be ignored, it faces challenges from bearish technical indicators and a lack of new utility. In contrast, Remittix combines practical use cases, strong funding, and early CEX support. For those asking which token could deliver 100x within six months, Dogecoin may still offer bursts of volatility-driven gains. However, Remittix stands out as the next 100x crypto because it combines utility with sustainable momentum.

Instead of relying on banks with strict rules, hidden fees, and slow processes, DeFi offers a parallel system that runs on transparent, permissionless technology — available to anyone, anywhere, 24/7. In this space, financial services are open-source and borderless. With just a crypto wallet, users can access countless ways to grow their assets without intermediaries. Among these, earning passive income has become one of the most attractive entry points for beginners. DeFi provides several well-established strategies for building passive income streams. Each comes with its own mix of rewards and risks: 1. Staking Staking is one of the simplest ways to earn in DeFi. By locking up cryptocurrency on proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum or Cardano, users help secure the blockchain. In return, they earn rewards — similar to earning interest in a savings account. For beginners, staking is often the first step into passive income: low-maintenance, relatively predictable, and widely supported. 2. Yield Farming Yield farming (or liquidity mining) is a more active strategy. Users provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap or SushiSwap. In return, they receive a share of transaction fees and sometimes bonus tokens from the platform. While yield farming can generate higher returns, it also comes with risks like impermanent loss and requires a better understanding of liquidity pools. 3. DeFi Lending Platforms like Aave and Compound allow users to lend their crypto assets to borrowers. The process is automated through smart contracts, and lenders earn interest on their deposits. For those who prefer a hands-off approach, DeFi lending can feel familiar — much like earning interest in traditional finance, but without banks in the middle. Zexpire Turns Volatility Into Opportunity While staking, farming, and lending remain popular, DeFi is evolving. New platforms are rethinking how crypto’s unique traits can be used to generate income. Zexpire is one such example. Crypto markets are famous for their volatility — prices swing wildly day to day, often leaving traders frustrated. Zexpire flips that challenge into an opportunity. Instead of betting on price direction, it introduces a 0DTE (zero days to expiry) options model in a simplified format. Each day, users make a single prediction on whether a cryptocurrency stays within a set range or it breaks out. Get it right, and you win. Get it wrong, and your loss is capped at the staked amount. There are no margin calls, no liquidation risks, and no leverage spirals. By reducing complex options strategies to a straightforward binary choice, Zexpire makes volatility itself the trade. What Zexpire Offers for Passive Income Seekers For those exploring DeFi income strategies, Zexpire introduces something different: Simplicity: No technical charts or complex pools to manage. Controlled risk: Losses are always capped, unlike leveraged trading. Built for crypto’s reality: Volatility is constant, and now it can be turned into an earning tool. Zexpire’s native token, $ZX, is the key to the platform’s features. At the moment, $ZX is available in an early access funding round which initially started at $0.003 and has achieved $0.009445 so far. Prices are stepping gradually to $0.025 before listing. The design rewards early participants with the lowest entry point, while later stages reflect growing demand. Gain Early Access to Zexpire at the Best Price Ways to Earn Passive Income in DeFi Method How It Works Pros Cons / Risks Staking Lock up tokens on PoS networks (e.g., Ethereum, Cardano) to secure the chain Simple, predictable rewards; beginner-friendly Lower returns compared to other DeFi strategies Yield Farming Provide liquidity on DEXs (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap) and earn fees + tokens High earning potential; supports DeFi markets Complex, risk of impermanent loss Lending Lend assets on platforms to earn interest Hands-off, steady income; familiar concept Returns depend on demand; smart contract risks Zexpire Make daily predictions on Bitcoin volatility via 0DTE options Simple format; capped risk; benefits from volatility Losses possible; depends on adoption and $ZX token value Final Thoughts DeFi is rich with opportunities to earn passive income — from straightforward staking to lending and yield farming. Each method has its own balance of complexity and reward. What makes Zexpire stand out is that it doesn’t just copy traditional finance models; it reframes crypto’s defining feature — volatility — as the opportunity itself. For beginners, it offers a simple way to engage with the market. For seasoned investors, it provides a tool to diversify beyond the usual DeFi strategies. In a world where markets never sleep, platforms like Zexpire hint at the next wave of innovation in how people can earn in crypto. For anyone exploring ways to earn in DeFi, holding $ZX may be the most leveraged way to capture that upside.

According to reports, the firm raised funds through a preferential stock offering to invest a bulk of the funds in cryptocurrencies, which is why the stock exchange barred its listing. In its statement, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) mentioned that “the policy on investment in virtual digital assets (VDAs) is under review and till a final view emerges, we would not be able to process the applications of this nature”. The company in question, Jetking Infotrain, engages in IT training. The firm had initially gotten an in-principle approval from the BSE on May 9, after the board passed a resolution on May 23 for allotment of more than 3.96 lakh shares, taking the total amount to Rs. 6 lakh (approximately $720,000). Bombay Stock Exchange rejects crypto-linked firm’s listing application In the documents filed with the BSE , based on which it received its initial clearance, its objectives were stated as providing education and skill development, general corporate purposes, and acquisition of VDAs. Most of the proceeds from the issue, which is around Rs. 3.96 crore, representing about 60% were to be invested in buying VDAs. Jetking has crypto investments in its treasury book, a disclosure it made to the Registrar of Companies under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Indian firms are allowed to invest in VDAs, just as they use surplus funds in mutual funds, securities, and fixed deposits, but are required to disclose them. The BSE directives indicate that even though companies are allowed to take direct crypto exposure out of cash profits and internal accruals, authorities are still against listed companies raising funds to invest in digital assets . “We had processed the application in the normal course as per extant norms. Final approval was kept on hold to take up the issue of fundraising for investment in VDA at the policy level with the Regulator. Subsequently, as per the revised norms, a decision was taken to reject the application,” a Bombay Stock Exchange spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Siddharth Bharwani, joint MD and CFO of Jetking, mentioned that the company is currently looking into the whole situation and examining the possibility of approaching the Securities Appellate Tribunal. “It has been five years since the Supreme Court said that cryptos were not illegal but require regulations,” Bharwani added. Once shares are already allocated and proceeds have been deployed, refunding investors and extinguishing stock can be a very complicated process. Crypto regulation remains a grey area in India The current stance of the Bombay Stock Exchange regarding VDA treasuring entities would force most companies in the country to halt their plans to launch the same product. Until this verdict, there has been optimism that most companies plan to follow in the footsteps of large Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy in the United States and Metaplanet in Japan. Presently, the primary purpose of these companies is to hold Bitcoin and other digital assets in their balance sheet. However, all these appear to be a far cry in India, as digital assets are not seen as securities nor neither are they seen as currency, but are considered as intangible assets. Under the circumstances, dealing in digital assets cannot be considered financial services as offered by non-banking financial companies. Also, if the shareholders in a digital asset treasury company are domestic, such entities may not have to deal with issues relating to foreign direct or portfolio investments and the Foreign Exchange Management Act. “There’s an increasingly urgent need for clearer classification of virtual digital assets under various existing laws. An approach of express regulatory guidance would be preferred to policy uncertainty,” said Jaideep Reddy, partner at Trilegal. Like the stance of the Bombay Stock Exchange, banks are also caught in a similar ambiguity. While some businessmen have been able to invest in US crypto ETFs through the RBI’s liberalized remittance scheme, local banks are still divided on categorizing the investments when handling the funds transfer.

Although most altcoins have failed to produce impressive increases since yesterday, MYX and XPL have emerged as top performers. BTC Stopped at $110K Recall that the primary cryptocurrency shot up to $118,000 last Thursday after the US Fed pivoted from its 2025 monetary policy and finally reduced the key interest rates. However, that rally was short-lived and BTC quickly returned to $115,000-$116,000 for the weekend. The actual correction, though, was yet to take place . At first, bitcoin slumped by over five grand on Monday and dropped to $112,000. Following another brief recovery attempt, the bears continued to put pressure on the asset at the end of the week. The culmination, at least for now, occurred on Friday morning when BTC dumped below $109,000 for the first time since the start of the month. It bounced off in the evening trading session and even exceeded $110,000, but it was quickly stopped there and now trades well below that line. Its market cap has dropped further to $2.175 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins stands tall at 56.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XPL Rockets Most altcoins were obliterated during the market-wide crash, and ETH was among the poorest performers. The second-largest crypto asset went from roughly $4,500 to a multi-month low of under $3,900. It recovered some ground and briefly jumped above $4,000 yesterday, but it sits below it now. On a daily scale, most larger-cap alts are slightly in the green but in a modest manner. More impressive daily gains come from IP, which has rocketed by 14%, WLFI (5%), MNT (5%), and WLD (4%). The recently launched Plasma (XPL) has gained the most today (22%), followed by MYX’s 18% surge. The total crypto market cap remains sluggish at $3.850 trillion after losing over $300 billion in a week. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

However, though Solana’s strength persists to amaze, increasingly more investors are focusing their attention on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a low-cost DeFi project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trading at just $0.035 in presale phase 6. Stage 6 itself is already 50% sold out. Over $16.4 million has been raised by the project, and over 16,600 investors have been attracted. As its DeFi ecosystem is in its infancy and building steam, and as its low entry price is attracting notice, MUTM is being touted as a potential successor to Solana’s success. As SOL languishes to gain momentum, smart money is increasingly considering MUTM as the project with significantly greater long-term upside. Solana Builds Strength Above $210 as Bulls Eye $320 Breakout Solana (SOL) continues to display robust bullish momentum, prolonging the upward trend that began in April. After breaching the significant $210 resistance, this level has now become a strong support zone, serving as a key pivot in the recovery of the asset from previous corrections. The price is currently consolidating in the 0.618 to 0.786 Fibonacci retracement zone, an area that is typically associated with accumulation before a big move to the upside. The setup for Solana suggests the potential for a violent breakout towards the next major resistance level at $320, supported by rising trading volumes and positive investor sentiment, technical analyst Ali said. This strong technical foundation suggests that SOL can outperform most altcoins in the coming months as bullish momentum continues to build. As SOL looks for momentum, another crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting bigger attention. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring in the sixth presale round with a new record of investor demand and milestone targets. Having over 16,600 registered investors and over $16.4 million raised, the project is shattering all records, clear signs of increasing confidence in its vision and future prospects. Being at a stage where it is possible to enjoy ginormous long-term gains is certain as the ecosystem expands. As a gesture of gratitude to early adopters, the project has launched a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 supporters will be awarded $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance will be one of the most promising ETH-based DeFi projects to watch in 2025 as it remains committed to its growth goal. Benchmark for Security Features In order to secure the platform, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch an official bug bounty program with a minimum guaranteed award pool value of $50,000. There will be four grading tiers available to reward discovered vulnerabilities: critical, major, minor, and low. It will offer end-to-end security and protection. Mutuum Finance stability is loan-to-value and liquidation value based on dynamically calculated collateral volatility base. It also has a reserve multiplier system 10% buffer to the best as high as 35% for risky collateral. It is highly accurate mechanism without any loss of transparency, therefore stable but sound platform. This Presale Could Outpace Solana’s Next Rally Solana’s steady hold above the $210 support shows that its bullish structure remains intact, and a breakout to $320 should be imminent. However, as investors continue to watch out for the next best thing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as a coin to reckon with. Already, more than $16.4 million has been raised from more than 16,600 investors, and Stage 6 of the presale is already 50% sold, a sign of gathering demand. Early access to a high-upside potential is something that investors cannot afford to miss, and they must act now and invest in the Mutuum Finance presale before it is completely sold out.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-xrp-is-about-to-go-crazy-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has shared an in-depth perspective on XRP, emphasizing both on-chain metrics and technical patterns that could shape its next market move. In a recent video , the analyst reviewed the short-term holder net unrealized profit and loss ratio, describing it as a critical indicator for assessing market positioning. According to the explanation, this metric highlights phases of capitulation when the line turns red and reflects optimism phases, such as belief, denial, and euphoria, when the line shifts into green or blue zones. Presently, the indicator is in the orange zone, with short-term holders approaching capitulation. The analyst noted that historically, the orange and red phases have often provided strong entry points. For instance, in December, when the line shifted into green, XRP reached a local top before undergoing a correction. Conversely, in June and November, when the metric turned red, it coincided with price floors, with XRP rebounding significantly in subsequent weeks. According to Steph Is Crypto, this history suggests that a further dip in the short term could mark an important opportunity. #XRP IS ABOUT TO GO CRAZY!!!! pic.twitter.com/SLHQCshWXy — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 25, 2025 Technical Patterns and Breakout Levels The analyst then turned to XRP’s chart on the two-day timeframe, focusing on the price action within a falling wedge or bull flag structure. Price movements are currently compressing between downward-sloping resistance and support lines, with the asset attempting to break out. The commentary indicated that a confirmed breakout would require a daily close above the $3 level, which would signal a shift in momentum and strengthen the bullish case. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On a broader scale, XRP’s previous resistance is now acting as new support, a development described as encouraging for long-term structure. The analyst pointed out that XRP has shown a repeating pattern of rallies followed by compression phases, a sequence that has continued to support the broader uptrend. Based on this observation, the expectation is that another rally could follow in line with the established structure. Price Targets and Risk-Reward Balance Looking ahead, the analyst maintained key price targets for XRP, with $3.65 as an immediate objective, followed by the $4 and $4.55 ranges. The risk-reward profile was presented as favorable, with limited downside so long as the weekly price does not close below $2.70. A move beneath that level would weaken the structure, but the analyst emphasized that current conditions leave more room for upside than downside. Steph Is Crypto underscored that both the net unrealized profit and loss ratio for short-term holders and the technical structure of XRP are aligning toward a potentially significant move . With historical patterns suggesting that capitulation zones have marked major lows, combined with the ongoing compression within a bullish chart pattern, the outlook remains optimistic. XRP’s ability to secure a daily close above $3 is seen as the critical confirmation point for the next phase of upward momentum.

Public relations (PR) plays a central role in how crypto projects build credibility, attract investors, and engage communities. Unlike in less regulated regions, European crypto PR requires a careful balance between compliance, trust-building, and creativity. This review highlights the key specifics of crypto PR in Europe and profiles some of the leading agencies shaping blockchain communications across the continent. Key Specifics of Crypto PR in Europe Regulation as a Defining Factor The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which took effect across the EU, has set a new standard for crypto communications. PR campaigns must comply with requirements that advertising be “fair, clear, and not misleading.” This means no exaggerated claims of returns, clear disclosure of risks, and alignment between marketing materials and official white papers. Regulatory oversight is not uniform across Europe, however. While MiCA harmonizes many rules, local authorities in countries like Germany and France still apply additional standards. PR agencies must adapt campaigns to each market while maintaining compliance across the EU. Trust Over Hype The European investor audience tends to be more risk-averse and regulation-conscious than in other regions. Years of scams and failed projects have heightened skepticism. As a result, PR in Europe emphasizes transparency, case studies, and educational content over flashy hype campaigns. The winning formula is credibility: aligning with licensed exchanges, highlighting audits, and showcasing real-world use cases. Multi-Market Complexity Europe is not a single homogenous market. A PR campaign in Germany will look different from one in Spain, and both will differ from the UK (no longer under EU law but still a critical crypto hub). Agencies must navigate different languages, media ecosystems, and cultural attitudes toward risk and innovation. Localized messaging, multi-lingual media outreach, and region-specific influencer partnerships are therefore central to successful campaigns. Media and Community Channels In Europe, PR campaigns are built on a two-pronged strategy: Crypto-native media: Outlets like Cointelegraph, CryptoSlate, and The Block are influential across the continent. Local business and tech media: Publications such as Handelsblatt (Germany), Les Echos (France), and Financial Times (UK) help reach institutional and mainstream audiences. Additionally, Telegram groups, Discord servers, and Twitter/X communities remain key arenas for shaping narratives. Top European Blockchain PR Agencies Several agencies stand out for their expertise in navigating Europe’s complex crypto environment. Here are some of the most notable: 1. Outset PR Outset PR is widely recognized for its precise, data-driven approach to crypto communications in Europe. Unlike agencies that rely on mass outreach or generic PR packages, Outset PR carefully curates media strategies to maximize visibility while minimizing wasted resources. Outset PR’s Key Strengths Include: Data-driven and regionally aware Outset PR constantly tracks shifts that affect crypto media performance, from regulatory changes like MiCA to Google algorithm updates and SEO trends. This analytical focus allows the agency to anticipate changes in visibility and adjust client strategies accordingly. Just recently, Outset PR published detailed media performance reports for both Western and Eastern Europe, giving projects clear insights into which outlets deliver the highest ROI. Regulatory sensitivity With the EU’s MiCA framework reshaping the industry, Outset PR places heavy emphasis on compliance-driven messaging. The team closely monitors how MiCA and national regulations influence local media outlets and advises clients on adapting their tone, adding proper disclaimers, and avoiding legal risks. This ensures campaigns remain both effective and regulator-proof in an environment of increasing scrutiny. Boutique-level approach Rather than pushing one-size-fits-all packages, Outset PR takes a personalized approach. Each campaign is tailored to the client’s unique objectives, budget, and stage of growth—whether a startup in presale or a mature exchange expanding its market presence. This boutique mindset gives clients the precision and flexibility of a small firm while delivering the reach of a larger agency. Together, these strengths make Outset PR a standout choice for blockchain projects seeking not only visibility but also strategic alignment with Europe’s complex regulatory and media landscape. 2. MarketAcross Based in Israel but operating widely in Europe, MarketAcross is one of the most recognized names in blockchain PR. The firm focuses on content marketing, influencer outreach, and media placements, often working with top-tier projects and exchanges. Its pan-European reach and long-standing experience make it a go-to for large-scale campaigns. 3. FINPR FINPR, with a strong European presence, is known for cost-efficient PR packages tailored to startups. The agency emphasizes fast execution, securing media coverage, and influencer-driven campaigns. It appeals especially to early-stage crypto projects looking for quick visibility in European markets. 4. Melrose PR Although US-based, Melrose PR has expanded into Europe and is respected for its focus on blockchain storytelling and thought leadership. It is particularly strong in brand positioning for DeFi and NFT projects and maintains close ties with crypto media globally. 5. Ctrl PR A newer but rapidly growing European PR agency, Ctrl PR emphasizes community engagement, regulatory-aware communications, and localized campaigns. They highlight growth metrics like increasing community participation by over 300% in specific blockchain projects, reflecting their results-driven approach. Top European Crypto PR Agencies Agency Key Strengths Regulatory Awareness Approach Regional Focus Outset PR Data-driven media selection, performance monitoring, in-depth reports on Western & Eastern Europe Strong: tracks MiCA, national rules, and their impact on media content & tone Boutique-level, personalized campaigns aligned with client objectives and budget Strong presence in Europe with region-specific insights MarketAcross Content marketing, influencer outreach, large-scale campaigns Moderate: adapts messaging to EU compliance but more growth-focused Broad/global, suited for projects seeking mass exposure Global, with operations across Europe FINPR Cost-efficient PR packages, fast media placements, influencer engagement Limited: focuses more on visibility than compliance Package-based, designed for startups with smaller budgets Europe + Asia, good for early-stage projects Melrose PR Storytelling, thought leadership, strong in DeFi & NFTs Moderate: adapts campaigns to regulatory tone but not specialized in compliance Narrative-driven, strong in positioning executives & projects US-rooted but active in Europe Ctrl PR Community engagement, localized campaigns Moderate: integrates compliance into messaging when required Results-driven, flexible, startup-friendly Europe-focused, with emphasis on local language campaigns Conclusion Crypto PR in Europe is defined by a unique blend of regulatory compliance, cultural diversity, and a demand for credibility. Agencies must navigate MiCA’s strict advertising rules while tailoring campaigns to diverse local markets and skeptical audiences. The top PR agencies in Europe—such as Outset PR, MarketAcross, FINPR, Melrose PR, and Ctrl PR—demonstrate that success in this region depends on more than media placements. It requires strategic storytelling, regulatory awareness, and authentic community building. For crypto and blockchain projects aiming to grow in Europe, choosing the right PR partner is not just about visibility—it’s about earning trust in one of the world’s most cautious yet influential markets.

According to authorities, the scammers targeted a Colorado native, scamming the unsuspecting victim out of his $1.4 million retirement savings. The victim, who remains anonymous, spoke to the media on the condition that he appears in silhouette with his voice disguised to protect his identity. According to the man, the CBI has said they will continue to investigate the case, hoping that they come across a big lead that will blow everything open. Crypto romance scam cases have been on the rise in the past year, with numerous elderly people falling prey. While some appear as pig-butchering scams, others are just outright scams, authorities noted. Colorado native loses $1.4 million to romance scammers In his statement , the victim noted that his travails began when he started having marital issues and joined a dating website. He noted that after several connections, he connected with a particular person who turned their conversation from love and romance to financials. The victim mentioned that this person said they could help him invest in several digital assets. He noted that he trusted the person because he felt they were romantically involved. The victim mentioned that though they never met at any point during their conversations, they did have conversations on FaceTime. The woman said her name was Erin, with investigators noting that it might be a fake screen name adopted by scammers in the past. The victim said it all started with him sending funds to several legitimate cryptocurrency applications. Later, he was asked to send funds to a fake application controlled by the scammer. In total, he lost $1.4 million. “If it’s too good to be true, it’s not true,” the victim said. According to CBI Special Agent Zeb Semester, this was the largest amount of money he had ever witnessed stolen in a crypto scam. “The largest amounts of losses that we see are in these crypto cases, like that, with investment scams,” Smeester said. He also added that these cases are not difficult to investigate, but law enforcement often takes a different view of them because the criminals are always overseas. Experts blame the unregulated crypto industry The CBI Special Agent noted that instead of trying to apprehend the scammers, they focus on retrieving the stolen funds. “We’re not going after the perpetrators because most of them are going to be overseas. And it’s extremely hard to narrow down who those people are,” he said. In a report by the Better Business Bureau’s 2024 Scam Tracker, investment scams, including those that involve digital assets, are the riskiest out there. The group claims that romance scams currently rank third on the list, but according to BBB Director of Foundation Meghan Conradt, romance scams and crypto investment scams often come hand in hand. “Unfortunately, this is something we at the Better Business Bureau see a lot of. And it’s actually been increasing over the last couple of years,” Conradt said. Semester listed some of the red flags that people need to watch out for so they don’t fall prey to these romance scammers and lose their funds. Conradt stated the reason why crypto scams are common is that the industry is quite new and unregulated. She mentioned that it doesn’t offer the same protections that victims will enjoy in traditional institutions if they can provide a dispute. “It’s something people aren’t really educated about and don’t know a whole lot about,” she said. “It’s a little bit like the Wild West out there. And the value of it can swing dramatically every day. It could be worth hundreds of thousands one day and worth just a few dollars the next day.” Get seen where it counts.

Solana followed a similar trajectory, suffering a colossal 16.4% dump within the same time frame. Despite this tumble, analysts suggest a price recovery could happen soon, reinforcing a bullish posture for Solana price prediction in October. The recent market crash has been cruel to most alts; not all. Remittix is a new crypto standing strong amid the brutal wipeout that was triggered by fading FOMC euphoria. Retail interest in this project is still aggressive; on-chain data confirms an aggregate of $26.7 million worth of RTX has been purchased to date. Let’s consider Solana price predictions, and after that, we will take a look at why Remittix is withstanding the bearish headwinds. Solana Price Prediction: Bulls Must Overcome Key Resistance Levels To Reignite Bullish Momentum Last week, Solana experienced a resurgence from July lows around $160 to $235, bolstered by Kyle Samani’s Multicoin-led $1.65 billion treasury vehicle specifically for SOL accumulation. But despite the retail accumulation that followed, tides have quickly moved in favor of sellers who sent the asset below the $200 psychological level for the first time since early September. At report time, Solana buys and sells at $199.07, representing a 16.4% week-long decline. Many natives are getting worried about whether there will be a near-term recovery. Analysts suggest that Solana price prediction in the near-term depends on whether buyers overcome resistance zones while holding strong support levels. If buyers can break past the $210 support level over the weekend, bullish momentum could be reignited sooner than anticipated. Analysts still maintain that a successful reclaim of the $250 zone next month could trigger another push toward all-time highs later this year. Why Remittix is Defying the Market Crash Remittix has been one of the few alts holding strong amid the $1.6 billion wipeout across the alt market. This project has seen an exponential growth in retail and investor attention, which has, in turn, helped it withstand the bearish headwinds currently blowing across the market. At report time, RTX tokens are priced at $0.1130, and retail buys now total a whopping $26.7M. This resilience is largely due to Remittix’s real-world utility and other bullish catalysts. Certification by CertiK: Confidence in the project has been strengthened by a thorough CertiK audit, verifying both the team and infrastructure. This helped Remittix rank as the no. 1 presale token this cycle, boosting trust among retail. 15% Referral Bonus: Its referral program has been a game-changer. Early adopters are earning 15% in USDT instantly claimable every 24 hours. For experts, RTX represents a pivotal bridge for DeFi adoption, enabling real-world utility, faster settlement times, and liquidity, unlocking billions in value by connecting crypto utility directly to TradFi.

Key Takeaways: Kraken is seeking $200–$300 million in new funding, potentially raising its valuation to $20 billion ahead of a 2026 IPO. The exchange is expanding aggressively, with acquisitions, new leadership, and over $1.5 billion in 2024 revenue. Kraken is stepping up its political involvement, pledging $2 million to pro-crypto PACs supporting industry-aligned candidates. The funding, while not yet finalized, follows a separate $500 million round quietly completed at a $15 billion valuation, as reported by Fortune. The capital raise signals Kraken’s push to position itself among the top-tier crypto firms preparing to go public. Kraken Targets 2026 IPO Amid Expansion Plans The San Francisco-based exchange, one of the largest in the US by volume, is aiming for an IPO as early as 2026. Bloomberg noted that Kraken is working with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group to lead the offering. Kraken has also been aggressively expanding. In March, it announced plans to acquire derivatives platform NinjaTrader in a $1.5 billion deal. The firm restructured in late 2024, appointing Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi as co-CEO, and began publishing financials, revealing $1.5 billion in revenue for 2024 and $472 million in Q1 2025. JUST IN: #Bitcoin and crypto exchange Kraken raises $500 million at a $15 billion valuation. We are going mainstream pic.twitter.com/cUZ6CbLrCd — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 26, 2025 This week, Kraken also pledged $2 million to pro-Trump crypto political action committees (PACs) in 2025, indicating the growing influence of digital asset firms in Washington. In a post on X, Co-CEO of Kraken Arjun Sethi noted that the exchange will donate $1 million to the Digital Freedom Fund (DFF) and another $1 million to venture firm Andreessen Horowitz’s advocacy initiative, the America First Digital (AFD). The decision, he said, reflects a broader strategy by crypto companies to shape regulatory frameworks and support candidates who back industry growth. Notably, Kraken’s latest pledge adds to its earlier contributions to political action committees. In January 2024, its parent company, Payward Inc., donated $750,000 to Fairshake PAC . Crypto IPOs Gain Momentum Last week, BitGo officially filed for an initial public offering , becoming the first dedicated crypto custodian to pursue a listing on a US stock exchange. BitGo’s IPO filing came amid renewed momentum for crypto-related public offerings. The digital asset space has seen several notable public listings in 2025. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, surging more than sevenfold since going public. Online trading platform Etoro , which offers crypto trading among its services, debuted in May. In addition, Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, moved its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to Nasdaq earlier this year. Gemini, the exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO in June, signaling strong market confidence in crypto exchanges going public. More recently, Figure Technology Solutions Inc., a blockchain-focused lending platform, raised $787.5 million in its initial public offering . The San Francisco-based company, alongside key backers including Ribbit Capital, sold 31.5 million shares at $25 apiece, valuing the firm at roughly $5.3 billion. Originally targeting a lower range, Figure increased both the share count and price just days before the listing, signaling strong investor demand.

52333050,https://cryptonews.com/?p=429482,1758966407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52333050.jpeg,Novogratz: Dovish Fed Chair Nominee Could Trigger Major Bitcoin Rally,https://cryptonews.com/news/novogratz-dovish-fed-chair-nominee-could-trigger-major-bitcoin-rally/,"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could stage a sharp rally if the next US Federal Reserve chair turns out to be a monetary dove. Key Takeaways: Mike Novogratz says a dovish Fed chair nominee could be the “biggest bull catalyst” for Bitcoin, potentially pushing prices toward $200K. He warned that such a pivot would come at the cost of U.S. financial stability but could trigger explosive crypto gains. Market reaction may remain muted until an official nomination is made, though analysts say the dollar faces downside risks. Speaking during a YouTube interview with crypto investor Kyle Chasse , Novogratz pointed to the potential nomination of a pro-easing candidate to replace Jerome Powell as a pivotal moment for digital assets. “That’s the potential biggest bull catalyst for Bitcoin and the rest of crypto,” Novogratz said. Dovish Pivot Could Spark Sharp Crypto Rally, Novogratz Says He added that a dovish pivot, particularly if it involves aggressive rate cuts, could lead to a dramatic run-up in prices. “Can Bitcoin get to $200K? Of course it could,” he said, suggesting such a scenario could spark a “blow-off top” moment in the market. The Fed’s current chair, Jerome Powell, is set to complete his term in May 2026. According to reports, former President Donald Trump is considering candidates like Kevin Hassett, Christopher Waller, and Kevin Warsh to replace him, each carrying different views on monetary policy. Waller, for instance, advocated for rate cuts as early as July this year. Novogratz stressed, however, that such a scenario would come with consequences. “It would be really shitty for America,” he said, warning that Fed independence could be at risk. Still, the short-term impact on Bitcoin could be explosive. “Gold skyrockets… Bitcoin skyrockets,” he predicted, should a hyper-dovish nominee be confirmed. The conversation echoed broader concerns raised by market watchers. Daleep Singh, vice chair at PGIM Fixed Income, recently said that the makeup of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) could change significantly post-2026. Singh also flagged risks to the dollar, noting that the balance of risks was “skewed to the downside.” Market reaction, according to Novogratz, may remain muted until such a nomination becomes official. “I don’t think the market will buy that Trump’s going to do the crazy, until he does the crazy,” he said. The Fed’s first rate cut of the cycle, 25 basis points in September, was largely expected. However, if the next chair accelerates that trajectory, it could realign investor flows toward crypto. As Novogratz put it, “It becomes a whole new conversation if that happens.” Hex Trust CEO: US Banks Will Soon Offer Bitcoin Services Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini believes US banks are on the verge of mainstreaming Bitcoin , pending regulatory clarity. He predicts that within months, most American banks will offer custody, trading, and deposit services for Bitcoin, calling U.S. regulation the “global benchmark” for institutional adoption. Founded in 2018, Hex Trust provides crypto custody, trading, lending, and staking services to institutions across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. With over 200 employees and a million end users via B2B deals, the firm is targeting $20 million in revenue by 2025 and considering a future IPO. Quaglini also sees stablecoins as a disruptive force, potentially replacing the SWIFT system for cross-border payments. Unlike US-listed crypto companies that rely on retail trading, Hex Trust’s strategy focuses on providing infrastructure for institutions and avoiding direct exposure to crypto market volatility.

On one side, there is a surge of optimistic investments; on the other, regulatory uncertainties loom large. This balancing act has left traders in a state of suspense, eagerly awaiting clear direction. Traders watch the charts for technical signals, just as Outset PR monitors the performance of media outlets through data-driven analytics to ensure campaigns align with market dynamics. By applying the same precision that investors bring to liquidity and resistance levels, Outset PR identifies where stories will achieve the strongest impact. Ethereum Eyes New Heights After Recent Setback Source: tradingview Ethereum currently trades between $4360 and $4607. It's trying to shake off a recent drop. The price fell over 14% in the last week, echoing the past month. Still, the six-month gain of over 115% shows its strong growth potential. The next hurdle for ETH is at $4764. If it leaps over that, it might aim for the $5011 mark. Hitting these targets would mean a roughly 11% to 16% jump from its current range. The current support levels suggest a good safety net, but the market remains uncertain. The mood is cautiously optimistic as traders eye these key levels. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Conclusion Ethereum’s position highlights the tension between optimism and caution that defines today’s crypto market. Whether ETH breaks above $5,000 or consolidates further, the outcome will depend on how inflows and regulation balance out. Similarly, in communications, success lies in reading the signals and placing narratives where they resonate most. Outset PR’s use of proprietary analytics and syndication strategies mirrors the trader’s toolkit, turning raw data into actionable insights. As investors await clarity, the parallel is clear: those who understand how to navigate both market and media landscapes are best positioned for long-term gains.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, and few assets capture the imagination quite like Cardano. With its ambitious roadmap and scientific approach to blockchain development, ADA has garnered a significant following. But the burning question on every investor’s mind is: what does the future hold? Specifically, will ADA’s price truly hit the coveted $2 mark in the coming years? Our comprehensive Cardano Price Prediction dives deep into the potential trajectories for 2025, 2026, and all the way to 2030, offering insights into the factors that could drive its growth and the challenges it might face. Understanding Cardano’s Core: A Foundation for Growth Before we delve into price forecasts, it’s crucial to understand what makes Cardano unique. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Cardano was built on a peer-reviewed research foundation, emphasizing security, scalability, and sustainability. It operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, which is significantly more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work systems. Scientific Approach: Every development phase, from Shelley to Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire, is meticulously researched and peer-reviewed. Scalability & Sustainability: Designed to handle a large number of transactions efficiently and to evolve without sacrificing decentralization. Interoperability: Aims to allow different blockchains to communicate seamlessly, a crucial feature for the future of the decentralized web. This robust foundation is what underpins the long-term optimism surrounding Cardano ADA price . Its methodical development process, though sometimes slower, aims to create a highly resilient and future-proof blockchain ecosystem. A Look Back: ADA’s Journey So Far Cardano has seen its share of dramatic price swings since its launch. From its initial coin offering (ICO) to its all-time high above $3 during the 2021 bull run, ADA has proven its potential for significant gains. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it has also experienced steep corrections, reflecting the volatile nature of the market. These cycles are important to consider when making an ADA Price Forecast . Historically, ADA’s price movements have often correlated with major network upgrades and broader market sentiment. For instance, the rollout of smart contract capabilities with the Alonzo hard fork generated immense excitement and contributed to its peak valuation. Understanding these past trends provides context for future possibilities. Cardano Price Prediction 2025: What Will Drive ADA’s Ascent? The year 2025 is often seen as a pivotal point for many crypto assets, potentially aligning with the next major bull cycle. For Cardano, several key factors could converge to drive its price upward, making the ADA 2025 outlook particularly interesting. By 2025, Cardano is expected to have made significant strides in its development roadmap, particularly with the Basho and Voltaire eras. Basho focuses on scalability and interoperability, introducing sidechains and further optimizing the network’s performance. Voltaire, the final era, will bring full on-chain governance, empowering ADA holders with complete control over the network’s future direction. Key Drivers for ADA in 2025: Enhanced Scalability: Improved transaction speeds and lower fees will make Cardano more attractive for dApp developers and users. Robust Governance: The full implementation of Voltaire will foster a more decentralized and adaptable ecosystem, attracting more participants. Ecosystem Growth: A flourishing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT projects built on Cardano will increase demand for ADA. Institutional Interest: As regulatory clarity improves and Cardano’s stability is proven, institutional investors may allocate more capital, boosting liquidity and price. Considering these factors, many analysts project a strong rebound for ADA. While specific figures vary, a realistic range for ADA 2025 could see prices comfortably above their current levels, potentially testing previous all-time highs and laying the groundwork for further expansion. Navigating the Road to 2026 and Beyond: Challenges and Opportunities Looking further into 2026 and towards the end of the decade, the landscape becomes more complex. While the potential for growth remains strong, so do the challenges. A comprehensive ADA Price Forecast must account for both. Opportunities for Cardano: Real-World Utility: Cardano’s partnerships in sectors like education, supply chain, and digital identity could expand, driving adoption beyond speculative investment. Interoperability Solutions: As the blockchain space matures, Cardano’s focus on seamless communication between different networks will become increasingly valuable. Developer Community: A growing and engaged developer community will ensure continuous innovation and the creation of valuable applications. Challenges for Cardano: Competition: The blockchain space is highly competitive, with other Layer-1 protocols constantly innovating and vying for market share. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving global regulations could impact the broader crypto market, affecting ADA’s price. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic conditions, such as inflation or interest rate hikes, can influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. For 2026, while volatility will likely persist, the underlying strength of Cardano’s development and ecosystem growth could see it solidify its position among top cryptocurrencies. The path to higher valuations will depend on successful execution of its roadmap and broader market recovery. Will ADA Price Hit $2? A Deep Dive into the Target The question of whether ADA’s price will hit $2 is central to many long-term investment strategies. To reach this significant milestone, several conditions would likely need to be met. Firstly, the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization would need to see substantial growth, perhaps reaching multi-trillion-dollar valuations again. Cardano’s market share within this larger pie would also need to remain strong or even increase. Secondly, the utility of the Cardano network must expand dramatically. This means more users, more dApps, and more transactions flowing through the network, directly increasing demand for ADA. What it Takes for ADA to Reach $2: Mass Adoption of dApps: A vibrant ecosystem of popular decentralized applications on Cardano will drive utility. Increased Transaction Volume: Higher network activity signifies greater demand for ADA for fees and staking. Significant Staking Participation: A large portion of ADA locked in staking reduces circulating supply, creating upward price pressure. Positive Market Sentiment: A general bullish trend in the broader crypto market is often a prerequisite for major price rallies. Successful Governance Implementation: The Voltaire era’s successful rollout will instill confidence in Cardano’s future evolution. Considering Cardano’s historical performance and its ambitious roadmap, hitting $2 is certainly within the realm of possibility, especially during a strong bull market cycle. It would represent a significant recovery and a testament to the network’s growing utility and adoption. Cardano Price Prediction 2030: A Long-Term Vision Looking out to 2030, we enter the realm of long-term vision and profound market evolution. By this time, the blockchain industry will likely be far more integrated into global finance and everyday life. Cardano aims to be a leading player in this future, and our Cardano 2030 prediction reflects this potential. By 2030, Cardano is envisioned as a fully decentralized, self-sustaining ecosystem with a mature governance model. Its network should be highly scalable, interoperable with various blockchains, and host a diverse array of real-world applications. This long-term perspective suggests that if Cardano executes its vision effectively, its utility and value could be substantially higher than today. Factors Shaping Cardano’s Future Price by 2030: Global Blockchain Integration: Cardano’s role in a globally interconnected blockchain economy. Decentralized Identity Solutions: Potential for widespread adoption of Cardano-based digital identities. Cross-Chain Bridges: Seamless interaction with other major blockchains, increasing its reach and utility. Sustainable Development: Its eco-friendly PoS mechanism will be a significant advantage in a world increasingly focused on sustainability. A successful Cardano 2030 would see it as a fundamental layer of the internet of value, underpinning various industries and digital services. While predicting exact figures so far out is challenging, the potential for significant appreciation, potentially well beyond the $2 mark, is a compelling narrative for long-term holders. Expert Opinions and Analytical Models for Cardano Future Price When considering the Cardano Future Price , it’s helpful to look at various analytical approaches. Technical analysis examines past price charts and trading volumes to predict future movements. Fundamental analysis assesses the intrinsic value of the project, including its technology, team, partnerships, and adoption rates. On-chain metrics provide insights into network activity, such as transaction counts, active addresses, and staking rates. Many experts employ a combination of these methods. While some remain cautiously optimistic, others foresee substantial growth for Cardano, especially as its ecosystem matures and global blockchain adoption expands. The consensus often points to Cardano’s strong fundamentals and development approach as key drivers for its long-term potential. Actionable Insights for Potential ADA Investors Investing in cryptocurrencies, including ADA, comes with inherent risks. However, for those considering adding Cardano to their portfolio, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand Cardano’s technology, roadmap, and community before investing. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum, invest a fixed amount regularly to mitigate volatility. Stake Your ADA: Participate in network security and earn passive rewards by staking your ADA. This also reduces circulating supply. Stay Informed: Follow official Cardano news, development updates, and broader market trends. Long-Term Vision: Cardano is a long-term project. Price predictions for 2025, 2026, and 2030 suggest that patience may be key. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Challenges and Risks to Cardano’s Ambitious Vision While Cardano presents a compelling investment case, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks that could impact its future trajectory and the realization of our Cardano Price Prediction . Development Pace: Cardano’s scientific, peer-reviewed approach, while robust, can sometimes lead to slower development cycles compared to competitors. Delays in key upgrades could dampen investor enthusiasm. Competition: The Layer-1 blockchain space is fiercely competitive. Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades, along with strong contenders like Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot, constantly vie for developers and users. Decentralized Governance Hurdles: While Voltaire promises full decentralization, implementing effective on-chain governance for a global community of millions can be complex and prone to disagreements, potentially slowing decision-making. Market Volatility: The broader cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile. External economic shocks or significant regulatory changes could trigger market-wide downturns, impacting ADA’s price regardless of its fundamental strength. Adoption Rates: While the technology is impressive, widespread adoption by businesses and individuals for real-world use cases is the ultimate driver of value. If adoption lags, price growth may be limited. Addressing these challenges effectively will be paramount for Cardano to achieve its ambitious goals and fulfill the optimistic price predictions for 2025, 2026, and 2030.

AI’s Answers May Surprise the XRP Army,https://cryptopotato.com/is-ripples-bull-run-finished-ais-answers-may-surprise-the-xrp-army/,"TL;DR Ripple’s native token has joined the broader crypto market’s correction and dumped below a few crucial support levels in the past week. Being 25% away from its all-time high marked over two months ago, the question now arises whether XRP’s run has concluded and it’s time to brace for a bear market. Here’s ChatGPT’s take on this. That’s All She Wrote? Before we dive into the AI’s detailed answer on this, let’s briefly recall XRP’s run that started last year after the US elections. At the time, it traded around $0.60 before it exploded beyond $1, $2, and eventually $3 in January. Speculations began about breaking its 2018 all-time high of $3.4, but XRP only managed to match it. What followed was a months-long correction that drove it south to under $2 at one point. However, it managed to reclaim that level and remained at around $2.2-$2.3 by the start of the summer. Then came what many anticipated to happen earlier this year, and a spectacular run in July drove XRP beyond its 2018 ATH to a new one of $3.65. After such a massive rally, the asset corrected and slipped below $3 on several occasions in the next couple of months. In fact, it has tested the $2.70 support four times since then, but that level has remained intact. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Being 25% away from its peak marked in July means that this is a pivotal point as analysts debate whether it’s a regular correction or the start of a full-on bear market. ChatGPT admitted that such retracements are “common even during strong bull markets.” It reminded that XRP, alongside most other larger-cap alts and BTC, has experienced similar or even worse pullbacks in previous cycles before “setting fresh highs.” As such, it determined that the bull run is “not necessarily over,” since one painful correction “doesn’t kill a cycle.” However, it warned that there are certain factors that need to improve for XRP to resume its rally. The Factors From a technical standpoint, the AI chatbot noted that the XRP Army shouldn’t be too concerned as long as the asset remains above the crucial $2.70 support. Nevertheless, a “decisive break below that level might signal a deeper cooling phase.” Additionally, it argued that on-chain activity should at least remain at the current level. It also mentioned some macro factors, such as the Federal Reserve’s policy, which could impact XRP and other riskier assets. Jerome Powell’s warning about inflation in the US over the past week is considered arguably the biggest reason behind the crypto market’s pullback. Lastly, ChatGPT indicated that if the US SEC finally greenlights all spot XRP ETF applications, which are more than a dozen, it could impact the underlying asset’s price positively, especially if the inflows are significant.

If key support levels give way, analysts warn the price could retreat sharply, with $60,000 emerging as the critical long-term line in the sand. Onchain Levels Traders Are Watching The first major support sits near $111,400, where many recent buyers entered the market. Holding above this level keeps their positions in profit and confidence intact. A sustained drop below it, however, could trigger renewed selling pressure. A broader demand zone lies between $104,000 and $108,000. This is where large volumes of Bitcoin changed hands, forming what analysts call a “make or break” region. If Bitcoin stays above this band, recovery attempts remain on the table. A clean break lower, by contrast, would leave the door open to deeper declines — with $102,800, $105,200, and $107,300 marking short-term supports before $60,000 comes back into focus. Key short-term support: $107,300 Critical zone: $104,000–$108,000 Long-term floor: $60,000 Macro and Institutional Drivers Market sentiment has also been shaped by macro signals. Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently emphasized that the central bank won’t rush into rate cuts, keeping investors cautious. His comments dampened appetite for risk assets, dragging Bitcoin back under $110,000. Bitcoin has dipped below $113,000 following the Fed’s “risk-management” rate cut, which suggested further easing depends heavily on economic data. Traders had priced in aggressive cuts; mixed inflation and labor data are now causing uncertainty and profit-taking. pic.twitter.com/Ihnh7Dc7zP — Cryptic (@Cryptic_Web3) September 23, 2025 At the same time, BlackRock provided a counterweight. The asset manager purchased over 700 BTC (worth about $77 million) via Coinbase Prime, even as traders braced for volatility tied to the expiry of $17 billion in Bitcoin options. The move underlined institutional conviction despite retail hesitation. BREAKING: BLACKROCK JUST BOUGHT $79.7M IN BITCOIN. pic.twitter.com/e2aTBBK3WI — Conor Kenny (@conorfkenny) September 26, 2025 BlackRock is also pushing new products. Alongside its $87 billion IBIT, the firm has filed for a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, designed to generate yield through covered call strategies. Analysts view this as a step to attract income-seeking investors and strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term case. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Bears Still in Control From a charting perspective, Bitcoin remains trapped under a descending trendline from mid-September. The 50- and 100-period SMAs around $113,000–$113,500 are reinforcing resistance, highlighting a bearish crossover zone. Recent candlestick activity reflects indecision. A cluster of small-bodied candles shows failed recovery attempts, while last week’s sequence of red candles resembled a “three black crows” pattern — a bearish continuation signal. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is weak but not yet exhausted. The RSI sits at 33, just above oversold, offering no sign of bullish divergence. For traders, the setup favors shorts while Bitcoin stays under $113,000. Short entry zone: $110,000–$110,400 Stop-loss: above $112,500 Targets: $107,300 and $105,200 For new traders, think of Bitcoin as moving down a staircase. Each failed bounce makes the next step lower more likely. Unless the coin decisively reclaims $113,000, sellers retain the upper hand.

Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is now trading between roughly 85.5 to 93 cents, offering hope after recent drops. If ADA breaks through its first resistance at about 98 cents, it could reach over a dollar, nearing the second resistance level. This would mark a rise of over 15% from its lowest recent point. The steady climb in the last six months, with a 15% increase, shows potential strength. Yet, there's a struggle given its 16% drop in the past week. If it falls, the first safety net lies at almost 81 cents. The RSI score sits below neutral, indicating some room for growth. Keep an eye on market moves that might push ADA forward or hold it back. TRON (TRX) Shows Promise Despite Recent Dips Source: tradingview TRON (TRX) is currently priced between around 34 to 35 cents. It's facing a bit of a challenge to move past 36 cents, with a support level sitting at roughly 33 cents. The coin has slightly dipped over the past week and month by nearly 5%, but it has surged over 44% in the last six months. This past performance hints at good long-term potential. If TRON breaks the 37-cent resistance, it might target around 13% growth to potentially reach the next key level. With a balanced momentum, TRON could catch attention if current supports hold and resistance levels are crossed. Conclusion AVAX, ADA, and TRX each display resilience despite recent setbacks, with technicals suggesting room for recovery if key resistance levels are crossed. Yet their performance, like the broader market, remains shaped by liquidity and regulatory narratives. Outset PR applies a similar discipline in communications — evaluating performance data, recognizing momentum early, and tailoring strategies to unlock maximum visibility. Whether in trading or storytelling, success comes from knowing when conditions align for a breakout.

As one of the best-performing blockchain networks, Solana remains in focus for developers and institutional investors alike, and as such, it is a must-have participant in the 2025 crypto cycle. As well as the stability of Solana, PayFi altcoins are now gaining prominence, with Remittix (RTX) being one such project which many investors are eager to track. At retail of $0.1130 per token, Remittix is gaining momentum for its novel way of handling crypto-to-fiat settlements as well as its continually increasing presale success. Solana price stability and market momentum Solana’s price action continues to attract attention as the latest volumes in recent periods surged to $11.3 billion, representing a 26.71% daily increase. Its total market capitalization is currently at $106.82 billion, cementing Solana’s position as one of the biggest cryptocurrencies. The Solana price remaining above $190 indicates strong institutional investor and retail investor backing. Given the blockchain’s history of fast transaction times, cheap gas prices, and scalable infrastructure, this persistence is noteworthy. Despite continuous competition from other Layer-1 blockchains, adoption on the Solana network is unabated with the basics intact. Remittix: the PayFi project gaining momentum As Solana holds its ground in the market, emerging projects such as Remittix are making their own way in the DeFi and PayFi landscape. Developed to connect crypto with mainstream finance, Remittix facilitates real crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. Far from just another presale project, it’s made for practical adoption. At its current presale stage, Remittix has managed to raise over $26.7 million and sell more than 672 million tokens. Importantly, the project has announced future listings on BitMart and LBank, expected to provide liquidity and disperse exposure. The Remittix wallet is also live in beta testing, demonstrating progress towards its real-world use. Main reasons Remittix is gaining popularity: Utilization: Instant crypto-to-fiat transfers Ranked #1 pre-launch token as confirmed by CertiK Raised more than $26.7Million in presale $250,000 giveaway to encourage participation in community Security and resilience of ecosystem Security is a keystone of successful crypto projects, and Remittix has already moved in this direction. The project is completely audited by CertiK and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens on the CertiK Skynet leaderboard. This ranking gives early investors confidence, confirming that the project has a foundation of trust, transparency, and good technical foundations. This recognition is timely as investors continue to seek crypto with real usage and strong backing. Combined with its upcoming listed centralized exchanges, Remittix is going to be one of the top-performing cryptos under $1 with real growth potential in 2025. The SolanapPrice remaining above $190 demonstrates the strength of the blockchain, but equally reinforces the increasing importance of projects that are driving real-world adoption. Remittix, currently at $0.1130, is quickly set to be one of the best presales of 2025, with its innovation in cross-border payments standing out.

BNB is bouncing back at $1,021 after a temporary fall to $984, while Chainlink (LINK) falls to $21.29, illustrating the weakness of some of the leading assets. In this mixed landscape, the focus is on a new challenger: Digitap . Its presale is breaking records, and experts predict potential returns of as much as 20 times its initial price. The crypto market thus shows two opposing faces: on the one hand, the big-cap assets are flailing; on the other, cutting-edge projects such as Digitap are in the spotlight. Digitap: The Revolutionary Omni-Bank Digitap is not just another token. It is an omni-bank, a one-stop hub that combines the benefits of decentralized finance with traditional banking services. Users can manage their digital assets and fiat currencies in one place, make fast payments with a No-KYC card, and maintain their privacy. As laws get more restrictive, this project attracts more investors who cherish their financial freedom. The $TAP presale already raised more than $200,000, reflecting robust market hype. Several analysts believe that this early momentum can lead to a price blast once the token is listed. This makes Digitap one of the most promising projects around. For Info about $TAP, visit Digitap.app Presale or Join the Community BNB Above $1,000: A Bullish Signal to Watch After several failed attempts to break the $1,000 resistance, BNB has finally crossed this psychological barrier. Buyers seem to be regaining control and are pushing the price up to $1,021 . Trading volumes are rising slightly, signaling renewed interest from traders. However, the situation is still fragile. A drop below $1,000 could reignite selling pressure and push the price back toward $984 or even $950, which are levels that recently served as support. For short-term investors, the market rebound is both an opportunity and a challenge. BNB’s ability to remain above $1,000 in the coming days will determine whether it is indeed on a bullish reversal path. Chainlink Down to $21.29: A Sign of Weakness The situation for Chainlink is more concerning. After several days of stagnation around $23, the price has fallen to $21.29 , a drop of over 7% in a short time. This decline shows a loss of momentum and a lack of immediate buyer interest. Although LINK is an essential component of DeFi due to its oracles, investors appear to be shifting away from this asset to other projects with better short-term potential. Some analysts consider this an opportunity for those who believe the broader market will eventually recover. If risk appetite were to return, LINK would become appealing once more and reclaim higher levels. Why $TAP Is on Analysts’ Radar Enthusiasm for Digitap is on the rise. Optimists forecast gains of up to 20 times the presale price. This is facilitated by the following facts: clear tokenomics with a limited supply, built-in deflationary mechanisms, real user utility, and timely market positioning in line with current demand for new growth engines. While BNB and LINK struggle to attract new capital, Digitap emerges as an innovative alternative that could trigger a new bullish cycle. The emphasis on ease of use and financial independence also creates a strong appeal to investors. Altcoins to Watch Now: BNB, LINK, TAP The present market dynamic exposes two opposing facts: BNB is regaining energy over $1,000, whereas LINK keeps slumping and searches for strong support to slow the drop. Between these two extremes, Digitap is enthralling analysts with an energetic presale and expansion possibilities. For investors, the message is clear: BNB may offer a continuation opportunity if the $1,000 level holds, LINK represents a more speculative bet awaiting a reversal signal, and Digitap remains the most exciting candidate for those looking to get in early on a high-potential project before its official listing.

Analysts point to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the emerging frontrunner, offering strong fundamentals, a structured tokenomics model, and tangible utility that position it as a prime candidate for exponential long-term growth. While conventional crypto coins have dominated headlines for years, the shift toward functional DeFi protocols shows that investors are prioritizing assets with predictable revenue, controlled risk, and the ability to scale efficiently. MUTM, currently available at $0.035, is drawing attention from retail and institutional players seeking early exposure before its next phase increases the price by 15%, underscoring its high-upside potential. Dual Lending Mechanics and Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its dual lending model, designed to accommodate a wide spectrum of investors and borrowers. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools allow stablecoins and bluechip tokens to generate predictable returns, while the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending framework supports higher-risk or less-liquid tokens, enabling flexibility without compromising security. Borrowers will benefit from stable-rate loans with an initial rate lock and calibrated higher starting rates, ensuring predictability in repayment costs. The platform also enforces overcollateralization, liquidation triggers, and reserve factors, providing strong risk management that appeals to institutions seeking sustainable exposure. Phase 6 of MUTM’s presale has already raised $16.4 million, with half of the 170 million token allocation sold. Current holders number over 16,600, reflecting growing confidence in the token’s long-term prospects. The presale’s progression builds FOMO among investors, particularly as the next phase increases the token price by 15% to $0.040. Comparing early-phase participants to new buyers illustrates the strong compounding potential inherent in MUTM’s presale structure, giving investors a clear framework for wealth creation. Mechanisms Supporting Long-Term 100X Growth and Price Appreciation Several protocol features create a robust foundation for ongoing demand and token appreciation. MUTM’s buy-and-distribute mechanism repurchases tokens from the open market using revenue from lending and borrowing, rewarding mtToken stakers and sustaining continuous buy pressure. This effect ensures that as platform adoption grows, token demand remains high. The upcoming beta launch will provide users early access to lending, borrowing, and stablecoin minting features, allowing firsthand experience of the platform’s utility. Layer-2 integration will enable faster and cheaper transactions, attracting more borrowers and lenders while increasing the total value locked (TVL). These improvements will allow MUTM to scale efficiently, supporting higher activity levels and consistent demand for the token. Expected listings on major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, and KuCoin, will provide liquidity and mainstream exposure, further strengthening investor confidence. Combined with the predictable revenue from stablecoin borrowing, liquidation penalties, and the reserve factor, these mechanisms create an ecosystem where economic security underpins sustained growth. Retail and institutional investors alike will see MUTM as a protocol that balances innovation with practical safeguards, making it a highly attractive long-term hold. Additional engagement features like the dashboard for tracking ROI and the Top 50 leaderboard incentivize users to actively monitor and participate in the ecosystem. These tools will improve retention and encourage strategic behavior, ensuring the community remains engaged as adoption expands. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap, with plans for Layer-2 expansion, stablecoin implementation, and multiple exchange listings, aligns future utility with projected demand. Treasury revenues generated through protocol fees and liquidation mechanics will provide a self-sustaining economic model, creating continuous support for token value. Analysts projecting a 100x long-term return see these integrated features as key differentiators compared to legacy crypto coins that lack structured revenue streams and institutional-grade risk management. Retail and institutional investors have a compelling opportunity to enter the MUTM presale ahead of the next price increase, positioning themselves for long-term growth. The combination of presale momentum, dual lending mechanics, Layer-2 efficiency, buy-and-distribute incentives, and structured treasury management creates a strong framework for MUTM to achieve a 100x potential in the coming years, making it a must-watch token in the evolving DeFi market.

The bill is currently awaiting approval from Capitol Hill. The organization expressed its concerns about the legislation in a letter to U.S. Senator Majority Leader John Thune and Senator Charles Schumer. Transparency International’s concerns are on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) and the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA). Transparency International sees risks posed by the RFIA bill The letter highlights the risks posed by the bills, with support from the Free Russia Foundation, Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, and Nate Sibley, the director of the Hudson Institute’s Kleptocracy Initiative. The parties want Congress to ensure that digital asset legislation includes measures to protect against money laundering and sanctions evasion, among other illicit activities. The organization argued that virtual assets are becoming the new tools for laundering the proceeds of corruption, including bribery and embezzlement. The letter cited the example of Tareck El Aissami, a Venezuelan official accused of embezzling state funds into digital assets and laundering them through U.S. crypto exchanges. “These blind spots in our crypto laws would give drug cartels, fentanyl traffickers, and corrupt regimes like Iran, North Korea, and Russia exactly what they need to anonymously move dirty money and fund their crimes.” -Scott Greytak, Deputy Executive Director of Transparency International U.S. The organization’s recommendations come in the wake of the recent market structure framework provided by Senate Democrats. The market structure framework highlights the need for stricter regulatory measures for cryptocurrencies. Democratic senators previously explained that the risks stemming from the high volatility of most digital assets pose a financial crisis under the RIFA. The newly appointed executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, Patrick Witt, also called for Congress earlier this month to move quickly on cryptocurrency market structure legislation. He said at an industry event in Washington, D.C. on September 12 that getting the legislation over the finish line is a top priority. The U.S. policymakers also argued that a loophole in the RFIA could allow decentralized crypto platforms to avoid policies designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Transparency International said in the letter that the U.S. Treasury Department should have the power to implement AML measures on DeFi platforms to prevent illicit activities. The letter also advocates for measures to eliminate certain loopholes for crypto mixers. Digital asset mixers, like Tornado Cash, have previously been tied to criminal activities. The authors argued that the RFIA would allow companies to avoid accountability by claiming they don’t operate in the U.S. They also maintained that any final legislation must ensure that crypto platforms serving U.S. customers must comply with U.S. sanctions and AML/CFT requirements. GENIUS Act limits stablecoin issuers from offering yield The authors also acknowledged the importance of creating a level playing field for stablecoin issuers. They stated that all stablecoin issuers must implement reasonable ecosystem-wide monitoring. According to them, the initiative could help ensure protections for investors while assuring they do not engage in illicit financial activities. The GENIUS Act became law in July and stipulates that no stablecoin issuer can offer any yield or interest on holdings. Senate Democrats also suggested a prohibition on interest or yield paid either directly or via affiliates by stablecoin issuers. The stablecoin legislation prohibits issuers from offering yields directly or through affiliates, but does not block exchanges from doing so. Banks advocated for the term through affiliates to be included in the stablecoin legislation, and even after it was signed into law, they haven’t stopped calling for the change. The Bank Policy Institute wrote in August that lawmakers should use the market structure bill to close the loophole created by the GENIUS Act. The crypto industry sees the stablecoin bill as fair legislation that permits exchanges and affiliates to pay interest to holders. Crypto lobbying groups responded to the Bank Policy Institute’s statement, arguing that only banks having such allowances gives them an advantage and limits consumer options.

This occurs as significant institutional interest meets the rising strength of the U.S. dollar. The interplay between these forces leaves traders speculating. Traders study price action and macro forces to gauge where momentum will build next. In a similar way, Outset PR monitors media performance and outlet dynamics, publishing detailed analytical reports to ensure campaigns are precisely aligned with market trends. Bitcoin Dances in the Range, Eyeing Future Highs Source: tradingview Bitcoin has recently been trading in a narrow range of $114,000 to $117,000. Despite a minor dip, it has seen a 32% increase over the past six months, indicating a slow but steady upward trend. Key support is established at approximately $112,000, while resistance lies near $119,000. Should Bitcoin successfully breach this resistance, it could target $123,000, representing a potential gain of 5% to 9% from its current levels. Recent trends suggest some selling pressure, as indicated by the relative strength index. However, a sustained move beyond current resistance levels could reignite investor optimism, potentially paving the way for further gains.

Ranked sixth by market cap at $109.4 billion, Solana’s momentum is being closely watched by traders as institutional capital circles the asset. Market analysts expect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to rule on several Solana staking ETF applications by mid-October. Firms including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and CoinShares are among those filing updated S-1 forms. Another flurry of S-1 amendments filed today on spot sol ETFs… Franklin, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, & Canary. Includes staking (yes, bodes well for spot eth ETF staking). Guessing these are approved w/in next two weeks. pic.twitter.com/g13NDFKSEU — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 26, 2025 ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted that the move follows the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, which saw $12 million in inflows and $33 million in trading volume shortly after its debut. Pantera Capital has echoed optimism, describing Solana as “next in line for its institutional moment,” with $60 million already entering Europe’s Bitwise Solana staking ETP in recent days. Market Cap: $109.4 billion Circulating Supply: 543.5 million SOL 24h Trading Volume: $8.8 billion Ranking: #6 by CoinMarketCap Analysts suggest approval of multiple U.S.-based staking ETFs could accelerate institutional adoption, potentially pushing SOL toward the $250 mark in the near term. Partnerships and Ecosystem Growth Beyond ETF speculation, Solana continues to expand its ecosystem through new collaborations. A notable development is the rise of Tapzi (TAPZI), a GameFi project backed by Solana’s infrastructure. Unlike traditional play-to-earn tokens, Tapzi emphasizes skill-based staking games such as chess and tic-tac-toe, raising over $50 million in presales. Projections suggest its token value could multiply 100–500 times as adoption grows. Solana itself is strengthening ties with payment providers and scaling solutions, fueling demand for its blockchain in both DeFi and enterprise-grade applications. Current trading data shows SOL hovering around $152–$201, with analysts eyeing a move toward $175 as institutional demand and developer activity remain robust. GameFi used to be all hype with nothing solid behind it. @genome_protocol is raising the bar. Here, ownership isn’t some vague promise, it’s a right.

Expanding use cases and real-world applications continue to bolster network demand, creating long-term growth potential even as near-term price volatility persists. Solana Technical Outlook and Trade Setup Technically, Solana price prediction remains bearish under pressure despite its recovery attempt. On the 4-hour chart, SOL is moving within a descending channel, with resistance around $205.50. The 50-period SMA at $219.50 and the 100-period SMA near $215.40 present strong hurdles that bulls must overcome. Solana (SOL/USD) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick action shows hesitation, with repeated long upper wicks suggesting sellers remain in control. Momentum is mixed—while the RSI has recovered from oversold territory near 40, it shows little evidence of bullish divergence. Key Levels to Watch: Resistance: $205.50, $215.40, $219.50 Support: $197.00, $185.40, $177.40 Trade Setup: Bearish Case: Short positions may favor entries around $205–$207, with stops above $212 and targets at $197 and $185. Bullish Case: A breakout above $216 would flip sentiment, opening upside potential toward $224 and $232. For now, Solana’s price action resembles a downward escalator—unless it decisively breaks above $216, rallies risk fading back into the channel. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly.

USDT supply on the ETH blockchain has grown by around $17 billion since May to $77 billion. The shift represents a reversal from earlier in May, when Tron temporarily held the lead with 48% supply compared to Ethereum’s 42%. The two blockchain networks have remained close competitors throughout the year, with between $75 billion and $80 billion supply levels. According to DeFiLlama data, Tron’s supply stands at $76.23 billion at the time of publication. Institutional adoption fuels ETH dominance as the preferred network for USDT Retail traders have largely favored Tron for its low fees against Ethereum’s institutional-grade infrastructure with higher transfer fees. Despite that, ETH has maintained deep liquidity and an extensive DeFi ecosystem reach. Other notable chains include the BSC chain, which holds 7.48% of the USDT supply, and Plasma (XPL), with a supply of $4.37 billion. Solana has remained low, capturing only $2.1 billion of the USDT supply, according to data on DeFiLlama. 📈🔝 @Tether_to 's USDT on @ethereum is back as the biggest stablecoin deployment by supply. The supply of USDT on Ethereum has increased by ~$17 billion since May. pic.twitter.com/1wS2RZ1FA3 — Token Terminal @ TOKEN2049 🇸🇬 (@tokenterminal) September 26, 2025 Ethereum’s daily USDT transactions average around 400K, while overall network transactions surpassed 1.64 million today. This shows its active use in payments and settlements across the DeFi ecosystem. Tron, however, still dominates in terms of daily transactions. Institutional adoption of Ethereum has fueled the reversal, with companies like PayPal integrating PYUSD stablecoin into Ethereum, currently leading with $1.75 billion in supply. The scale of USDT volumes on Ethereum influences cross-chain bridge activity, liquidity provision, and exchange integration. Ethereum’s ability to capture institutional stablecoin flows positions it as the primary settlement layer for institutional financial applications as TradFi adopts blockchain-based payments. Tether remains the global leader in the stablecoin market with a market cap of $174 billion. Circle’s USDC follows in the second position with $74 billion. The two tokens dominate the stablecoin market, although they have different strategies. GENIUS Act pushes broader stablecoin competition Tether first launched in 2014 as RealCoin before changing that name later. It gained market traction quickly after becoming the preferred tool for moving money between different cryptocurrencies, mainly due to its speed of settlements and lower fees. It has also faced controversies, including regulatory fines and concerns over its reserves. The token has now grown to be offered on over 90 networks. Circle’s USDC, launched in 2018, is focused on compliance and transparency. It publishes monthly attestations while maintaining a close partnership with American financial institutions. Circle went public in June, listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and raising over $1 billion on its IPO. The firm has positioned itself as the regulated alternative to Tether. The U.S. regulatory framework has boosted the growth in stablecoin competition. The GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, established a comprehensive standard for stablecoins to meet. Cryptopolitan covered the story , highlighting that the act requires stablecoin firms to disclose monthly public reserves, third-party attestations, and strict limitations on asset composition. Circle was already largely compliant with these requirements. Tether has, however, is launching another U.S.-compliant token, USAT, while issuing USDT for the global market. Tether has managed to maintain strong financial results, with billions in quarterly profits generated mainly from its holdings of U.S. Treasuries.

However, analysis from market strategist CrediBULL Crypto suggests these concerns may be overstated. In an X post on September 26, the analyst highlighted that while a downside move is possible, it is unlikely to derail the broader bullish outlook. On the short-term chart, XRP is consolidating within a descending triangle pattern. The price has repeatedly tested the horizontal support zone near $2.65, creating what analysts describe as “triple lows.” XRP price analysis chart. Source: Tradingview CrediBULL noted that a breakdown of this level could trigger a dip into the high-timeframe (HTF) demand area between $2 and $2.40. This would represent a decline of roughly 10–15%, in line with pullbacks expected across the wider crypto market should Bitcoin ( BTC ) slide below $105,000. However, the higher-timeframe chart tells a different story. The expert noted that the current consolidation sits within a much larger bullish structure that has been developing over several years. Despite short-term weakness, XRP remains above major support levels and continues to build a foundation for a potential breakout to new all-time highs. XRP fundamentals Indeed, the technical structure emerges as XRP continues to record notable fundamental developments that are likely to influence the price. The recently unveiled XRP ETF has yet to gain traction, with investors now focusing on the potential approval of the spot product later in October. With several applications pending before regulators, attention is on how potential approval might impact the price due to anticipated institutional capital inflows. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.78, having gained about 0.92% in the past 24 hours. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold In the short term, XRP is under bearish pressure. The price is currently below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.99, indicating weakening momentum and potential for further downside, while remaining above the 200-day SMA of $2.58, which provides support against deeper corrections. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 37.75 underscores this bearish tilt, dipping into oversold territory but not yet extreme (below 30), suggesting limited immediate rebound potential without fresh catalysts.

52334320,591013,1758968848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52334320.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy After Vanguard’s Big Crypto ETF Shift,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-after-vanguard-crypto-etf-shift/,"Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund management company, has long stood firm on its old-fashioned anti-crypto stance. Back in January 2024, the company stated it would not offer cryptocurrency exposure to its clients, arguing that the assets were too volatile and incapable of generating sustainable long-term returns. However, the ice now appears to be finally starting to melt. An insider source recently revealed that Vanguard is actively exploring ways to provide digital asset exposure to its clientele . This shift comes in response to strong client demand and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment around the crypto industry. Unlike BlackRock, which has launched its own crypto ETF, Vanguard has no immediate plans to roll out a fund of its own. Instead, its first step would be to allow clients access to third-party crypto ETFs. Read on as we uncover more about Vanguard’s future plans, as well as highlight the best altcoins to buy right now . Vanguard Has Been Secretly Pro-Crypto Although Vanguard has openly criticized cryptocurrencies, it also happens to be the largest shareholder in Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR). Today, Strategy is hands down the largest corporate accumulator of Bitcoin , with 639,835 tokens in its kitty. Vanguard itself owns 20M shares in MicroStrategy, representing around 8% ownership. Adding to this, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji as its CEO in July 2024 . With 25 years of industry experience, Ramji was instrumental in launching BlackRock’s iBIT spot Bitcoin ETF while leading the firm’s global ETF business. His appointment was widely viewed as a signal that Vanguard might eventually pivot toward a more crypto-friendly stance. However, in August, the new CEO clarified that Vanguard had no immediate plans to launch any crypto ETFs. Still, while the company has shied away from direct crypto investment vehicles, there have always been subtle hints pointing in the opposite direction. With competitors like BlackRock leading the charge, Vanguard’s rigidity risks alienating pro-crypto investors. Perhaps that’s what has sparked its recent shift in mindset. Eric Balchunas , a senior ETF analyst, called Vanguard’s latest pivot a massive development for all Bitcoin ETFs, noting that the firm’s 50M investors could bring fresh liquidity and capital into the market. With Vanguard finally stepping onto the crypto ship, there couldn’t be a better time to start building your own crypto portfolio. But simply stacking blue-chip digital assets won’t be enough; you’ll need to spot and invest in promising low-cap coins early. Here are our top 3 suggestions. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Layer-2 Bitcoin Solution for Faster Transactions and Web3 Participation Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first-ever Layer 2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain designed to solve issues of Web3 compatibility, speed, and scalability. While Bitcoin is the face of the crypto industry, it still lags behind when it comes to innovation and adaptability. For example, Bitcoin can still only process around 7 transactions per second with a block time of 10 minutes. By contrast, Solana can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin Hyper addresses this gap by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aka the same technology that powers Solana’s high throughput. This integration allows developers to build dApps and execute smart contracts directly on Bitcoin. The SVM uses parallel execution, meaning it can process multiple transactions simultaneously as long as they’re not related. While these transactions occur off-chain, you won’t have to compromise Bitcoin’s renowned Layer 1 security. Supporting this is a non-custodial canonical bridge that locks up your Layer 1 Bitcoin and mints an equivalent amount of Web3-compatible Layer 2 tokens. These Layer 2 tokens can then be used across DeFi apps for staking, lending, borrowing, and more. Once done, you can reclaim your original Bitcoin from the bridge by depositing L2 tokens. This utility-driven approach has already helped the $HYPER presale raise $18.5M. At present, 1 $HYPER costs just $0.012985, and based on our $HYPER price prediction , the token could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025, representing a potential 2,364% return. Interested? Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to learn more about this new cryptocurrency project. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Crypto-Run Content Creation Platform Offering AI Tools & Lowers Fees SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers a new content creation and sharing platform aiming to disrupt the $85B industry with innovation and transparency. Imagine spending hours conceptualizing, planning, shooting, and editing a piece of content, only for the platform to take 70% of your revenue in the name of platform and management fees. Infuriating, right? That’s why many content creators are shifting to SUBBD, which charges only a fraction of creators’ earnings as fees. In return, it offers a full suite of AI tools – voice generators, text, image, and video creators – to help produce engaging content. This frees up more time for creators to interact directly with fans and build loyal communities. But it’s not just creators who benefit from SUBBD. Holders of the $SUBBD token can access premium content, subscribe to their favorite creators, request personalized videos, and even send tips as tokens of appreciation. On top of that, staking $SUBBD offers a fixed 20% return in the first year, while also unlocking access to creator livestreams and exclusive behind-the-scenes content. The $SUBBD presale is live and has already pulled in over $1.2M, with each token available for just $0.05652. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD . According to our $SUBBD price prediction , it could surge to $0.301 by the end of 2025, delivering a staggering 432% return on investment. For more details, check out SUBBD Token’s official website . 3. MemeCore ($M) – Meme Coin that Rewards Every Form of Blockchain Participation MemeCore ($M) is an innovative Layer-1 blockchain that aims to change how investors perceive meme coins today. Even the best meme coins are often seen merely as fun, speculative assets – entertainment-driven cryptocurrencies that thrive on virality and on-chain activity with little to no utility. MemeCore challenges this by introducing a unique Proof-of-Meme (PoM) mechanism, built on the belief that every on-chain activity strengthens the network. It records and rewards all forms of participation, whether it’s creating and sharing memes, staking, or trading tokens. $M serves as the platform’s native currency, powering all on-chain transactions, gas fees, and reward distributions. On the technical front, MemeCore ($M) gave a strong breakout on September 4 when it broke past its long-term resistance at $1. After hitting an all-time high of $2.96 on September 18, the token is now trading at $2.33 with strong support at $2.12. While the broader crypto market pauses for breath, MemeCore too is consolidating nicely between $3 and $2.12. A breakout above its previous high could propel the token to a new peak of $4 in the coming weeks. Want in? Buy $M on BingX or any of the other crypto exchanges. Recap : With Vanguard making a major shift into crypto ETFs, signaling growing mainstream adoption, now’s the best time to load up on explode-worthy altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and MemeCore ($M).

The company is reportedly accelerating its capital raising ahead of a potential IPO. According to people familiar with the matter, the funding round has not yet been finalized and could change depending on market conditions. The investment under discussion is expected to be approximately $200 million to $300 million. This move follows Kraken's recent $500 million fundraising round at a $15 billion valuation, marking a significant increase in the valuations of major cryptocurrency companies in the private markets. Founded in 2011 and officially known as Payward Inc., the company had raised only $27 million in seed capital before this year. The new funding will provide Kraken with additional resources to further strengthen its competitiveness with publicly traded rivals Coinbase and other global exchanges. The company also recently began offering tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Related News: What's the Latest on Solana?

Kraken has reportedly begun working with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs on its upcoming IPO, which could take place in the first quarter of next year. Meanwhile, Tether, another industry giant, is in talks with investors including ARK Investment Management to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion. This transaction could push Tether's valuation to $500 billion. Companies like Circle, Gemini, and Bullish have also gone public this year. *This is not investment advice.

On the daily chart, XRP remains in a descending triangle, a technical pattern that typically precedes volatility. Sellers have been capping rallies at lower highs since mid-July, and buyers are defending the $2.70 area. Analysts predict that XRP could reach $2.50, where both technical and on-chain signals converge. Data shows a buy cluster between $2.45 and $2.55, so if prices dip into that range, liquidity may trigger a bounce. Market researcher Sistine Research notes this is XRP’s weakest liquidity compression since late 2024—historically a precursor to big moves once momentum shifts. Key Resistance: $2.97 (50-day SMA), $3.25 breakout trigger Support Cluster: $2.70 immediate floor, $2.45–$2.55 buyer wall RSI: Hovering near 40, showing muted momentum ETF Developments and Macro Pressure Beyond charts, institutional products are shaping sentiment. The REX/Osprey XRPR ETF has attracted $38 million in trade, while Franklin Templeton’s ETF decision in November could serve as another potential catalyst. Analysts argue that approved funds would boost legitimacy and deepen XRP’s liquidity pool. Welcome to the circus of crypto where BTC is the strongman, ETH is the juggler, and Base is the clown car that keeps multiplying! Fiat? Oh please, that’s the sad balloon animal nobody wants! Get ready for some spicy takes and meme-worthy moments! … — Money Printer Go BRRR (@OrdinalPrinter) September 26, 2025 Macro factors are adding turbulence. Bitcoin dropped be low $110,000 after $22 billion in crypto options expired and $1.5 billion in liquidations across the market. Ethereum fell to a 7-week low, and XRP went down 2.9% to $2.74 during the same period. Meanwhile, flat U.S. core PCE inflation reinforced expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut later this year, a potential liquidity tailwind for risk assets. Market Watch $BTC slipped under $109K, triggering $275M in long liquidations as traders brace for Friday’s $22B $BTC options expiry. If $BTC stays below $110K by expiry, put options could gain a $1B advantage, putting extra pressure on bulls. Some analysts suggest… pic.twitter.com/hYlhCGsgrP — KCEX (@KCEX_Official) September 25, 2025 This macro backdrop underscores why XRP remains vulnerable in the near term. Risk-off flows are keeping traders cautious; however, the prospect of easier monetary policy and ETF approvals could quickly shift sentiment in XRP’s favor. Price Forecast: Breakout on the Horizon At current levels, XRP has a market cap of $166.5 billion and is #4 on CoinMarketCap. The narrowing triangle means something is about to happen. A daily close above $3.25 will confirm the breakout and open up targets at $3.43 and $3.66. Conversely, a breakdown below $2.70 could expose $2.48 and $2.26, before buyers step in at the on-chain support wall. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick behavior has shown long lower shadows near support, hinting at quiet accumulation despite visible pressure. For traders, one setup involves going long on a confirmed breakout above $3.25, with stops below $3.00. A short bias emerges if $2.70 fails, targeting $2.48. Long-term investors may see any dip toward $2.50 as an entry point, particularly if institutional flows accelerate. Looking forward, XRP’s fate hinges on whether the bearish triangle gives way to further downside or whether the buy wall absorbs selling and triggers a rally. With technical compression, ETF catalysts, and macro liquidity shifts all aligning, the coming weeks could set the tone for XRP’s next major trend into year-end.

The files, leaked earlier this month, provide a detailed look inside the A7 group, an operation based in Russia, operating a specialized “sanctions evasion-as-a-service.” Elliptic’s analysis of the data shows that several crypto wallets have processed stablecoin transactions worth $8 billion over the past 18 months, tracing the digital money flow from Russian-affiliated entities to political operations in Moldova as the country prepares to hold its parliamentary elections. Reports mentioned that Shor’s switch to digital assets was necessary because of his controversial past. A7 document leaks show Russia’s influence using crypto According to several reports, Shor fled Israel after he was convicted in 2017 for his role in the theft of $1 billion from Moldovan banks. Shor ended up in Russia, with the country granting him citizenship. The United States later sanctioned him in 2022, accusing him of making efforts to undermine democracy in Moldova. From his position as a fugitive, Shor started the A7 group in 2024, creating a structured connection for the expertise he had cultivated. In the report released by Elliptic, it claimed that A7 group is partly owned by Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank (PSB), a bank that has been sanctioned for financing Russia’s defense industry, tying A7 as a de facto arm of the country’s financial warfare apparatus. The scale of the operation is quite big, with Shor reportedly boasting to Vladimir Putin in a statement earlier this month that A7 had carried out transactions worth 7.5 trillion rubles, which is approximately $89 billion, for Russian businesses in ten months. While the mechanisms of operations were not clear to people at the time, the A7 leaks now provide a detailed look into the blueprint of operations. They reveal a complex settlement network built to move payments through a group of companies, primarily located in Kyrgyzstan , a country that shares close political and financial ties with Russia. The scheme also combines the use of traditional tools like cash and promissory notes with a heavy reliance on digital assets like USDT to move funds across borders outside the controlled traditional finance system. Creation of A7A5 eliminated reliance on USDT This dependence on crypto is revealed in internal chat logs where employees discuss multi-million dollar USDT transfers for treasury management. In one exchange, a user named athena1098 requested two million USDT for “treasury,” a transaction that was connected to a wallet that had seen more than $677 million in inflows. The leak revealed that the user is Maria Albot, a former Moldovan politician who was also sanctioned. Albot also shares close ties to Shor. The leaks also showed how sanctioned individuals continued to carry out large-scale financial operations and transactions using digital assets. In the leaked file, A7 noted that there is a vulnerability in relying on USDT, in the sense that it could be frozen by its issuer, Tether. The company then moved to develop its alternative, A7A5, a stablecoin backed by the Russian ruble. With about 41.6 billion tokens in circulation, the stablecoin is currently valued at $500 million. In addition, reports claim that A7A5 was engineered to be sanctions-proof. Leaked chats from April 2025 show employees discussing concerted market-making efforts, which led A7 wallets to send $2 billion in USDT to exchanges to purchase A7A5 and build liquidity, creating a self-contained financial ecosystem insulated from Western pressure. Notably, the stablecoin was also used on Garantex, an exchange that has since been brought down for several sanctions violations. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

In her post, she included an image of a now-deleted Watcher.Guru message that had claimed SWIFT was nearing an agreement with Ripple to use XRP for cross-border payments. The image further stated that billions of XRP were secured in escrow as liquidity reserves. Alongside the image, Amelie added her own remark, writing that she was “patiently waiting for this announcement to come true,” signaling her anticipation that such a development could materialize in the future.

According to SWIFT, the plan involves cooperation with leading global banks and aims to make international retail transactions as fast and predictable as domestic ones. The organization positioned the initiative as a significant step toward modernizing global payment infrastructure for consumers and small businesses. Importantly, SWIFT’s communication did not make mention of XRP or any direct collaboration with Ripple. Clarification about the Watcher.Guru post The image Amelie shared originated from a Watcher.Guru tweet published on March 20, 2025. That tweet stated that SWIFT was close to a partnership with Ripple involving XRP and liquidity reserves. However, the claim was later determined to be inaccurate. According to a Times Tabloid report , Watcher.Guru’s account had been compromised, and the misleading post was a result of that breach. The outlet confirmed that the assertion of a pending SWIFT and Ripple agreement was not correct and Watcher.Guru subsequently removed the message. Despite the clarification, the image of the original claim circulated widely and drew attention from crypto enthusiasts before being taken down. Amelie’s decision to highlight the screenshot in her own tweet shows her interest in the possibility that such an agreement could eventually happen, though no official confirmation supports it at present. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current status and outlook At this stage, the verifiable developments consist of SWIFT’s announced initiative with major banks to transform cross-border retail payments, as well as the correction regarding the removed Watcher.Guru post. While Amelie expressed her hope for a future where XRP could play a role in SWIFT’s operations , there is no evidence that such an arrangement currently exists. The only official communication from SWIFT remains its statement on enhancing retail payment systems without reference to any particular digital asset. The circulation of the screenshot and Amelie’s reaction underscore ongoing interest within the crypto community regarding whether traditional financial institutions, such as SWIFT, may eventually incorporate digital assets, including XRP, into their payment frameworks. For now, the factual record confirms only that SWIFT is working with global banks to accelerate and standardize cross-border retail payments.

In the backdrop of such discussion, emerging DeFi-based projects like Remittix (RTX) are creating a stir, offering real-world usability, cross-chain transactions, and bank-to-crypto transfers that distinguish them as alternatives to traditional store-of-value coins. BTC Trends Show Growing Market Confidence The Bitcoin price is $110,025.96, which is a 1.61% decline in the past 24 hours. While the market capitalization is still at $2.18 trillion and the trading volume is still at $73.99 billion, having risen by 34.21%, Bitcoin continues to be the Global Anchor of sentiment on both the centralized exchanges and decentralized platforms. This pullback is viewed by analysts as a part of a normal consolidation period after months of sustained rallies. There still is short-term volatility, but long-term fundamentals such as institutional adoption and Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives are in place to underpin a bullish Bitcoin prediction towards 2026. But as Bitcoin matures, the majority of early-stage investors are diversifying into new altcoins to watch out for, searching for crypto with real utility and low gas fee crypto projects that can provide faster, cheaper transactions and serious adoption. Remittix Beta Wallet Now Live With Real-World Utility Remittix (RTX) , presently worth $0.1130 per token, has rolled out its Beta Wallet in official capacity, bridging crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries.

Amid this situation, popular analyst Ted Pillows has shared an audacious market prediction that would douse fears of an impending cycle top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Over? These Signals Show Where The Market Is At Institutional Demand To Extend Bitcoin Market Cycle To 2026 A typical crypto market cycle has always peaked in Q4 of the fourth year. This timing usually matches the post-halving hype and a strong wave of retail and institutional market demand. Such behavior is observed in the last two cycles when Bitcoin reached a market top of $19,700 in December 2017, and $69,000 in November 2021. However, Ted Pillows postulates the present market is likely to present a different pattern, which aligns with the US business cycle. Generally, the US business policy centered around liquidity, interest rates, and inflation all play a heavy role in Bitcoin demand. Notably, the US Federal Reserve implemented its first rate cut of 2025 this September, and market analysts expect the monetary authority to maintain this dovish approach for the next six months. In particular, JP Morgan predicts the Fed will implement two more rate cuts in 2025 and one in 2026. This drop in interest rates is expected to boost investors’ access to liquidity through borrowing and support investments in risk assets such as Bitcoin. Furthermore, the introduction of Bitcoin Spot ETFs has also changed the structure of inflows. Notably, these investments have improved the ease of institutional investment in Bitcoin, with the present cumulative ETF inflows valued at $57.23 billion. Importantly, these heavy inflows, coupled with the emergence of Bitcoin treasury companies, have all contributed to maturing the Bitcoin market that is now likely to be driven by macroeconomic cycles rather than the traditional crypto-native cycles. If US market forces prove dominant, Ted Pillows expects Bitcoin to reach a market peak in Q1 or Q2 2026, indicating the potential for higher price targets despite recent price drops. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Again? $10 Million Stock Buyback Sparks Fresh Price Hopes Bitcoin Heading To $112,000? Over the last few hours, Bitcoin has shown strong resilience in bouncing off the $109,000 price support. According to a separate analysis post by Pillows, the premier cryptocurrency is now likely headed to reclaim the $112,000 resistance price level. If market bulls successfully overcome this barrier, further analysis suggests a potential rise to $117,000. Alternatively, another retest of $109,000 could result in a decisive break below this support level, pushing prices as low as $101,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin exchanges hands at $109,420, reflecting a decline of 0.25% in the past day.

This development comes amid the crypto firms’ IPO frenzy in the US under a rather supportive administration of President Donald Trump. Kraken Stays Focused, Follows $500M Raise With New Funding On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Kraken has begun advanced negotiations to boost its value to $20 billion as part of fundraising efforts in view of a planned IPO. Impressively, this move follows a recent $500 million raise, which took Kraken’s valuation to $15 billion. Bloomberg first reported on Kraken’s IPO valuation in March 2025, stating the exchange was targeting a public listing in the first quarter of 2026. Beyond capital raising, the US-based trading platform has displayed other behaviors seen in IPO preparation, such as financial statement disclosure. Furthermore, Kraken has also expanded its product line beyond digital asset trading to include access to stocks and exchange-traded funds. While the reported funding talks remain in progress. Bloomberg expects a $200 to $300 million commitment according to sources familiar with the matter, allowing Kraken to potentially reach its target $20 billion valuation ahead of 2026. The media house also reports that the crypto exchange has engaged the advisory services of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in regard to this planned IPO. Kraken is now expected to soon file an S-1 registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as expected of any entity aiming to launch a public offering. Crypto IPO Frenzy Continues Kraken joins a growing list of crypto/blockchain firms seeking public funding. In 2025 alone, four other companies, namely USDC issuer Circle , blockchain lender Figure, and exchanges Bullish and Gemini , have successfully launched IPOs, indicating a significant step-up in wider investors’ interest in digital asset-focused firms. This public market approach is widely buoyed by the pro-crypto policies of Trump. Notably, the Republican has upheld promises of creating a friendly regulatory environment for digital assets operations, as indicated by strategy changes by regulators, including the SEC and CFTC. The 47th US President has also popularly established a Federal Bitcoin Reserve, prompting similar actions from state governments. In terms of regulations, Trump also famously signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance, operations, and use. At press time, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.73 trillion following the market crash seen in the last week. Notably, there has been a slight recovery of 1.11% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto Exchange|Circle|gemini|GENIUS Act|IPO|Kraken|President Donald Trump,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 11:00:46
52336282,https://invezz.com/?p=2901697,1758971400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Analysts give 3 reasons why MUTM could be the best crypto with $3 target by 2026 end,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/27/analysts-give-3-reasons-why-mutm-could-be-the-best-crypto-with-3-target-by-2026-end/,"The cryptocurrency market has grown increasingly complex, leaving investors asking what is going on with crypto today as traditional coins plateau and retail and institutional demand search for structured, high-potential alternatives. Among the emerging contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out due to its dual-lending architecture, combining P2C pools for major coins and stablecoins with P2P markets for less-liquid tokens. Depositors in the P2C pools will receive mtTokens that automatically accrue yield, while a governance-managed stablecoin will be minted only against overcollateralized loans and burned on repayment. This mechanism creates a recurring native cash flow, as liquidation events funnel a portion of penalties directly into the treasury, providing predictable revenue that underpins future staking rewards, buybacks, and protocol incentives. Three core drivers paving the way to $3 Analysts point to three primary reasons why MUTM is structurally positioned for significant upside. First, the liquidation rules with penalty allocation provide a recurring revenue stream. When borrowers fall below collateral thresholds, liquidations occur, and a share of the penalty flows to the treasury. This treasury revenue will be systematically applied to incentives and partial buybacks MUTMs for mtToken stakers, directly translating platform activity into MUTM demand. By continuously tying protocol performance to token utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates a self-reinforcing growth loop that makes the token attractive for both retail and institutional participants. Second, the reserve factor is a critical driver of value accumulation. A fraction of borrower interest compounds into deployable treasury assets, building a strong on-chain safety buffer. These reserves will be strategically applied to fund staking rewards, insurance mechanisms, and liquidity incentives. The disciplined reserve growth ensures that MUTM will have tangible backing for its token economics, reinforcing confidence among larger market players and contributing to a stable path toward multi-dollar pricing. Third, the robust oracle strategy enhances trust and participation. Chainlink primary feeds supplemented with fallback mechanisms and time-weighted averages will reduce erroneous liquidations, encouraging users to maintain larger, longer-duration collateral positions. This accuracy attracts corporate treasuries, funds, and active whales who prefer predictability, allowing the protocol to generate consistent borrowing and fee volume. The combination of precise pricing, structured penalties, and strong reserve dynamics forms a compelling case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) upside potential. Adding to these three pillars, the buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures that protocol revenue converts directly into token demand. Revenue from borrower interest, fees, and liquidation penalties will be used to purchase MUTM from open markets and distribute it to mtToken stakers. This cyclical model aligns participant incentives with the protocol’s growth, creating a measurable link between usage, revenue, and token appreciation. Presale momentum and strategic entry Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is priced at $0.035 and has raised approximately $16.4 million, with 16,600+ holders already participating. Half of the 170 million token allocation for this phase is already claimed. The project has passed a CertiK audit with a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79, requested on 2025-02-25 and revised on 2025-05-20. Social engagement continues to accelerate with a $50,000 bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway for 10 winners of $10,000 each in MUTM. Phase 7 will step the price up to $0.040, a 15% increase, creating urgency for those seeking early entry and maximum exposure before the next valuation adjustment. The $3 target from $0.035 represents an 86X multiple, illustrating the scale of potential appreciation. This pathway is supported by structured adoption: the beta launch at listing will convert presale holders into active users, generating real borrowing and repayment flows. Over 12–24 months, these cycles will produce trancheable revenue streams that feed into treasury reserves, buybacks, and staking rewards. Layer-2 integration will ensure fast, low-cost transactions, encouraging retail adoption and higher utilization, while expected Tier-1 exchange listings will expand liquidity and market access. Combined, these elements create a defensible path to a multi-dollar valuation. Final words For example, a $5,000 allocation at Phase 6 at $0.035 will yield 142,900 MUTM tokens, which would be worth $428,600 at the $3 target. This approach demonstrates how structured protocol mechanics, not just speculation, can drive substantial appreciation. Analysts highlight that the revenue and utility model of MUTM, centered on stablecoin lending, treasury growth, and buyback cycles, offers a more defensible route to price expansion compared with purely network-driven altcoins like XRP. Phase 6 is already half sold out, and the following phase at $0.040 is a really important chance. Early admission guarantees participation in the treasury-driven appreciation loop, where penalties for liquidation, reserve accumulation, and buybacks all work together to create steady demand for MUTM. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the best chances in the market for investors who want to invest in crypto in a disciplined way and see long-term development. The price is on track to reach $3 by the end of 2026.

Brooks argues that many companies, including Tesla and Figure, rely on optimistic assumptions about robots learning that do not conform to the laws of physics, sensing, and manipulation in the real world. According to Brooks, approaches that rely on video-based learning to teach human-like dexterity won’t be sustainable. He characterized the approach as pure fantasy thinking, saying that human hands have multiple touch receptors that no robot can match. He highlighted the things a robot may fail to replicate, including human tactile feedback to pressure, vibration, and slip detection, which are central to dexterity. Future robots won’t look human, Rodney predicts In an essay published by Rodney Brooks, he highlights the lack of established infrastructure in the robotics industry to capture, store, and use touch data. Unlike vision and speech, where there are plenty of datasets and signal processing frameworks, touch remains underdeveloped in hardware and algorithm design. According to Brooks, many robot systems today lack adequate force feedback, fine finger control, and robust tactile sensing, which are essential for general-purpose manipulation. He also highlighted safety concerns when robots continue to scale. Brooks believes that as size increases, so does the size and body of robots, meaning a fall from a larger robot could be far more dangerous than from a smaller one. Scaling up in size for robots means its mass grows with the cube of linear scaling, while also structural strength grows with the square, creating safety challenges. Brooks revealed that walking upright is another major hurdle for the existing humanoid robots , pointing out that they use energy-intensive control and are not yet structurally safe to be near humans when in motion. He argues that to operate in human environments, robots must be certified as safe when people stand within mere centimeters, pointing out that the current designs have not achieved that. Brooks predicts that in the next fifteen years, the most successful robots marketed as humanoid will not look like humans; instead, they will rely on wheels, multiple arms, and specialized sensors rather than walking upright on two legs. He added that the current funding rounds to support humanoid experiments are unlikely to result in the mass production of humanoid machines. Mass humanoid robot adoption is much further away than expected Chris Camillo, a renowned investor who turned $20K to $60 million by investing in robotics, has also sounded his warnings, revealing that after spending more than 400 hours researching the space, he remains optimistic about long-term potential. Still, the challenges ahead are being misinterpreted by many investors. At the Independent Investor summit, Camillo points out that the perception that manufacturing capacity is the key bottleneck for humanoid robots is misguided. “Most people I speak to that are deeply engaged with this space, we all agree on one thing: at the point where we actually have a scalable humanoid robotics platform, fully scalable that has met all the KPI thresholds… we will start a 10–15 year supply-demand imbalance, where it doesn’t matter how much you can manufacture,” – Chris Camillo , Renowned Robotic Investor Camilllo explained that the difficulty lies in deployment, not production, and pointed out the integration challenges companies face when adopting generalized robotics. He cited that it’s hard to deploy generalized robots at Walmart, FedEx, or Coca-Cola, and that it will take years of strategic work, integration, preparing a workforce, and digitizing inventory before incorporating humanoid robots into the manufacturing floor or attempting to do anything. Both Camillio and Brooks point out that much of the investor community currently fails to appreciate how long and complex the process will be. As a result, while humanoid robots may eventually play a role in global industries, the timeline for real-world value may be far longer than they predict.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/did-swift-just-eat-ripples-lunch-heres-the-latest/,"A quiet but powerful shift is brewing in the global payments industry. For years, blockchain enthusiasts imagined a day when legacy financial networks would embrace on-chain settlement. Now, the world’s largest interbank messaging system appears to be testing that very idea—potentially reshaping the landscape that Ripple has spent more than a decade trying to dominate. A Surprise Pilot That Turned Heads A post on X by CryptosRus drew widespread attention to reports that SWIFT is piloting blockchain settlement on Linea, an Ethereum Layer-2 developed by ConsenSys. Multiple reputable sources confirm that SWIFT is experimenting with combining its trusted messaging network with atomic, on-chain settlement and stablecoin rails. If successful, the move would mark a historic step for the $150 trillion cross-border payments giant, one that could redefine how banks settle international transactions. Scale That Reframes the Competition SWIFT handles an estimated $150 trillion in global transactions each year. Even a 1% migration of that traffic to on-chain settlement represents roughly $1.5 trillion in flows—far eclipsing the $27.6 trillion total stablecoin payments recorded in 2024. DID SWIFT JUST EAT RIPPLE’S LUNCH? @Ripple spent a decade competing with SWIFT. Now SWIFT just leveled up. The $150 TRILLION payments giant is piloting blockchain settlement on ETH's L2 Linea ($LINEA). Even 1% of SWIFT volume = $1.5T on-chain flows – that’s bigger than ALL… pic.twitter.com/HmJIa1CCZG — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) September 26, 2025 These figures illustrate why market watchers are riveted: a pilot of this magnitude could dwarf the combined activity of the entire existing stablecoin ecosystem. What It Means for Ripple Ripple built its brand by offering a faster, cheaper alternative to SWIFT’s traditional messaging rails . Its XRP Ledger enables on-demand liquidity and near-instant settlement, sidestepping costly nostro/vostro accounts. But a SWIFT move into blockchain doesn’t automatically spell doom for Ripple. Different Roles: SWIFT is primarily a messaging cooperative, while Ripple provides both messaging and liquidity solutions. Market Expansion: If major banks grow comfortable with tokenized settlement because of SWIFT’s pilot, the overall market for blockchain payments could expand—leaving room for Ripple to capture new niches. Rather than a knockout punch, SWIFT’s experiment is a direct competitive test of Ripple’s long-standing thesis: that blockchain can transform cross-border payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Action Remains Resilient Despite the headlines, XRP is trading around $2.79 as of report time, showing resilience after a week of modest swings. Technical indicators suggest ongoing short-term volatility, but analysts have not linked any sudden price moves to the SWIFT news. Traders continue to monitor exchange flows, on-chain volume, and broader market sentiment to gauge whether SWIFT’s pilot will have a tangible impact on XRP demand. The Bottom Line The question—Did SWIFT just eat Ripple’s lunch?—captures the drama but oversimplifies the reality. SWIFT experimenting with Ethereum’s Linea network is the strongest institutional validation yet for on-chain settlement, but it is not the end of Ripple’s story. The next phase depends on concrete results: which banks participate, whether SWIFT adopts an interoperable settlement token, and how Ripple positions its own technology to stay indispensable. For now, CryptosRus’ post has highlighted a critical turning point. Whether it becomes a decisive shift or merely a shared milestone for the entire blockchain payments sector remains to be seen.

As Bitcoin’s fresh outlook promises a possible new bull run, intelligent money is also searching for high-upside plays beyond the flagship cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its revolutionary DeFi model and parabolic growth potential, is quickly emerging as one of the top cryptos to build up before the market’s next leg higher. Mutuum Finance is in phase 6 of its presale which is 50% sold out. The project has already raised more than $16.4 million and attracted more than 16,600 unique holders. Bitcoin’s Long-Term Outlook Grows Stronger as Analysts Set Sights on $160K and More The price action of Bitcoin continues to be a topic of interest in the market as top on-chain analyst Willy Woo gives an update to his long-term forecasts, stating the top crypto can surge to the $140,000–$160,000 range during the next cycle. Woo, who has previously referred to Bitcoin potentially reaching $250,000 to $300,000 on the back of on-chain supply shocks and ongoing long-term investor accumulation, now acknowledges the potential for even higher targets of $300,000–$400,000 if institutional inflows were to gain traction. Despite recent profit-taking, with whales selling positions close to $120,000 and rotating capital into traditional markets, Bitcoin’s fundamental foundation remains solid, underpinned by sustained inflows and tightening supply dynamics. While the pace of capital entering the market is slower than in previous cycles, analysts believe that these circumstances can still yield a considerable upside run, cementing Bitcoin’s status as a core holding even as investors diversify into riskier, higher-reward Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Skyrockets in Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sixth presale round is currently underway at a frantic pace. The project has raised over $16.4 million already and has been bought by over 16,600 holders. Participants in this round are poised to enjoy astronomical returns the instant the token gets listed on the market. Besides success in its presale, Mutuum Finance is strongly focused on building a stablecoin and balanced ecosystem on the Ethereum chain. In addition to protecting its platform, Mutuum Finance has also collaborated with CertiK to introduce a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The program seeks to invite security developers, white-hat hackers, and researchers to find bugs on the platform. The bugs are categorized as effort and risk levels: major, critical, minor, and low. This is a significant step towards protecting users’ balances and additional building of investor confidence. Mutuum Finance seeks to push the boundaries of the existing DeFi space. In community engagement, the project has launched an early investor $100,000 giveaway , and 10 winners are eligible to receive $10,000 MUTM. The project vision is to take the existing DeFi ecosystem to the limits. Being loyal to this conviction, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink price oracles for USD terms for assets, trading, and lending. It also supports assets such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. To make it reliable, the system employs fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages to fetch very precise price data even during the times of very volatile markets. The protocol is a closed-order book design with market risk aversion and illiquidity as top priorities. The protocol is implemented by a set of mechanisms like close levels, liquidation thresholds, and incentive to liquidators. Underlying volatility directly dictates the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio as well as liquidation policies: the higher, the tighter parameters and lending terms. In addition, reserve multipliers are also differentiated by asset risk weightings to bring stability, security, and resilience to the system under different circumstances in the markets. MUTM to Explode Before BTC Peaks Willy Woo’s new Bitcoin price prediction of up to $400,000 signals a strong new cycle ahead. But while BTC is always important, investors want more upside with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Already 50% sold out in Stage 6 with over $16.4 million collected and 16,600+ holders, MUTM will be one of the top altcoins to watch. Act now to buy MUTM before the presale ends and the growth opportunity skyrockets.

Its unique value proposition rests on its AI-enabled cross-chain arbitrage system, which analysts commend for its efficacy and innovation. The Competitive Edge of Lyno AI The promising Early Bird phase of Lyno AI's presale saw a price set at $0.050 per token, which was notably lower than subsequent phases with a price tag of $0.055. This strategic pricing helped in selling a staggering 793,580 tokens and raising almost $40,000. This has outperformed other competitors like Bitcoin Hyper and Ozak AI in practicality and community benefits. The Rise of AI in Blockchain: A Look at Lyno AI's Strategy Analysts who had previously accurately predicted a 150% increase in Ethereum in 2024 now point to Lyno AI as the standout presale of 2025. The platform utilizes AI-driven neural networks to execute swift and profitable cross-chain trades on networks like Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism. This method facilitates a steady ROI of 2.6% from flash loans, surpassing previous single-chain models. Investor Benefits and Community Involvement Lyno AI is not just about technology; it's about creating a community-driven ecosystem. Token holders of $LYNO play a role in governance decisions and benefit directly from 30% of protocol fees when they stake their tokens. This attractive incentive model builds on the confidence demonstrated by the rigorous audits from Cyberscope , ensuring secure and quick transactions within the blockchain network. Exclusive Presale Opportunities: Win Big with Lyno AI In a unique promotional move, Lyno AI has announced a giveaway for early supporters. Investors purchasing over $100 worth of tokens stand a chance to win a share of 100,000 tokens, creating excitement and driving early participation in the presale. This kind of incentive is aimed at bolstering early stage investment before prices surge to $0.100 after the Early Bird phase. Why Lyno AI Could Redefine Blockchain Economics The innovative use of AI for arbitrage across multiple chains sets Lyno AI apart, potentially revolutionizing blockchain economics. Investors looking for new opportunities following the explosive growth seen in coins like Solana and Avalanche should consider locking in their stake in Lyno AI during its compelling presale period.

Key Takeaways: Several major asset managers filed updated S-1s for spot Solana ETFs, with potential SEC approval expected by mid-October. The filings include staking features, signaling rising institutional demand and possible momentum for ETH ETF staking approvals. Analysts say Solana is emerging as the next altcoin for institutional adoption, with strong inflows and growing ETF interest. The comment follows a wave of amended S-1 filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday. Top Asset Managers File Updated Applications for Spot Solana ETFs In a post on X , Geraci noted that Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary Capital all filed updated documents for their proposed spot Solana ETFs. The S-1 form provides detailed disclosures on fund structure, risk, and operations. Geraci speculated that approvals could land within the next two weeks, calling October a “significant month” for digital asset products. His remarks come shortly after the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF launched in the US, debuting on the Cboe BZX Exchange with $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in first-day inflows. The ETF momentum around Solana aligns with recent market commentary positioning SOL as the next crypto asset poised for institutional adoption. Another flurry of S-1 amendments filed today on spot sol ETFs… Franklin, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, & Canary. Includes staking (yes, bodes well for spot eth ETF staking). Guessing these are approved w/in next two weeks. pic.twitter.com/g13NDFKSEU — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 26, 2025 Pantera Capital described Solana as “next in line” following under-allocation compared to Bitcoin and Ether. Bitwise CIO Hunter Horsley added that the firm’s European-listed Solana staking ETP recorded $60 million in inflows over five trading days—evidence that “Solana is on people’s minds.” Geraci also noted that the inclusion of staking language in U.S. filings may be a positive signal for the long-delayed approval of spot Ethereum ETFs with staking features. Ether ETF applicants have long pushed for the ability to offer yield via staking, which analysts say could “reshape the market.” While the SEC has not yet given the green light for staking in US-listed Ether ETFs, optimism is growing among issuers and analysts that broader altcoin exposure, and the ability to generate yield, could drive a new wave of investor interest. Bitcoin ETFs Hold Over 1.47M BTC Bitcoin exchange-traded products now hold over 1.47 million BTC , representing around 7% of the total supply, with U.S.-based ETFs dominating the landscape. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at nearly 199,500 BTC, according to data from HODL15Capital. AUGUST Global Bitcoin ETF update pic.twitter.com/6VkRsTmOU2 — HODL15Capital (@HODL15Capital) September 2, 2025 However, momentum appears to be cooling. In August, Bitcoin ETPs saw $301 million in outflows, while Ethereum funds attracted $3.95 billion. Whale activity mirrors this shift, with several large holders rotating hundreds of millions from BTC into ETH ahead of key ETF developments and the historically weak September trading month. As reported, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing 92 crypto ETF applications , according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. A detailed spreadsheet published on August 28 shows most of these filings, especially those linked to Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, are facing final decisions by October. The wave of new applications reflects growing interest in altcoin-focused ETFs and could spark fresh capital inflows into the crypto market.

Its Early Bird presale phase has tokens at a price of $0.050, lower than the next phase price of $0.055 with the momentum already noted by 793,580 tokens sold and almost 40,000 raised. This analyzes the reasons why Lyno AI is more effective than the competition such as Bitcoin Hyper, Ozak AI, etc., based on practical applications and benefits of the community. Missed Ethereum? Lyno AI’s AI Bots Are Serving Multi-Chain Profits—Get In Now! Analysts that correctly forecasted 150% Ethereum increase in 2024 are now pointing to Lyno AI as the hottest presale in 2025. To maximize Flash loans, the site runs neural networks powered by AI to provide steady 2.6 percent ROI through rapid, cross-chain trades on successful Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks. By contrast to earlier single-chain efforts like Remittix, Lyno AI can attain genuine multi-chain arbitrage, which can be profitable to regular investors, without necessarily having whale-style capital needs. Stake $LYNO, Earn 30% Fees—Join the Community Driving the Next Crypto Boom! The Lyno AI is a community-driven ecosystem and not merely technology. The owners of the $LYNO token are a part of a governance, having an impact on upgrades and fee models. Moreover, the direct reward to investors is a 30-percent share of protocol fees upon staking $LYNO. With Solana exploding its DEX volume to over $100 billion during ETF mania, the multi-layer security and audited smart contracts of Lyno AI that are audited by Cyberscope would guarantee investor confidence without compromising quick trade transactions. Buy $LYNO Early—Snag 10,000 Tokens Before Prices Surge! In an additional effort to motivate presale participants, Lyno AI provides a special giveaway, such that investors who buy more than $100 in tokens are entitled to a prospect of winning a portion of a 100K pool. Ten fortunate investors will each be granted 10,000 $LYNO tokens, which will generate an additional sense of urgency to be among the first ones to join. The final price will be of 0.100 and the Early Bird price will be 0.050, which will be a very good entry point before the next stage will rise at 0.055. 2025’s Hottest Presale: Lyno AI’s AI Arbitrage Could Explode—Don’t Miss Out! This is a rare opportunity that investors who have missed out on the rocket ship of coin growth such as Solana and Avalanche have with Lyno AI.

Algorand historic price sentiment ALGO price chart by CoinGecko Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June.

Crypto.com has recently made a significant announcement that could reshape how many U.S. investors interact with digital assets. The platform has officially secured a crucial Crypto.com margin derivatives license from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). What Does This Crypto.com Margin Derivatives License Mean? This isn’t just another regulatory hurdle cleared; it’s a major step forward for Crypto.com and its users. The license empowers Crypto.com Derivatives North America (CDNA), a subsidiary, to legally offer margin derivatives. These products are based on a variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies. For traders, this development means access to more sophisticated financial tools. Margin derivatives allow investors to potentially amplify their returns, but they also come with increased risks. It’s a testament to Crypto.com’s commitment to expanding its offerings within a regulated framework. Why is CFTC Approval a Big Deal for Crypto.com? Obtaining approval from the CFTC is a rigorous process. It signals that Crypto.com has met stringent regulatory standards designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity. This level of oversight can build greater trust among institutional and retail investors who have been cautious about the less regulated aspects of the crypto market. Enhanced Credibility: Operating under CFTC supervision boosts Crypto.com’s standing in the U.S. financial landscape. Broader Market Access: It opens doors for more traditional investors to engage with crypto assets through regulated products. Consumer Protection: Regulatory frameworks aim to ensure fair practices and provide recourse for users. How Do Margin Derivatives Work in Crypto? Margin derivatives are financial instruments that allow traders to speculate on the future price movements of an underlying asset, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, without owning the asset itself. ""Margin"" refers to borrowing funds to increase your trading position beyond what your own capital would allow. For example, if you believe the price of Bitcoin will rise, you could use a margin derivative to open a larger position than your initial investment. If the price moves in your favor, your profits are magnified. However, if the price moves against you, your losses can also be magnified, potentially exceeding your initial investment. It is crucial to understand these risks before engaging in such trading activities. Benefits and Challenges of Expanded Offerings The introduction of a Crypto.com margin derivatives license brings both exciting opportunities and important considerations. Benefits: Increased Capital Efficiency: Traders can control larger positions with a smaller initial capital outlay. Diversification of Strategies: Provides more tools for hedging existing portfolios or speculating on market trends. Market Maturity: The availability of regulated derivatives contributes to the overall maturity and sophistication of the U.S. crypto market. Challenges: Higher Risk: Margin trading involves leverage, which can lead to significant losses if the market moves unfavorably. Regulatory Scrutiny: While approved, derivatives markets are always under close watch by regulators like the CFTC. Complexity: These products require a deeper understanding of financial markets and risk management. What’s Next for Crypto.com and U.S. Traders? With the Crypto.com margin derivatives license now in hand, the platform is poised to roll out these new offerings. This move positions Crypto.com as a key player in the evolving U.S. crypto regulatory landscape. It also sets a precedent for other platforms seeking to offer similar advanced trading products. U.S. traders who are interested in exploring margin derivatives should ensure they have a solid understanding of the risks involved. Education and responsible trading practices will be paramount as these new opportunities become available. In conclusion, Crypto.com’s achievement of securing a U.S. margin derivatives license from the CFTC is a landmark event. It signifies a significant expansion of services for U.S. users, offering more advanced trading options within a regulated environment. While these tools present exciting possibilities for sophisticated traders, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making and robust risk management. This move not only benefits Crypto.com but also contributes to the growing legitimacy and sophistication of the cryptocurrency market in the United States.

The majority of analysts now expect Pi Coin to face stronger headwinds, with nearly 90% of expert polls pointing to further declines by 2026. Some investors have already started considering newer projects like Remittix (RTX) , which has been steadily gaining traction at a price of $0.1130 per token. This contrast between an old token losing faith and a new DeFi project building steam is shaping the crypto narrative today. Pi Network Price Prediction: Why Faith Is Eroding Pi Coin garnered interest over the years as a mobile mining experiment, but the failure to see adoption in the real world has cast doubt. Now trading at $0.2633, Pi has fallen by 1.64% over the last day, amid softer sentiment. With a dubious roadmap and questions over scalability, market players anticipate additional selling pressure. The project’s market capitalization stands at $2.15 billion now, but skeptics argue that the valuation is hard to sustain without broader utility. The daily trading volume has risen by 16.85% to $55.67 million, but much of it is also apparently speculative in nature. This is why the Pi Network Price Prediction sees further weakness. Investors who once considered Pi a long-term play now question whether it has a role to play in the crypto ecosystem. With the next big altcoin story evolving, many are considering alternatives with stronger fundamentals and real-world use cases. Remittix Stands Out As A Real-World Utility Project Unlike Pi Coin, Remittix was developed to solve real-world problems in cross-border payments. With over $26.7 million raised and 672 million tokens sold, RTX is among the best crypto presales of 2025. That it has upcoming listings on both BitMart and LBANK says a lot about the interest and work that has gone into the project. Remittix is also releasing its wallet in beta, bringing usable functions pre-launch. This makes RTX one of the earlier-stage crypto investments already showing product development before listing on centralized exchanges. Why Remittix Is Getting Ahead Ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens $26.7M+ raised with strong community backing Confirmed upcoming listings on Tier 1 exchanges $250,000 giveaway to early users CertiK Verification Provides Additional Investor Confidence Security is top priority in upcoming crypto projects, and Remittix has taken a giant step by becoming fully verified by CertiK. This makes it a crypto with real utility, not just another speculative launch. Being at the very top of pre-launch projects also speaks volumes about its legitimacy. In addition to presale success, Remittix provides low gas fee crypto transfers, staking, and a 15% USDT referral program. These position RTX as both a top DeFi altcoin and a long-term ecosystem play. The Pi Network Price Prediction continues to highlight the risks as Pi Coin is struggling to find its use case. While traders debate its future, Remittix has already garnered early adoption traction and strong investor confidence. With exchange listings pending, audited security, and global payment utility, RTX is set to define the next big crypto launch of 2025.

In its recent statement, the company mentioned that it will test out the AI music host feature, noting that it will provide relevant stories, fan trivia, and commentary about whatever a user is listening to. The move comes two years after Spotify announced the launch of its AI DJ, a feature where it delivers a curated selection of music alongside AI-powered spoken commentary about the tracks and artists that users are interested in. At the time, Spotify claimed the idea behind the feature was to ensure that it was aware of the taste of its users when it comes to music, so the DJ can choose what to play when they hit the button. The company said it was like having an “AI DJ in your pocket.” YouTube Music to test its new AI host feature In its blog post , YouTube claims its new AI hosts are currently undergoing tests at YouTube Labs, its new hub for AI experiments. It also added that YouTube Labs is “a new initiative dedicated to exploring the potential of AI on YouTube.” The new AI lab is expected to share a similarity to Google Labs, Google’s experimental arm that allows users to test early-stage AI products and provide feedback. YouTube Labs is open to all users, which means that users do not need to subscribe to a premium membership to access the new hub. However, the company noted that only a limited number of its users based in the United States will be allowed to test out the experimental phase of the program. The move is in line with YouTube’s shift towards AI, with the company announcing the implementation of several AI features across the main YouTube application. Earlier this month, the company announced the release of a series of AI tools for creators , including GenAI tools for Shorts creation. YouTube is deploying a custom version of Veo 3, Google’s text-to-video generative AI model, to Shorts. In addition, it will add a new remixing tool, an “Edit with AI” feature, and many other tools. With the custom version, Veo 3 Fast, creators can apply motions from a video to an image, add different styles to their videos, and insert objects into the video with a simple text prompt. New features and a crackdown on AI slop Creators can also change the dialogue from eligible videos into soundtracks for other Shorts using Google’s AI music model, Lyria 2. The company also showed off new and updated tools in its Studio, where creators can manage their channels and track analytics. It also said its likeness detection feature, which was announced last year, is now in open beta. The feature is expected to help people flag and remove any unauthorized videos using their facial likeness. Other features include a countdown timer for new releases for YouTube Music and a chance for users to release thank you videos. The company is also exploring a pilot program for US listeners that will allow them to access exclusive merchandise drops from artists. Also, video podcast creators in the US will be able to create clips more easily with AI suggestions, according to YouTube. A new feature that will turn audio podcasts into video podcasts is also expected to be released next year, the company said. While YouTube is embracing AI through the deployment of these new features, it is also cracking down on AI slop. The company recently updated its policies to crack down on creators generating revenue from inauthentic content, including mass-produced videos and other types of repetitive content.

52337058,591078,1758973860,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52337058.jpeg,"Mike Novogratz Sees Bitcoin at $200,000 Following Powell’s Replacement, as Bitcoin Hyper Soars",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-could-reach-200000-following-powells-replacement/,"Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz predicts a $200,000 Bitcoin if Jerome Powell’s replacement is dovish. The comment came during an interview with Kyle Chasse, where Novogratz declared: Trump told us he wants a dove in the Fed And if he picks a dove enough of a person, there’s gonna be an ‘oh s**t’ moment. Gold skyrockets, Bitcoin skyrockets. — Mike Novogratz, Kye Chasse interview As Novogratz sees it, Fed’s next chair nominee could serve as the largest crypto catalyst, potentially pushing Bitcoin to a new ATH by the end of the year. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $18.5M presale will also contribute to that thanks to its promise of turning the Bitcoin network faster and cheaper. Hyper’s Layer 2 aims to solve Bitcoin’s native performance limitation, which would turn the network more feasible for institutional investors. The Fed Turns Bitcoin Stronger at the Expense of the US Dollar Novogratz warns against a dangerous tipping of balance between crypto and the US dollar stemming from the Fed’s rate cuts. While rate cuts are bullish for Bitcoin, they’re bearish for the US dollar, because it scares away investors who seek refuge in high risk, high reward digital assets. The last FOMC meeting, which took place on September 17, had the opposite effect, though, with the US dollar jumping almost 2 basis points over the following week, while Bitcoin lost 5.4% between then and today. The meeting resulted in a 0.25% rate cut , which didn’t seem to raise the investors’ interest, but the next ones might. The Fed announced three more cuts coming, two by the end of this year and one more in 2026. The closest one is planned for October 28 and it’s an almost guarantee if we go by FedWatch’s market sentiment, which puts the odds of a favorable decision at 87.7% . And this time we expect Bitcoin to recover its lost territory and make a breakthrough for another ATH. With $120K cleared, a push to $130K and beyond is more than feasible. Mid-October is the true test if Michael Saylor’s Strategy decides to buy the dip, which is more than likely given that Bitcoin is currently in consolidation mode, floating around the $109K zone for over two days. This hints at a dying bear momentum, which Strategy could capitalize on to push its treasury above 640,000 $BTC. With a bullish Bitcoin for October and the crypto market on the verge of a coming alt season, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) appears to be the biggest winner. How Bitcoin Hyper Could Turn Bitcoin Into the Future of the Financial Sector Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 upgrade that promises to transform Bitcoin into the driving force behind the new global financial system. Hyper seeks to solve the very problem that’s holding Bitcoin back in 2025: its native performance limitation. The Bitcoin network is currently limited to seven transactions per second (TPS), which places Bitcoin on the 23rd position on the list of the fastest blockchains in the world. By comparison, BNB is second with a TPS of 220, while Solana is second with a real-time TPS of up to 1,000 and a theoretical one of 65,000. A change is necessary and Hyper brings just that with the help of tools like Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge. While SVM allows for the ultra-fast execution of DeFi apps and smart contracts, the Canonical Bridge handles network congestion and addresses transaction finality times directly. The Canonical Bridge works by minting the users’ tokens onto the Hyper layer, allowing investors to use their $BTC in the Hyper ecosystem. These tools allow Hyper to boost Bitcoin’s performance by improving scalability and allowing for near-instant finality thanks to the Bitcoin Relay Program and the zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. Most importantly, Hyper eliminates the fee-based priority system, which prioritizes larger and more fee-heavy transactions to the detriment of the smaller and cheaper ones. This system currently increases transaction confirmation times to hours in some cases. Long-term, Hyper hopes to turn the Bitcoin network into a more feasible choice for institutional investors who process thousands of transactions per second. The $18.5M presale offers $HYPER at $0.012985 per token, which translates into a potential wealth-building investment opportunity. Given Hyper’s projected long-term utility and investor support during the presale, our price prediction for $HYPER puts the token at $0.32 by the end of the year, following a Q4 release. Continuous support and successful implementation could lead to mainstream adoption, pushing $HYPER up to $1.50 or higher by 2030. This translates to a 11,451% five-year ROI if you invest at today’s price. If you’d like to support $HYPER or simply diversify your portfolio, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER and go to the presale page today. This isn’t financial advice.

In private messages shared by The Rage, Dashjr appears to acknowledge that current filtering methods are not sufficient. There has long been a debate within the Bitcoin ecosystem between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots regarding the place of non-monetary data, often referred to as “spam,” on the blockchain. The Core team proposes increasing the op_return size to move such transactions to a more secure environment, while the Knots side argues that non-monetary data should not be included in Bitcoin at all. Dashjr's Knots client implements a mechanism to filter certain types of data before it enters the node pool. The debate has evolved over time from preventing harmless data to more serious claims that nodes should not contain illicit data. However, experts argue that this approach is technically infeasible, as current consensus rules require all nodes to maintain a validated block. According to leaked messages, Dashjr is suggesting a multi-signature committee as a solution. In this proposed system, a designated group of individuals can retroactively review data on the blockchain and replace sections they identify as “illegal content” with zero-knowledge proofs. This allows node operators to remove the relevant data from the blockchain while preserving the validity of the transaction. Related News: What's the Latest on Solana? Analysis Firm Issues Warning - “It Shouldn't Fall Below This Level” “The only options we have right now are for BTC to die or we have to rely on someone else,” Dashjr wrote in his messages. Implementing this proposal would require a Bitcoin hard fork. However, this approach poses a serious contradiction to Bitcoin's core principles. Critics argue that such a committee would have the power to remove not only CSAM but also any “unwanted” data in the future, undermining Bitcoin's censorship resistance. They also warn that node operators could face legal risks if they fail to comply with the committee's demands. *This is not investment advice.

52337328,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84516,1758974368,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Europe’s Digital Euro Push Meets Altcoin Surge,https://timestabloid.com/europes-digital-euro-push-meets-altcoin-surge/,"Europe is rapidly accelerating its plans for a digital euro as a counterbalance to U.S.-dominated global payment systems. In a recent address at Bloomberg’s Future of Finance event, ECB board member Piero Cipollone confirmed that the European Central Bank is aiming for a 2029 launch of a digital euro. Key euro-institutions like the European Parliament, European Council, and European Commission are expected to have their stances aligned by May 2026, after which joint legislation will begin. Once that legal framework is in place, full implementation is estimated to take 2.5 to 3 years. Central to this push is strategic autonomy: reducing Europe’s reliance on Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and other U.S.-based payment and card networks. Finance ministers across the EU have emphasized that the digital euro should be independent and resilient. Meanwhile, there are active debates over privacy rules, how large digital euro balances can be for individuals, and ensuring offline functionality. At the same time, crypto markets are seeing renewed energy among presale projects, and among these MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a rising contender. Europe’s Digital Euro: Balancing Innovation and Sovereignty The digital euro project has entered its preparation phase , which began in late 2023, and is now moving into detailed legal and technical alignment. EU finance ministers are working to produce a common position by early 2026 so that legislation can be drafted and finalized. Main points under discussion include: Holding limits per user to preserve banking stability Privacy protections around balances and transactions Offline payment functionality for everyday resilience Momentum appears strong, driven both by geopolitical concerns and the rise of stablecoins and crypto-assets globally. European officials are determined to deliver an alternative to foreign-controlled payment systems and enhance the euro’s global role. There is also recognition that payments and finance are increasingly digital-first, meaning Europe cannot afford to lag behind the United States or China in this domain. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Altcoin Rising at the Right Time The European Central Bank’s push for a digital euro is dominating headlines, but investors aren’t just watching central banks, they’re chasing speculative upside where the real multipliers live. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as that breakout candidate. Its presale just crossed another funding milestone, with daily inflows hitting fresh highs this week. Analysts note that projects with similar traction in past cycles went on to deliver 47x returns once listings arrived. What’s striking about MAGACOIN FINANCE is how its politically charged branding has turned into a magnet for new wallet sign-ups, climbing steadily across Telegram and X in the last 72 hours. With stages selling out faster and demand compounding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as the kind of asymmetric play investors seek when macro headlines push digital adoption forward. How These Developments Intersect There is a clear link between Europe’s push for a digital euro and the momentum behind altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Both reflect the same broad theme: a shift in how people, institutions, and even governments engage with digital assets. Europe’s digital euro strengthens infrastructure and regulatory clarity, which benefits the broader crypto environment. Altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE ride these structural waves by offering scarcity, community engagement, and early-stage entry points. The timing is powerful: as the EU builds legal frameworks for digital payments, crypto projects aligned with audits, strong supply mechanics, and cultural resonance are positioned to thrive. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid presale growth shows how quickly investor interest can mobilize around early opportunities. The Bigger Picture: Europe’s Role in the Digital Shift Beyond the ECB and EU institutions, the digital euro discussion is also about Europe’s positioning in a multipolar world. The United States enjoys dominance through the dollar and U.S.-led payment infrastructure. China, meanwhile, is aggressively pushing the digital yuan in pilot projects both domestically and abroad. For the EU, the digital euro is more than just a payments tool—it is a strategic asset designed to protect financial sovereignty and enhance competitiveness. This vision extends to trade, cross-border settlement, and financial innovation. A digital euro would reduce the region’s exposure to foreign sanctions risk and reinforce the euro’s use in global commerce. For citizens, it could mean faster, cheaper, and more secure digital payments, both online and offline. For businesses, it could lower transaction costs and build trust in Europe’s homegrown financial infrastructure. In parallel, crypto markets provide a grassroots reflection of these top-down changes. The more the world moves into digital-first finance, the more space opens for altcoins to establish themselves as cultural and financial vehicles. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise is a prime example of this grassroots momentum. Conclusion Europe’s ambition to launch a digital euro by 2029 highlights its determination to secure payment sovereignty and reduce reliance on U.S. systems. With legislation targeted for mid-2026 , the coming years will be critical in shaping Europe’s digital monetary landscape. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already emerged as a standout in crypto, raising over $14 million, surpassing 13,500 holders, and selling most of its presale allocation. Backed by audits and designed with scarcity at its core, it is increasingly viewed as a generational opportunity for forward-thinking investors. In a year where both digital sovereignty and breakout altcoins dominate the narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to capture attention as one of the defining projects to watch.

The trend grew when companies like Strategy (MSTR) started adopting bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Strategy now holds 639,835 BTC, making it the world’s largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Publicly-traded companies, as a whole, hold over 1 million BTC, but how much small and medium enterprises hold isn’t known.

Cunha said these companies aren’t chasing yield or experimenting with altcoins, but rather are focusing on BTC and stablecoins like USDT and USDC to manage their treasuries. These holdings serve conservative, cash-management purposes rather than speculative plays. The rise in institutional activity is also having a side effect: it’s reducing the overall volatility of crypto markets, Cunha said. That’s making bitcoin a more appealing option for treasurers, even asthe enterprise segment in Brazil is still just starting to adopt crypto. “The big guys in Faria Lima? They’re on the sidelines,” he said, referring to the financial district in Brazil’s largest city São Paulo often compared to Wall Street. “They haven’t moved yet. It’s all waiting to happen.”",Finance|Crypto Exchanges|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-27 12:00:00

The sell-off marks further volatility as investors consider issues like rising network fees, development of alternative Layer 2 solutions, and transaction efficiency variance. Even with the challenges, Ethereum is still a foundation for decentralized finance, backing up millions of apps and smart contracts keeping it at the center of the broader blockchain universe. But the volatility in the market in recent times has also directed investor interests towards presales and upcoming crypto ventures such as Remittix (RTX) that are making waves by concentrating on actual payment modes. Ethereum price and market conditions Ethereum Price stands at $4,052.4, a decline of 1.28% in the previous 24 hours. With a market cap of $474.54 billion, Ethereum is still the smart contract leader. Trading volume has increased as well, with daily volume of $59.7 billion, an 18.22% rise, reflecting high demand with short-run price pressure. This volatility is a reflection of increased uncertainty across digital assets. While Ethereum has its established base in DeFi to lean on, Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives and low gas price crypto projects are forcing investors to be receptive to diversification. The majority are leveraging presales and nascent-stage crypto investment opportunities as hedges amid volatile market cycles. Remittix presale growth and real-world utility Remittix (RTX) is one of the best crypto presales for 2025, at a mere $0.1130 per token . The firm has already raised in excess of $26.7 million and sold more than 672 million tokens. The achievement has already seen announcements of future listings on BitMart and LBank, two of the top centralized exchanges that will bring liquidity and visibility once RTX is live. Remittix is building a cross-chain DeFi platform that enables direct crypto-to-bank money transfers in 30+ countries. The beta test for its wallet is already live, allowing community members to try out its payment features. This focus on crypto solving real-world problems gives RTX an edge over purely speculative coins. Why Remittix is gaining traction $26.7Million+ raised with 672Million+ tokens sold Wallet beta testing global transfers Future listings on BitMart and LBank $250,000 giveaway and 15% referral rewards CertiK verification and investor confidence Confidence in Remittix grew after CertiK, the leading blockchain security auditor, verified the entire team. RTX is currently #1 on pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet, proving its legitimacy as investors seek the next big altcoin 2025. With Ethereum prices both resilient and fluctuating, newer presales like Remittix (RTX) are attracting the eye of investors with real-world utility and growing momentum. Featuring a live wallet in beta, multiple upcoming exchange listings, CertiK certification, and robust presale demand, RTX is transforming into a cryptocurrency with real utility and a promising contender within the fastest-growing crypto 2025.

52337823,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=821402,1758974457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52337823.jpeg,Wall Street banks expect the euro to climb past $1.20 soon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-euro-rally-extending-past-1-20/,"Wall Street is betting that the euro rally still has legs. The currency has already surged over 12% this year, and big-name banks now say that’s just the beginning. According to the Financial Times, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and UBS all believe the euro will push beyond $1.20 in the next few months as global investors keep hedging against the U.S. dollar and interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve weigh on greenback demand. Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, described the current surge as a “global euro moment.” And it’s not just because of stronger sentiment around the Eurozone economy. Analysts say part of the rally comes from growing unease with President Donald Trump’s economic agenda. The euro even topped $1.19 this month, hitting a level not seen in four years before dipping slightly to $1.17. But traders and strategists say that dip isn’t the end, it’s just a pause. Pension funds raise hedging bets as interest gap narrows Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said the massive repositioning away from the dollar is still in its early stages. “We’ve just seen the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “That’s at the helm of the dollar weakness we’ve seen, and there’s more to come.” The surge in demand for the euro is being driven by investors using contracts to hedge their dollar exposure, and the movement has gained speed as big institutions, especially pension funds, start to ramp up those hedges from very low levels. The cost of those hedges depends heavily on the interest rate difference between the U.S. and the Eurozone. With the Fed continuing to lower rates , that gap is narrowing. Jackie Bowie, who leads Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at Chatham Financial, said, “As that interest rate differential closes, [hedging] potentially becomes more palatable to put in place.” When holding dollars becomes less profitable, hedging makes more sense, and that’s fueling more buying of the euro. Forecasts are bullish. Goldman Sachs thinks the euro could hit $1.25 within a year. JPMorgan is aiming for $1.22 by March. UBS is calling for $1.23 before the end of this year. A survey compiled by Bloomberg shows most banks expect the currency to push past $1.20 by the third quarter of next year. But that kind of appreciation isn’t without consequences. Stronger currencies hurt exporters, and Europe’s manufacturers are already feeling the squeeze. They’ve warned that a prolonged rally would cut deep into their profits. Rising euro raises concern inside the ECB and among exporters Inside the European Central Bank, the conversation is getting complicated. Tomasz Wieladek, chief European macro strategist at T Rowe Price, called $1.20 a “line in the sand.” Luis de Guindos, who sits on the ECB’s rate-setting committee, warned back in July that anything above $1.20 would make things “much more complicated.” The concern isn’t just about exports. A stronger euro puts downward pressure on inflation, which could force the ECB to consider cutting rates just to cool the currency down. Not everyone inside the central bank is on edge, though. Dominic Bunning, who heads G10 FX strategy at Nomura, said a slow climb in the euro wouldn’t trigger alarm bells. He argued that if domestic demand stays strong, the appreciation could actually help by easing inflation pressures. But he also made it clear that if the euro jumps too fast while demand weakens, “currency strength [would be] exacerbating disinflationary tendencies.” Some banks are betting in the other direction. Citi, for example, expects the euro to drop toward $1.10 in the next 6 to 12 months. They say signs of a rebound in the U.S. economy could reverse recent trends. But most analysts aren’t buying it. Instead, they’re pointing to what they see as a deeper change. A June survey from OMFIF, a think-tank focused on central banking, found that reserve currency managers plan to increase their euro holdings over the next couple of years. Wieladek called it a structural move. “Euro appreciation is a structural story, as reserve currency managers begin to pivot out of the US and the Fed cuts rates,” he said. For now, Wall Street’s bets are clear.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-has-a-price-gap-sitting-between-2-73-and-2-51-heres-the-significance/,"Markets often look calm until they encounter a stretch of thin liquidity—a zone where few trades have ever taken place and prices can move with surprising speed. For XRP traders, one such area has just come into focus, and it’s drawing close attention across the crypto community. Ali Identifies a Key Liquidity Gap Respected market analyst Ali recently highlighted a notable “price gap” on XRP’s chart, pinpointing the range between $2.73 and $2.51. In a widely shared post on X, Ali demonstrated that this band has experienced minimal historical trading activity, making it vulnerable to sudden price movements. Why This Zone Matters Price gaps form when there is little recorded buying or selling within a specific range, creating what technicians call a “low-volume node.” When markets revisit these areas, there are fewer standing orders to slow momentum. $XRP has a price gap sitting between $2.73 and $2.51. pic.twitter.com/T1100MsSBc — Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 That means XRP could slide rapidly through the $2.73–$2.51 corridor if selling pressure increases—or rally just as quickly if strong demand drives it upward. Analysts point to on-chain data showing sparse historical supply in this band, reinforcing the view that it represents a genuine pocket of thin liquidity rather than a charting quirk. Current Market Snapshot As of report time, XRP trades around $2.78, maintaining a cautious uptrend after a volatile week. Price action remains just above the upper edge of Ali’s gap, with daily charts showing steady but modest swings. Broader crypto sentiment and ETF-related flows continue to guide short-term direction, yet traders are watching closely for any decisive move toward the gap’s boundary that could trigger a sharper reaction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Traders The gap itself does not predict which way XRP will move; it signals how quickly price could travel if it enters that zone. A dip into the corridor might send the token swiftly toward the lower limit near $2.51 because of limited buyer interest. Conversely, a firm bounce above $2.73 would show that buyers are willing to defend higher ground, suggesting stronger underlying demand. Analysts advise monitoring exchange order books, volume spikes, and on-chain liquidity to gauge which scenario gains traction. The Takeaway Ali’s analysis shines a spotlight on a technical weak spot that could dictate XRP’s next major move. Whether the market falls into the gap or repels it, this narrow range now serves as an important reference point for traders seeking to anticipate volatility. For investors and short-term speculators alike, the $2.73–$2.51 zone is more than just numbers on a chart—it’s a potential gateway to XRP’s next burst of momentum.

Ji Yue, once hyped as the next big EV name, collapsed within six months and left people like Li Hongxing with millions in debt. Li, who runs an ad agency, said he borrowed money to cover campaign costs for Ji Yue in 2024. “It was a feeling of sheer despair,” he said after the company vanished without paying him back. He’s still chasing 40 million yuan, about $5.6 million. Carmakers squeeze suppliers as margins vanish Nearly 500 domestic EV brands once crowded China’s market at its peak in 2019. That number has dropped, but over 150 brands and more than 50 EV makers are still stuck fighting to survive. The problem is simple: too many players, not enough profits. Car companies are locked in endless price wars. They force suppliers to cut prices, extend payment terms, and eat the losses. Some suppliers are still waiting for checks that should have come months ago. Carl Cheng, an insurance manager in the EV sector, said it plainly: “Suppliers have little choice but to quietly accept unfavorable terms. If you walk away, there are plenty of others ready to step in.” According to him, automakers demand 10% price cuts every year. One coating supplier in Wuhan dropped prices by 40% just to stay in business. With no margin left, they slashed worker pay by 30% and brought in temps to keep production running. The obsession with cost-cutting means automakers have stopped caring about innovation. Quality is dropping across the board. And even after cutting corners, profit margins are sinking. Average margins fell to 4.3% last year, down from 8% in 2017. Half of China’s manufacturing capacity sits unused. Despite that, carmakers keep raising new money to cover losses and stay afloat. “A lot of EV makers are actually running at a loss right now,” said Shen Hong, a researcher at a government-linked think tank. Li’s experience with Ji Yue is a perfect example. He signed a long-term contract with the brand in May 2024, confident in its future. But by October, he noticed red flags. Ji Yue stopped responding properly. A few weeks later, the company announced it was “restructuring.” Government cracks down as price war spirals As exports hit nearly 6 million units last year, making China the world’s top car exporter, foreign governments started pushing back. Europe, Mexico, and Canada all hit Chinese cars with new tariffs and restrictions. Meanwhile, inside the country, the government finally admitted things were out of control. In a Communist Party magazine this month, Xi Jinping said the price wars needed to stop. Beijing has called in auto execs for warnings, told local governments to pull back subsidies, and ordered carmakers to pay suppliers within 60 days. But experts aren’t impressed. “Just cutting capacity will not be a perfect solution,” said Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley. Killing off companies too quickly could trigger mass job losses. China’s auto industry employs over 4.8 million people, and the Party doesn’t want to risk social unrest. The government also launched an “anti-involution” campaign, targeting what it calls excessive, self-defeating competition. But nothing’s changed much on the ground. Cheng said, “Compared with before, I don’t think the current price war has eased much at all.” Automakers are finding workarounds, launching cheaper models, offering free upgrades, and skipping the obvious price cuts to dodge government attention. Claire Yuan, an analyst at S&P Global, said carmakers are likely to keep playing this game. Vincent Sun, from Morningstar, doesn’t see relief coming soon either. Shen said administrative orders won’t be enough. And Ahya warned that fixing EV overcapacity will be harder than expected since private firms make up the bulk of the sector. Even He Xiaopeng, founder of leading EV brand Xpeng, admitted on a podcast in August: “I think the knock-out rounds in China’s auto industry will go on for another five years. There will likely be only five of them left.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Market analysts attribute this surge to a combination of favorable regulatory frameworks and strategic partnerships with key local banks, which have collectively enhanced investor confidence and mainstream accessibility. Thailand’s regulatory environment has been notably supportive of digital assets, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand providing clear guidelines for cryptocurrency operations. This transparency has encouraged both retail and institutional investors to participate in the market, reducing uncertainty and creating a more stable investment landscape. XRP, in particular, has benefited from these policies due to its strong utility in cross-border payments and financial settlements, aligning seamlessly with Thailand’s ambitions to modernize its banking infrastructure. Equally significant are XRP’s strategic alliances with leading Thai banks. By integrating XRP into their payment and remittance systems, these institutions are able to offer faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions for both domestic and international transfers. This explains why XRP continues to be the crypto king on Thai soil with Asia increasingly becoming a hub for cryptocurrency adoption. Therefore, RippleXity highlights that XRP’s 390% surge underscores Thailand’s rise as a blockchain adoption hub, driven by strategic regulations and key industry partnerships. XRP on the Verge of a Major Move as Pressure Builds Market analyst Leandrocrypto has highlighted a critical juncture for XRP, noting that the cryptocurrency is approaching a decisive breakout point. Based on the weekly chart analysis , XRP is currently under significant pressure, squeezed between persistent selling above and a strong support level at $2.70. Support at $2.70 has held strongly, showing buyers defending this key level. If sustained, it could spark a bullish reversal, but a break below may trigger a deeper pullback and short-term market pressure. On the other hand, XRP has been forming lower highs, signaling capped upward momentum. This compression against strong support creates a 'squeeze,' often a precursor to a sharp, volatile breakout as sidelined traders rush in. As a result, Leandrocrypto warns the XRP market is at a critical juncture. A breakout could spark a rally toward multi-week highs, while a breach of $2.70 support risks a sharp retracement. Traders are closely watching for the next move with price presently at $2.78. Conclusion XRP’s 390% surge in Thailand showcases how favorable regulations, strategic banking partnerships, and real-world blockchain use can drive adoption, spotlighting Thailand as a model for transforming cross-border payments and financial infrastructure. On the other hand, XRP finds itself at a crossroads with the level to watch being $2.70 because breaking above or below it could trigger the next major rally or correction. With pressure mounting and momentum tightening, a pivotal breakout is imminent.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 12:19:14

Looking back, ARB had a steep decline in April, which saw it register its lowest price since launch at $0.245. It has since recovered the losses. ARB 1-day chart analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView ARB has support at $0.380 and trades below its 3-day SMA ($0.5080), signaling a general bearish market. The MACD histogram (-0.0043) confirms waning negative momentum, while the RSI (37.41) is in neutral territory. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. The move comes despite an attempted ARB recovery in the last 48 hours. Arbitrum price 4-hour chart price analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that ARB registers positive momentum and that its volatility is dropping.

Arbitrum remains bearish despite an attempted recovery in the last 48 hours. The coin trades below its 3-day SMA, suggesting that traders are preferring to close their positions. Why is ARB down? ARB’s decline reflects a mix of technical breakdowns while ecosystem developments like VanEck’s ETF provide long-term upside; near-term risks dominate. Recent news The Arbitrum DAO has unveiled “Season One” of its DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP), which introduces a reward system for specific assets and activities across the Arbitrum ecosystem instead of focusing on individual decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future?

Are you an Ethereum enthusiast, an investor, or simply curious about the future of digital finance? You’ve landed in the right place. The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic, often unpredictable, but few assets capture the imagination quite like Ethereum. Its foundational role in the decentralized ecosystem makes its future trajectory a topic of intense discussion and analysis. We’re here to dive deep into the Ethereum price prediction for the coming years, exploring the factors that could propel ETH to unprecedented heights, potentially even reaching the coveted $10,000 mark. From its groundbreaking smart contract capabilities to its position as the backbone of Web3, Ethereum is more than just a digital currency; it’s a platform for innovation. But what does the future hold for this crypto giant? Let’s unpack the possibilities, analyze the market, and project where ETH might be headed between 2025 and 2030. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025: Navigating the Bullish Horizon The year 2025 is often seen as a critical juncture for many cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum is no exception. Several factors will likely influence the Ethereum price prediction during this period. The ongoing evolution of the Ethereum network, particularly its scalability and efficiency improvements, will play a significant role. The shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with The Merge was a monumental step, reducing energy consumption and paving the way for future upgrades. By 2025, we anticipate further enhancements through the ‘Surge,’ ‘Verge,’ ‘Purge,’ and ‘Splurge’ phases. These upgrades aim to: Increase transaction speed and throughput (Surge). Improve decentralization and censorship resistance (Verge). Streamline historical data storage (Purge). Enhance network functionality and security (Splurge). The widespread adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon will also contribute to Ethereum’s utility, making it more accessible and affordable for everyday use. As more users and developers flock to the network, demand for ETH, which is used for gas fees and staking, is expected to rise. This increased utility and reduced supply pressure from staking could create a powerful bullish scenario for the ETH price . Analysts often project a conservative range for 2025, but significant breakthroughs in adoption could push prices beyond initial expectations. Understanding the Fundamentals: What Drives ETH Price? To make an informed Ethereum price prediction , one must understand the core drivers behind the ETH price . Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by a unique blend of technological innovation, market sentiment, and network utility. Here are the primary factors: Supply and Demand Dynamics: Ethereum’s tokenomics, particularly after EIP-1559 and The Merge, have introduced a deflationary mechanism. A portion of transaction fees is burned, reducing the total supply of ETH. Coupled with increased demand from DeFi, NFTs, and dApps, this supply-demand imbalance can drive prices up. Network Activity and Adoption: The number of active addresses, daily transactions, and total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols on Ethereum directly reflects its utility. Higher activity signals a healthy, growing ecosystem, which positively impacts the ETH price. Staking Rewards and Yield: With Proof-of-Stake, ETH holders can stake their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards. This incentivizes holding ETH, reducing the circulating supply and adding another layer of demand. Technological Upgrades: As mentioned, Ethereum’s roadmap for scalability, security, and sustainability is a constant catalyst. Each successful upgrade enhances the network’s capabilities, attracting more users and developers. Developer Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community in the crypto space. This vibrant ecosystem ensures continuous innovation, new applications, and a robust platform that maintains its competitive edge. These fundamentals paint a picture of a resilient and evolving asset, making a strong case for its long-term value appreciation. The continued growth of these underlying metrics is crucial for any bullish Ethereum price prediction . Crypto Market Trends: Macro Factors and Ethereum’s Resilience While Ethereum’s internal mechanics are vital, the broader crypto market trends and macroeconomic environment significantly influence the ETH price . Cryptocurrencies do not exist in a vacuum; they are increasingly intertwined with global financial markets. Here’s how macro factors play a role: Global Economic Conditions: Inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical stability can affect investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. During periods of economic uncertainty, investors might move away from volatile assets, but during times of growth, crypto often thrives. Bitcoin’s Influence: As the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s price movements often dictate the overall direction of the crypto market. Ethereum, while a leader in its own right, tends to follow Bitcoin’s general trends. Institutional Adoption: Growing interest from institutional investors, hedge funds, and corporations adds legitimacy and capital to the market. Products like spot Ethereum ETFs, if approved, could unlock massive institutional demand. Regulatory Landscape: Clarity or uncertainty in cryptocurrency regulations across major economies can cause significant price swings. Favorable regulations can foster growth, while restrictive ones can create headwinds. Technological Innovation Across the Industry: While Ethereum is a leader, competition from other Layer 1 blockchains (Solana, Avalanche, Cardano) and Layer 2 solutions keeps the market dynamic. Ethereum’s ability to maintain its competitive edge through continuous innovation is key. Understanding these broader crypto market trends is essential for a holistic view of Ethereum’s potential. Its resilience during market downturns and its ability to quickly rebound during bullish cycles highlight its strong market position. Table: Key Macro Factors Impacting ETH Price Factor Impact on ETH Price Current Trend Interest Rates Higher rates generally negative (reduces risk appetite) Stabilizing/Potentially Decreasing Inflation Can be positive (hedge against inflation) or negative (reduced consumer spending) Moderating Regulatory Clarity Positive (attracts institutional capital) Evolving/Improving Institutional Investment Strongly positive (increased demand, legitimacy) Increasing Global Economic Growth Positive (higher risk appetite) Mixed/Cautious Blockchain Technology: Ethereum’s Enduring Innovation At the heart of every Ethereum price prediction is its pioneering blockchain technology . Ethereum didn’t just introduce a digital currency; it revolutionized what a blockchain could do by enabling smart contracts. This innovation paved the way for decentralized applications (dApps) and an entire ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Ethereum’s blockchain is a robust, permissionless, and transparent ledger that allows for complex, self-executing agreements. Its transition to Proof-of-Stake has significantly enhanced its sustainability and laid the groundwork for future scalability. The sharding roadmap, for instance, aims to drastically increase transaction processing capabilities by dividing the network into smaller, more manageable segments. This continuous evolution of its blockchain technology ensures Ethereum remains at the forefront of innovation, attracting developers and users who seek a reliable and powerful platform. The strength of Ethereum’s underlying technology is a key differentiator. Its battle-tested security, extensive network effects, and committed developer community provide a solid foundation for its long-term value proposition. This technological superiority is a primary reason why many foresee a strong future for the ETH price . Web3 Innovation: Ethereum as the Digital Frontier Ethereum’s role in driving Web3 innovation is undeniable. Web3, the next iteration of the internet, envisions a decentralized web where users have greater control over their data and digital assets. Ethereum, with its smart contract platform, is the primary infrastructure enabling this vision. Consider these examples of Ethereum’s impact on Web3: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum powers the vast majority of DeFi protocols, offering services like lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges without intermediaries. This financial revolution is still in its early stages, with massive growth potential. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): The explosion of NFTs, from digital art to gaming assets, largely happened on Ethereum. NFTs represent digital ownership and identity in Web3, creating new economies and forms of expression. Metaverse and Gaming: Many metaverse projects and blockchain-based games are built on Ethereum, leveraging its smart contracts for in-game economies, digital land ownership, and unique character assets. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Ethereum enables DAOs, which are internet-native organizations owned and governed by their members, showcasing a new paradigm for collective decision-making. As Web3 innovation continues to accelerate, Ethereum’s position as the leading platform for these groundbreaking applications will solidify. The more Web3 grows, the more integral Ethereum becomes, driving demand for ETH and strengthening its market value. This deep integration into the future of the internet is a powerful argument for a significant Ethereum price prediction in the coming years. Can ETH Reach $10,000 by 2030? A Deep Dive into Long-Term Potential The question on many investors’ minds is: Can ETH realistically reach $10,000 by 2030? While no one can predict the future with certainty, a detailed analysis suggests that this target is indeed achievable under favorable conditions. Our Ethereum price prediction for this timeframe considers several long-term catalysts and potential challenges. Potential Catalysts for ETH to $10,000+ Full Scalability Implementation: By 2030, Ethereum’s sharding and other scaling solutions should be fully mature, drastically increasing its transaction capacity and reducing fees. This will make Ethereum a highly efficient and cost-effective platform for global adoption. Massive Web3 Adoption: As Web3 applications become mainstream, from decentralized social media to widespread metaverse integration, Ethereum’s role as the foundational layer will drive immense demand for ETH. Institutional Inflows: Continued regulatory clarity and the introduction of more institutional investment vehicles (like ETFs) could funnel trillions of dollars into the Ethereum ecosystem. Deflationary Supply Shock: With sustained high network usage and EIP-1559’s burning mechanism, ETH could become significantly more deflationary, leading to a supply squeeze that pushes prices upward. Global Digital Currency Integration: Ethereum could play a pivotal role in the future of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or as a settlement layer for other digital assets, increasing its utility and perceived value. Reaching $10,000 would imply a market capitalization significantly higher than today’s, but given the potential for global adoption of decentralized technologies, this is not an outlandish figure. For context, this would place Ethereum’s market cap in a similar range to some of the world’s largest traditional companies today, which is plausible if it truly becomes the internet’s financial and computational layer. Challenges and Risks for Ethereum’s Growth While the potential is vast, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges that could hinder Ethereum’s path to $10,000: Competition: Other Layer 1 blockchains continue to innovate and attract developers, posing a competitive threat to Ethereum’s dominance. Regulatory Uncertainty: Unfavorable or overly restrictive regulations in major economies could stifle innovation and adoption. Technical Hurdles: The implementation of complex upgrades like sharding is not without technical risks and potential delays. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its extreme volatility. Black swan events or prolonged bear markets could delay price targets. Security Concerns: While robust, any major security breach or exploit on the Ethereum network or a widely used dApp could severely impact trust and price. Despite these risks, Ethereum’s proven track record, ongoing development, and foundational role in the decentralized economy position it strongly for future growth. The ability of the Ethereum community and developers to navigate these challenges will be key to realizing its full potential and validating a strong Ethereum price prediction . Conclusion: Ethereum’s Unwavering Trajectory In summary, our comprehensive Ethereum price prediction for 2025, 2026, and extending to 2030 paints a compelling picture of growth and innovation. The journey of ETH to potentially reach $10,000 is underpinned by its relentless technological advancements, its pivotal role in Web3 innovation , and its increasing integration into the global financial landscape. From the continuous evolution of its blockchain technology to the powerful tailwinds of favorable crypto market trends and increasing institutional interest, Ethereum stands as a formidable force in the digital economy. While the path may be marked by volatility and challenges inherent in any nascent, yet rapidly maturing, technology, Ethereum’s fundamental strengths and vibrant ecosystem provide a robust foundation. The transition to Proof-of-Stake, the development of Layer 2 solutions, and the ongoing commitment to scalability and efficiency are not just technical upgrades; they are strategic moves that enhance Ethereum’s utility and appeal to a broader global audience. Investors and enthusiasts alike should remain informed, recognizing that Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency but a critical piece of the future internet.

52338790,https://invezz.com/?p=2901706,1758976200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,3 reasons why analysts favor MUTM as their answer to what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/27/3-reasons-why-analysts-favor-mutm-as-their-answer-to-what-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in/,"Analysts following early-stage digital assets are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as their preferred answer to what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now. With Bitcoin’s cycle approaching a new peak, the hunt for strong-performing altcoins is intensifying. Many investors are questioning why crypto is down in certain sectors while others continue to surge, and analysts are making the case that MUTM’s presale trajectory, lending innovation, and security-first approach make it a rare standout. Reason 1: Lending models that reshape crypto investing The first reason analysts are favoring Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its dual lending system designed to serve both mainstream and high-risk markets. In the Peer-to-Contract model, liquidity providers will supply assets such as USDT, USDC, DAI, BTC, ETH, and SOL into audited pools. These pools will automatically manage borrowing and lending with dynamic interest rates. For example, an investor who deposits $10,000 in BTC will generate 12% APY, amounting to $1,200 in passive income over the year. Borrowers on the other side will secure funds without liquidating their holdings, such as pledging $1,500 in ETH to borrow $1,125 in USDT. Analysts highlight that Peer-to-Peer lending will run in parallel for tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, allowing users to negotiate directly with higher rates reflecting higher risks. This separation protects the main pools from volatility while still creating lucrative opportunities for those willing to take on niche token exposure. Collateralized lending will always remain overcollateralized, guided by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Stability Factor and automatic liquidation rules. Stablecoins and blue-chip tokens will be assigned loan-to-value ratios of up to 75%, while meme coins will sit closer to 40%. This framework reassures analysts that loans will remain solvent and sustainable, strengthening their case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the more practical choices in crypto investing. Reason 2: Presale growth that signals strong upside The second reason analysts are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its presale performance. Currently in Phase 6 for $0.035, the project has already attracted more than 16,600 holders and raised $16.4 million, with half of the Phase 6 allocation sold. The presale is structured with steady price increases across 11 phases, rewarding early buyers with transparent upside. Investors who entered at Phase 1 for $0.01 are already up 250% on paper, and analysts project that current Phase 6 buyers will benefit from a 70% value gain by the time Phase 11 is expected to list at $0.06. This clear roadmap is a major reason analysts favor MUTM when investors are asking crypto is a good investment in the current cycle. While many tokens remain speculative, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has laid out a predictable structure. With Phase 7 set to begin at $0.040, the cost of entry will climb again. Analysts emphasize that those who delay participation will simply face higher prices in later stages, making Phase 6 one of the most attractive windows to act. Reason 3: Security and community that builds confidence The third reason analysts are backing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its dedication to trust and engagement. The platform has undergone a CertiK audit, receiving a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet rating of 79, validating its code quality and transparency. On top of this, a $50,000 bug bounty program has been established, with tiered rewards from $200 to $2,000 for vulnerabilities reported. Analysts point out that such initiatives are rare for presale-stage projects and further validate why they favor MUTM. Community incentives add another layer of confidence. A $100,000 giveaway is active, with ten winners set to each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens, while social engagement is building rapidly with over 12,000 Twitter followers. Analysts also point to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming dashboard, which will allow users to track their ROI in real time, along with a Top 50 leaderboard that will distribute bonus MUTM rewards to the most engaged investors. Analysts looking at the next wave of crypto investing have made it obvious that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) meets all the requirements for utility, presale momentum, and security. MUTM has earned its place as the finest cryptocurrency to invest in because it includes loan methods that give actual yields, a presale that is already priced to reward early action, and a clear focus on trust. The price of Phase 7 is quickly approaching $0.040, and the window at $0.035 is getting smaller. Analysts say that individuals who are waiting on the sidelines risk entering later at greater charges.

According to sources close to Russia’s security services, the operation is linked to an ongoing investigation into illegal transfer of funds to foreign countries. Russian police search crypto exchange offices in Moscow Law enforcement officers are searching the offices of crypto trading platforms in the Moscow International Business Center, seizing large amounts of money, documents and hardware. Multiple raids have been carried out over the past weeks, Russian media reported, quoting Telegram channels publishing information sourced from the police and other security agencies. The actions are part of an investigation into suspected capital flight, more specifically to the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to Bits.media. Two cryptocurrency exchange service providers, Rapira and Mosca, have been targeted in particular, the crypto news outlet detailed. On Friday, the Baza Telegram channel, which is close to the Russian police and the Federal Security Service (FSB), unveiled : “More than $10 million, 100 million rubles, and 200,000 euros were seized at one of these exchanges. At the moment, funds are also frozen on several other Chinese exchanges.” “Law enforcement officers are circulating the premises with a list of people who can lead them to one exchange or another,” the online source added. Baza also learned that all this is part of a procedural probe, not a criminal case yet, highlighting that “preliminary reports indicate that several officials may also be involved.” Lawyers representing the exchanges’ owners from the Mushailov, Uzdensky, Rybakov & Partners law firm declined to comment. Agents are checking cards issued by the exchange firms to different people and searching for contact lists providing access to other platforms. Meanwhile, VChK-OGPU reported that police arrived at the Moscow City center on Thursday, asking questions about “offices working with crypto” or processing payments to Chinese factories. They were “extremely serious” and “seizing everything,” the Telegram channel wrote, adding that users of the raided coin exchange offices are now deleting correspondence and getting rid of devices. Crypto exchange Rapira denies links to Dubai Quoted by the business news portal RBC on Saturday, Rapira confirmed the raids have been taking place. However, the crypto exchange insisted there is no evidence linking it to illegal transfer of funds to Dubai. In a statement released by its press service, the company said: “Indeed, authorities have been conducting inspections of exchange offices for two weeks, but we have no information regarding the withdrawal of funds to Dubai.” The other affected crypto trading firm, Mosca, as well as investigative bodies in Moscow, are yet to officially comment on the matter. Russian authorities launched a series of raids against cryptocurrency exchanges in the fall of 2024, RBC recalled in its report. Police searched dozens of addresses in 14 regions, including St. Petersburg, Russia ’s second-largest city. Criminal investigations were opened under various articles of the country’s criminal code, including for illegal banking activity and illegal circulation of payment instruments. More than 90 individuals were named as defendants in the case against the operators of the UAPS anonymous payment system and the Cryptex exchange. They are believed to have provided services to cybercriminals, including cryptocurrency exchange, transfer of funds and money laundering. In 2023, the group’s turnover exceeded 112 billion rubles (over $1.3 billion today). Recent legislative changes and a new system for identifying and blocking criminal transactions, announced by the Bank of Russia earlier this year, have been criticized as effectively targeting crypto trading in the country.

As one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market, BNB consistently captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. The burning question on everyone’s mind is: what does the future hold for BNB, and will it ever reach the coveted $1000 mark? This comprehensive guide delves into the intricate world of Binance Coin price prediction , offering insights into its potential trajectory from 2025 to 2030. We’ll explore the factors driving its value, analyze historical data, and project potential scenarios, providing you with a clearer picture of what to expect from this digital asset. Understanding Binance Coin (BNB) and Its Core Value Before we dive into predictions, it’s essential to understand what Binance Coin is and why it holds significant value in the crypto landscape. BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, initially launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain in 2017. It later migrated to Binance’s own blockchain, the Binance Chain, and then to the Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), which supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). BNB serves multiple critical functions within the Binance ecosystem: Transaction Fees: Users can pay trading fees on the Binance exchange with BNB, often receiving a discount. Staking: BNB is used for staking on the BNB Chain, contributing to network security and earning rewards. Launchpad Participation: Holding BNB grants users access to token sales on the Binance Launchpad, a platform for new crypto projects. Payments: BNB is increasingly accepted as a payment method by various merchants. Decentralized Applications (dApps): It powers numerous dApps built on the BNB Chain, serving as gas for transactions. This multifaceted utility is a fundamental driver of its demand and, consequently, its price. The more the Binance ecosystem expands and is adopted, the more utility BNB gains, which directly impacts its long-term potential. A Look Back: Historical BNB Price Analysis and Key Milestones To forecast the future, it’s often helpful to examine the past. BNB’s journey has been marked by remarkable growth and resilience. Launched at approximately $0.10 during its ICO, BNB has seen exponential gains, especially during major bull runs. Key Historical Highlights: 2017-2018 Bull Run: BNB saw its first significant price surge, driven by the overall crypto market enthusiasm and its utility for discounted trading fees on the rapidly growing Binance exchange. 2019: Launch of Binance Smart Chain (BSC): This was a game-changer. BSC offered a high-performance, low-cost alternative to Ethereum, attracting a wave of developers and users. This significantly expanded BNB’s utility beyond just exchange fees, leading to another strong price appreciation. 2021 Bull Market: BNB experienced an unprecedented rally, reaching its all-time high of over $690. This surge was fueled by the DeFi boom on BSC, the popularity of NFTs, and the overall speculative frenzy in the crypto market. 2022 Bear Market: Like most cryptocurrencies, BNB faced significant headwinds, declining substantially from its peak due to macroeconomic factors, regulatory concerns, and a general risk-off sentiment. 2023-2024 Recovery: A gradual recovery began, mirroring broader market sentiment, with BNB demonstrating resilience and showing signs of renewed interest, particularly with advancements within the BNB Chain and new project launches. This historical BNB price analysis reveals a pattern: periods of rapid growth often follow significant ecosystem developments, while market-wide downturns can impact its short-term performance. However, its underlying utility has consistently provided a floor and a basis for recovery. Factors Influencing Binance Coin Price Prediction Predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently complex, as numerous variables come into play. For BNB, these factors can be broadly categorized into several key areas: 1. Binance Ecosystem Growth and Utility The continued expansion of the Binance ecosystem is arguably the most crucial factor.

This deflationary mechanism reduces supply over time, which can positively impact price if demand remains constant or increases. Staking and Locking: More users staking BNB or locking it for various services reduces the circulating supply, potentially driving up demand. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest from institutional investors could inject significant capital into BNB. 3. Regulatory Environment Global cryptocurrency regulations are constantly evolving. Positive regulatory clarity can foster wider adoption, while restrictive measures or legal challenges against Binance could introduce uncertainty and negative price pressure. 4. Macroeconomic Factors and Market Sentiment Broader economic conditions (inflation, interest rates, recessions) and overall crypto market sentiment (bullish vs. bearish cycles) heavily influence BNB’s price. As a high-beta asset, BNB tends to amplify market movements. 5. Competition and Innovation The crypto space is highly competitive. While BNB Chain is a major player, it faces competition from other Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Continuous innovation is necessary for BNB to maintain its competitive edge. Short-Term Outlook: Binance Coin Price Prediction for 2025 Looking towards 2025, several factors suggest a potentially bullish environment for BNB, although volatility will remain a constant companion. The anticipated Bitcoin halving in 2024 often historically precedes a broader crypto bull run, which could lift BNB along with the rest of the market.

In a Friday X post, he wrote, “Another flurry of S-1 amendments filed today on spot sol ETFs. Franklin, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, & Canary.Includes staking (yes, bodes well for spot eth ETF staking). Guessing these are approved [within the] next two weeks.” Pantera Capital says investors may jump on Solana projects Geraci’s comments come shortly after REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF on Cboe BZX went live, which opened with $33 million in volume and $12 million in day-one inflows. According to Pantera Capital, Solana could be the next big target for institutional investors, given its underexposure relative to BTC and ETH. Geraci also noted that the next few weeks may be a turning point for digital assets. He asserted that developments like the inaugural Hyperliquid ETF application, the debut of the first spot XRP ETF, the first ETF with DOGE exposure , the first index-based spot crypto ETF, and new SEC listing standards are paving the way — adding, “Get ready for October.” In an X post Friday, Bitwise CIO Hunter Horsley also highlighted $60 million in inflows into Europe’s Bitwise Solana staking ETP over five trading days, commenting, “Solana on people’s minds.” Bitfinex analysts, however, cautioned that altcoins might not see a major run-up until more crypto ETFs targeting smaller assets are approved. Fusaro believes the filings are well advanced in the SEC’s review process Geraci noted that staking’s inclusion in the latest ETF submissions indicates a favorable outlook for ETH ETF staking. Several analysts agree. Markus Thielen, research head at 10x Research, said in a recent interview that staking would boost returns for ETH ETFs and could “dramatically transform the market.” However, several US asset managers have yet to receive the SEC’s green light for staking in Ether ETFs, though they filed numerous requests months ago. What’s clear, nonetheless, is that after the SEC introduced its proposed listing rules in July, firms have been busy updating their filings and responding to regulatory feedback. Three people with knowledge of the matter said the last batch of amendments might come before the week ends. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise and a crypto asset manager, claimed the filings had progressed significantly through the review process and that the finalized rules were consistent with their expectations. The SEC’s decision to approve new listing rules means crypto ETFs that satisfy preset requirements no longer need case-by-case approval. Sources say the change will reduce approval times to 75 days or less from the previous 270-day process. The rules have made more companies eager to launch their own ETFs. Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group, even confirmed they have submitted more than a dozen registration statements, though they still plan to seek approval for more. Back in July, the agency outlined the framework for these listing standards, detailing the requirements that asset managers and the participating exchanges, NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe Global Markets, must meet to gain approval for a new spot crypto ETF without undergoing an extensive, case-by-case review.

That is why today’s watchlist mixes Ripple, XRP, and XLM with a fresh PayFi pick, Remittix , a PayFi altcoin built for real payments and rewards. We cover the XRP setup, the newest XLM moves, and where smart money is hunting the next 100x crypto across DeFi, payments, and tokenization. XRP: Triangle Pullback Then Rebound Setup Source: Lingrid Ripple’s token, XRP, pulled back from a triangle break and is sliding into the green imbalance zone near the rising trendline. Price is compressing with long tails, which hints at dip absorption. For this Ripple outlook, holding $2.64 to $2.58 is key. A reclaim over $2.78 opens a path toward $2.95 to $3.05, while a loss of $2.58 delays bulls and keeps the coil in place. The broader XRP story keeps improving. Holders can now use DeFi through FXRP on Flare, and mXRP adds liquid staking with up to 10 percent yield. Regulatory progress around generic listing standards supports XRP ETF talk, and open interest has pushed toward 1 billion dollars. This Ripple and XRP blend of utility, liquidity, and compliance tools is why many traders keep XRP on their radar. XLM: On-Chain Strength And Real-World Use Source: Tradingview XLM trades near $0.3609 as Stellar’s TVL hits a record, with more than 400 million XLM locked. Daily smart contract calls have topped 1 million, showing stronger app use and developer activity. That is healthy for network effects, stablecoin adoption, and cross-border payments. Institutional signals are rising too. Mercado Bitcoin plans 200 million dollars in tokenized assets on Stellar, and RedSwan added 100 million dollars in real estate tokenization. PayPal’s PYUSD now works on Stellar for fast, low-cost transfers. The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF’s move to include Stellar is another sign of growing trust. This mix keeps XLM on screens for altcoin rotation and longer-term accumulation. Remittix (RTX): PayFi Utility Plus Daily USDT Rewards Remittix is a utility-first altcoin for fast, low-cost global transfers, merchant payouts, and real-world remittances. The team has raised over $26.7 million by selling more than 672 million tokens at $0.1130, with CEX listings announced at Bitmart and LBank . The wallet beta is live, and CertiK ranks Remittix number 1 among pre-launch tokens at Skynet. Why RTX keeps trending with the next 100x crypto hunters 15 percent referral rewards in USDT, claimable every 24 hours in the dashboard Live PayFi use cases that can drive real transaction demand and liquidity Announced CEX listings for deeper markets and better price discovery CertiK verification and top Skynet rank for added security confidence Clean presale path for early-stage crypto investment with strong community growth Focus on cross-border payments, merchant payouts, and stablecoin rails Where To Look For The Next 100x Crypto Scan for altcoins that pair real payments, tokenization, and steady CEX and DeFi liquidity.

While crypto prices today for major tokens capture headlines, a promising alternative is emerging with a unique yield-driven ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out among crypto coins and even traditional crypto ETFs for its dual-lending architecture and built-in utility, positioning it as a penny crypto with multi-dollar aspirations by 2026. XRP price outlook: will it reach $3 by 2026? Analysts project $3.50–$5 by 2026, with conservative estimates at $3.05 and bullish targets at $7 if ETF launches and CBDC pilots in Asia/Middle East boost ODL to $2 trillion annually. Institutional treasuries like VivoPower ($100M) add confidence. However, ETF delays or stablecoin competition (e.g., USDT) could push XRP to $2.50 (20% chance). US-China tariffs may cause 10–15% corrections. Social sentiment is 70% bullish but volatile. XRP is poised to exceed $3 by mid-2026 (90% odds), potentially hitting $4–$5 with ETF catalysts. Monitor $2.80 for downside risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): dual-lending and utility-driven design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate as a dual-lending platform, offering Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for majors and stablecoins, alongside Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets for less-liquid or higher-risk tokens. Lenders in P2C pools will receive interest-bearing mtTokens representing their share, while borrowers will provide overcollateralized assets and choose variable or stable interest rates. This design ensures capital efficiency, consistent yields, and a transparent system that appeals to both retail and institutional participants. At the heart of the platform is a governance-tuned, overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted against loans and burned upon repayment, creating natural demand for MUTM. The token’s utility will extend to staking, governance participation, and open-market buybacks, turning protocol operations into measurable, value-driving mechanics. This combination of utility and structure differentiates MUTM from speculative tokens and positions it as a candidate for a long-term price trajectory comparable to XRP. Mechanics supporting an XRP-style growth thesis Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s liquidation rules and allocation of penalties will serve as a consistent revenue source. When loans are liquidated, a portion of the penalty will flow directly to the treasury. These recurring inflows will fund incentives, treasury operations, and systematic buybacks, tying token demand directly to real protocol earnings. The reserve factor will further strengthen the balance sheet by accumulating a fraction of borrower interest. This on-chain capital will serve as deployable insurance, fund incentives, and back additional staking programs, converting operational activity into tangible financial leverage for the platform. The protocol will implement a robust oracle strategy using primary Chainlink feeds with fallback sources and TWAPs, ensuring accurate prices and clean liquidations. This approach will reduce unjust losses and encourage larger, longer-term positions from users and institutions, further driving adoption and utilization. Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently active at $0.035, with $16.4 million raised and 50% of the 170 million token allocation already claimed. Over 16,600 holders are participating, with market confidence strengthened by a CertiK audit scoring 90 for Token Scan and 79 for Skynet. Ongoing community incentives include a $50,000 USDT bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway . Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% step-up, creating a critical entry point for investors seeking early exposure before the token’s listing and beta launch. Target clarity: the XRP $3 comparison The analysts’ projection positions MUTM as a penny crypto that could reach $3 by 2026. From the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, this represents a multiplier of 86X, equivalent to a potential +8470% appreciation. The path to this target is supported by a combination of structural and market-driven factors. Treasury inflows from liquidations and reserve accruals will create a growing balance sheet, deployed into liquidity, incentives, and strategic buybacks that generate MUTM demand. The upcoming beta release at listing will convert presale holders into active users, generating borrowing and fee volume that institutional buyers will value over a 12–18 month horizon. Layer-2 integration and major exchange listings will increase visibility, liquidity, and accessibility, compressing valuation multiples and supporting the large multiplier needed to approach the $3 mark. Investor example and urgency For example, a $1,000 investment today at $0.035 will purchase 28,600 MUTM tokens. At the $3 target, this position will be worth $85,700, demonstrating the scale of the potential upside. The presale urgency is clear: Phase 6 is already half subscribed, and the next step to Phase 7 at $0.040 (+15%) will further limit entry. Early participation allows investors to capture upside ahead of the beta launch and the operational activation of the platform’s balance-sheet mechanics into real token demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now because it has structural security, mechanics that are based on revenue, and demand that is based on utility. Its dual-lending design, reserve growth, and integration with stablecoins make it a solid base for rapid multi-year growth. If you want to buy a penny crypto that could beat XRP’s $3 by 2026, the presale for MUTM is the best time to do so.

A newly created address, starting with bc1q7, executed a substantial Bitcoin withdrawal of 584.72 BTC, valued at an astonishing $63.9 million, from Binance just minutes ago. This move, as reported by Onchain-Lense, immediately sparked discussions among analysts and investors alike. But what does such a significant off-exchange movement truly signify for the broader crypto landscape? What Does This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal Mean for the Market? When a large quantity of Bitcoin is moved off an exchange, it’s typically interpreted as a strong signal of intent to hold, often referred to as ‘HODLing’. This particular Bitcoin withdrawal from Binance is no exception. It suggests that the recipient, rather than looking to sell in the immediate future, aims to secure these assets in a private wallet for long-term storage. Reduced Selling Pressure: By removing BTC from an exchange, the immediate supply available for sale decreases, which can alleviate downward pressure on prices. Long-Term Confidence: Such a large move often indicates conviction in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, prompting holders to secure their assets away from trading platforms. Market Sentiment Indicator: Major withdrawals are closely watched by traders as a gauge of overall market sentiment, often hinting at bullish trends. Understanding On-Chain Signals: Why a Binance Bitcoin Withdrawal is Noteworthy On-chain data provides invaluable insights into the movements of cryptocurrencies. Analysts closely monitor these transactions because they offer a transparent look into market participant behavior. A significant Bitcoin withdrawal , especially from a major exchange like Binance, stands out because it directly impacts the exchange’s available supply. Consider this: when users deposit Bitcoin onto an exchange, it often precedes an intention to sell or trade. Conversely, a withdrawal signifies the opposite – a desire to keep the assets off the trading books. Therefore, this $63.9 million Bitcoin withdrawal suggests a shift in immediate market dynamics, moving these coins into a less liquid state. Is This Bitcoin Withdrawal a Bullish Indicator for BTC’s Future? While one large Bitcoin withdrawal does not definitively dictate future price action, it certainly adds to a mosaic of potentially bullish indicators. The ‘intent to hold’ narrative is powerful because it implies a belief in higher future prices, leading to less supply on exchanges and potentially driving up demand. Historically, periods of sustained large withdrawals from exchanges have often preceded price rallies, as the reduction in readily available supply meets consistent or increasing demand. For investors, monitoring these on-chain movements can provide a crucial edge in understanding underlying market sentiment and potential shifts in momentum. In conclusion, the recent $63.9 million Bitcoin withdrawal from Binance by a new address is a powerful signal. It underscores a growing confidence among some holders to secure their assets for the long term, potentially reducing immediate selling pressure and contributing to a more bullish outlook for BTC. While the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable, such significant on-chain movements offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of Bitcoin’s supply and demand. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin withdrawal from an exchange? A Bitcoin withdrawal from an exchange occurs when a user moves their Bitcoin from their account on a cryptocurrency exchange (like Binance) to a personal wallet that they control. This could be a software wallet, a hardware wallet, or any other non-custodial storage. 2. Why is a large Bitcoin withdrawal considered significant? Large Bitcoin withdrawals are significant because they reduce the amount of BTC available on exchanges for immediate trading or selling. This often indicates that the holder intends to keep their Bitcoin for the long term, reducing potential selling pressure and signaling a bullish sentiment. 3. Does every large withdrawal lead to a price increase? Not necessarily. While large withdrawals can be a bullish indicator, they are just one factor among many that influence Bitcoin’s price. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment also play crucial roles. However, consistent large withdrawals over time can contribute to a more positive price outlook. 4. How can I track Bitcoin movements like this? You can track Bitcoin movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers. Services like Onchain-Lense, Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and others provide data and tools to monitor exchange flows, large transactions, and other crucial on-chain metrics.

Being the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is frequently likened to digital gold, an inflation hedge, and a major source of investor sentiment in blockchain technology. With growing interest from retail investors and institutions, the big question now is what will become of Bitcoin in 2030, especially with emerging projects like Remittix (RTX) revolutionizing the DeFi landscape. Current market performance Bitcoin is valued at $109,450.24, having fallen a 1.61% daily performance. Despite the decline, its market cap stands at $2.18 trillion and is still the world’s largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. Volume has also been strong with $73.99 billion in 24-hour volume, up 34.21% from the previous session. This combination of high capitalization and liquidity highlights why Bitcoin remains atop crypto discourse. Yet, alongside BTC, attention is piqued towards upcoming crypto projects that offer faster settlement rates, low gas fee crypto transactions, and scalable real-world uses. The road to 2030 When considering long-term Bitcoin Price Predictions, institutional onboarding, regulatory facilitation, and competition from the remainder of DeFi initiatives will be at the forefront. Bitcoin itself is based on a scarcity model with a limit of 21 million coins that still leaves it among the greatest long-term investment opportunities in cryptocurrency. But the next ten years will not be solely dominated by Bitcoin. Investors are increasingly seeking opportunities in tokens with utility and potential for growth. It is here that top crypto under $1 and early-stage crypto investments like Remittix are becoming popular as the next giant altcoin in 2025. Remittix: building actual utility in payments Remittix has already raised $26.7 million in its presale, selling over 672 million tokens for $0.1130 apiece. A cross-chain DeFi project, RTX enables direct crypto-to-bank payments in more than 30 countries, targeting a $19 trillion payment industry. The project has secured future listings on BitMart and LBANK, increasing liquidity via centralized exchanges. Additionally, Remittix is in the process of beta testing its wallet and has encouraged a $250,000 community giveaway, highlighting its early adoption strategy. Why Remittix is standing out #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens An authenticated team with industry-leading blockchain security audit Raised over $26.7M in presale funding Beta wallet testing is live with community access Security and community growth One of the features is that Remittix is fully verified by CertiK, the #1 pre-launch token globally. This translates to unparalleled security verification and guarantees investors that RTX is a crypto with real utility. Apart from security, Remittix features staking, minimal gas fees, and a 15% referral program in USDT. These make RTX the best DeFi altcoin potential of 2025, surpassing other emerging crypto projects. The BTC Price remains a global benchmark, but by 2030, the market would be evenly split between Bitcoin as digital gold and newly minted tokens, driving adoption. As the speed of crypto adoption is advancing so rapidly, projects like Remittix provide the template for uniting security, utility, and accessibility. For those keeping an eye on the next big crypto drop, RTX offers a compelling case as a crypto that’s solving real-world problems while Bitcoin finds its footing as the bedrock of the market.

According to Novogratz, if the next Fed chair after Jerome Powell favors aggressive rate cuts , the dollar could weaken and risk assets would get a big bid. He added that while that outcome would be great for crypto, it would not be good for the country. Dovish Fed Could Send Bitcoin Higher Novogratz said during an interview with Kyle Chasse published on YouTube that if the Fed begins cutting when it probably should not, and a strongly dovish chair is installed, investors could rush into assets like gold and Bitcoin. Based on reports, he suggested a scenario where markets chase higher prices in a short span, producing what traders call a blow-off top. He also allowed that Bitcoin could reach $200K under that set of conditions. Markets Won’t React Until The Pick Is Real Reports have disclosed that US President Donald Trump has narrowed his shortlist to three names: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Trump told reporters on Sept. 6 that those were the top three. Novogratz said markets often wait for official action, so a rally of the size he described may not begin until a decision is announced and investors are sure of the policy shift. Policy Choice May Undercut Dollar Daleep Singh, vice chair and chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income, agreed that the Fed could act quite differently after Powell’s term ends in May 2026. According to Singh, the risks to the dollar may be skewed to the downside if policymakers turn more dovish. Novogratz warned this could erode the Fed’s independence and produce broader problems for the US economy, even as it lifts prices of risk assets. Recent Moves Add Context The Fed delivered its first rate cut of 25 basis points in September, a move markets largely expected. Reports show that Governor Waller had been urging a cut as early as July, which highlights the range of views inside the system. Those past steps help explain why some investors now talk about how far policy could tilt and how big an impact that might have on crypto.

The same system lawmakers said was too risky is staying. But this isn’t a done deal yet, technically. What Trump signed was an executive order on Thursday that delays a ban for 120 days. That ban was originally triggered by a law passed in spring 2024. So instead of pulling the plug, Trump bought time for Larry Ellison, Silver Lake, and others to finalize a structure that keeps the app alive, keeps the Chinese code running, and gives American investors a chance to make money off it. Joint venture to run U.S. TikTok while algorithm stays Chinese The plan is to carve out a separate “American TikTok,” run by a new joint venture controlled by U.S. people and U.S. firms. That version will no longer be under the thumb of ByteDance, but it will still run on ByteDance’s algorithm. This is the same recommendation system that American officials have spent years warning about. Instead of writing new code, the U.S. will just retrain and monitor the existing algorithm. The White House published a fact sheet saying, “the divestiture puts the operation of the algorithm, code, and content moderation decisions under the control of the new joint venture.” They added that all recommendation models using American user data will be retrained and overseen by “trusted security partners.” What the sheet does not say is that a new algorithm will be built from scratch. So the plan is to slap a U.S. security layer on top of a Chinese algorithm, call it American, and hope it works. There’s no clear answer yet on how deep this oversight goes. Will Larry and crew be able to fully audit the code, or are they managing a system they can’t fully see? And if ByteDance updates the algorithm, does the U.S. version follow those updates or stay frozen? No one knows yet. U.S. data, at least, will be hosted in Oracle’s cloud centers, something that actually began in 2022. But that’s just storage. The real question is control. And control, right now, is being leased. Investors secure equity, ByteDance locks in profits The deal lets ByteDance keep its algorithm and get paid for it. Cryptopolitan reported the joint venture will license the tech, paying ByteDance 20% of revenue and up to 50% of profits. ByteDance also gets to hold a 20% equity stake in the U.S. business. That’s an ongoing payday. JD Vance, the Vice President, told reporters the deal is valued at $14 billion. That’s way under Wall Street estimates , which had the U.S. TikTok piece pegged between $35 billion and $50 billion. That lowball figure only makes sense because ByteDance is getting long-term licensing money. They didn’t lose their engine. They just leased it. Larry’s Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi fund, will control 45% of the new company. A 5% slice is being held for a rotating list of investors that Trump said might include Rupert Murdoch and Michael Dell. “They’re great people,” Trump said at the signing ceremony, not hiding the political nature of the invites. There’s already talk of a future IPO. If the company lists, it’s likely to go above $14 billion. Snap is sitting at $14 billion and doesn’t have nearly the same reach. And if ByteDance manages to pull this off, it could reopen its own IPO plans. The company pulled back from listing in Hong Kong in 2021 after friction with Chinese regulators. With this American problem now outsourced and monetized, ByteDance could head back to the markets, licensing deal in hand.",OP-ED|ByteDance|CNY|Oracle|TikTok|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 13:00:36

This comes as the flagship crypto trades below $110,000, with predictions that it could further drop below the psychological $100,000 level. Bitcoin Price Forms Bearish Pattern On Weekly Chart Severino revealed in an X post that the Bitcoin price is potentially forming an Evening Star pattern on the weekly chart, something he is wary of. He noted that this pattern is forming right at the Bollinger Band basis line, at around $111,600, during the tightest BB squeeze in BTC’s history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Over? These Signals Show Where The Market Is At The market expert had earlier revealed that the Bitcoin price’s weekly Bollinger Bands are officially the tightest in the entire history of BTCUSD price action. Essentially, BTC is currently trading within a tight range, indicating low volatility. Severino’s accompanying chart shows that the upper BB is at around $122,000, the basis BB is at $111,600, while the lower BB is at $101,000. Meanwhile, the Evening Star pattern suggests that the bears are taking control from the bulls, putting the Bitcoin price at risk of a further downtrend. With the Bollinger bands being this tight, Severino may be cautious of how this could lead to a BTC decline to the lower BB basis. Crypto analyst Bob Loukas confirmed that the bears are in control and indicated that BTC could still drop below $100,000. He noted that the Bitcoin price is looking to print its Weekly Cycle Low, although he opined that BTC is holding up well despite the current downtrend. The analyst declared that a rally to $118,000 will confirm the start of a new cycle. Until then, the bears will remain in control. His accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could risk dropping below $100,000 during this period when the bears are in control. However, in the long run, Loukas still expects the Bitcoin price to rally to as high as $140,000. BTC Needs To Reclaim $116,300 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also warned that the Bitcoin price needs to reclaim $116,300 or risk dropping as low as $94,334 based on the Pricing Bands. He had earlier stated that $107,200 is the crucial support for Bitcoin. The analyst claimed that a drop below that support level would put $100,000 or even $93,000 in play. Related Reading: These Analysts Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash And Their Forecasts Say It’s Not Over Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that the Bitcoin price has broken below the trendline at $110,000. He remarked that confirmation is still needed and that the lagging span must follow to validate this bearish move. However, the analyst is one of those who doesn’t believe that BTC has topped, noting that the market is in a period of fear and that this has never marked the cycle top. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $109,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitget Wallet, on the other hand, teamed up with Web3 growth platform Spindl to tackle one of the industry’s most critical issues: how consumers discover and interact with on-chain applications. These initiatives show how Latin America is progressively adopting digital financial innovation and positioning itself as a leader in Web3 adoption. Safra launches US dollar-backed Stablecoin Banco Safra has announced the creation of Safra Dollar , a stablecoin entirely backed by the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. Developed in collaboration with California-based tokenisation business Hamsa, the digital asset is registered on a private blockchain and is intended to make dollar exposure more accessible to Brazilian investors. The product is available to both individuals and corporations, has a minimum investment of 1,000 reais (about USD 188), provides D+1 liquidity, and is exempt from IOF tax. Transactions can be completed entirely via Safra’s digital channels, which include the mobile app and internet banking platform. Safra emphasises that each operation is backed by short-term dollar reserves to preserve parity, ensuring liquidity and stability. While the stablecoin does not provide yield, it reflects US dollar exchange rate swings and offers the advantages of blockchain technology, such as security, traceability, and predictability. The plan builds on Safra’s previous forays into the crypto sector, which included the 2023 launch of the SAF Crypto Selection fund and the 2024 Bitcoin fund connected to BlackRock’s ETF. With Safra Dollar, the bank expands its offering for clients seeking international diversification without opening foreign accounts, cementing its position at the forefront of digital finance in Brazil. Bitget Wallet partners with Spindl to tackle Web3 discovery Bitget Wallet, a prominent non-custodial crypto wallet with over 80 million users, has announced a strategic agreement with Web3 growth platform Spindl to tackle one of the ecosystem’s most pressing issues: user discovery and engagement measurement across chains. In today’s fragmented Web3 market, user journeys can involve numerous protocols and wallets, making it difficult for projects to trace how users discover and interact with them. Traditional Web2 attribution models, which rely on clicks and impressions, fail to capture relevant on-chain behaviour, such as wallet connections or transactions. Spindl’s attribution architecture intends to close this gap by using blockchain as a transparent marketing database, allowing projects to directly link outreach initiatives to verifiable on-chain behaviour. Spindl’s placements will be included in Bitget Wallet’s Discover feature as part of this cooperation, making it the first wallet-native attribution experiment of its sort. By embedding transparent analytics within a self-custodial environment, the program aims to transform wallets into strong distribution channels for Web3 applications, allowing developers to reach audiences more effectively while providing verifiable performance metrics. Jamie Elkaleh, CMO of Bitget Wallet, underlined that addressing the attribution question is critical for the next wave of Web3 growth, as wallets are frequently users’ first point of entry into decentralised services. Spindl sees the agreement as an opportunity to scale its service, particularly in Asia, where Web3 use is accelerating. Together, the companies hope to bridge the gap between discovery and engagement by providing a paradigm that promotes openness, decentralisation, and long-term growth in the blockchain ecosystem. USDT surpasses 300 Bolívares amid Venezuela’s currency crisis The price of USDT in Venezuela has crossed 300 bolívars , illustrating the increasing devaluation of the national currency due to hyperinflation and a shortage of foreign exchange. USDT trades at 305 bolívares on Binance P2P, confirming its status as the key reference for the digital dollar. Economists warn that this milestone is more than a transitory fluctuation—it signifies the deeper downfall of the bolívar as a viable currency. With the central bank hampered by sanctions and declining reserves, official liquidity operations increasingly rely on USDT rather than physical dollars, indicating a fundamental shift in Venezuela’s parallel market. In this climate, USDT has evolved as the preferred mechanism for saving, pricing, and payments, even outperforming physical dollars in many day-to-day activities. Millions of Venezuelans, from freelancers to taxi drivers, change their earnings directly into the stablecoin to protect themselves from inflation, while businesses of all sorts now set prices using USDT. According to Sherlock Communications, stablecoins now account for more than 47% of transactions under $10,000. However, the rapid shift generates new distortions: customers say that paying with Binance Pay can be more expensive than the parallel exchange rate, and the central bank’s ongoing printing of bolívares to purchase USDT further drives inflation, which is presently projected at above 229% each year. Economists worry that Venezuela’s reliance on Tether highlights the vulnerability of its financial system, with the bolívar losing relevance in the country’s economy.

Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has long noted that as the value of each XRP rises, fewer tokens are required to settle large transfers. While the calculation is mathematically sound, understanding what a $10,000 price would mean for XRP demands careful consideration of market realities and the broader financial landscape. How the Claim Gained Momentum The conversation began when John Squire shared an X post citing David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. Schwartz has repeatedly explained that as the value of each XRP rises, the number of tokens needed to settle large transactions falls. Squire’s example made the point crystal clear: at $1 per XRP, a $1 billion transfer would require one billion tokens; at $10, it would need 100 million; at $100, 10 million; and at a staggering $10,000 per token, only 100,000 XRP. The logic is flawless, and the post quickly went viral. KABOOM! $XRP AT $10,000? As David Schwartz explained: The higher the price, the fewer tokens needed to move massive value. At $10,000 per XRP, just 100K tokens = $1 BILLION This isn’t speculation — it’s pure math. pic.twitter.com/8nP5Gjsz0J — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 27, 2025 XRP’s Current Market Reality Today, XRP trades around $2.70 to $2.80, with a circulating supply of roughly 59.8 billion tokens. That puts its market capitalization in the hundreds of billions of dollars—substantial by any measure but nowhere near the multi-trillion-dollar territory implied by a $10,000 price. Recent movements in XRP’s price have mirrored broader crypto trends: shifting liquidity, profit-taking, and cautious institutional participation, even as regulatory clarity has improved following Ripple’s successful resolution of its high-profile SEC case . The Mathematics and The Magnitude Squire’s calculations are correct, but the implications are staggering. Multiplying $10,000 by the current circulating supply yields a market capitalization of about $598 trillion—a figure far exceeding the combined value of all publicly traded companies and several times greater than the world’s total economic output. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The efficiency Schwartz describes is real : higher prices do reduce the number of tokens required for large transfers. But efficiency does not erase the immense capital and liquidity that such a valuation would demand. What Would Be Required Markets are driven by supply, demand, and liquidity—not elegant formulas. For XRP to even approach a fraction of $10,000, the ecosystem would need unprecedented global adoption, extraordinary trading volumes, and sustained inflows of capital on a scale never before seen. While Ripple’s legal victories and the possibility of future XRP-based exchange-traded funds have improved the long-term outlook, these developments alone cannot create the multi-hundred-trillion-dollar market necessary to support such a price. The Takeaway David Schwartz’s observation, amplified by John Squire, captures an important truth: a higher XRP price makes large-value transfers more efficient. Yet efficiency is not a forecast. At today’s levels, XRP remains a leading digital asset with proven utility, but a $10,000 valuation remains a mathematical thought experiment rather than an imminent reality. Understanding the difference between elegant math and market possibility is crucial for anyone navigating the world of cryptocurrency.

But Glassnode said that the broader context reveals a market showing signs of exhaustion. On-chain data, for one, shows that the current 12% drawdown is modest relative to historical cycles, but it comes on the heels of massive capital inflows. ETF Slowdown + Heavy Profit-Taking Since November 2022, Glassnode has found that three major waves of investment have lifted Bitcoin’s Realized Cap to $1.06 trillion, which is nearly $678 billion in net inflows, and is almost 1.8 times larger than the prior cycle. These waves have not only driven price appreciation but also triggered repeated profit-taking events, with the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio indicating cyclical peaks each time over 90% of coins moved realized gains. Besides, long-term holders have realized 3.4 million BTC and have already surpassed previous cycles, which highlighted the “heavy distribution and maturity of the rally.” ETFs and other regulated trading vehicles, which historically absorbed supply and stabilized price, have slowed significantly in the wake of macro events, including the FOMC, which has left the market vulnerable. During this period, LTH selling surged to 122K BTC per month, while ETF netflows dropped to near zero. Such moves can easily tip in favor of downside pressure. Spot markets bore the immediate impact, as seen with volumes spiking after forced liquidations swept through thin order books, while futures experienced sharp deleveraging and options markets amidst increased risk sentiment through skew expansion. These factors collectively indicate that short-term liquidity is dominating price action, rather than fresh capital entering the market to support momentum. “Unless demand from institutions and holders aligns again, the risk of deeper cooling remains high, highlighting a macro structure that increasingly resembles exhaustion.” These obvious signs of exhaustion haven’t stopped certain cohorts of whales from seizing the pullback to expand their holdings. Whale Accumulation Amidst Market Fatigue Over the past seven days, whales, wallets holding 100-1,000 BTC, have accumulated roughly 30,000 BTC. On-chain transfers surged from 440,000 to over 770,000 BTC during the decline, while exchange outflows indicated strategic storage rather than selling. Short-term holders are now near loss territory, which could mean that local lows may be forming. Sitting at the 21-week EMA near $109.5K, Bitcoin is testing key support, suggesting the current whale-driven accumulation could be laying the groundwork for a potential reversal. Meanwhile, analysts at Bitunix said that key liquidity support sits at $108K. They, however, warned that a breakdown could test the $106K-$107K range. On the upside, $110K-$112K represents a “stop-loss cluster for longs,” while $116K is the major resistance that would require clear capital inflows to break.

With several regulatory wins, the asset has moved from a multi-year consolidation below $1 over the past year to targeting new highs around $4. Despite this momentum, the asset still faces several competitors likely to influence investor interest. To this end, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s latest artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT-5 , which identified two assets likely to significantly compete with XRP and have the potential to rise by 2026. Stellar (XLM) The first is Stellar ( XLM ), a platform focused on low-cost international transfers and financial inclusion. Stellar has seen renewed momentum recently, with analysts suggesting that growing adoption could drive its value higher. According to ChatGPT, its integration with remittance services and decentralized finance applications further positions it as a strong contender in the payments space, although its smaller ecosystem and sensitivity to broader crypto market cycles remain potential risks. Notably, one of the most notable integrations involved Paxos and stablecoin initiatives with a goal to support $3 billion in tokenized assets by year-end, backed by partners like Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. In 2025, Stellar saw a surge in adoption, driven by strategic partnerships with MoneyGram, PayPal, and Mastercard, which streamlined cross-border payments and expanded its DeFi ecosystem. By press time, XLM was trading at $0.36 up over 3% in the last 24 hours. XLM one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Algorand (ALGO) In the second spot is Algorand ( ALGO ), a layer-one blockchain designed for low-fee transactions and real-world payment applications. Algorand has emphasized micropayments and institutional use cases, with a roadmap of upgrades scheduled for 2025–2026 that aim to enhance its utility and adoption. Regarding the price movement, ALGO has mainly traded in tandem with the broader cryptocurrency market. By press time, the token was valued at $0.21 gaining over 2.6% in the last 24 hours. ALGO one-week price chart. Source: Finbold ChaGPT noted that Strategic partnerships and on-chain payment products support its growth potential, though competition from other blockchain networks and adoption hurdles could impact its performance. At the same time, partnerships have been pivotal to Algorand’s growth. For instance, in June 2025, the Algorand Foundation announced a collaboration with Paycode to expand financial inclusion through secure, offline-first digital payment infrastructure in countries such as Ghana, Zambia, and Mozambique.

Price gaps occur when an asset’s price jumps or drops sharply without any trading occurring in the intervening range, often signaling strong market momentum or a potential area of price correction. Martinez highlights that this gap represents a critical zone where XRP may experience heightened activity. Historically, such gaps tend to act as magnets, with prices often revisiting the range to “fill” the gap before resuming a larger trend. In practical terms, this could mean that XRP might retrace toward $2.51 if selling pressure intensifies, or rally past $2.73 if bullish momentum dominates. Notably, this gap aligns with broader technical signals pointing to heightened volatility. Gaps often reveal abrupt shifts in supply and demand, and in XRP’s case, it may signal traders rapidly repositioning amid recent price swings and wider macroeconomic pressures on the crypto market. Interestingly, Price gaps often act as psychological markers, shaping trader behavior. XRP’s $2.51–$2.73 zone could serve as a pivotal support-resistance range, buyers may view the lower bound as a bargain entry, while sellers see the upper bound as a profit-taking target. How the market responds at these levels will be key in defining XRP’s short-term trajectory. Barclays Report Highlights Crucial Deadline for Crypto Integration into Global Payments Popular crypto observer SMQKE has highlighted a recent Barclays report confirming the November 2025 ISO 20022 deadline as a pivotal moment for global payments and crypto integration. The shift is set to reshape how banks, fintechs, and digital asset markets connect, marking a milestone that could redefine the future of finance. SWIFT projects 91% of financial institutions will be ISO 20022-ready by November 2025, a milestone that upgrades payment data standards and paves the way for seamless interoperability between fiat, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins. Barclays notes that ISO 20022’s enhanced data model will be pivotal in bridging digital and fiat assets. By streamlining cross-border payments, accelerating settlements, and providing greater transaction transparency, it lays the foundation for crypto’s seamless integration into global finance. Meanwhile, the November 2025 deadline is not the end of payments transformation but the launchpad for a new era of financial innovation. ISO 20022’s enhanced messaging standards enable instant payments, streamlined APIs, and broader open banking adoption, while setting the stage for digital assets to enter mainstream commerce. ISO 20022’s standardized, data-rich framework is set to fuel financial innovation—enabling real-time cross-border payments, automated digital asset settlement, and seamless integration between traditional banking and DeFi ecosystems. For crypto enthusiasts, the November 2025 ISO 20022 deadline marks a pivotal shift where regulatory-compliant, interoperable systems are converging with blockchain’s capabilities. This isn’t just a technical upgrade, it’s the catalyst for embedding digital assets like XRP into the global payments ecosystem. Conclusion The November 2025 ISO 20022 deadline is far more than a compliance milestone, it is the foundation of a new financial era. By bridging traditional payments with digital assets, it sets the stage for faster, smarter, and more inclusive global transactions. As banks, fintechs, and crypto platforms align under this universal standard, the payments industry will not only become more efficient but also more open to innovation. Meanwhile, XRP’s price gap between $2.51 and $2.73 is more than just a technical curiosity, it’s a battleground for momentum where buyers and sellers will likely define the token’s short-term direction.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 13:36:54

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is uniquely positioned to attract large capital allocators due to its stable-rate borrowing and Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for highly correlated assets. Stable-rate loans will come with an initial rate slightly above variable rates, but a rebalancing mechanism ensures the protocol avoids overexposure: if supply falls below 90% of the equivalent all-variable rate, the system adjusts rates automatically, protecting both borrowers and lenders. This structure provides predictable long-term loan costs, appealing to corporate treasuries, funds, and whale desks seeking reliable yield without exposure to sudden rate spikes. ECE further amplifies Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal. By allowing highly correlated assets such as USDT, USDC, and DAI to be borrowed with higher effective leverage, the platform will multiply borrowing volume without increasing systemic risk. This improved capital efficiency boosts transaction throughput, protocol fee income, and deposit utilization, all of which generate recurring buyback potential in MUTM tokens. Combined with deposit and borrow caps and restricted collateralization, whales will be able to deploy large tickets safely, capturing yield while maintaining risk discipline. Another key lever is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. Protocol revenue from borrower interest, fees, and liquidation penalties will be used to purchase MUTM on open markets and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This approach directly converts operational activity into token demand, creating a reinforcing loop that benefits both participants and corporate users. Whales recognize that this predictable feedback loop, combined with ECE and stable-rate borrowing, allows for secure accumulation and structured price appreciation. Presale momentum and FOMO Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is currently priced at $0.035, having raised approximately $16.4 million with 16,600+ holders participating. Half of the 170 million token allocation has already been claimed. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79, requested on 2025-02-25 and revised on 2025-05-20. Social proof is further enhanced by an ongoing 50,000 USDT bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway for 10 winners of $10,000 each in MUTM. Phase 7 will lift the price to $0.040, a 15% step-up that creates urgency for both retail and whale investors seeking early entry before the next price adjustment. Path to $2: Whale capital and product catalysts From $0.035 to $2.00 represents a 57X multiple. The path to this target is structured and mechanistic. Large-scale whale capital will enter the protocol for stable-rate borrowing and yield opportunities, immediately increasing utilization. Higher utilization drives interest rate adjustments, boosting reserves and funding the buyback budget. Layer-2 integration will allow whales and retail users to transact with low fees and high throughput, expanding on-chain activity immediately after listing. Coordinated Tier-1 exchange listings, combined with visible beta usage of the platform, will amplify liquidity and adoption. These factors together will support a price trajectory toward $2 within 12–18 months of strong adoption. To illustrate, a $10,000 allocation at Phase 6 priced at $0.035 will yield 285,800 MUTM tokens. At $2, this position grows to $571,500, representing a 57X return. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s beta release will serve as a catalyst, allowing whales to stress-test the platform and scale positions quickly, generating a short, intense price run that reinforces market confidence. Phase 6 is now half sold out, and Phase 7 will raise the price by 15% to $0.040. Whales are actively trying to get both protocol yield and token upside. Getting in early guarantees participation in the stable-rate, ECE, and buyback feedback loops that set MUTM on a conservative but very profitable growth path. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the next big thing in crypto investing. It has organized revenue mechanics, predictable yield, and Layer-2 efficiency. It could reach $2 by 2026.

This monumental milestone, valued at approximately $4.21 billion, signals a profound shift in institutional confidence towards the Solana ecosystem. It’s not just retail investors anymore; major corporations are increasingly recognizing and backing Solana’s potential, making these strategic investments a significant indicator of its growing prominence in the blockchain space. Why Are Corporations Increasing Their Solana Holdings? The surge in corporate Solana holdings isn’t random; it reflects a calculated move by companies seeking to leverage Solana’s distinct advantages. Solana is celebrated for its high throughput, low transaction costs, and impressive scalability, which are critical factors for enterprise-level applications and widespread adoption. These technical strengths position Solana as a formidable contender in the competitive blockchain landscape, attracting sophisticated investors. Speed and Efficiency: Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for high-frequency operations. Low Costs: Transaction fees on Solana are remarkably low, reducing operational overhead for businesses. Scalability: Its innovative architecture allows for significant growth without compromising performance, essential for future-proof investments. Developer Ecosystem: A robust and growing community of developers building diverse applications on Solana further enhances its appeal. Who Are the Key Players in Corporate Solana Holdings? According to data from Strategic SOL Reserve, the collective corporate Solana holdings now stand at 20.92 million SOL, representing 3.64% of Solana’s total supply. This substantial figure underscores the serious commitment from institutional players. While many companies contribute to this total, one entity stands out prominently. Forward Industries has emerged as the single largest corporate holder, commanding a staggering 6.822 million SOL, which alone is valued at approximately $1.69 billion. This significant investment by Forward Industries highlights a strong conviction in Solana’s long-term viability and its capacity to drive innovation across various sectors. Their strategic position could potentially influence future market dynamics and signal a trend for other corporations to follow. What Does This Mean for Solana’s Future Trajectory? The growing trend of substantial corporate Solana holdings carries significant implications for the network’s future. Such large-scale institutional backing often brings increased stability, enhanced credibility, and greater liquidity to a cryptocurrency. It demonstrates that Solana is not merely a speculative asset but a technology with tangible utility and a robust foundation that appeals to serious business interests. This institutional embrace could accelerate Solana’s development, foster new partnerships, and potentially lead to broader integration into traditional financial systems and enterprise solutions. While challenges such as network stability and regulatory clarity remain, the confidence shown by these corporate giants provides a powerful bullish signal for Solana’s continued evolution and market presence. Strategic Impact of Institutional Confidence The accumulation of corporate Solana holdings acts as a powerful vote of confidence, transforming Solana from a promising altcoin into a recognized institutional-grade asset. This shift is crucial for its maturation and wider acceptance. When large corporations commit significant capital, it often attracts further investment, creating a positive feedback loop that can fuel ecosystem growth and innovation. Investors, both large and small, often look to institutional movements as indicators of market direction and asset strength. Moreover, the active participation of these corporate entities might also lead to governance involvement, contributing to Solana’s decentralized future and ensuring its development aligns with the needs of diverse stakeholders. This strategic alignment between corporate interests and blockchain technology is paving the way for a more integrated and robust digital economy. In conclusion, the dramatic rise in corporate Solana holdings to over 20 million SOL is a landmark event, signaling a new era of institutional trust and investment in the Solana ecosystem. This substantial backing by companies like Forward Industries not only validates Solana’s technological prowess but also paves the way for its accelerated growth and broader adoption across various industries. As corporations continue to integrate digital assets into their strategic portfolios, Solana is firmly positioned at the forefront of this exciting evolution, promising a dynamic and impactful future.

Several major asset managers, including Franklin, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary, have submitted amended S-1 filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart highlighted the wave of updates, noting that the filings reflect active movement between issuers and regulators. Significantly, these new submissions include provisions for staking, a mechanism that could allow the ETFs to generate additional yield from on-chain participation. Staking Becomes Central to ETF Model The revised filings revealed that issuers intend to place Solana into designated staking accounts. By doing so, funds can earn rewards in either cash or SOL tokens, enhancing the net asset value and potentially boosting returns for shareholders. ETF analyst Nate Geraci explained that such mechanisms make these products more attractive, especially as investors look for diversified exposure to digital assets. The staking element marks a departure from traditional ETF structures and could pave the way for broader adoption if approved. This shift aligns with recent regulatory changes. Earlier in September, the SEC allowed Grayscale’s Ethereum products to move under a more standardized framework. That decision reduces the need for repeated approvals on similar products, creating a faster pathway for issuers. Consequently, Geraci suggested that approvals for the Solana ETFs could arrive within the next two weeks, given the regulator’s improved efficiency. Market Response and Whale Activity Solana’s market price has reacted positively to the filing news, trading near $202 after a 4.8% daily gain. Despite a 14.9% pullback over the past week, investor sentiment remains constructive. On-chain data from Lookonchain revealed that two whales deposited 277,000 SOL, worth over $54 million, to exchanges in the past three hours. This movement may reflect short-term profit-taking, though the broader market outlook leans bullish. Price Outlook Ahead of ETF Decision Technical levels show Solana consolidating above a strong bid zone near $190 to $195, which has previously acted as support. Analysts at iWantCoinNews suggest that holding this range could fuel a rebound toward $250 to $300. Source: X Should momentum continue, a push to $400 is increasingly seen as possible, particularly if ETF approval arrives mid-October. Conversely, failure to sustain the $190 threshold could trigger a deeper retracement toward $165.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 13:43:28

Could $RTX Produce Higher Gains?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/once-dubbed-the-king-of-meme-coins-could-rtx-produce-higher-gains/,"Talks about Pepe price prediction keep surfacing in chatrooms and crypto feeds, but signals aren’t looking kind. The once-viral meme coin is now stuck trading near $0.0000094, hanging by a thread of support even as traders debate if it can ever reignite a true rally. Meanwhile, a new contender, Remittix has institutional analysts and top ICO investors whispering comparisons to “XRP 2.0.” Remittix is mounting a serious challenge to legacy meme plays and early buyers are already seeing gains that outpace many meme coins’ best returns this year. Pepe Price Prediction: Meme Fading, Resistance High Pepe lacks upward momentum. Analysts caution that unless it breaks above $0.0000127 soon, it risks slipping into lower trading ranges between $0.0000082 and $0.0000094. Technical indicators indicate declining momentum: MACD and RSI indicators show further decrease, and smart money appears to be leaving, reducing its exposure to memes. Some Pepe price prediction models even project a drop of 17–25% in coming weeks before support at $0.000007 swings it back up. In short, Pepe may still rally briefly on sheer momentum, but its upside is capped by its own history, making it risky for anyone chasing big returns now. Remittix: The High-Growth Crypto Challenger To Memecoins Remittix isn’t just another token, it’s aiming to redefine this altcoin cycle. Positioned as a cross-chain DeFi project and one of the fastest growing cryptos in 2025, it’s built for real utility, not just memes. Its wallet is live in beta, enabling instant transfers from crypto to fiat bank accounts in over 30 countries, with support for 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. Remittix goes deeper: It already secured CertiK verification, confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, and a deflationary ERC-20 model that rewards long-term holders. Its earning engine? A 15% USDT referral program paying out daily. In short: it’s structured for growth, adoption, and scarcity. Why top analysts are backing Remittix: Real-world payment infrastructure enabling direct bank transfers Multi-asset support across crypto and fiat pairs Daily referral rewards paid in USDT Audited and ranked #1 in pre-launch security Deflationary token design to reward holders When you compare with Pepe, Remittix is playing a different game: not hype, but product and adoption. Investors who missed meme coin 2021 may see RTX as their redemption ride. Giveaways, Access & Final Push Remittix isn’t just building, it’s bringing the community along. The Defi coin has set up a $250,000 giveaway that has drawn more than 340,000 entries and 25,000+ holders. The new referral program lets you claim 15% of every purchase you bring in, paid out daily. Analysts say that missing this window may mean watching during the breakout phase, when prices reflect real-world value instead of meme mania.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Slowing but not stopping The narrative The U.S. government seems headed toward a shutdown. While that won't directly affect crypto, the reverberations from the government shutting down will affect policymaking in the crypto world. Why it matters There are three major questions right now when it comes to market structure legislation: Will Congress pass a bill; when might Congress pass a bill; and how will a government shutdown affect this process? Beyond just Congress, a shutdown might affect regulators' rulemaking efforts, though that may not be as big an issue at the moment (depending, of course, on how long the shutdown lasts). Breaking it down Congress has until Sept. 30, 2025 — in other words, Tuesday — to pass a budget bill, or at least a continuing resolution that would keep funding the government. Republicans control the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, but they still need some Democrat support to move a budget bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies seemed set to meet and negotiate with President Donald Trump, but Trump canceled the meeting earlier this week . And on Friday, Punchbowl News reported that the House of Representatives' leadership might not bring the body back into session at all until the Senate passes a bill. A shutdown will likely slow down progress on crypto market structure legislation. The chances of market structure making it through Congress and to the president's desk this year are already growing slim even without the looming shutdown threat, according to multiple people I spoke to this week. A planned markup hearing for the Senate Banking Committee's draft bill was pushed from its tentative Sept. 30 date to late October, and the Senate Agriculture Committee has yet to publish any draft legislation. Any bill addressing market structure would need support from both committees before it moved to the overall Senate and then the House of Representatives. The individuals said they still expected to see progress next year, if Congress isn't able to move the market structure bill through the Senate and House before Dec. 31. These chances, however, grow more slim in the face of a shutdown. Locking up the federal government is often remedied with quick, short-term spending deals that only push the drama a few weeks or months further down the road and promise future congressional tie-ups. If the government does shut down, the Senate committees may have to push back plans for a markup, said Blockchain Association Senior Director of Government Relations Jessica Martinez. ""While there has been good faith negotiation on both sides, a shutdown would stall critical progress on crypto policy,"" she said in a statement. ""Despite a possible delay, our leaders in Congress are committed to getting bipartisan market structure legislation across the finish line."" Kristin Smith, the president of the Solana Policy Institute, said she was optimistic that the legislation would continue to receive bipartisan attention, saying that a shutdown would be a ""setback, but it's clear [lawmakers] remain committed"" to passing a market structure bill. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), speaking at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event earlier this month, has already tried to tamp down expectations that Congress had to act by the end of September, a deadline previously set by Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott. ""I don't want to put an artificial deadline on anything, because we're in the middle of negotiations about whether we're going to have a bipartisan budget,"" she said. ""The most important issue that Congress has to deal with right now is the fiscal cliff on September 30. That is a much more important deadline that the entire country is relying on … I really urge you, please don't give market structure an artificial deadline, because it is so important for this industry that we get this right and that we do it on a bipartisan basis."" The bright spot for the crypto industry may come from the regulators. While the federal regulators — the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Treasury Department entities — will all have to stop anything non-critical, a lot of the ongoing rulemaking efforts have already been set in motion. Some of these efforts are in the public comment phase. Didier Lavallee, the CEO of Canadian firm Tetra Digital, said in a statement that a shutdown might affect SEC Chair Paul Atkins' agenda ""in the medium term,"" but the momentum around crypto policymaking still enjoys bipartisan support. ""So while there may be short-term delays in policy timelines, it’s unlikely to fundamentally derail progress in the long run,"" he said. This week Monday 17:00 UTC (1:00 p.m. ET) The SEC and CFTC are holding a joint roundtable on Sept. 29, 2025, to discuss ways of uniting their regulatory efforts. Tuesday Post-trial motions in the Department of Justice's case against Roman Storm are due.

Among the most promising names are Remittix (RTX) , Stellar (XLM), Avalanche (AVAX), and VeChain (VET). Remittix stands out the most and is attracting both retail and institutional investors as they prepare for explosive moves in Q4 2025. Stellar gains momentum with ETF approval XLM currently trades around $0.361, and despite recent volatility, the network has shown strong signs of growth. Total Value Locked (TVL) has hit an all-time high, and daily smart contract interactions have surged past 1 million, proving rising adoption. Stellar received a massive boost when the U.S. SEC approved the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF , which now includes XLM. This move has attracted institutional attention. Analysts are closely watching the $0.40 resistance level. If XLM breaks above it, the next targets could be $0.50, $0.70, and possibly even the $1.50 to $3.30 range later in the cycle. However, failure to hold the $0.32 support zone may lead to another pullback. source: @ChartNerdTA on X With its growing partnerships and expanding ecosystem, Stellar continues to be one of the best crypto to buy now for investors. Avalanche shows institutional support AVAX is trading around $29.4. The Avalanche Foundation is building a massive treasury that could surpass $1 billion , backed by institutional giants like Dragonfly, VanEck, and Grayscale. Recently, AVAX bounced from $30.7 to just over $36, with resistance at $36 acting as a critical barrier. If bulls can push past this level, the next targets are $37-$38 and potentially $45-$55. Support sits between $31-$34, providing an attractive entry point for buyers. source: EhsanZeydabadi on TradingView VeChain positions for breakout VET currently trades near $0.0223. This project has been quietly strengthening its fundamentals through its Interstellar development phase, which focuses on achieving full EVM parity and cross-chain integration. Technical analysts highlight the 20-week moving average near $0.025 as a critical level. Historically, breaking above this level has triggered rallies of over 200%. If VET clears $0.021700 , it could make a powerful move toward upper resistance zones. source: @CryptoMichNL on X Why Remittix is topping the list for investors Remittix has quickly emerged as the best crypto to buy now. The project has already raised over $26.7 million, selling 672 million tokens at $0.1130 each. Even more exciting, Remittix has officially announced its first CEX listings on BitMart and LBank. Remittix has also launched its Beta Wallet, allowing users to explore the ecosystem early. The platform also recently passed a rigorous audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms. To give back to its rapidly growing community, Remittix has launched an instant referral reward program. Users who refer new buyers receive a 15% bonus paid in USDT, claimable every 24 hours. Investors are calling Remittix the best new altcoin for several reasons: $26.7 million already raised, proving massive early adoption. BitMart and LBank listings confirmed, boosting exposure and trading volume. Beta Wallet is live and functional, giving users hands-on experience with the ecosystem. CertiK security audit passed, providing top-tier safety and reliability. Multi-trillion-dollar market potential, targeting global remittance and payments.

Could this innovative omni-banking platform be the best crypto to buy now for early investors? Bitcoin’s Price Predictability: The Impact of ETF Inflows Despite a recent dip in its price to around $114,560, market sentiment around Bitcoin is still incredibly positive, with bulls targeting $150,000. This confidence is largely thanks to a flood of institutional demand, especially through Bitcoin ETF inflows. Just last week, a fresh $900 million flowed into US ETFs, signaling a serious appetite for crypto from big players. Source: Timothy Peterson According to analyst Timothy Peterson, these ETF flows have become a reliable way to predict Bitcoin’s short-term moves. He’s found that strong inflows are often followed by big gains, while weaker flows precede slower performance. His data even shows that average monthly returns nearly double when investors follow these inflow patterns, jumping from 3.8% to 8.0%. This isn’t just academic; it gives investors a powerful tool for managing their risk. And the resilience is clear: even after a period of sharp outflows in early 2025, Bitcoin ETF inflows quickly bounced back, proving that institutional confidence in crypto is as strong as ever. Why $TAP Offers Explosive Asymmetric Gains While Bitcoin offers substantial returns, its massive size means the percentage gains are naturally more limited. For investors chasing truly explosive growth, early-stage projects like Digitap ($TAP) present an asymmetric opportunity—a chance to turn a small investment into something life-changing. Digitap isn’t just a concept; it’s a live omni-banking platform bridging fiat and crypto, with a functional app already available on major app stores. Its native $TAP token, currently in presale, offers a unique value proposition: a fixed supply of 2 billion tokens with deflationary burn mechanisms, driving scarcity. This combination of real utility, a proven product, and a token designed for long-term value makes $TAP an appealing prospect for those seeking 100x potential. The current price of 1 $TAP token is just 0.0125 USDT. This gives investors a unique opportunity to acquire tokens before the price increases to 0.0159 USD. Early investors are already showing their confidence in Digitap’s vision to unite traditional finance and crypto, with 22.95 million tokens sold and $287,043 USD raised. This initial phase offers the kind of entry point that experienced investors look for, providing a favorable position for considerable upside as the project matures. Act Now for Future Rewards Both Bitcoin and Digitap ($TAP) offer compelling investment opportunities in the current market. While Bitcoin targets a confident $150,000, providing robust, albeit more measured, gains, Digitap stands out as an early-stage gem with the potential for much higher percentage returns. Its innovative omni-banking solution, combined with a deflationary $TAP token, positions it as the best crypto to buy now for those looking for substantial 2025 gains. For crypto beginners dreaming of their first big win, investing in Digitap during its presale could be the smart money move, offering a rare chance to get involved with a high-utility project before it hits the mainstream.

The market is showing its hand, and large-cap altcoins no longer promise explosive upside. But in crypto, there is always opportunity. Trump is opening up 401ks , and the president’s executive order to unlock access to crypto in 401k retirement plans has set the stage for nearly 90 million Americans to invest directly via their retirement accounts. This is the largest expansion of access to crypto ever seen in history. Boomers who have been walled off from crypto will be able to participate, and analysts believe their capital will not flow into bloated layer 1s but into projects that look, feel, and operate like fintech startups: live products with revenue, utility, and trust. That is why Digitap ($TAP) , the world’s first omni-bank, is gaining momentum as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Source: https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1970203890642501981 Billions About to Enter Crypto Markets? In a letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins this week, lawmakers called for swift action to implement Trump’s executive order . Their aim is to open 401k plans to crypto, loosening restrictions that have excluded retirement savers from one of the fastest-growing markets on earth. If enacted, this change could redirect billions into digital assets. However, retirement savers tend to prefer investments with utility and long-term staying power rather than speculative tokens, and investors need to be aware of this. Boomers will not buy Fartcoin in their 401ks, but projects like Digitap, which resemble fintech startups, could be attractive to them. Boomers will want live apps and revenue models, not memes and bloated large-cap alts. The times are changing, and now the best-performing cryptos will likely be those favored by institutional-style capital searching for sustainable growth stories. Why Large-Cap Altcoins Are Losing Their Spark Cardano’s struggle at $0.90 illustrates the problem clearly. With a market cap of nearly $30 billion , the upside potential is slim. Even if ADA doubled, investors would see very modest gains compared to the wild upside available in early-stage projects. These projects remain important pieces of crypto infrastructure, but in clear words, they no longer offer the kind of ground-floor entry that defines wealth-making trades in crypto. For retirement savers entering the market through 401k access, this difference is crucial. They will not be seeking the fading giants of past cycles. They will be seeking the fintech-like disruptors with real adoption curves ahead of them. Digitap: A Fintech-Style Disruptor Digitap is a live omni-bank platform available today for download on iOS, Android, and desktop. Users can deposit, withdraw, transfer, exchange, and spend across both fiat and crypto from a single dashboard. This project is bringing money into the 21st century and is the perfect disruptor for outdated industries like cross-border payments. The big ticket item is Digitap’s multi-rail settlement system. Transactions are routed across both traditional rails like SWIFT, SEPA, and ACH, and blockchain rails, and these routes are AI-optimized. The result is transformative: money that moves globally at the speed of information, and no bottlenecks between fiat and crypto. Digitap looks less like an altcoin and more like the next-generation banking app. This familiarity is exactly what older investors will prefer as 401k access expands. Best Crypto to Buy Now Before 401k Capital Flood As ADA struggles below $0.90, Digitap is soaring as one of the best cryptos to buy now before Trump opens up 401ks to crypto. Its presale has already raised nearly $200,000, and investors can purchase $TAP today for $0.0125. The next stage will be priced at $0.0159, giving early movers an advantage, and if the current inflows maintain, the initial stage will be sold out very soon. The opening of 401k access to crypto under Trump’s executive order could redirect billions in retirement savings into digital assets. That capital will not chase memes. It will chase utility-driven projects with real-world adoption. And Digitap looks like the clearest candidate.

Market rotation, infrastructure upgrades, and stronger developer activity are shifting attention toward altcoins with utility, scalability, and growing adoption. Rather than chasing meme cycles alone, investors are looking for networks that deliver real upgrades and position themselves for breakthroughs. With macro conditions gradually stabilizing, names that had been under the radar are now posting promising signals. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing interest in presale communities as a project that matches the momentum and structural integrity many believe will define next year’s breakout champions. Why These Altcoins Are Gaining Attention Now The backdrop for altcoin records is being built by multiple forces converging. First, more attention is going toward networks solving scaling, layer-2 solutions, and interoperability, as congestion and fees remain a concern on high activity chains. Second, on-chain metrics, transaction volume, wallet activity, staking participation, are showing strength in some previously overlooked tokens. Third, social sentiment is flowing toward real use cases: storage, AI, and alternative virtual machines rather than hype alone. Altcoins showing stability near support zones in recent days are being watched by traders for possible breakouts. Institutional observability is increasing too, especially in tokens tied to adoption and infrastructure instead of pure speculation. Altcoin #1: Toncoin (TON) Toncoin is one of those layer-1s making headlines quietly. Its price is about $2.80 depending on exchange, with a market cap over $7 billion , and daily trading volume above $90-120 million . TON has shown modest positive movement over the past 24 hours. Despite being down some over the last week, its infrastructure growth, especially integrations tied to Telegram (wallets, messaging), keep it in focus. For many, Toncoin is being watched as a potential breakout candidate because of its large user base via Telegram, real-world features, and low fees which may attract renewed usage. Altcoin #2: Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) Polygon’s ecosystem has been evolving, and its native POL token is showing signs of defending key levels. It’s trading near $0.24, after testing lower supports around $0.22, with resistance zones between $0.25 and $0.28. This zone has proven tough but in recent hours there have been inflows and better balance between buyers and sellers. Capital rotation toward layer-2s and zkEVM adoption are adding fundamental strength. Traders note that if POL decisively breaks above $0.28, followed by reclaimed moving averages, it could set up a new record challenge. Altcoin #3: MAGACOIN FINANCE: Entering the Picture Early Altcoins are lining up for breakout moves in 2025, and presale names are being included in lists usually reserved for majors. MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned that place due to its strong momentum and verifiable traction. With over $14 million raised, the presale is proving sticky with both retail and whale buyers. Analysts note that its tokenomics could support multipliers up to 70x compared to current presale levels. Credibility has been bolstered by audits from CertiK and HashEx, helping it stand apart from purely narrative-driven launches. In just the past three days, wallet signups and traffic have accelerated sharply, reinforcing the demand curve. As altcoins prepare for what could be record-breaking performances in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched as more than just a meme-inspired play, it’s being treated as a serious breakout candidate. Altcoin #4: Near Protocol (NEAR) Near has not been as loud lately, but developers and ecosystem launches are reviving interest. With its scalable sharding architecture and low gas fees, NEAR is being used more for data-storage, decentralized identity, and AI-data projects. Technicals suggest near support is holding across daily and weekly charts, and recent growth in project announcements signals potential. For those tracking altcoins ready to punch above past highs, NEAR is seen as a sleeper with solid fundamentals that could benefit from broader adoption and infrastructures seeking stable, developer-friendly chains. Altcoin #5: Optimism (OP) Optimism is benefiting from the momentum in layer-2 expansion. With scaling pressures on major chains, rollups are in focus, and OP has seen steady growth in total value locked (TVL) in its ecosystem, plus integrations of DeFi applications and bridging tools. The narrative of optimistic rollups, lower fees, and developer participation is driving positive long-term interest. Price action in recent days shows OP consolidating before potential breakout ranges. For those looking beyond the obvious names, OP seems ready to be among the record-setting altcoins if usage keeps increasing and bridging infrastructure improves. What Could Push These Altcoins to New Records For Toncoin, POL, Near, Optimism, and Arweave to set new all-time highs, several things need to align. First, continued developer activity and ecosystem growth will matter a lot, new project launches, integrations with consumer apps, partnerships. Second, social engagement and wallet or user growth feed momentum: when active addresses rise, usage metrics rise, narratives strengthen. Third, macro-crypto tailwinds, favorable regulation, increased institutional flows, clearer infrastructure funding, will help amplify the gains. Fourth, technical charts must confirm support zones, resistance breaks, and volume surges; price behavior in recent trading suggests several of these are forming. Conclusion 2025 looks increasingly like the year utility, infrastructure, and real-use case altcoins reclaim spotlight. Toncoin, Polygon, Near, Optimism, and Arweave are shining examples of networks showing the signals of record-setting potential: active development, growing use-cases, improving social sentiment, and strong technical setups. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as an early access presale project that is already building toward similar foundations, scarcity, audits, community support, and roadmap clarity. For anyone tracking the next wave of altcoins that could break new records, these names deserve close watch.

XRP Is Disappearing!,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-stop-pay-attention-now-xrp-is-disappearing/,"XRP’s trading environment has turned increasingly tense, with analysts warning that visible supply on public exchanges may be shrinking . Over the past several weeks, the token has maintained a tight but volatile trading range, keeping traders alert for sudden moves. This shifting liquidity landscape has raised concerns that a sharp price reaction could emerge if current trends continue. Exchange Flows Under the Microscope Blockchain analytics platforms have documented striking movements in exchange-controlled wallets. Some major venues have recently experienced significant withdrawals, while others have shown large inflows, creating a complex picture. The withdrawals, in particular, have fueled speculation that XRP is being transferred to private custody or institutional cold storage—actions that can temporarily reduce the supply available for public trading and magnify price swings. STOP!!! PAY ATTENTION NOW! #XRP IS DISSAPPEARING! pic.twitter.com/WK5vZczbqQ — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) September 26, 2025 Ripple Bull Winkle’s Warning Against this backdrop, crypto commentator Ripple Bull Winkle sounded an alarm on X, claiming that XRP is “disappearing from exchanges” as banks, institutions, and private buyers accumulate the token behind the scenes. His message, which quickly went viral, suggests that dwindling public supply could set the stage for a “violent price shock.” While his comments highlight a real market concern, they represent one interpretation of on-chain data, which also show substantial exchange inflows at different times. Institutional Demand and ETF Momentum The narrative of shrinking exchange supply gains credibility when viewed alongside growing institutional interest. Recent regulatory shifts and a wave of cryptocurrency ETF filings have encouraged larger players to secure XRP through over-the-counter deals and long-term custody solutions, rather than leaving tokens on public exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These moves reduce the number of tokens readily available to retail traders and can increase volatility when market demand spikes. Implications for Traders If exchange balances continue to decline, even modest buying pressure could drive outsized price moves. Conversely, renewed inflows to exchanges would ease upward pressure and stabilize prices. Traders are advised to monitor exchange reserve charts, XRPL wallet balances, and key price levels around $2.77 to $3.10 for signs of either sustained accumulation or fresh distribution. Bottom Line Ripple Bull Winkle’s stark warning underscores a legitimate market risk: when significant quantities of XRP migrate off public order books, liquidity can dry up quickly, setting the stage for rapid price movement . Yet the broader data reveal a more nuanced reality—withdrawals and deposits are both occurring, and the net effect remains fluid. With XRP currently hovering in the upper $2 range and institutional interest climbing, vigilance is essential for anyone tracking the next major swing in this high-stakes market.

This milestone underscores growing institutional confidence in XRP, bolstered by increasing regulatory clarity and the token’s strengthening role within the evolving digital payments ecosystem. Open interest, a measure of the total number of outstanding futures and options contracts, serves as a key indicator of market activity and investor sentiment. The $1 billion threshold places XRP among the most actively traded cryptocurrencies, highlighting renewed momentum after years of legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, institutional adoption is emerging as the key catalyst behind XRP’s surge, with banks and payment providers leveraging its speed, scalability, and low costs for cross-border transactions. Simultaneously, deepening liquidity in derivatives markets is equipping traders with more robust hedging and speculation tools. This dual momentum has driven leveraged positions sharply higher, propelling XRP’s open interest to the $1 billion milestone. Rising open interest mirrors a broader crypto trend fueled by monetary easing and demand for alternative stores of value. Yet XRP stands apart, legal clarity and real-world payment utility give it a unique edge over other major digital assets. Therefore, XRP’s $1 billion open interest is more than a milestone, it signals growing institutional participation and deeper financial integration. With momentum building across both speculative markets and real-world utility, XRP is poised to reemerge as a leading force in the next wave of crypto adoption. Ripple’s RLUSD Lands on Bybit Bybit has officially listed Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin RLUSD for spot trading, expanding on-ramps and liquidity for both retail and institutional users. This listing enhances accessibility by enabling RLUSD trading pairs with leading crypto assets and stablecoins, strengthening its role within major centralized exchanges for trading and custody. Industry reports confirm Bybit has launched RLUSD trading across pairs like USDT, BTC, ETH, and XRP, expanding its utility for settlement, hedging, and intra-exchange conversions. These pairings make RLUSD instantly valuable to traders seeking a USD-pegged stablecoin native to the XRP Ledger ecosystem. The Bybit listing is timely, thanks to RLUSD’s integration into tokenized funds and institutional vehicles has already signaled rising demand, and exchanges typically track these flows. Its debut on Bybit therefore reflects both institutional momentum and a push toward broader market adoption. Ripple’s RLUSD, a fully backed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, was designed to expand payment rails and boost on-chain dollar liquidity. Positioned at the center of Ripple’s stablecoin strategy, which includes acquisitions and partnerships, its listing on major exchanges underscores the company’s push to integrate stablecoin payments into global finance. Therefore, the Bybit listing expands RLUSD’s reach: traders gain a liquid USD-pegged option, institutions get a new access point, and Ripple strengthens its market infrastructure. While regulatory scrutiny and regional access limits remain, the move signals RLUSD’s shift from niche use to mainstream trading corridors. Conclusion XRP’s climb to $1 billion in open interest is more than a reflection of market speculation; it highlights the asset’s transition into a maturing financial instrument with growing institutional relevance. Meanwhile, the listing of RLUSD on Bybit marks a pivotal milestone in Ripple’s push to establish its stablecoin as a serious contender in the digital dollar space. Beyond expanding liquidity and accessibility, it positions RLUSD at the crossroads of institutional adoption and retail trading. If trading activity accelerates and utility deepens across payment corridors, RLUSD could emerge as a critical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain markets",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 14:07:10

Just as decentralized networks aim to reshape finance, advanced artificial intelligence is set to redefine industries worldwide. And right now, all eyes are on South Korea AI . This tech-forward nation is making a bold play to establish itself as a leader in artificial intelligence, launching an ambitious initiative to develop homegrown large language models (LLMs) that can rival global giants like OpenAI and Google. The implications for data sovereignty, innovation, and even the future of digital economies are significant, mirroring the core principles of decentralization that many in crypto champion. Why South Korea AI is Investing Heavily in Homegrown Innovation South Korea’s strategic pivot towards sovereign AI isn’t just about technological prowess; it’s a calculated move to bolster national security and maintain tighter control over data in an increasingly AI-driven world. Recognizing the critical importance of foundational AI models, the nation has launched its most ambitious initiative to date, pledging a substantial ₩530 billion (approximately $390 million) to five local companies. This significant investment underscores Seoul’s clear desire to reduce reliance on foreign AI technologies, fostering a robust domestic ecosystem capable of driving future innovation. The Ministry of Science and ICT has carefully selected a cohort of companies to spearhead this drive, including established tech giants and promising startups. Their progress will be rigorously reviewed every six months, with funding directed towards top performers until only two leaders remain. This competitive approach ensures that the most effective and innovative solutions emerge, propelling South Korea AI to the forefront of the global AI landscape. The Power Players: Developing Advanced Korean AI Models Each of the selected organizations brings unique strengths to South Korea’s intense AI race. These companies are not merely replicating existing models but are developing sophisticated Korean AI models tailored to the local language and cultural nuances, aiming for superior performance and relevance within the domestic market and beyond. LG AI Research: Exaone 4.0 As the R&D unit of LG Group, LG AI Research offers Exaone 4.0, a hybrid reasoning AI model. This latest version combines extensive language processing with advanced reasoning features. What sets Exaone apart is its deep access to real-world industry data, spanning biotech, advanced materials, and manufacturing. Instead of solely chasing model scale, LG prioritizes intelligent data refinement, aiming to deliver practical value that general-purpose models often miss. Their strategy involves offering models via APIs and using user-generated data for continuous improvement, focusing on efficiency and industry-specific solutions rather than just massive GPU clusters. SK Telecom: A.X South Korea’s leading telco, SK Telecom (SKT), launched its personal AI agent “A.” in late 2023, followed by its new large language model, A.X, in July. Built on Alibaba Cloud’s open-source Qwen 2.5, A.X 4.0 comes in both a 72-billion-parameter and a lighter 7B version. SKT highlights A.X 4.0’s efficiency, processing Korean inputs about 33% more efficiently than GPT-4o. Their advantage lies in leveraging vast data from their telecom network, encompassing navigation and taxi-hailing services. SKT acts as a crucial bridge, bringing AI directly into everyday life through customer service, mobility, and manufacturing. They are also investing in robust AI infrastructure, including GPUaaS and a hyperscale AI data center with AWS, and fostering a full-stack ecosystem with partners like Korean AI chipmaker Rebellions and MIT. Naver Cloud: HyperCLOVA X Naver Cloud, the cloud arm of South Korea’s internet giant, introduced HyperCLOVA in 2021 and upgraded it to HyperCLOVA X in 2023. This powers their AI chatbot CLOVA X and the generative AI search engine Cue, a direct competitor to Microsoft’s CoPilot and Google’s AI Overview. Naver believes LLMs serve as “connectors” to improve usefulness across systems. Naver stands out as one of the few companies globally with an “AI full stack,” having built its HyperCLOVA X model from scratch and operating its own data centers, cloud services, and applications. Similar to Google, Naver embeds AI into core services like search, shopping, maps, and finance, leveraging its extensive real-world data for superior recommendations. They emphasize sophistication over sheer size, asserting their AI is globally competitive at comparable scales. Upstage: Solar Pro 2 As the sole startup in this competitive project, Upstage’s Solar Pro 2 model, launched last July, quickly gained recognition as a frontier model by Artificial Analysis, placing it alongside models from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic. Despite having fewer parameters (31 billion compared to 100-200 billion for most frontier models), Solar Pro 2 performs exceptionally well for South Koreans and is highly cost-effective. Upstage aims to achieve 105% of the global standard for Korean language performance. Their strategy focuses on real business impact, developing specialized models for industries like finance, law, and medicine, and fostering an “AI-native” startup ecosystem in Korea. Challenging Global Giants: The Rise of South Korea’s Large Language Models The ambition of South Korea’s initiative is clear: to directly challenge the dominance of global heavyweights like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The focus isn’t just on building any AI, but on developing Large Language Models that offer distinct advantages, particularly in areas where global models might fall short. A key differentiator is the emphasis on local language and cultural understanding. Models like SKT’s A.X 4.0 boast superior efficiency in processing Korean inputs, a crucial factor for user adoption and practical application within the country. Upstage’s Solar Pro 2, despite its smaller parameter count, has demonstrated strong performance on major Korean benchmarks, proving that tailored development can outperform brute-force scale in specific contexts. The goal is not merely to compete on general benchmarks but to deliver AI that is inherently more useful and accurate for the South Korean populace and its industries. Furthermore, the strategy involves leveraging unique datasets. LG AI Research taps into LG Group’s vast industrial data, while SK Telecom utilizes its comprehensive telecom network information. Naver Cloud integrates AI into its ubiquitous services like search and shopping, gaining invaluable real-world usage data. This deep integration with local industries and consumer behavior provides these Large Language Models with a contextual understanding that generic global models may lack, enabling them to offer more precise and relevant solutions. Beyond Benchmarks: The Future of Generative AI in South Korea South Korea’s vision for Generative AI extends far beyond impressive benchmark scores. The true objective is to translate technological advancements into tangible economic value and enhanced societal well-being. This involves a strong focus on practical applications and industry-specific solutions. Industry Specialization: Companies like LG AI Research are honing their models for specific sectors such as biotech and manufacturing, while Upstage is developing specialized AI for finance, law, and medicine. This targeted approach ensures that the AI developed addresses real-world challenges and creates immediate impact. Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Rather than engaging in an arms race for the largest GPU clusters, many Korean players are emphasizing efficiency. LG AI Research aims to maximize output from existing chips, and Upstage’s Solar Pro 2 demonstrates that high performance can be achieved with smaller, more cost-effective models. This sustainable approach is vital for long-term scalability and broader adoption. Ecosystem Building: There’s a concerted effort to foster a vibrant AI ecosystem. SK Telecom is building a full-stack infrastructure with local partners and global collaborators like MIT. Upstage is championing an “AI-native” startup environment, encouraging innovation from the ground up. This collaborative spirit aims to accelerate development and ensure South Korea remains at the cutting edge of Generative AI . This holistic strategy ensures that South Korea is not just a consumer of AI but a significant producer, shaping the future of generative technologies with its unique blend of government support, corporate innovation, and a deep understanding of local needs. South Korea’s ambitious push into sovereign AI represents a significant global development. By strategically funding local tech giants and innovative startups, the nation is building a robust foundation of homegrown AI innovation . This initiative prioritizes national security, data control, and the development of highly efficient, culturally nuanced AI models designed to outperform global competitors in specific, critical areas. From LG’s industry-specific intelligence to SKT’s telecom-powered versatility, Naver’s full-stack prowess, and Upstage’s cost-effective frontier models, South Korea is demonstrating a powerful commitment to becoming a dominant force in the global AI landscape. The world watches as this technologically advanced nation meticulously crafts its future, aiming not just to compete, but to lead.

XRP, the native token of the Ripple network, has not been spared. After a sharp sell-off, XRP is hovering near its critical support levels — leaving investors asking whether it can reclaim $5 in the coming cycle. At the same time, fresh presales like AlphaPepe are gaining traction as traders search for the “next big thing” while large-cap coins consolidate. Current Market Context for XRP XRP has struggled to maintain momentum after repeated selloffs across the broader market. The coin is currently testing the $2.70–$2.80 range, an important support zone. Analysts argue that if this floor holds, a rebound to $3.20 or even $3.60 could follow. On the flip side, a breakdown below $2.70 could open the door to deeper losses toward $2.20. Despite short-term weakness, XRP remains in the spotlight thanks to institutional developments. A recently launched spot XRP ETF has seen encouraging inflows, signaling that larger players are finally beginning to allocate capital to Ripple’s ecosystem. Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Support: $2.70 remains the line in the sand. Losing this zone would weaken the bull case significantly. Resistance: $3.20 to $3.60 is the immediate hurdle. A decisive breakout here could send XRP toward the psychological $5 level. Momentum: RSI readings suggest oversold conditions, and trading volume is beginning to recover — two signals that a near-term bounce may be brewing. For XRP to mount a true rally, investors will need to see a combination of stronger ETF demand, improved macro conditions, and regulatory clarity. Fundamental Drivers for XRP Ripple’s business model has long centered around improving cross-border payments. With banking partners exploring blockchain-powered settlement solutions, XRP plays a critical role in liquidity provision. Recent developments include: ETF Tailwinds: The new Rex-Osprey Spot XRP ETF could accelerate institutional adoption. Regulatory Clarity: Ripple’s legal battles with the SEC appear closer to resolution, reducing uncertainty. Utility Growth: Tokenized assets and on-demand liquidity services provide a strong use case for RippleNet and XRP. If these fundamentals align, XRP could not only stabilize but also become a leader in the next bullish cycle. Price Prediction Scenarios Bull Case: XRP holds $2.70 support, breaks through $3.60, and rallies toward $5 in 2025, driven by ETF inflows and renewed investor confidence. Base Case: XRP consolidates between $2.70 and $3.50, with gradual upside potential as fundamentals strengthen. Bear Case: Failure to hold key support could drag XRP toward $2.20, delaying any recovery until broader market sentiment improves. Where AlphaPepe Fits Into the Picture While XRP remains a top-10 asset with institutional upside, speculative traders often seek higher-risk opportunities during market consolidations. This is where AlphaPepe (ALPE), a fast-rising meme coin presale, enters the conversation. AlphaPepe combines community-first tokenomics with innovative features like flexible staking pools and an upcoming DAO that incentivizes long-term holding. The project has already attracted close to 1,600 holders, highlighting organic community growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, AlphaPepe’s presale structure and staking options are designed to reduce post-launch dumping — a feature that resonates with investors cautious about volatility. As capital rotates between large caps and speculative plays, it is not unusual to see traders balancing exposure between established names like XRP and newer presales such as AlphaPepe. Conclusion XRP stands at a critical juncture. Holding $2.70 support could open the door for a recovery toward $3.50–$5, while a breakdown risks delaying bullish hopes. Institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and Ripple’s real-world use cases remain the key drivers for long-term success. At the same time, speculative appetite in the crypto market has not faded. Projects like AlphaPepe highlight how investor attention can shift rapidly toward presales with strong tokenomics and viral growth potential. For those seeking stability, XRP continues to offer blue-chip credibility. For those chasing explosive gains, AlphaPepe provides a different kind of upside.

BTC is still the most popular cryptocurrency, but many investors are now looking at meme currencies, which often give significant returns when the market increases. This September, four tokens stood out. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is at the top of the list. It’s a presale powerhouse that mixes meme culture with serious blockchain innovation. Snek (SNEK), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Useless Coin (USELESS) are each gaining traction in their own ways. Combined, they offer a wide range of chances for investors willing to take risks. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Presale Powerhouse Leading the Pack Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is swiftly becoming the meme token everyone talks about in 2025. Now in Stage 13 of its presale, the price is $0.0022. The project is developing a Layer-2 blockchain that works with Ethereum and is made for meme tokens. It offers transactions that happen in a flash, very low costs, and security against sniper bots, which gives everyone a better chance during launches. This puts it much ahead of most meme coins. A CertiK audit makes investors feel better about their investments by ensuring their smart contracts are safe. Little Pepe is a mix of funny and helpful things. There are no transaction fees, staking rewards, and a Meme Launchpad for new enterprises. Marketing has also made the hype bigger. Little Pepe keeps its community interested and thrilled with a $777,000 giveaway and ETH awards for the best customers. Analysts say that when it goes public, it will have a lot of room to grow, with a target price of around $0.003. Snek (SNEK): Mid-Cap Meme Coin with Room to Grow Snek has become a meme coin with a growing group of supporters. SNEK is one of the stronger mid-tier meme tokens right now, with a market cap of about $300 million and a price of about $0.0042. Snek isn’t as new as Little Pepe, but it still looks good because its liquidity is expanding, and it has a loyal community. It strikes a compromise between higher-cap meme tokens like WIF and coins that are more of a gamble, like Useless Coin. It’s a good choice for investors with moderate risk. Dogwifhat (WIF): Branded Meme Culture at Scale Dogwifhat is another meme currency that has done well because of its strong brand and cultural connection. WIF is one of the most well-known meme tokens on the market. It costs about $0.89 and has a lot of trading activity. Analysts say the recent 6–7% drop in WIF’s value is due to profit-taking and not a loss of momentum. Its community keeps it active and makes it relevant in the meme world. WIF’s current value is what makes it hard for them. The percentage growth potential may be lower because the price is higher than newer meme tokens. But WIF is still a good choice for investors who want to get involved with a well-known meme brand. Useless Coin (USELESS): High-Risk, High-Reward Meme Satire Useless Coin has gained popularity through humor and sarcasm, completely embracing its “useless” name. The coin is currently worth $0.2189, and it has gone up more than 125% in the last three months, thanks to whales buying it up and exchanges losing money. However, the risks are substantial. With no roadmap or utility, the token’s fate depends entirely on maintaining cultural traction. If the joke wears off or sentiment shifts, its price could quickly reverse, making it highly speculative. Conclusion Bitcoin has been going up 22% this year, and meme coins are riding the wave of fresh hope. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the frontrunner, with a lot of presale momentum, Layer-2 utility, and active marketing to get investors interested before it goes public. Snek (SNEK) offers mid-tier stability with room for growth, Dogwifhat (WIF) has great branding and community influence, and Useless Coin (USELESS) is still a speculative investment for those who like meme-driven volatility. These four show how many ways there are to make money in the meme coin space. Little Pepe makes the best case for people who are prepared to take chances this September. At only $0.0022, it is still an early-stage jewel that might significantly increase portfolios as Bitcoin’s bull run continues.

The funds were sent to two new addresses, according to blockchain analysts from Lookonchain. Analysts suggest these wallets are tied to an early Ethereum investor, known as Ethereum-OG, who initially obtained much of his ETH through the Bitfinex exchange. In total, this whale still controls more than 736,000 ETH — approximately $2.89 billion spread across eight separate wallets. Market Analysts React to Whale Activity The unexpected transfer sparked speculation across the crypto community. X (formerly Twitter) user FOMOmeter commented that such moves are not necessarily aimed at liquidations. Lookonchain also highlighted an uptick in institutional activity around Ethereum.

The latest consensus is that Solana, Remittix , Cardano, and Hedera each stand out as the best crypto to buy now, bringing different edges to the evolving digital economy. Solana (SOL): Holding Key Levels Amid Institutional Inflows Solana continues to trade around $200, defending the critical $197 support after a 16% weekly drop. Despite volatility, analysts point to strong institutional inflows, with Pantera-backed treasuries acquiring over $167 million in SOL. Solana Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko On-chain activity is maturing, with stablecoins now accounting for 58% of Solana’s DeFi volume. Technical setups hint at a breakout toward $250–$295, while bullish scenarios extend as high as $500 by Q4 2025. This strong support and corporate adoption balance keep SOL on the list of the best crypto to buy now. Remittix (RTX): Trending PayFi Presale Project Remittix (RTX) solves an age-old problem: the inefficiencies of cross-border remittances. Designed to serve freelancers, businesses, and everyday users, Remittix is building a system that turns crypto into practical, low-cost payment rails. Key progress includes: $26.7 million raised with 672 million tokens sold in presale CertiK KYC verification and ranked #1 Pre-Launch Token on Skynet Remittix Wallet is in Beta with live community testing Crypto-to-fiat Web App set for Beta in Q4 BitMart and LBank exchange listings secured, with two more to be announced Remittix is already attractive to investors seeking passive earnings through its $250,000 giveaway and 15% USDT referral rewards, which are paid instantly and claimable daily. With adoption strategies targeting everyday money movement, analysts are increasingly naming RTX as the best crypto to buy now for both utility and upside. Cardano (ADA): Trapped in A Crucial Demand Zone Cardano trades near $0.78, with its ability to hold the $0.68–$0.78 demand zone set to determine its next move. If buyers defend this level, analysts see ADA targeting $1.00 in the near term and possibly $1.33 in the mid-term. Cardano Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Cardano’s community-driven development and upcoming spot ETF approvals keep it firmly in the conversation as one of the best crypto to buy now for investors looking at resilience and growth potential. Hedera (HBAR): Bullish Patterns, ETF Potential Hedera trades near $0.24, up 80% from yearly lows but still below its $0.305 high. Technical analysis shows a bullish flag, with a potential surge to $0.40 if momentum holds. Hedera Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Adding to optimism, filings for U .S. spot HBAR ETFs and Hedera’s role in the Wyoming stablecoin project could drive institutional demand. These factors cement HBAR’s place among the best crypto to buy now. Uptober Best Crypto to Buy Watchlist Whether it is Solana’s institutional backing, Remittix’s presale momentum, Cardano’s demand zone, or Hedera’s bullish setup, each has a case to be the best crypto to buy now, going into the historic Uptober bull market. However, Remittix is quickly setting itself apart, not just for price potential, but for delivering real-world value to freelancers, businesses, and global remittance users. For those seeking both momentum and utility, analysts agree: Remittix deserves the top spot.

Early buyers of SOL saw their holdings skyrocket from cents to hundreds of dollars, while SHIB surprised the market with a viral, hype-driven surge that created massive short-term gains. Analysts now project that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, has the potential to emulate SOL’s impressive ROI while offering a more structured and sustainable approach than SHIB’s speculative rise. For traders considering strategic crypto investment, MUTM represents a unique combination of utility, growth potential, and presale momentum. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate with a dual lending framework that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. The P2C model will allow users to deposit stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, DAI, and USDD, alongside major cryptocurrencies including ETH, BTC, SOL, ADA, XRP, and LINK. Rates for lenders will dynamically adjust according to pool utilization, ensuring that capital is deployed efficiently and that borrowers have access to liquidity without destabilizing the system. For example, a user depositing $10,000 BTC into a P2C pool will earn approximately 12% APY, generating $1,200 in a year while retaining their principal. On the borrowing side, an individual providing $1,500 ETH as collateral will be able to access $1,125 in stablecoins, keeping exposure to potential price appreciation while leveraging liquidity for other opportunities. The P2P lending mechanism will isolate higher-volatility assets like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, allowing borrowers and lenders to negotiate terms directly. This approach creates a higher-risk, higher-reward segment while protecting core liquidity pools, a feature absent in hype-driven meme tokens. All loans, whether P2C or P2P, will require overcollateralization and be monitored through a Stability Factor. Liquidations will activate when positions fall below the required thresholds, enabling liquidators to maintain system solvency and protecting depositors from losses. Unlike SHIB, which relied primarily on community hype, MUTM will anchor its ecosystem with a $1-pegged stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted when loans are issued and burned upon repayment or liquidation. Governance-controlled interest rates will help maintain the peg, and arbitrage mechanisms will keep the system balanced during periods of high market volatility. Price discovery will be precise, leveraging Chainlink oracles, fallback systems, aggregated feeds, and DEX TWAP references to provide fair valuations for borrowers and lenders alike. Presale momentum and projected returns Phase 6 of the MUTM presale is priced at $0.035, with around $16.4 million projected to be raised and over 16,600 holders expected. Half of the current phase’s allocation has already been claimed, and the next Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, reflecting a 15% near-term price hike. Comparing this to SOL’s $0.22 early listing and SHIB’s ultra-low entry points, MUTM offers a presale advantage with structured utility. Early participants from Phase 1 at $0.01 will achieve 3.5x value gains by Phase 6, and the upcoming listing at $0.06 projects a 6x paper gain. Long-term adoption and exposure could see the token mirror or even surpass SOL’s historical ROI and outpace SHIB’s early speculative surge. Additionally, MUTM will integrate mtToken staking and MUTM buyback mechanisms, where platform revenue is used to repurchase tokens from the market and redistribute them to stakers. This will provide both long-term yield for investors and support price stability. Investors will also benefit from a dashboard to track real-time ROI and a Top 50 leaderboard where the largest stakers earn bonus MUTM tokens based on their rank. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is structured to ensure orderly growth, from smart contract audits and testnet demos to compliance reviews, exchange listings, and a live platform launch. Combined with a CertiK audit scoring 90 in Token Scan and 79 in Skynet, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 giveaway for ten early supporters, the ecosystem is designed to maximize both investor confidence and community engagement. While SOL and SHIB have created history with massive returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 will offer investors a compelling blend of utility, structured growth, and early presale advantage. Analysts highlight that the token’s trajectory, bolstered by stable lending mechanisms, oracle-driven pricing, and staking incentives, positions it to match SOL’s ROI and surpass SHIB’s early market performance in the next growth cycle.

This significant development aims to redefine how stability is maintained within the network, potentially shifting away from its current reliance on external stablecoins like USDT and USDC. For anyone invested in the future of decentralized finance, understanding this strategic move is crucial. Why is Polkadot Proposing a Native Polkadot pUSD Stablecoin? Currently, the Polkadot network largely depends on established stablecoins such as USDT and USDC for its decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. While these have served their purpose, the desire for greater autonomy and control over the ecosystem’s financial infrastructure has grown. The proposed Polkadot pUSD seeks to address this by offering a truly native solution. Previously, an attempt to introduce a stablecoin called aUSD, based on the Honzon protocol, faced challenges and was ultimately unsuccessful. This experience highlighted the need for a robust, well-integrated solution that aligns with Polkadot’s unique architecture. A native stablecoin would mitigate risks associated with relying on centralized issuers and external regulatory pressures, offering more resilience to the ecosystem. How Will Polkadot pUSD Enhance Ecosystem Stability? The architecture behind Polkadot pUSD is designed to foster robust stability. Unlike some algorithmic stablecoins, pUSD is proposed to be over-collateralized by DOT, Polkadot’s native token. This mechanism aims to provide a strong backing, mitigating volatility risks and ensuring a more secure asset for transactions and DeFi protocols within the network. Over-collateralization means that the value of the DOT held as collateral would exceed the value of the pUSD in circulation. This buffer helps absorb price fluctuations in DOT, offering a layer of security for pUSD holders. Furthermore, integrating pUSD directly into Polkadot’s parachain model could unlock seamless interoperability and liquidity across various connected blockchains. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for Polkadot pUSD? Introducing a native stablecoin like Polkadot pUSD brings a host of potential advantages, but it also comes with its own set of challenges that the community must carefully consider. Potential Benefits: Increased Autonomy: Reduces reliance on external, potentially centralized stablecoin issuers. Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Keeps value within the Polkadot ecosystem, fostering internal growth. Seamless Integration: Designed to work natively with Polkadot’s unique parachain architecture. New DeFi Opportunities: Opens doors for innovative lending, borrowing, and trading protocols built around pUSD. Key Challenges: Oracle Reliability: Ensuring accurate and decentralized price feeds for DOT collateral. Liquidation Risks: Managing potential liquidations during extreme market downturns to maintain peg. Adoption and Liquidity: Gaining widespread acceptance and sufficient liquidity to compete with established stablecoins. Governance Hurdles: Securing community consensus through the governance vote process. The success of this proposal hinges on a robust design and strong community support to navigate these complexities. What Does the Future Hold for Polkadot’s DeFi Landscape with Polkadot pUSD? The successful implementation of Polkadot pUSD could profoundly impact the network’s decentralized finance landscape. It represents a strategic step towards greater self-sufficiency and innovation, potentially attracting more developers and users to build on Polkadot. A native stablecoin could act as a foundational block, encouraging the creation of more sophisticated and integrated DeFi applications. Moreover, a native stablecoin would strengthen Polkadot’s position as a leading multi-chain ecosystem, offering a secure and stable asset that can flow freely between its parachains. This would not only enhance user experience but also solidify Polkadot’s vision of an interconnected, decentralized future. The proposal for a native Polkadot pUSD stablecoin marks a pivotal moment for the Polkadot ecosystem. It signifies a bold ambition to strengthen its financial independence and enhance the stability offered to its users and developers. As the community deliberates on this crucial governance vote, the outcome will undoubtedly shape the next chapter of Polkadot’s journey in the competitive blockchain space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Polkadot pUSD? Polkadot pUSD is a proposed native stablecoin for the Polkadot ecosystem, intended to be collateralized by Polkadot’s native token, DOT. Its primary goal is to provide a decentralized, stable asset for transactions and DeFi activities within the network. How is pUSD different from aUSD? While both aim to be stablecoins within Polkadot, pUSD is a new proposal following the challenges faced by the previous aUSD, which was based on the Honzon protocol. The new pUSD proposal aims for a robust design, likely incorporating lessons learned from prior attempts and focusing on strong DOT collateralization. Why is Polkadot proposing a native stablecoin? Polkadot aims to reduce its reliance on external stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which introduce centralization risks and external dependencies. A native stablecoin like pUSD offers greater autonomy, better integration with the ecosystem, and enhanced control over its financial infrastructure. Who decides if pUSD will be issued? The issuance of pUSD is subject to a governance vote by the Polkadot community. DOT holders will participate in this decentralized decision-making process, ensuring that the community has a direct say in the network’s future direction. What are the main risks associated with pUSD? Key risks include ensuring the reliability of price oracles for DOT collateral, managing potential liquidations during extreme market volatility, and achieving sufficient adoption and liquidity to maintain its peg effectively. Robust design and active community oversight are crucial for mitigating these risks. Stay informed about the latest developments in the Polkadot ecosystem!

Here Is A Cheaper Alternative For 46x ROI,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/should-you-buy-sol-now-with-solana-price-crashing-here-is-a-cheaper-alternative-for-46x-roi/,"The recent market volatility in the crypto market has left most investors questioning if Solana’s stunning pullback is a golden opportunity to buy or an indication of more insidious weakness to follow. While others are doubling up on Solana hoping for a reversal, more and more investors are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-cost altcoin making waves for its explosive growth potential and groundbreaking DeFi model. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , in presale stage 6. It is 50% sold with tokens at $0.035, garnering massive interest. With a potential 46x return on investment, MUTM could not only be the Solana alternative, but better bet in this volatile market. Solana to experience Deeper Correction before Possible Rebound Solana’s recent movements indicate deeper downside ahead before actual recovery. The formation of a double-top pattern near $250 with a neckline at $230 warns of weakening bullish momentum, while a rising wedge pattern, a bearish warning, signals further declines as trendlines meet. The Murrey Math Lines’ ultimate resistance has also led to rejection, a natural reaction after testing such a crucial level. Further, momentum indicators are signaling caution, with the MACD lines crossing bearish and the RSI moving downwards, signaling decreasing buying pressure. Analysts now anticipate a potential fall to the strong pivot zone of the Murrey Math Lines, where Solana may form its next support, potentially setting the stage for a grand rebound once selling pressure wanes. Strong Early Presale Momentum Stage 6 presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already selling its tokens at a cost of $0.035, which is justifiable given the potential of the project. The tokens have been sold to more than 16,600 investors already, and this has pushed the funds raised to more than $16.4 million. Such statistics not only reflect growing demand in the market, but also growing expectation of the release of the project. How the Ecosystem Operates Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles in an attempt to deliver operational consistency for lending, borrowing, and insurance premiums on ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Redundancy is assured through backup systems such as fallback oracle parameters, composite data feeds and time-weighted averages of exchanges. These are combined as the characteristics of the multi-step process which maintains the price data both normalized as well as on target even in volatile or extreme market conditions. It is this magic which underpins the stability of Mutuum Finance in the market of DeFi markets. Market deviation has a direct effect on the collateral management in the protocol. Proportions in percentage of loan to value (LTV), liquidation are distributed based on riskiness of the collateralized assets with risk-free tokens being given top priority and of higher risk capped at lower value. Reserve multipliers apart from additional safeguarding to users, will be distributed proportionately: 10% buffer in lower-risk assets, and up to 35% in highest-risk assets. MUTM is a negative exposure-reducing diversification model. The model is used in illiquid position flipping liquidity protocol management. Risk exposure balancing and liquidation level balancing help Mutuum keep thresholds well calibrated and risk minimized. Collateral tokens, stablecoins, and ETH also enable support for greater LTV ownership of risk, in case of more stable reserves. Proportional distribution of this sort has the greatest reserve potential and reserve safety, yet offers a best-of-all-worlds balance between protection and access. Prior to Solana Rebound, MUTM Can Blast Off Solana’s pullback will attempt to entice buyers but with caution as momentum weakens. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is racing ahead, raising over $16.4 million from 16,600+ investors with Stage 6 already 50% sold for a paltry $0.035. With an estimated 46x ROI, MUTM is a lower-price, high-potential alternative to SOL. Jump in on the presale now before it expires.

It’s emerging as the underdog utility play that many now believe could outperform both. But can any of these deliver 25× gains before January? Let’s break it down. Shiba Inu (SHIB): meme muscle fading or hidden breakout? SHIB is now trading close to $0.00001167 with a hold of about $0.000011. The price structure of I gives a clue of a possible breakout; analysts are looking out to a possible move to $0.000017-0.0000205 in case of a relapse of momentum. Some models even talk about reaching $0.0000205 as a realistic target. But here’s the caution: even that stretch is only ~4× from here, not 25×. SHIB would need a massive bull wave, token burn acceleration, and unwavering community drive to get there. The “Shiba Inu price prediction” narrative has whispers of a revival, but it seems better placed as a steady meme coin bet rather than the explosive breakout pick. Early buyers of SHIB made gains during past cycles, some even soared 50-100×. But those were unique conditions. Today’s landscape is less forgiving: large supply, regulatory scrutiny, and shifting flow toward utility tokens all cut into SHIB’s tailwind. Bonk: meme coin rewired with DeFi aspirations Bonk (BONK) trades low—around $0.000021—but its strength lies in ecosystem activity. It’s not pure meme fluff anymore: Bonk is layering in DeFi tools and trying to cement itself in Solana’s infrastructure. Analysts forecast a climb to $0.000026–$0.000030, if utility gains traction and liquidity holds. In theory, that’s approximately 4× to 5× upside, not yet near 25×. Still, Bonk’s community is more focused, and the meme angle gives it a shot at faster gains than SHIB. If market sentiment flips and memecoin mania returns, Bonk could be a dark horse—but 25×? That’s a stretch unless everything breaks perfectly in its favor. Remittix: the utility underdog ready to outrun meme tokens Remittix (RTX) is no meme. It’s shaping up as a cross-chain DeFi project and one of the top ICO/early stage crypto investment picks for value-seeking investors. Having raised over $26.7 million and sold more than 672 million tokens at $0.1130, the project is already being likened by analysts to “XRP 2.0.” Its beta wallet is live, supporting transfers across 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies and enabling direct crypto-to-bank transactions in 30+ countries. Investors who got in early are already seeing double-digit multiples. Analysts project that Remittix could deliver 25× or more gains if adoption scales, exchange listings go live, and usage climbs. Unlike SHIB and Bonk, Remittix’s growth is backed by infrastructure, not hype. Why Remittix Gets the Institutional Nod Cross-border payments built in: crypto → fiat bank transfers Broad support: 40+ cryptos, 30+ fiat currencies Real-time FX within wallet Already securing centralized exchange listings Fully audited and ranked #1 for pre-launch security In many conversations today, “buy RTX tokens” is echoing as a top directive for the next breakout play. Which has a true shot at 25×? SHIB? Solid brand, enormous supply: unlikely to multiply 25× in this regime. Bonk? More nimble, with DeFi leanings: better odds than SHIB, but still tough to hit 25×. Remittix? The utility play where 25× feels reachable. With rising presale momentum, real use cases, security approval, and exchange listings in motion, Remittix has the scaffolding others lack. If you believe utility wins over hype, Remittix may outpace both Shiba and Bonk before year-end. Miss it, and you might watch it run without you.

While the premier cryptocurrency has managed to stop bleeding in the past day, the BTC price has struggled to reclaim the psychological $110,000 level. Interestingly, the latest readings of a technical analysis indicator suggest that the Bitcoin price might have just reached a bottom and could be ready for a rebound. Has The Bitcoin Price Reached A Bottom? In a September 26 post on the X platform, a crypto analyst named after the renowned economist Frank Fetter revealed that the price of Bitcoin might have just entered a buy zone. This price projection is based on the relative strength index (RSI) indicator on the daily BTC price chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Again? $10 Million Stock Buyback Sparks Fresh Price Hopes The relative strength index is a momentum indicator used in technical price analysis to assess the magnitude and speed at which an asset’s price changes. The RSI oscillator is usually used to analyze whether a crypto asset (Bitcoin, in this case) is being overbought or oversold, suggesting a possible price or trend reversal. When the relative strength index breaks above 70, it typically indicates an overbought market condition, with the asset’s price likely to face selling pressure. Meanwhile, an RSI value below 30 implies that the market is in an oversold condition, with price on the verge of a potential rebound. According to Fetter, the Bitcoin relative strength index on the daily chart has fallen to its lowest level since the April price bottom of $74,000. This price downturn, which was triggered by the tariff war between the United States and China, saw the RSI oscillator fall beneath the 30 threshold in March. Since bottoming out at the $74,000 mark and the RSI low in April, the Bitcoin price has since gone on to set multiple all-time highs. If history is anything to go by, there is a chance that the flagship cryptocurrency could find support at its current price and run up to a new high. As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $109,331, reflecting a mere 0.2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is down by more than 5% on the weekly timeframe. Crypto Market Enters ‘Fear’ Zone The crypto Fear & Greed Index is another signal suggesting a buy opportunity in the Bitcoin market at the moment. According to the latest on-chain data from Alphractal, this metric has dropped to 28, signaling strong fear amongst digital asset investors. Related Reading: The Mobility Advantage: Why Bitcoin’s Portability Makes It Superior To Traditional Gold Meanwhile, the Fear & Greed Index of the stock market is at a neutral level, meaning that pessimism has yet to hit the traditional markets. With the crypto Fear & Greed Index at its lowest level since April 2025, the divergence from the traditional markets suggests potential accumulation opportunities in the digital asset market.

In line with this, she highlighted the target to watch out for as altcoin looks to end this downtrend and begin its recovery. Level To Watch As XRP Price Eyes Final Low CasiTrades revealed in an X post that $2.715 might mark the final low for the XRP price before it begins its wave 3 impulsive move to the upside. She noted that the price level is the bottom trendline of the consolidation and, importantly, would still not make a new low in the correction. This came as the analyst highlighted that altcoin had faced a significant rejection at the $3 resistance. Furthermore, the XRP price also lost its major .5 fib support at $2.79 and even retested it as resistance. She added that the rejection was sharp and that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is reflecting strong pressure, which suggests that the market may need to drop to lower levels for this correction to be over. This is why she believes that token may still fall to $2.715. Meanwhile, CasiTrades explained that the price is now forming a divergence on the higher timeframes but that the smaller timeframes haven’t fully exhausted yet. She stated that this suggests that the larger move down is unfolding as a 5th wave, but it hasn’t finished just yet, which is why the altcoin could drop lower. The analyst added that some altcoins, such as Ethereum and DOGE , have already reached their bottom targets. Meanwhile, others, including the XRP price, require one last dip to fully exhaust the selling pressure before sentiment can shift bullish. Key Signs To Watch For The Altcoin As part of the key signs to watch, CasiTrades noted that the 1-hour RSI has printed a bullish divergence and is holding a clear trendline. She claimed that a final drop to this price level would help confirm exhaustion. Meanwhile, the altcoin price reclaiming $2.79 by the daily close would be a strong signal, especially if it flips it back into support. The crypto analyst assured that the current XRP price action isn’t weakness but a shakeout. She added that tight consolidation, then volatility, and now exhausted selling are the perfect conditions needed for the next major breakout and a fresh market trend. However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that XRP could drop way lower than the projected bottom at $2.715, noting that there is a gap between $2.73 and $2.51. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.78, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Ali Martinez|altcoins|CasiTrades|Coinmarketcap|Doge|dogecoin|Ethereum|relative strength index|ripple|RSI|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|DOGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 15:00:38

When a dramatic price drop hits a high-profile asset like XRP , explanations flood in—some rooted in data, others in speculation. The real challenge for investors is separating measurable market forces from the stories that rush to fill the gap. Levi of Crypto Crusaders Raises Alarm Levi of Crypto Crusaders posted a video on X claiming the recent XRP plunge was no accident . He argues that the sell-off was deliberately triggered by large institutions dumping their holdings, forcing retail traders to panic-sell and intensifying the decline. According to Levi, sensational headlines about global events merely serve as distractions from the real driver: coordinated institutional selling. On-Chain Evidence of Heavy Selling Blockchain data supports at least part of that view. Market trackers recorded unusually large XRP transfers to exchanges just before and during the drop, signaling significant whale activity. Independent analytics platforms reported spikes in exchange inflows and wallet movements involving tens of millions of XRP, a pattern consistent with deliberate large-scale selling. They CRASHED #XRP on Purpose… pic.twitter.com/Msqo7Z8u34 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 26, 2025 These reports also show a broader pattern: whales accumulated XRP for months, then released sizable blocks during periods of market weakness. Such behavior can create sudden downward pressure even when long-term sentiment remains positive. Broader Market Forces at Play However, not every price shock requires a conspiracy. The recent crypto-wide downturn coincided with heavy futures liquidations and a pullback in risk assets across global markets. These factors often trigger cascading sales that hit multiple cryptocurrencies at once, including XRP. News of geopolitical tension or macroeconomic shifts can heighten fear, but leverage and margin calls frequently deliver the sharper blow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the Data Really Shows The evidence confirms that large investors sold significant amounts of XRP and that these moves helped drive the price lower. Yet proving an organized effort to “crash” the market goes beyond tracking wallet activity. Without direct proof of collusion or intent, claims of a coordinated takedown remain speculative. Guidance for Traders Levi’s warning serves as a reminder to look beyond headlines. Traders should monitor on-chain data, exchange flows, and macroeconomic conditions before reacting to sudden drops. Knee-jerk selling based solely on dramatic news is exactly the trap seasoned market participants advise avoiding. The XRP plunge underscores a larger lesson: whether moves are engineered or simply amplified by market mechanics, informed decisions depend on verifiable data—not fear or rumor.

ETH’s historical reliability appeals to institutional investors, but its Layer-1 congestion and higher transaction costs limit retail adoption speed relative to new Layer-2 integrated protocols like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Solana (SOL) overview Solana (SOL) is recognized for its high-speed Layer-1 throughput and low transaction costs, making it popular for decentralized applications and NFT platforms. However, SOL has experienced network outages and occasional scaling bottlenecks, creating uncertainty for large-scale adoption and high-value lending strategies. While fast, SOL’s infrastructure risks contrast with the predictable, treasury-backed mechanics that MUTM offers, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a preferred option for early buyers targeting high ROI in a structured DeFi environment. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and why it’s capturing attention Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed around a dual lending model that caters to both traditional stablecoins and more volatile niche assets. Its P2C lending pools will accept major stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, and DAI alongside blue-chip cryptocurrencies including ETH, BTC, SOL, and AVAX. Overcollateralization and loan-to-value ratios up to 75% will allow participants to lend or borrow efficiently. For example, a user depositing $10,000 in USDT could earn approximately 15% APY, while borrowing $7,500 USDT against $10,000 worth of ETH collateral will allow them to deploy capital without liquidity shocks. The P2P lending segment will focus on higher-risk memecoins like DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, PEPE, and TRUMP, offering individually negotiated terms in isolated pools. This approach ensures that high-risk exposure does not affect the core protocol liquidity, creating a safe yet diversified ecosystem for traders and whale desks seeking targeted opportunities. Advanced features further differentiate Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Layer-2 integration will ensure low fees and fast execution, enabling smooth borrowing, lending, and staking experiences. Its upcoming stablecoin, pegged to $1, will be minted through borrowing activity, maintaining a dynamic yet secure supply. The platform will introduce mtTokens combined with a buyback-distribute mechanism, allowing users to earn MUTM tokens funded by protocol revenue. The dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard gamify investing, offering extra rewards for large buyers and fostering engagement from both retail and institutional users. Presale momentum and early entry advantages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction during its presale phase. The total supply of MUTM is 4 billion tokens, with Phase 6 priced at $0.035, raising approximately $16.4 million and attracting over 16,600 holders. Half of the Phase-6 allocation of 170 million tokens has already been subscribed, creating a strong FOMO effect ahead of the next phase, which will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% step up. Early buyers have a clear edge. A Phase-1 participant acquiring MUTM at $0.01 will see a 3.5X presale value gain, and by the time of the anticipated listing at $0.06, that value will reach 6×. Analysts target a $3 price by 2026, translating into a 300X gain from the initial Phase-1 entry. Even participants entering at $0.035 will experience significant upside, with a pathway to 1,500% ROI through structured presale mechanics, staking rewards, and buyback-fueled demand. Security, community incentives, and FOMO Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is backed by a $50,000 bug bounty program with tiered rewards and a $100,000 ongoing giveaway for 10 winners receiving $10,000 in MUTM each. The community is already vibrant, with over 12,000 Twitter followers generating ongoing discussion and social proof. These incentives, combined with clear presale mechanics, offer both security and social momentum, making early participation more attractive than ever. If you’re a crypto investor who wants systematic growth instead of speculative hoopla, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great option. The #1 ROI selection for early investors is this one, ahead of SOL and ETH. This is because of its strong protocol mechanics, staking payouts, and the forthcoming Phase-7 price hike. Phase-6 is nearly 50% sold, and the next step to $0.040 is coming up. This means that the chance to get in at a discount is getting smaller, but there is still a clear road to the $3 aim and a 1,500% return on investment by 2026. Investors who get involved early will be able to take advantage of both the presale benefits and the beta-driven adoption cycle that is driving Mutuum Finance (MUTM) up the crypto hierarchy.

The company, Bloomberg reports citing TeraWulf CEO Patrick Fleury, is working with Morgan Stanley to arrange the funding, which could launch as early as next month through high-yield bonds or leveraged loans. Credit rating agencies are evaluating the deal, and Google’s support may help it secure a stronger credit rating than would be typical for the firm. The AI industry’s hunger for data center space, chips, and electricity has attracted crypto miners unlikely partners, which already control power-intensive infrastructure that can be repurposed for AI workloads. Google, which recently increased its backstop for TeraWulf to $3.2 billion , now holds a 14% stake in the company. That support helped AI cloud platform Fluidstack expand its use of a TeraWulf-run data center in New York in August. Other crypto-native firms are following suit. Cipher Mining struck a similar agreement with Google and Fluidstack this week. Google will also backstop $1.4 billion in obligations tied to that deal and take an equity stake in Cipher.

Novogratz offered insider insights into market cycles, institutional adoption, and the catalysts that will trigger the next major bull rally. After eight years of waiting, Wall Street's “herd” has finally arrived in the crypto market, according to Novogratz. BlackRock's involvement in ETFs and Larry Fink's role have been critical in changing the institutional mindset. Unlike past four-year crypto cycles, Novogratz thinks things will be different this time: Regulatory Clarity: New laws and the SEC's pro-crypto stance are paving the way for the industry to grow. Corporate Integration: Wall Street banks and Corporate America will accelerate the shift from “accounts to wallets” by integrating tokenized assets and stablecoins. Real World Assets (RWA) Tokenization: Portfolios will become a mix of tokenized real-world assets, including stocks, bonds, and private loans. Novogratz emphasizes the importance of community and trends in the valuation of successful crypto projects. “All successful cryptocurrencies are cults,” he says, noting that projects like XRP and Cardano, even with low use cases, survive and gain value thanks to the strength of their communities. According to him, even stocks like Tesla and MicroStrategy now have a cryptocurrency-like “cult” structure. Mike Novogratz reveals his four largest positions, expressing strong belief in three altcoins as well as Bitcoin. Related News: What's the Latest on the Altcoin Season Index? Are We in a Bitcoin Season or an Altcoin Season? Novogratz's four biggest positions are: Bitcoin (BTC) Solana (LEFT) Hyperliquid (HYPE) Ethereum (ETH) Solana (LEFT) hakkındaki tezini ise şu şekilde özetliyor: “Solana’nın anlatısı, internetin sermaye piyasaları için bir platform olacağı yönünde.” Jump Capital gibi elit yüksek frekanslı ticaret şirketlerinin Solana üzerine inşa etmeyi tercih etmesi, SOL’ü büyük sermaye piyasaları için güçlü bir aday yapıyor. Despite current global risks (especially the put options he bought due to high valuations on the NASDAQ), Novogratz predicts the markets will end with a “blow-off top” and the final leg of the frenzy will be “crazier than you can imagine.” Novogratz says Bitcoin could reach the $200,000 level and explains the biggest potential catalyst for this jump as follows: Fed Loss of Independence: Trump's appointment of a “dovish” to the Fed and his premature interest rate cut could undermine the Fed's independence, triggering a massive risk-off reaction. He predicts that gold and Bitcoin will skyrocket in this scenario. *This is not investment advice.

52344520,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/next-dogecoin-doge-3-coins-under-0-10-that-could-turn-1000-into-10000/,1758987600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52344520.jpeg,"Next Dogecoin (DOGE): 3 Coins Under $0.10 That Could Turn $1,000 Into $10,000",https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/next-dogecoin-doge-3-coins-under-0-10-that-could-turn-1000-into-10000/,"Every market cycle creates a new hunt for the next Dogecoin. In 2021, Dogecoin shocked the world by proving that a meme could become a serious investment. Today, investors are again searching for tokens under $0.10 that might explode. Out of the many projects competing for that title, analysts are paying close attention to Little Pepe . With its presale raising over $25 million and its early investors eyeing projected gains as high as 10000%, it is being called the frontrunner for the next Doge. Alongside LILPEPE, two other names worth watching are BONK and BOOK OF MEME. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) LILPEPE is currently in presale Stage 13 with a price of $0.0022. More than 92% of this stage has sold out, showing how quickly demand is building. The presale has already raised $25.9 million, with over 15.9 billion tokens sold. The momentum looks similar to what Doge once had, but there is actual infrastructure behind it this time. The project has completed a Certik audit and is listed on CoinMarketCap, adding credibility many meme tokens lack. It is built on a Layer 2 designed for meme coins with zero tax on buy and sell transactions. Anti-sniper bot protection makes sure whales cannot unfairly grab the supply. Community energy is another bullish sign. The $777,000 giveaway has already attracted more than 382,000 entries, and the Mega Giveaway is rewarding top buyers with over 15 ETH in prizes. These campaigns echo Doge’s culture-driven success but with a more coordinated approach. Analysts believe that once centralized exchange listings are announced, liquidity and visibility could push the price higher at speed. From a technical perspective, LILPEPE shows strong velocity in presale sellouts, whale accumulation, and social trend dominance. Its zero market cap advantage means it is starting with room to grow, unlike older coins with billion-dollar valuations. An aggressive bullish projection suggests that $0.20 to $0.30 is possible within a year, representing roughly 10000% gains for early presale buyers. BONK (BONK) BONK is another coin under $0.10 that continues to attract attention. It trades at a fraction of a cent but carries significant liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. Current price levels hover close to earlier lows, but BONK has posted an 18% increase over the last month, and volume remains healthy. Technical indicators show positive momentum with short and medium moving averages pointing upward. BONK’s strong community presence within Solana gives it durability even when markets cool. Analysts see moderate upside here, potentially revisiting past highs if meme sentiment revives. The projection is more conservative than LILPEPE, but a return to $0.02 or more would still deliver meaningful multiples from current levels. BOOK OF MEME (BOME) BOOK OF MEME trades around $0.00205 with a market cap near $140 million and a 24-hour trading volume above $30 million. That liquidity makes BOME one of the more established meme tokens under $0.10. Its supply sits near 68.9 billion tokens, giving investors a large circulating base to work with. Technical signals are moderately bullish. Relative strength sits in a comfortable zone, trading volumes are active, and the token price is recovering after steep declines from its all-time high near $0.026. Traders view this reset as a chance for new accumulation. BOME has room to run if narrative cycles align, especially given how meme projects often surge in waves. An aggressive projection for BOME suggests that prices could climb toward $0.05 or even $0.10 if interest spikes and new listings arrive. That would represent a 25x to 50x gain from today’s levels. It may not rival LILPEPE’s 10000% upside scenario, but it shows how powerful meme-fueled pumps can be when liquidity and narrative meet. Conclusion The search for the next Doge is far from over. BONK and BOME have communities and liquidity that keep them relevant, with projections ranging from 10x to 50x depending on market sentiment. But Little Pepe stands out for its presale momentum, whale accumulation, Layer 2 design, and massive giveaways. With early-stage pricing of $0.0022 and analysts speculating on gains that could stretch to 10000%, it has captured the kind of energy Dogecoin once had while adding real infrastructure for long-term growth.

Here’s a breakdown of the key events that transpired in the week. Trump signs executive order on TikTok deal President Donald Trump signed an executive order approving a restructuring of TikTok’s US operations , valuing the business at around $14 billion. The deal satisfies national security requirements forcing ByteDance to divest its American unit or face a ban. Under the agreement, Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund will control about 45% of the new entity, while ByteDance retains under 20%. Existing investors and new holders will account for another 35%. Oracle will manage security operations and continue cloud services. Notably, no ByteDance representatives were present at the signing, and China has yet to formally approve the deal. Analysts have previously estimated TikTok’s US arm could be worth $30–35 billion, highlighting a wide gap in valuations. US tariffs on pharmaceuticals, furniture, and trucks In a separate announcement, Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs effective October 1, 2025. The most disruptive measure is a 100% tariff on branded and patented pharmaceutical imports , a move aimed at forcing drugmakers to build plants in the US. The announcement triggered immediate selloffs in Asian and European pharma stocks, with India—responsible for about 40% of US pharma imports—seen as most exposed. Analysts warn of potential supply chain disruptions and higher US drug costs. Other industries were also targeted: 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets and vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture, and 25% on heavy-duty trucks . While intended to boost domestic manufacturing, the tariffs may raise consumer prices and pressure import-dependent sectors. Trump’s Tylenol remarks On Monday, Trump linked autism to childhood vaccines and the use of Tylenol during pregnancy—claims rejected by leading medical bodies. The president, acknowledging he is not a doctor, advised pregnant women not to take Tylenol and parents to delay vaccinations. The remarks immediately hit financial markets: shares of Kenvue, Johnson & Johnson’s consumer-health spinoff, fell 7.1% to a record low. Medical societies continue to cite data showing acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy, underscoring the gap between administration rhetoric and scientific consensus. Cryptocurrency market sees $1.5B liquidation Crypto markets endured a severe downturn on Monday, with more than $1.5 billion in long positions liquidated in just 24 hours. Ethereum plunged nearly 9% to $4,075 after close to half a billion dollars in leveraged bets were unwound. Bitcoin dropped 3% to around $111,998, while altcoins like Solana and XRP saw steeper losses. The mass liquidation dragged total crypto market capitalization below $4 trillion, erasing weeks of gains. Analysts cited high leverage, regulatory scrutiny of ETFs and stablecoins, and global macro uncertainty as key drivers of the selloff. On Saturday, the total crypto market capitalization was at $3.77 trillion. Major cryptocurrencies also continued to weaken with Bitcoin trading at $109,294, down by over 5% in the last 7 days and Ethereum at $4011.8, trading in red by more than 10% from the previous week. Nvidia commits $100B to OpenAI for AI data center expansion In a major move within the technology and AI sector, Nvidia Corp. announced it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to support the construction of new data centers and infrastructure capable of running large-scale artificial intelligence workloads. The announcement follows the signing of a letter of intent outlining a strategic partnership between the two companies. The investment will fund OpenAI’s development of data centers with a total capacity of 10 gigawatts, powered by Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, enabling the training and deployment of AI models at unprecedented scale. Nvidia and OpenAI said the first gigawatt of systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026 on the Nvidia Vera Rubin platform. Analysts note that the partnership could bolster Nvidia’s position in the AI hardware market while accelerating OpenAI’s model deployment capabilities, highlighting investor enthusiasm for large-scale AI infrastructure investments. Trump attacks the UN in General Assembly speech In his address to the United Nations, Trump accused the body of failing to support US foreign policy and wasting resources on migration . He criticized the UN as offering “nothing but empty words” and claimed it was financing illegal migration rather than curbing it. The president also stressed domestic achievements, citing lower inflation and wage growth, while framing his protectionist trade stance as essential to safeguarding US industry.

According to Bloomberg , the People’s Bank of China has used the Shanghai Gold Exchange in recent months to pitch central banks in friendly countries on the idea. At least one Southeast Asian country has shown interest, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The push would allow Beijing to strengthen its role as a bullion hub and reduce reliance on Western financial centers. Custodian services are a key part of that infrastructure, helping to attract more trading activity and enhance credibility. Gold analyst Jan Nieuwenhuijs noted on X that foreign central banks have technically been able to store gold in Shanghai since 2014, but uptake has been minimal so far. He added that one Southeast Asian country, possibly tied to the mBridge cross-border payments project, could be evaluating the option. The timing comes as central bank demand has underpinned a powerful rally in bullion. Spot gold climbed as high as $3,784.74 an ounce in New York on Monday, setting another record before easing slightly. According to MarketWatch, the metal closed last week at $3,789.80, up 43.59% year-to-date — well ahead of bitcoin’s 17% gain, the S&P 500’s 12.96% rise and the Nasdaq Composite’s 16.43% increase. Kitco News reported that despite overbought conditions, analysts expect gold’s bullish momentum to continue, citing inflation trends and growing demand for alternatives to U.S. Treasurys. Chris Mancini, co-portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said investors are increasingly turning to gold as a substitute for the dollar. Still, China faces competition from established markets such as London, whose vaults hold more than 5,000 tons of global reserves. The World Gold Council ranks China fifth among central bank gold holders, but its domestic market for jewelry, bars and coins remains the world’s largest.",Markets|Gold|China|central banks|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|ASIA|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-27 15:48:54

However, while XRP’s price prediction looks promising, a new meme-powered Layer 2 project, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , is capturing attention with over $26 million already raised and unique features that no other chain offers. Here is why analysts believe LILPEPE could turn a $ 5,000 bet into half a million by 2026. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Targets $6 With Record-Breaking Spot ETF Debut The XRPR ETF launched with nearly $38 million in trading volume on its first day, marking the largest organic ETF launch of 2025. This marked a massive milestone for XRP and the broader adoption of regulated crypto assets. With this move, CME Group has also announced plans to launch options on XRP futures in October, further strengthening XRP’s position in institutional markets. This combination of ETF inflows and futures growth has given analysts plenty of reasons to expect a significant price rally. XRP Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko XRP is consolidating around $3 after falling from its July top of $3.66. Bullish trend persists, with analysts predicting a steady rise to $6. That would double XRP’s value from its current level, solidifying its position as a top altcoin. However, while a doubling in price is bullish, it pales in comparison to the explosive potential of one new meme-focused Layer 2 project that analysts believe could transform a $5,000 investment into half a million by 2026. Little Pepe: The Presale Taking Over Crypto Conversations If XRP’s story teaches stability and institutional adoption, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is about raw market momentum and community-driven firepower. Currently in Stage 13 of its presale, the project has already raised over $26 million, selling over 16 billion tokens. Each token costs $0.0022, a 120% gain from its Stage 1 price. What makes Little Pepe different is its vision. It’s building the world’s first Layer 2 blockchain designed exclusively for memes. With ultra-low fees, lightning-fast transactions, and unique sniper-bot resistance baked into its EVM architecture, it’s setting a new standard for fair and secure meme trading. Adding to the excitement is the Little Pepe Launchpad, a meme-only hub that will incubate and launch new meme tokens directly on its chain. This has already sparked viral discussions among meme enthusiasts and analysts, who see LILPEPE as more than a presale; it’s the start of a new meme-driven economy. The team behind Little Pepe includes anonymous crypto experts who have previously guided several of today’s top meme coins to billion-dollar valuations. With zero buy/sell tax, near-zero trading fees, and confirmed listings on two top centralized exchanges at launch, the presale buzz is quickly becoming a full-blown narrative of “the next big meme chain.” Why Analysts Call Little Pepe a Future Millionaire-Maker While XRP price prediction points to a 2x rally to $6, analysts note that the asymmetric upside lies in projects like Little Pepe. With its presale momentum and unique Layer 2 framework, LILPEPE has the ingredients to deliver life-changing returns for early backers. Here’s why analysts are so bullish: Post-Launch Catalysts: Confirmed CEX listings at launch, plus an ambitious roadmap aiming at Tier-1 exchange exposure. Meme Launchpad: A built-in pipeline for meme tokens ensures constant activity and liquidity on the chain. Supply & Vesting Discipline: With 0% unlocked at TGE, a 3-month cliff, and gradual vesting, sudden dumps are prevented. With a launch price of $0.003 and a market cap target of $300 million, analysts believe Little Pepe could rally well beyond 100x if it mirrors the performance of earlier meme giants. For an investor putting in $5,000 today, that investment could snowball into $500,000 by 2026. And if that wasn’t enough, the project is sweetening the deal with a Mega Giveaway , rewarding top buyers from Stages 12–17 with over 15 ETH in prizes. From ETH rewards to a $777k community giveaway, the incentives drive even more frenzy around the presale. For many, XRP may double, but Little Pepe is shaping up as the true millionaire-maker.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been one of the possible coins to have been noticed by investors seeking high growth potential. Having hit its sixth presale stage, MUTM has already collected over $16.4 million and has attracted over 16,600 holders. The project’s revolutionary decentralized lending and borrowing strategy makes it a very significant player in the DeFi ecosystem. Its presale value has increased from $0.01 to $0.035, with an early investor return of 250%, while the subsequent phases promise further appreciation. As the crypto market continues to mature, Mutuum Finance’s focus on practical utility and user-solution driven makes it a serious contender for investors looking to get small investments to deliver high returns. MUTM has been ranked alongside Cardano and Shiba Inu as top picks for strong bull run returns. Cardano (ADA) Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Cardano (ADA) is currently navigating through more serious retracements within its ongoing downtrend, coming into contact with the important 0.702–0.786 Fibonacci region, a juncture where structural, dynamic, and liquidity-driven considerations converge. Having the weekly SMA and 21 EMA there gives them a lot of support, and this is somewhere bulls are going to be keen to defend. ADA maintaining this level would set up a good swing-long play with massive potential to the upside. The buyers should also look at the $1.1747–$1.1757 zone as a high-confluence take-profit level, which simultaneously provides a potential shorting spot with the afore-concentrated liquidity awaiting just above the mentioned level. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Daily Technical Outlook Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading within a key support zone of $0.00001100–$0.00001200, as one can observe on the daily chart. The price level has been subjected to repeated bear pressures by the EMA levels, which have acted as dynamic resistance in recent price rises. If SHIB remains supported in this area of consolidation, it may present a setup for a potential bullish reversal, targeting higher resistance levels in the coming months. A breakdown below here may trigger further losses, and thus traders will need to closely observe this important area for directional cues. The chart also indicates a possible double play: a short-term decline followed by a good bounce or an instant pop if bulls maintain the support strong. Mutuum Finance Record-Breaking Presale Mutuum Finance has witnessed all-time record-breaking demand for Stage Six presale at $0.035. Also, demand from investors has been record-breaking with over 16,600 investors and over $16.4 million raised so far. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program as an initiative to protect the platform even further. The bugs are classified on four grades, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, as an attempt to cover all the areas of vulnerability. Mutuum Finance is driven by strong security to provide service to all the customers to its best efforts. It works on the basis of collateral ratios, lending and depositing caps. Undercollateralized positions are effectively closed out by incentivized liquidations enabled through penalties and guarantee remediation charges in an attempt to stabilize the system. Efficiency of collateral is achieved best through Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, most notably for high-collateral lending. Reserve arrangements are employed in creating a buffer against market volatility and excess reserves may be invested into volatile assets in the policy of balancing instability. In an attempt to break away from traditional DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance also rewards early movers in a $100,000 giveaway competition with a chance for 10 users to win $10,000 MUTM. As a lending protocol, it provides real returns to lenders and borrowers based on its vision of an open, transparent, and efficient platform for all market participants. The Best Pick Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the top pick for investors seeking massive growth. Stage 6 of its presale is 50% sold out at $0.035, with over 16,600 investors contributing more than $16.4 million. Its dual-lending system, robust security, and efficient collateral management give it real utility in DeFi, making it a strong contender to turn modest investments into substantial returns. Although Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) offer upside, they are range-bound and slower-moving in their price action. For those looking for outsized gains, holding MUTM tokens today guarantees access to a high-demand, high-upside cryptocurrency early, before presale completion.

Fast forward to 2025, and people are turning their eyes to Remittix (RTX), arguing that it’s poised to be the next meme + utility breakout, the “PEPE of 2022 all over again.” Pepe coin price predictions by some crypto predictors openly draw this comparison. If you’re wondering how valid this is, let’s dig into price forecasts, the similarities, and how Remittix might, or might not, follow in PEPE’s footsteps. What the comparison means: “Remittix as PEPE 2022” PEPE’s story was mainly early entry + community + hype + little fundamental utility. Many investors got in very early and rode massive multipliers purely through narrative momentum. The claim here is that Remittix is combining that narrative momentum with a practical use case ( PayFi, crypto-to-bank transfers, multi-fiat wallet, etc.) . So it has both the meme/hype fuel and a structural backbone that PEPE didn’t offer at its peak. A leading crypto predictor recently published an article suggesting that, in terms of ROI potential, Remittix is lining up similarly to how PEPE looked before its breakout, meaning that those who enter now could see outsized multiples if the comparison holds. Pepe Coin price forecasts and risks To understand what Remittix is being compared against, here’s a refresher on PEPE’s price outlook: PEPE is currently trading in low base territory (often felt undervalued relative to its meme momentum). Short to mid-term forecasts suggest potential gains up to 3× to 10× from current prices, depending heavily on social momentum, listings, volume, and broader crypto market health. But risk looms large: lack of utility, dependency on hype cycles, sharp reversals, and supply pressure. Many analysts warn that PEPE’s next 10× won’t be easy without a strong supporting catalyst. Extreme long-range forecasts throw out 50×+ scenarios, but most seasoned analysts treat those as “wishful thinking unless something extraordinary happens.” Remittix: why some believe it could be the next PEPE-style breakout Here’s what Remittix brings to the table, and why the PEPE analogy has traction: Remittix has raised over $26.7 million in its presale, with 672 million tokens sold so far. Remittix is currently testing a Web3 wallet, offering features like crypto-to-bank transfers, multi-chain & multi-fiat support, and real-time FX conversion. Confirmed exchange listings ( BitMart , LBank ) and a full security audit (CertiK). 15% USDT referral rewards $250,000 crypto giveaways , low fees, and token utility design. If Remittix can deliver both hype and utility, the storyline writes itself, holding appeal to both speculators and long-term holders. Remittix price prediction (scenarios) based on PEPE analogy The label “PEPE 2022” is helpful to frame expectations; it conjures images of massive returns, viral cycles, and community frenzy. But Remittix’s most significant advantage is that it’s not trying to be PEPE; it’s building utility on top of viral potential. As a price prediction: a 10× to 50× range is a credible target if everything aligns. More ambitious multiples (100×+) are possible in dream cases, but too many dependencies to treat them as baseline expectations.

One of Bitcoin’s long-serving developers was at the center of a storm about immutability, censorship and what it means to “save” the protocol. The controversy escalated on Sept. 25, following an article published by The Rage claiming to reveal that Luke Dashjr, maintainer of the Bitcoin Knots software, advocates a hard fork that would install a trusted multisig committee with power to retroactively alter the blockchain, review transactions and remove illicit content. A blockchain hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain software, requiring all participants to upgrade to the new protocol because the new and old versions are incompatible. The piece cited purported leaked text messages in which Dashjr allegedly warned: “Either Bitcoin dies or we have to trust someone.” The story spread across X , drawing hundreds of thousands of views and intensifying a long-running philosophical rift: should Bitcoin remain a neutral settlement layer, or should developers actively filter what counts as legitimate use of the network? Dashjr rejected the claims outright . “The truth is I have not proposed a hardfork or anything of the sort, and these bad actors are just grasping at straws to slander me and try to undermine my efforts to save Bitcoin again,” he wrote. The Rage responded with a meme to the effect of demanding to know who sent the leaked messages that its story shared. Dashjr repeated his position multiple times over the following 24 hours. “Nope, nothing changed. Nobody is calling for a hard fork still."" he posted. In another reply, he underlined: “There is no hard fork.” The Knots vs. Core Divide Behind the dispute lies a deeper divide between Dashjr’s Bitcoin Knots project and the broader Bitcoin Core software used by most of the network. Knots enforces tighter transaction policies, including blocking non-financial data such as Ordinals inscriptions and Runes tokens. Dashjr and his supporters argue such measures protect Bitcoin’s monetary integrity and safeguard it from regulatory risks. Core developers have historically taken a more permissive approach, tolerating non-standard data as long as it does not break consensus. The alleged hard fork proposal cut to the heart of that tension. For Dashjr’s critics, it seemed to confirm fears that his vision requires compromising Bitcoin’s principle of immutability. For his defenders, the leak was an opportunistic smear designed to derail the case for stronger spam filters. Among his defenders was Udi Wertheimer, co-founder of Taproot Wizards , a Bitcoin Ordinals project, so one which most would assume embodies everyting to which Dashjr is opposed. “Not a Luke fan but this is a hit piece and fake news. He is not proposing this,” Wertheimer posted on X, referring to the supposed hard fork plan. ""I'm (obviously) not on Luke's side but...this is just a sloppy low quality propaganda piece,"" he wrote. Wertheimer concluded that what Dasjhr's leaked messages were a hypothetical discussion about using zero-knowledge proofs to allowing Knots nodes to avoid downloading ""spam."" ""This is, as always, a nothing burger,"" he concluded. ""It's pretty obvious to me that this proposal never gets implemented, and even if it did, it does not censor the network and does not split the network, and remains fully compatible with core."" It’s worth noting that over the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) slipped 2.2% to trade at around $109,000, a drop of over 5.5% in the last week. While there’s no direct evidence linking this dip to the controversy over Dashjr’s alleged plans, the timing is hardly helpful. In crypto markets, uncertainty alone can amplify downward pressure and rumors of protocol upheaval tend to stoke exactly that.",Tech|Bitcoin|hard fork|Luke dashjr|News,EN,0,0,FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-27 16:00:00

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-is-certain-ripple-xrp-will-replace-swift-heres-why/,"The prospect of a blockchain-based network displacing one of the world’s most established financial infrastructures is capturing significant attention across global markets. While incumbent institutions are actively experimenting with distributed ledger technology, Ripple’s XRP-powered settlement system is already operating at scale. This contrast has led some analysts to conclude that Ripple is positioned to become the next-generation backbone of international payments, potentially supplanting the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). SWIFT’s Linea Pilot: Modernizing Messaging Recent reports indicate that SWIFT is conducting a pilot program with ConsenSys’ Layer-2 network, Linea. The initiative explores whether SWIFT’s core service—secure and standardized financial messaging—can be enhanced through blockchain technology. For decades, SWIFT has served as a trusted intermediary for transmitting payment instructions between financial institutions. However, it has never provided actual fund transfers or settlement finality. Moving messaging onto a blockchain could improve transparency and speed, but it does not by itself transform SWIFT into a real-time settlement network. So you are telling This $LINEA will be used by $SWIFT for what exactly????? Messaging!!!! what about settlement and liquidity. So it is like upgrading IPHONE 8 with IPHONE 8 hehehehehehehehhe #Ripple Will be Replacing $Swift . ONLY FEW pic.twitter.com/v8j58ceOFI — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 27, 2025 Messaging Is Not Settlement It is important to distinguish between messaging and settlement. SWIFT’s role has traditionally been limited to delivering payment instructions; the actual movement of funds depends on separate clearing and settlement systems. Even with a blockchain-based upgrade, the fundamental challenge of achieving immediate liquidity and finality remains unresolved. This is precisely the gap that Ripple’s technology is designed to address. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity Capabilities Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform uses XRP as a bridge asset to enable near-instant cross-border settlement. By leveraging the XRP Ledger, ODL allows financial institutions to execute transactions in seconds without pre-funded accounts. This approach eliminates the need for costly nostro-vostro arrangements and directly tackles both liquidity and settlement requirements. Ripple’s system is not experimental; it is already in commercial use across multiple jurisdictions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Barriers to Swift Replacement Despite Ripple’s technological advantages , an immediate displacement of SWIFT is unlikely. The global banking ecosystem is deeply rooted in regulatory frameworks, legal standards for settlement finality, and conservative risk management practices. Network effects built over decades mean that many institutions will maintain hybrid operations in which legacy systems and blockchain-based solutions coexist for the foreseeable future. EGRAG CRYPTO’s Perspective Crypto market commentator EGRAG CRYPTO underscores the view that Ripple’s comprehensive settlement and liquidity model makes it a strong candidate to succeed SWIFT. According to this analysis, Ripple’s proven ability to facilitate rapid, low-cost cross-border transfers provides a competitive edge that experimental blockchain pilots have yet to match. Outlook Ripple already delivers capabilities—real-time settlement and efficient liquidity management—that SWIFT is only beginning to test through pilot programs such as Linea. While full-scale replacement will require regulatory acceptance and broad industry coordination, the growing adoption of Ripple’s ODL underscores its potential to become a dominant force in global payments. For observers like EGRAG CRYPTO, these factors collectively position Ripple not merely as a complement to SWIFT but as a credible successor when the financial sector moves decisively toward next-generation infrastructure.

The company attributes the trend to Bitcoin’s underperformance compared to other cryptocurrencies, alongside the rising impact of centralized exchanges. According to a report , all major sectors, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI tokens, and smart contracts delivered positive returns in Q3. Still, altcoins captured more momentum. Grayscale noted that the smart contract sector benefited from July’s stablecoin legislation in the US, while AI tokens and Bitcoin posted more modest results. Bitcoin Struggles to Keep Pace Bitcoin climbed to a record high of over $124,000 in August, yet its gains fell short compared to altcoins. Grayscale described the trend as an alt season—though unlike earlier cycles, Bitcoin’s dominance decline has been paired with broader growth in different crypto categories. The report also pointed out several market shifts driving altcoin strength: Companies holding more tokens on their balance sheets Increasing adoption of stablecoins in the US Higher centralized exchange trading volumes Still, both Bitcoin and altcoins remain behind gold and equities in reaching fresh highs, partly due to continued stablecoin outflows from exchanges. Outlook for Crypto ETFs As one of the largest asset managers in digital assets, Grayscale remains central in shaping new investment products. The company said the SEC’s approval of new crypto ETF listing standards should bolster markets in Q4. One of Grayscale’s multi-asset ETFs already gives exposure to leading coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Grayscale sees the third quarter as a turning point, with investor interest shifting from Bitcoin to altcoins amid regulatory change. Upcoming legislation and expanding ETF products could decide whether this distinct alt season builds into a broader rally across global markets.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 16:13:49

Crypto enthusiasts, financial students, and blockchain developers have been scouring the market for opportunities that combine hype with genuine upside. Among the hottest discussions right now are Dogwifhat, Cat in a Dog’s World, and the presale sensation MoonBull. Each offers a unique angle for investors seeking the best meme projects in 2025. Meme coins have captured the imagination of traders for years, moving beyond niche communities to mainstream attention. Dogwifhat is making waves with its vibrant community and strong roadmap, while Cat in a Dog’s World has carved out a niche with clever branding and social buzz. However, for those looking for structured potential and a strategic entry point, MoonBull presale is live now, offering early adopters a chance to ride a staged growth model designed for maximum upside. MoonBull: Jump on Stage 3 Before the Opportunity Slips MoonBull ($MOBU) is quickly earning its spot as the next big crypto , and its presale is live now. Stage 3 tokens are priced at just $0.00004057, giving early participants a rare opportunity to enter at the lowest possible rate. With 23 stages in total, each subsequent stage increases in price, making Stage 1 the most advantageous entry point for anyone serious about maximizing growth potential. Investing at this stage is about more than just buying tokens – it’s about securing your position before momentum builds. Early participants not only receive the cheapest entry but also gain strategic leverage as the market starts to notice MoonBull’s potential. The presale is first-come, first-served, creating urgency for those on the fence. Missing this stage could mean paying several times more in later rounds, and that’s a cost many investors want to avoid. To put the opportunity into perspective, imagine investing $5,000 at Stage3. With the final stage price projected at $0.00616, that initial investment could theoretically grow to over $1.2 million. This scenario highlights how timing and early participation can transform modest investments into life-changing returns. Even a smaller stake of $1,000 would yield significant upside, demonstrating why Stage 1 participation is considered the sweet spot for maximizing potential gains in 2025. MoonBull’s presale is designed to reward early adopters who understand both market dynamics and the power of scarcity. Each stage acts like a stepping stone, gradually increasing the token price and demand, giving Stage 3 participants a strategic advantage over later investors. For anyone tracking the best new crypto presales today, this represents a rare chance to get in before hype fully drives the market. Staking with 95% APY: Turn Tokens Into Passive Income Starting at Stage 10, MoonBull introduces staking with a whopping 95% APY. This system allows holders to earn consistent, daily rewards while continuing to benefit from the presale’s upward price trajectory. Tokens can be staked directly through the MoonBull dashboard, and while earned rewards have a 2-month lock-in, staked tokens themselves can be withdrawn anytime, giving investors both security and flexibility. A dedicated staking pool of 14.6 billion $MOBU ensures sustainability, providing long-term holders with a reliable stream of passive income. When combined with early entry in Stage 3, staking enables investors to multiply their upside: not only can they benefit from the presale price growth, but they can also earn significant rewards along the way. This dual benefit makes MoonBull a standout project among new meme coins live presales in 2025, blending excitement, strategy, and real earning potential. Dogwifhat: Meme Culture Meets Strategic Moves Dogwifhat has emerged as one of the intriguing meme coins this year. Known for its playful branding and vibrant community, the project is capturing attention through social engagement and influencer support. With over 12,000 active holders and rapid adoption in niche crypto communities, Dogwifhat demonstrates that a meme coin can grow beyond jokes and memes. The project emphasizes decentralized engagement, allowing users to participate in polls and governance decisions. With a circulating supply of 1.5 billion tokens, community participation is both meaningful and rewarding. Dogwifhat’s roadmap includes 3 upcoming integrations into NFT marketplaces, showing an ambition to merge meme culture with real-world digital assets. These strategies create value for holders and establish credibility in the competitive meme coin space. Cat in a Dog’s World: Clever Branding with Community Power Cat in a Dog’s World has positioned itself as a playful yet highly strategic meme coin. With an active social media community of over 8,000 followers and a growing Discord presence, the project leverages storytelling and humorous content to attract attention. Its marketing emphasizes clever engagement, which has resulted in strong online buzz despite being in early-stage development. The project has set a token allocation that balances community rewards and ecosystem growth. Approximately 1.2 billion tokens are dedicated to community incentives, staking events, and liquidity support, ensuring that every holder benefits from project activity. Cat in a Dog’s World also plans two upcoming partnerships in the DeFi space, signaling a move toward more structured growth beyond simple meme hype. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, the MoonBull presale remains the most compelling opportunity for anyone seeking the next big crypto investment. Its 23-stage presale, combined with high-yield staking and referral bonuses, provides a clear and structured pathway for wealth accumulation and community-driven growth.

Dovish policy may weaken the dollar but boost risky assets sharply. Market awaits official Fed Chair pick to confirm impact on crypto. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Sees Bitcoin Surging to $200,000 with New Fed Chair Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, predicts a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price if the next US Federal Reserve Chairman, replacing Jerome Powell, adopts a loose monetary policy stance. “In the event of a dovish Fed Chair, this could be the most powerful bullish catalyst for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,” Novogratz said in an interview with Kyle Chasse published on YouTube on September 26. A Possible Rate Cut Could Trigger Explosive Growth Novogratz explained, “ The Fed is cutting rates when it shouldn't, and they’re appointing a dovish Fed Chair .” He warned this scenario might spark a “moment of explosive growth” for Bitcoin. When asked if Bitcoin could hit $200,000, Novogratz responded, “ Of course it could... it would be a whole new story if such an appointment came to pass .” Despite the bullish outlook, Novogratz expressed concerns: “Do I want that to happen? No. Why? Because I love America.” Risks of Loose Monetary Policy for the US Economy According to Novogratz, aggressive rate cuts and dovish monetary policy could harm the US economy and undermine Federal Reserve independence. A dovish Fed typically weakens the US dollar but benefits risky assets like Bitcoin as traditional investments lose appeal. Daleep Singh, vice chairman and chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income, echoed these thoughts, stating, “There is a very high probability the Fed will act differently after Powell’s term ends in May 2026.” He added, “The dollar is likely to decline as the economic cycle progresses.” Market Reaction and Fed Chair Candidates Novogratz cautioned that appointing a dovish Fed Chair could shock markets: “Gold will soar… Bitcoin will soar.” He noted that while markets have partially priced in a dovish pick by President Trump, there is no absolute certainty until officially announced. Trump has narrowed the list of Fed Chair candidates to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Waller had advocated monetary easing earlier in July, and the Fed recently cut rates by 25 basis points, the first since 2020.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-27 16:19:00

The price is now consolidating in a critical zone where demand levels will dictate the next directional move. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin has dropped beneath the 100-day MA, leaving the price caught between the 100-day ($113K) and 200-day ($104K) moving averages. This range often acts as a “no man’s land,” reflecting indecision until either buyers or sellers reclaim momentum. The descending channel structure remains intact, suggesting persistent downward pressure unless bulls can defend the channel’s lower boundary near $109K. Holding above this region is essential to prevent deeper tests toward the 200-day MA and the $100K–$102K demand zone. Notably, there is a visible sell-side liquidity pocket below $107K, which could draw the price lower in a liquidity sweep before any major reversal attempt unfolds. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin was rejected aggressively from $117K, triggering a cascade of selling. The decline has brought the price into a bullish flag structure, with BTC now hovering just above a key demand zone below $110K. This area is vital for preserving bullish potential. If buyers defend it successfully, Bitcoin could stage a rebound toward recent highs. However, a breakdown here would likely accelerate the move toward the deeper liquidity pool near $100K, aligning with the 200-day MA. The next leg will depend on whether demand can withstand continued sell pressure or if sellers push the market into fresh lows. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan The Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap (2-week view) reveals how recent volatility has been liquidity-driven. A substantial cluster of liquidations has formed above the $117K swing high, where aggressive selling forced longs into liquidation. This band highlights the heavy concentration of stop-losses and overleveraged longs that amplified the rejection. In contrast, the heatmap shows no major liquidity clusters below the current price, implying that sellers may have already exhausted near-term downside liquidity. With Bitcoin stabilizing around $109K, this absence of downside targets may temporarily limit further declines, unless fresh order flow builds below. For now, the market remains defined by this imbalance: the $117K liquidity band overhead acts as a cap where supply dominates, while the $109K demand base must hold to avoid a deeper slide toward the $100K zone.

While the bullish trend structure hasn’t been fully broken on higher timeframes, both price action and on-chain metrics are showing mixed signals that traders should closely monitor. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH has lost the midline of its ascending channel, breaking below the dotted trendline that had supported the price since August. The asset is now testing the $4,000 key level, which aligns closely with the lower boundary of the channel and the 100-day moving average located around the $3,800 level. The RSI has also dipped near the oversold region but has rebounded slightly and is now hovering around 40, hinting at a possible local bottom if buyers step in with volume. However, if the asset breaks below the $4,000 level, a deeper drop toward the $3.5K range could be expected, which would officially put the market in a downtrend situation. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, ETH shows signs of a short-term rebound after reaching the purple demand zone around $3,850. The price bounced quite sharply from this zone and is now consolidating just below $4K. This move forms a potential short-term bottom, especially since RSI has exited oversold territory and is now trending up. That said, the structure remains bearish as long as ETH stays below $4,200 level. If buyers can reclaim that level, momentum could shift back in favor of a bullish move. Otherwise, a drop toward the $3,500 area would be very probable in the coming weeks. Onchain Analysis Exchange Supply Ratio On the on-chain data front, Ethereum’s Exchange Supply Ratio continues to trend downward, now sitting at its lowest point in years, near 0.13. This shows that a declining portion of the total ETH supply is held on centralized exchanges, suggesting a strong long-term accumulation trend. Historically, this has been a bullish signal, as it means fewer tokens are readily available for selling. However, this accumulation trend contrasts with the recent price action. While fewer ETH are sitting on exchanges, the price still dropped sharply, possibly due to short-term leverage wipeouts or broader market sentiment. In any case, this metric supports the idea that long-term holders remain confident, and unless we see a sudden reversal in exchange inflows, the macro bullish structure stays intact.

Analysts are beginning to argue that the next cycle’s top performer will not come from the current top 20 coins. Instead, attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project that has already surged 3.5x in its presale and is positioning itself as one of the most exciting names in crypto investing today. Outside the top 20, growth potential expands For investors asking crypto is a good investment during times when the market seems quiet, the answer often lies beyond the largest caps. Top 20 assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are well established, but they rarely deliver 30x or more in a single cycle anymore. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, is entering at a far lower valuation, giving it the agility to grow faster while offering a utility-driven platform that meets real lending and borrowing needs. The presale tells its own story. MUTM launched at $0.01 and has already reached $0.035 in Phase 6, meaning early participants are sitting on a 3.5x value gain before the token has even been listed. With $16.4 million raised, more than 16,600 holders, and half of the Phase 6 allocation sold, the momentum shows no sign of slowing. The next stage will lift the price to $0.040, rewarding early positioning before the token heads toward its eventual listing target of $0.06. That move alone represents a 70% value jump from today, while the longer-term price target of $1 implies gains exceeding 9,900%. Unlike speculative meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on practical models that bring new life into decentralized lending. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools allow users to lend assets into audited smart contracts and earn steady returns. For example, an investor supplying $8,000 worth of LINK into a pool earns around 13% APY, producing $1,040 in yearly interest without active trading. Borrowers, on the other hand, are empowered by overcollateralized lending. A user placing $1,200 worth of BTC as collateral can borrow $900 in USDT, unlocking liquidity while still keeping exposure to their original asset. More specialized lending is also supported through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, designed for tokens outside the main pools such as FLOKI, SHIB, and PEPE. These isolated agreements carry higher risks but also higher rewards, appealing to traders who want to push deeper into altcoin lending. By separating P2P loans from the core P2C pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures stability while still giving investors a place to access new opportunities. The system is safeguarded by a clear collateral and liquidation structure. Stablecoins and large-cap assets carry up to 75% loan-to-value ratios, while volatile meme coins are limited to around 35%. If collateral values drop, the Stability Factor triggers automatic liquidations at thresholds, ensuring solvency and protecting lenders. These mechanics create confidence in the system, something investors look for when they question why crypto is down during broader market corrections. Security, incentives, and a roadmap toward $1 In the crowded market of crypto investing, trust plays a decisive role. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already secured a CertiK audit with a TokenScan score of 90.00 and Skynet rating of 79.00, aligning with industry standards for transparency. Alongside this, the team has committed to a $50,000 bug bounty program to further harden its codebase. To energize its community, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is ongoing, rewarding 10 winners with $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. These moves combine security with community incentives, creating both confidence and enthusiasm around the presale. The platform will also feature an integrated dashboard, allowing users to connect wallets, calculate returns through an ROI calculator, and monitor real-time rankings in a Top 50 leaderboard. These additions are designed to make lending, borrowing, and tracking performance as seamless as possible, reducing complexity for both new and experienced users. Analysts argue that the final push to drive Mutuum Finance (MUTM) toward its $1 milestone will come with exchange listings. Preparations are already underway for tier-one platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, and Kraken. Combined with the project’s beta launch, these listings will expand both liquidity and visibility, amplifying demand and helping the token outperform coins that are already large caps with limited upside. For investors weighing crypto is a good investment for the next cycle, the choice is increasingly clear. Top 20 coins are reliable but slow movers, while outside that list, tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) present far greater upside with utility and security to back it. ADA once needed years to climb to $3, but MUTM is already up 3.5x in its presale and is on a trajectory to break past $1 much faster. Crypto cycles always reward early movers, and this time, those early movers are finding their way into Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

The spotlight is on Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , which has raced into presale stage 13 at $0.0022, already 120% above its launch price. The project has pulled in over $26.1 million and sold 16 billion tokens faster than expected, showing relentless demand. With a $0.003 listing price, current buyers are guaranteed a 30% return, yet analysts project far higher upside, enough to turn a $700 entry into more than $35,000 if stage growth continues into and beyond listing. Presale information and investor frenzy The LILPEPE presale has entered Stage 13, with tokens currently priced at $0.0022. Investor interest remains strong, as over $26.1 million has already been raised, with more than 16 billion tokens sold. This represents a 120% gain from the original Stage 1 price of $0.001. Each stage of the presale introduces a structured price increase, with Stage 14 set to rise to $0.0023. The presale began at $0.001 and has steadily advanced, by Stage 10, the price had climbed to $0.0019, raising $19.32 million with 12.75 billion tokens sold. Stage 11 sold out rapidly at $0.0020, followed by Stage 12 and now stage 13 at $0.0022, which has pushed the total raised to $26.1 million and tokens sold past 16 billion. The accelerating pace reflects strong investor appetite for early entry. With an anticipated exchange listing around $0.003 and projections estimating growth multiples beyond that, current buyers at $0.0022 are positioned for substantial returns. Presale giveaway boosting demand To fuel the frenzy further, there is also the current presale giveaway of $777,000, in which 10 lucky winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. Entrants make a minimum contribution of $100. Moreover, the Mega Giveaway will reward large and random buyers in stages 12-17 with several prizes of more than 15 ETH, which will attract even more buyers and encourage long-term interest. Little Pepe’s Layer 2 infrastructure, tokenomics, and utility stack put it in a unique position to grow and attract investor confidence in 2025 compared to other meme coins, which have had a hard time with price drops and split market sentiment. Little Pepe: a utility-driven meme coin Little Pepe (LILPEPE) sets itself apart from typical hype-driven meme coins by blending entertainment value with real technological utility. Operating on a meme-focused Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum, it delivers lightning-fast, low-cost transactions with zero taxes on trades. The network includes sniper-bot protection to ensure fair launches, while reward mechanisms encourage long-term holding. Its dedicated meme launchpad supports new token projects with added safety measures. Looking ahead, plans for cross-chain compatibility will further expand its utility and accessibility, cementing Little Pepe as a meme coin built for both fun and function. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is emerging as the top meme coin for 2025, far outpacing Shiba Inu and Dogecoin in growth potential. Stage 13 tokens are $0.0022, already 120% above launch, with over $26.1 million raised and 16 billion tokens sold. The upcoming exchange listing at $0.003 guarantees a 30% minimum return, while projections suggest a $700 investment could grow to $35,000 if momentum continues. Built on a Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain, LILPEPE combines low fees, fast transactions, sniper-bot protection, and a meme launchpad. With active giveaways and a structured presale, early buyers are positioned for significant upside. Join the presale now to secure tokens before Stage 14 raises the price.

As such, Dogecoin experts have identified a list of top altcoins to buy, expected to excel in the coming months. Crypto Market Patterns Point To 'Uptober' Surge Despite Dogecoin's current 20% decline on a weekly basis, industry experts are now hopeful about what they refer to as ""Uptober""—the anticipated market upswing that usually kicks off in October and the remainder of the year. As seen in the image below, there have been notable increases during these next three months for crypto prices. On average, the Bitcoin price has increased by 21% in October of the previous bull markets, with impressive gains of 46% and 44% in November and December, respectively. Dogecoin expert OxPhilantrop compared the current state of the market to the previous bullish cycle back in 2021, a year in which altcoin prices experienced extraordinary surges, with some of them exploding by as much as 481x. Top Altcoins To Buy On The Radar Ondo Foundation (ONDO): ONDO presents an interesting opportunity by providing on-chain software designed specifically for managing tokenized real-world assets (RWA). OxPhilantrop expects a jump in demand and accompanying price growth for the token, which is now priced at $1 and has a market capitalization of $3 billion. The Ionet Protocol (IO): Positioned as the world's premier decentralized computing network, allowing machine learning engineers to gain access to scalable distributed clusters for a fraction of the cost of competing projects, is another one holding significant growth potential. The PayDax protocol (PDP) : The last on the list, this rising protocol rewrites the norms of traditional banking by introducing a fully decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) financial system, dubbed by experts as ""the people's DeFi bank."" Dogecoin Expert Endorses PayDax As The Prime Altcoin While experiencing substantial success on stage one of its token presale, with figures rising toward 20% in terms of sales, another Dogecoin expert has highlighted PayDax as one of the top altcoins to buy ahead of Uptober's anticipated rally, boasting utility, services, and solutions between traditional and crypto markets. Key to PayDax's demand, visibility, and adoption across more than 20 countries, with a community of more than 10,000 users, are collaborations with auction house giants Brinks, Sotheby's, and courier Onfido, highlighting the platform's security and authenticity. PayDax is committed to leading industry advancements with top-tier technologies, as evidenced by its collaborations and future partnerships with DeFi Oracles like Chainlink (LINK). Exploring The PayDax Protocol (PDP) Features APY Rewards: Protocol staking → up to 6% annual percentage yield (APY) P2P lending → up to 15.2% APY Redemption Pool (insurance) → up to 20% APY Yield farming (leveraged 5x) → up to 41.25% APY Investors in the token presale can benefit from even greater sources of income, including the ability to leverage their crypto holdings, luxury watches, art, and more, without losing ownership and increasing liquidity, while also staking, and borrowing against crypto and real-world assets. Key Pillars Security and Transparency: PayDax has been distinguished in the expert community given its focus on ongoing smart contract audits by Assure DeFi, global regulatory compliance, which counter the risks associated with projects in presale stages, characterized by scams, rug pulls, and poor transparency. Community Engagement: Regular interaction through ask me anything (AMAs), podcasts, and video updates reinforces the protocol's transparency and accountability, led by a fully disclosed executive team, which include its CEO John Richardson, CTO Callum Waterstone, and CMO Matej Petrik. Maximize Returns With PDP Token Presale According to the Dogecoin expert, the PDP token presale offers investors a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire tokens at a discounted pricing of $0.015 ahead of potential moves of 10,000%, opening the door for exponential returns in the face of anticipated market demand. By acting now, and using the new promo code "" PD80BONUS "", investors will gain an additional 80% bonus on its purchase and set themselves up for exceptional portfolio growth and returns as the Uptober and altcoin season looms.

Both XRP/USDT and XRP/BTC pairs are sitting near important inflection zones that could define the next move. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair XRP has remained within a falling wedge structure, as the asset recently slipped below the 100-day moving average. The recent low at $2.75 is being tested again, and just below lies a more critical demand zone around $2.60, backed by the 200-day moving average, which is just below this area. This confluence makes it a make-or-break level for the buyers. If this area holds, we could see a bounce and a potential challenge of the wedge’s upper boundary near $3.10. A breakout from the wedge would open the door toward the key $3.60 level. But if the support gives out, XRP could decline to the $2.20 zone, which aligns with the lower boundary of the large ascending structure. The BTC Pair Moving on to the XRP/BTC chart, a bullish golden cross has occurred recently, as the 100-day MA pushed above the 200-day MA, but the asset hasn’t followed through yet. After a strong rally in July, the price has been moving sideways just above the 2,400 SAT support. The consolidation above both MAs suggests underlying strength, but the buyers need to hold the 2,400 SAT zone to prevent a deeper pullback. A clean break above the 2,800 SAT zone, which aligns with recent consolidation highs, could kick off the next leg higher, targeting the 3,000 SAT region once again. Otherwise, losing support may drag the pair toward the 2,000 SAT zone, shifting the overall market structure bearish. As a result, the 2,400 SAT zone remains a critical level for the investors to defend in the short term.

Dogecoin, the meme giant, is flashing signals that investors are quietly loading up again. But the real talk is around Paydax Protocol (PDP) , a presale project fusing DeFi with real-world assets. With whispers of a 20,000% upside, PDP could be the new guy that takes the spotlight next. Dogecoin Flashes a Buy Signal Again Dogecoin’s chart is looking serious again. Right now, bulls are holding the line at the 50-day SMA, showing real demand at lower levels. A relief push toward the 20-day EMA could open the path to $0.29, with $0.35 and even $0.44 on the radar if resistance cracks. This setup has traders watching closely, because Dogecoin has a history of making sudden, parabolic moves once momentum flips. For all the jokes around it, the coin has already proven it can surprise skeptics. And while Dogecoin works the technicals, investors are also hunting for newer projects with bigger upside. That’s where Paydax Protocol (PDP) enters the picture. It’s a presale token bringing real-world assets into DeFi, and analysts say it could outpace DOGE’s growth by sheer fundamentals. Paydax Emerges With a 20,000% Upside Forecast Most banks operate on a one-sided model where depositors see 1% on their money while institutions pocket the real profits. Paydax was designed to correct that imbalance, shifting control back to the people who provide the capital; lenders, borrowers, and stakers. Instead of forcing holders to sell BTC, ETH, or DOGE, Paydax lets them unlock liquidity without losing exposure. Even tokenized assets like real estate, gold, or luxury watches can be used as collateral. Valuations are handled by Christie’s and Sotheby’s, custody by Brinks, and Jumio manages ID verification, building trust into every step. On the yield side, PDP is hard to ignore. Stablecoin providers can earn up to 15.2% APY, stakers underwriting loans collect as much as 20%, and leveraged farmers can chase returns north of 40%. It’s a rare setup where DeFi utility meets real-world security; and that combination is pulling in attention fast. Why Paydax Is Gaining More Trust Unlike most new crypto projects, Paydax is putting transparency at the center of its early growth. The presale has already raised over $650,000, backed by an Assure DeFi audit and a fully doxxed team led by CEO Werner Van Staden. Knowing exactly who is behind the project sets it apart from anonymous launches. The KYC process adds even more weight for investors. A verified team means lower risks, clear accountability, and easier access to future exchange listings. Simply put, it’s harder for bad actors to disappear when regulators and partners can verify their identities. That kind of openness matters in crypto. By passing audits and KYC checks, Paydax is positioning itself as one of the safest presale plays on the market; combining the upside of an early-stage token with the credibility that usually only comes much later. Paydax Emerges as One of the Best Cryptos to Buy Under $1 Dogecoin still excites traders, but its upside is naturally limited; even a move back to $0.40 would deliver smaller returns compared to what Paydax could achieve. PDP is still in its presale phase at just $0.015, and a $1,000 entry today could mean $200,000 in Q1 2026 if the 20,000% forecast holds. That’s the difference between a mature meme token and a new utility-driven project. Dogecoin will likely keep trading in familiar ranges, but Paydax is starting from the ground floor, with faster adoption potential and a use case tied directly to DeFi and real-world assets. In crypto, timing is everything. PDP offers the kind of entry point Dogecoin gave early believers years ago. Waiting until listings push demand higher means paying more. Right now, before the crowd catches on, is when the boldest investors can secure life-changing positions. And you get 80% more tokens when you use the PD80BONUS code.

Particularly, cryptos priced under $1 like Dogecoin and the emerging Paydax Protocol (PDP) present intriguing prospects. Introduction to the Rising Stars of Crypto While Dogecoin has made headlines in the past for its meme-centric appeal and substantial price rallies, it's now signaling another potential uptrend. Meanwhile, a new player, Paydax Protocol (PDP) , is making waves by promising to amalgamate DeFi innovations with tangible assets, touting a potential climb of 20,000%. Understanding Dogecoin’s Market Movements The popularity of Dogecoin often hinges on its community's enthusiasm and market sentiment, evidenced by its recurring price surges. Currently, investors are pinpointing a revival as the coin shows demand at lower levels, potentially targeting higher resistance points such as $0.29 to $0.44. The current market trends for Dogecoin reflect this newfound interest. The Buzz Around Paydax Protocol’s Entry Unlike conventional banking models that offer minimal returns to depositors, Paydax Protocol is structured to empower its users by utilizing their funds in a more equitable manner. The protocol allows participants to leverage their cryptocurrency holdings or tokenized assets such as real estate and luxury items for liquidity, promising robust returns and maintaining asset exposure. Surmounting the traditional issues of trust in digital finance, Paydax has undergone significant scrutiny to ensure security and reliability for its stakeholders. This includes an audit by Assure DeFi , and the transparency of its founding team, reinforcing its credibility in the burgeoning DeFi landscape. Performance Comparison and Investor Sentiment As Dogecoin stabilizes within known thresholds, the presale phase of PDP at just $0.015 per token presents a stark contrast with predictions of exponential growth. Such early-stage investments carry higher risks but also the potential for remarkable rewards, as forecasted in Paydax's ambitious growth targets. The strategic entry points offered by both Dogecoin and Paydax Protocol illustrate the diverse strategies employed by crypto investors—whether choosing established names or new ventures poised for significant jumps.

Aster first overtook Circle in 24-hour revenue, becoming the second biggest protocol by daily earnings, right behind Tether on September 24 when it raked in $12.03M in protocol revenue fees while Circle brought in $7.71M, a figure that is around its usual daily baseline. The Aster DEX has stringed together consecutive days of strong revenue generation. Source: DeFiLlama . Aster stays ahead of Circle Aster , a recently launched perp DEX being positioned to compete with Hyperliquid, is growing pretty fast, attracting the attention of traders and institutions alike. On September 25, Aster outperformed Circle again, bringing in $16.33M while Circle brought in its usual $7 million. The pattern has persisted since then, with Aster’s revenue increasing each time above the previous mark, while Circle’s has maintained the status quo of around $7M. Through all of this, Tether has maintained its lead by a few million. Aster’s hot daily revenue streak highlights its explosive growth, with its 7-day fees being 2.6x higher than those of rival perp DEX Hyperliquid. This strong performance is being driven by whale activity, Aster’s private order book, broader DeFi adoption and a strong endorsement from former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Aster is set up as a challenger for Hyperliquid and other existing DEXs in a “perps war” that is now having broader implications on the landscape of crypto revenue. For the longest time, Tether and Circle dominated the revenue column with stablecoin yields. However, Aster’s breakout confirms DeFi protocols are also getting better at capturing trading fees, potentially drawing more liquidity and innovation away from the centralized players. Tether remains number one Stablecoin revenue comes from transaction fees, lending interest and treasury operations. As such, it is no surprise that Tether, whose potential valuation is tied to its dominance in the stablecoin market and interest from investors like SoftBank and Ark Invest, has remained number one in that area. Still a private company, reports claim that the crypto giant is in talks to raise up to $20 billion in a private placement that could value the El Salvador-based firm at about $500 billion. One report, citing people familiar with the matter, claims the company is seeking $15 billion to $20 billion for roughly a 3% stake. However, the figures were top-end targets, and in the end, numbers could be significantly lower, with the valuation of the company depending on the stake offered. Tether’s chief executive, Paolo Ardoino, has confirmed via a post on X that the company is indeed evaluating a fund raise from a selected group of high-profile key investors, but it is keeping it all hush-hush. In August, the company tapped former White House crypto policy executive Bo Hines as a strategic adviser to promote its expansion in the United States, a domain that is increasingly being promoted as pro-crypto.

Both Hedera Hashgraph and Cardano have seen mixed technical signals this month, but analysts agree that newer PayFi solutions are standing out. Among upcoming crypto projects, Remittix is taking center stage as it powers past $26 million raised. Experts say this momentum, combined with wallet testing and unique referral rewards, makes Remittix one of the most promising presale stories in 2025. Best crypto to buy now: Hedera Hashgraph price outlook Hedera Hashgraph is trading within a falling trend channel in the medium to long term. Such movement shows lower buy interest and a cautious outlook among investors. The coin recently reacted positively after hitting its $0.29 objective, but faces heavy resistance near $0.21. A successful breakthrough above that zone could generate new bullish signals, while failure could lead to renewed selling pressure. Compared to early-stage crypto investment options, HBAR is struggling to attract major inflows, making investors doubtful if HBAR is among the best crypto to buy now. Cardano faces bearish conditions Cardano’s performance has been under pressure with the price falling by 14.6% in the past seven days. Within the last month, Cardano also dropped 9.29%, losing around $0.07 from its value. Despite these challenges, Cardano is still considered one of the best crypto to buy now, thanks to its strong fundamentals and an engaged community. Analysts believe dips may provide quick trading opportunities, but ADA’s current setup highlights the challenges faced by older layer-1 coins when compared to newer, more impressive altcoins like Remittix. Remittix: the presale powerhouse Remittix is emerging as the best crypto to buy now thanks to its combination of PayFi innovation, community growth, and clear milestones. The project has raised over $26.7 million through the sale of more than 672 million tokens in its ongoing presale event. Tier-1 CEX listings on BitMart and LBANK are confirmed, and beta testing for the Remittix wallet is also live, signalling a strong focus on growth. Analysts note that the RTX presale momentum is further fueled by community-focused initiatives. Why Remittix leads the pack Remittix has surpassed 40,000 holders, showing mass adoption at an early stage. CertiK verification and #1 ranking adds top-level trust and transparency. The project has raised over $26.7 million already, confirming strong investor demand. A $250,000 giveaway is underway, and a referral program pays participants 15% in USDT for every new buyer they bring in, instantly claimable every 24 hours. This, combined with Remittix’s successful CertiK verification, makes it an ideal choice for investors.

While established names like Ripple (XRP) command attention, market experts are increasingly pointing to a new contender as this season’s top pick: Ruvi AI (RUVI). Citing significant institutional backing and historic presale momentum, they believe Ruvi AI has the potential to storm the charts and rival the market presence of even top-tier altcoins. This expert designation is fueled by a presale that is performing at a truly exceptional level. Ruvi AI has officially blazed past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens sold in a timeframe that has left analysts impressed. They are emphasizing that such rapid sales velocity is a rare phenomenon, typically reserved for projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is undeniable; after a quick sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply get claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. Institutional Interest: The Key to Rivaling Giants like XRP The comparison to a project like Ripple is significant. XRP’s market position was built on its ability to forge partnerships and attract institutional interest in its payment technology. Ruvi AI is now following a similar path, but within the explosive AI sector. It is attracting “smart money” and institutional backing due to its clear utility and mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . This fundamental value proposition, which provides a tangible product rather than pure speculation, gives it the foundation needed to build a sustainable, long-term presence on the charts. The project’s credibility is a cornerstone of this institutional interest. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency that serious investors demand. This combination of real-world application, a powerful AI narrative, and verified security is what separates Ruvi AI from the pack and makes it a legitimate contender. The Super App Fueling Its Chart-Topping Potential The engine driving Ruvi AI’s journey is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Last Call for Ground-Floor Pricing Before a 40% Hike The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already sold out at record speed, this entry point is rapidly closing. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP bonus structure is designed to maximize this autumn opportunity: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity upon launch, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. Autumn’s Top Pick Is Clear As the market enters a new season, the expert consensus is building. Ruvi AI has the fundamentals, the institutional interest, and the explosive potential to be this autumn’s biggest breakout star. For those looking to position themselves for the next major market move, the opportunity is here, but it won’t last long.

Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/when-will-xrp-reach-25-bitcoin-investor-shares-a-bold-prediction/,"According to reports, XRP is trading near $2.78 as markets head toward the year-end, with less than 100 days left until 2026. The token slipped more than 10% in the last week, a pullback that comes after stronger showings earlier this year. Related Reading: XRP Eyeing Explosive Move In Next Few Months, Research Shows Traders and analysts are watching a mix of on-chain signals and community chatter for clues about whether XRP can push into higher price tiers before the calendar flips. Community Predicted Targets Social media has become the loudest forum for price calls. One long-time Bitcoin investor active since 2013, who posts as Pumpius, put a $25 target on XRP before 2026 — a move that would mean over nine-fold gains from current levels. #XRP to $25 before 2026 https://t.co/7GMFJ9psR9 — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 24, 2025 Other voices have offered different ceilings: Alex Cobb has floated $22 by December, some expect $10, while a few see at least $5 as a nearer-term milestone. A handful of commenters even suggested figures above $30, tying those hopes to potential ETF flows. Replies on the thread ranged from bullish cheers to reminders to aim for smaller wins first, like cracking $4. ETF Interest And Market Flows Based on reports, optimism around potential XRP ETFs is a core driver behind the larger forecasts. Executives such as the CEO of Canary Capital have suggested that ETFs could open the door to billions of dollars of new inflows. That thesis has brought new life to bull cases and provided momentum to speculation about double-digit prices. Meanwhile, market behavior has been mixed: XRP had its strong periods in January and once more in July, yet momentum was lost thereafter, leaving traders hesitant as they balance ETF optimism with subsequent price weakness. Trading Behavior And On-Chain Signals XRP is seen to have a lower dormancy rate than Bitcoin and Ethereum in recent chain data. That indicates the units of XRP change hands more frequently, which generally means active usage — payments, transfers, and liquidity trades. Reports indicate that Bitcoin’s higher dormancy corresponds with a stronger “store of value” mental attitude, whereas Ethereum’s dormancy corresponds with developer and DeFi activity. XRP’s active circulation fits Ripple’s long-stated push to make the token a bridge asset for payments, rather than a coin mainly held for long-term gains. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Again? $10 Million Stock Buyback Sparks Fresh Price Hopes Dormancy Signals And Implications If transactional use continues to rise, it may help XRP build a case as a utility-driven asset. But higher movement alone does not guarantee price appreciation. Accumulation patterns also matter: assets that are hoarded tend to build scarcity narratives that can support higher valuations. Analysts and investors will likely watch whether greater on-chain use is matched by fresh buying pressure, including from institutional products, before updating their long-term views.

In doing so, the popular crypto advocate joked about launching an NFT collection of real characters, including herself, and other characters in the crypto ecosystem. Hester Peirce’s NFT Dream In a speech at the Coin Center, Peirce decided to respond to curious enquiries on her next plan after leaving the SEC. Notably, the “CryptoMom” and present head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force has since completed her tenure as an SEC Commissioner and only remains in service pending the appointment of her replacement. Speaking to her plans post-SEC, Hester Peirce referenced her long-standing passion for beekeeping, which may prove futile due to a lack of experience. She also nudged the idea of functioning as an exchange simply by “wearing a T-shirt,” which was an intended jab at the previous SEC’s practice under Gary Gensler , which attempted to “contort the law” by forcing crypto exchanges to register under the Securities Act with the Commission. Finally, the SEC Commissioner speaks to a Plan C known as Plan NFT. She began by first noting the regulatory progress on this class of digital assets, saying: Several years ago, the SEC managed to squelch NFTs with some strategic guidance in the form, of course, of an enforcement action: Digital cats, at least stoned ones, and other NFTs were securities. A more sober view of the securities laws now prevails. Chairman Atkins has recently acknowledged that most digital assets are not securities. In Hester Peirce’s proposed “NFT collection”, the first token is designed after her and named “CryptoMom.” In total, the Crypto Task Force boss speaks about 18 NFT characters, all based on various personalities she has encountered during her time in exploring the cryptocurrency industry. Peirce Apologizes To The Crypto Community In rounding off a rather light-hearted speech, Commissioner Hester Peirce gave a rather heartfelt apology for the rather harsh approach of the immediate SEC tenure to the digital asset space. The “CryptoMom” also urged present crypto founders, developers, and users to capitalize on the ongoing efforts of regulatory clarity to showcase the best prospects of this technology. Her statement read: I am sorry that over most of my tenure at the SEC I failed to convince my colleagues in government to give you a chance. I hope that you and others whom you have inspired will use this time—a time in which regulatory clarity has replaced ambiguity as government’s objective—to build good things that will enhance the safety, security, happiness, and prosperity of your family, friends, neighbors, and nation.

That tension is at the heart of a new analysis from prominent market commentator Egrag Crypto, who has taken a decidedly bearish stance on XRP despite its strong performance in 2025. His perspective invites a closer look at recent price action, historical patterns, and what they may signal for traders in the weeks ahead. Egrag Crypto’s Warning In a recent post , Egrag reminded followers that “patterns repeat, but you keep ignoring it.” Drawing on XRP’s past behavior around the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB), he highlighted two sharp pullbacks earlier this year and cautioned that another decline could be imminent. “If XRP drops below $1.90 on the 3-day timeframe,” he wrote, “it’s time to sell everything and run for the hills.” #XRP – Today I Want to Be a #Bear : From my post on September 25, 2025, titled “ #XRP – Patterns Repeat, But You Keep Ignoring It!” , let’s take a closer look at how #XRP has reacted on the daily timeframe when interacting with the Bull Market Support (BMSB). Key… https://t.co/hm2HAOIwrJ pic.twitter.com/SZ2F3o6yWh — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 27, 2025 Verifying the Historical Declines Historical data supports much of Egrag’s analysis. Exchange records show that in April 2025 XRP fell roughly 24% from its early-month highs, and in late June it declined about 10% based on daily closing prices—intraday swings approached the 13% drop Egrag cited. Averaged together, these moves amount to an 18–19% pullback, illustrating the coin’s capacity for swift corrections even during a broader uptrend. Potential Downside Targets With XRP trading near $2.78 as of report time, those historical drops provide a framework for possible retracements . A repeat of the April move would imply a price near $2.11, while a decline similar to June’s would bring the token to about $2.42. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The average of the two, around $2.26, sits squarely in the range Egrag highlights as a realistic short-term target if selling pressure accelerates. Implications for Traders Why do these levels matter? For highly leveraged traders, a slide toward the low-$2 range could trigger forced liquidations, compounding downward momentum. Even a modest pullback toward $2.40 could squeeze overextended long positions. Egrag’s $1.90 threshold is particularly significant: a decisive close below that mark on the three-day chart would signal a structural break in XRP’s bullish trend and could prompt a broader market reassessment. A Measured Perspective While Egrag Crypto’s analysis carries a cautionary tone, it does not predict the end of XRP’s long-term prospects. Instead, it serves as a reminder that sharp corrections are common—even in bull markets—and that disciplined risk management is essential. Traders who account for these historical patterns and size their positions accordingly will be better prepared for potential volatility, whether or not the worst-case scenario unfolds.

In 2027, it will range between $0.71 and $0.86, with an average price of $0.73. In 2030, it will range between $2.02 and $2.48, with an average price of $2.08. The parallel stack, a robust, open-source framework designed for crafting rollups and layer 2s that harness parallel processing, is now on SEI V2. The stack enhances Ethereum ’s performance by targeting most bottlenecks that Layer 2 blockchains face. Such developments are anticipated to drive SEI value over the long term. Regarding price performance, SEI shows signs of trading higher; however, it remains affected by the general market sentiment. How high will SEI go? Is SEI a good investment?

SEI’s trading volume dropped by 52.10% over the same period. SEI/USD 1-day chart price analysis SEIUSD chart by TradingView SEI registered negative momentum this week, a move that pushed it below the moving averages. The price tanked in the last 24 hours and now trades below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.3292).

SEI price analysis shows a neutral market with less trading volume, suggesting less trader interest in the coin. Traders are watching the $0.39 resistance. Failure to hold could target $0.26 (swing low). Recent news On September 9, 2025, the SEC acknowledged Canary Capital’s SEI ETF filing ( Dylan Till ), mirroring the Bitcoin ETF approval pattern. While not a guarantee, this procedural step fuels retail optimism. However, SEI’s market analysis suggests thin liquidity could amplify volatility if approval delays occur. Will SEI reach $1? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI will rise above $1 in 2028, when the coin will reach a high of $1.21. Can Sei Coin reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Will SEI reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Does SEI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, SEI will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory Is SEI a good investment? SEI has growing utility, and its EVM compatibility helps it steal a share of Ethereum’s dominance. While the technical analysis is bearish, price predictions paint a different picture.

According to analyst Ali Martinez, wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million DOGE have sold approximately 40 million tokens in the last 24 hours. This large-scale selling contributed to Dogecoin’s sharp correction from its mid-September high near $0.299, bringing the price down to $0.223. Consequently, the token broke below the $0.24 support level, revealing the next critical level around $0.218. Key Support and Resistance Levels Ali Martinez identifies $0.20 as a key support level for Dogecoin. DOGE’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution shows over 12.7 billion DOGE (8.46% of the circulating supply) have accumulated around this price. Maintaining above $0.20 could boost bullish momentum, potentially pushing DOGE toward resistance levels at $0.24 and $0.27. Source: X Conversely, a decisive break below $0.20 may trigger panic selling, pushing prices as low as $0.15. Traders should watch this zone closely, as it may define whether the market consolidates or faces deeper corrections. Trader Tardigrade points to another layer of support with the 150-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently near $0.22. Dogecoin has repeatedly rebounded from this level, showing persistent buying interest despite broader market pullbacks. The 150 EMA acts as a dynamic floor, limiting deeper declines while signaling ongoing accumulation. If daily closes stay above this support, consolidation with a positive bias remains likely. However, a clean break below $0.22 could expose the $0.20 support, testing the market’s resilience further. Positive Catalysts on the Horizon Despite recent selling pressure, Dogecoin’s daily performance shows resilience. Atpress time, DOGE trades at $0.2299 , reflecting a 0.13% increase over 24 hours. Market activity remains robust, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.7 billion. Additionally, momentum could accelerate with upcoming ETF approvals. The 21Shares spot-based DOGE ETF recently listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), signaling broader adoption.

According to analysis by Ted Pillows, after a recent decline from resistance above $113,000, the cryptocurrency is holding within a critical support zone. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows The outlook suggests that $112,000 remains a key level for bulls, as reclaiming it could trigger a fresh uptrend toward $118,000 and potentially retest the $123,000–$124,000 region. On the downside, immediate support lies around $107,000, where failure to hold could confirm the start of a broader correction. A break below this level would expose the next major support cluster near $105,000, extending down to $101,000, signaling a deeper retracement. Notably, Bitcoin’s current price action highlights indecision, with the asset consolidating in a narrow range as traders weigh whether momentum will shift upward or give way to stronger selling pressure. Therefore, a decisive move above $112,000 or below $107,000 is likely to set the tone for the coming weeks, with volatility expected to build as these thresholds are tested. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $109,386, down 0.11% in the past 24 hours and nearly 6% lower on the weekly chart. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) stands at $114,313, signaling short-term weakness and reinforcing the ongoing bearish sentiment. However, the asset remains above the 200-day SMA of $104,142, suggesting the broader trend is intact unless that level is broken. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 37.81 reflects bearish momentum, edging closer to oversold territory. While sellers remain in control, the indicator suggests Bitcoin could soon enter a zone where buyers step in to defend key support levels. For any sustained upward move, the asset must reclaim the $110,000 level.

While ETH’s slowdown is a warning of a cooling market and future consolidation in the making, MUTM’s hyper growth prospect and revolutionary underpinnings place it as a unique candidate for explosive gains. With analysts’ projections of multi-X gains once the next altcoin cycle takes shape, the narrative is fast shifting away from legacy behemoths like Ethereum and to new Mutuum Finance a journey that could prove to be the impetus to the next big crypto wealth creation. Ethereum Under Short-Term Stress as Market Momentum Weakens Ethereum’s recent 3.29% drop to $4,012 reflects shifting market sentiment as bullish momentum weakens. The pullback, primarily caused by profit-taking in close vicinity of major resistance levels, suggests ETH is likely to test its consolidation phase before its next big price action. Technical indicators are in favor of this perspective, weakening momentum oscillators and declining trading volumes signal a potential probe of lower support levels in the immediate term. While today’s pressure is certainly onerous, this correction might provide strategic points of entry into markets, capital typically flows out of large-cap positions like Ethereum into emergent, higher-upside alternatives during cooling market times. Mutuum Finance Presale and Ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Stage 6 of presale, and tokens are available to buy at $0.035. The project has already reached more than 16,600 investors and more than $16.38 million of committed capital. These are only the level of market demand MUTM enjoys and global hype of going live. Mutuum Finance protocol will hedge liquidity and volatility in real time. It shorts illiquid positions opportunistically without shorting too little on liquidation levels. Risk sizes are also hedged into stablecoins and ETH positions, and LTV ratios are collateralized with less volatile collateral. A reserve factor, proportionally allocated by asset classes, is also helping protocol security and reserve management optimization. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to collateralize, lend, exchange, and settle USD-denominated token and asset like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform makes use of fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages. Highly precise price information is provided by multi-layered infrastructure in high-pressure market situations. Early Adopter Rewards to the Community As a token of appreciation to its investors, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $100,000 giveaway plan. Ten individuals will be awarded $10,000 each in the form of MUTM tokens. Market volatility is one of the things that must be managed in Mutuum Finance’s collateral management system. Stability of assets is used in the calculation of LTV ratios and points of liquidation, risk classes being split into high and low classes. Reserve multipliers are hence used, beginning at 10% for risk-free assets up to 35% for risk tokens. Buffer room for protection is given without jeopardizing diversification in the portfolio. Mutuum Finance is working on an active capital-backed, passive borrowing and lending protocol. It will facilitate lending against securitised collateral and be backed by two simple mechanisms: a stability algorithm and an interest rate optimisation algorithm. They will create efficiency, resiliency, and long-term sustainable use of capital in the network as a whole. Undervalued Presale Gaining Steam as ETH Loses Steam Ethereum’s latest plunge to $4,012 shows the fickleness of major cryptos, but it’s also opening up a chance for investors to consider high-upside substitutes like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Already in Stage 6 of its presale with over $16.38 million raised from over 16,600 investors, MUTM is gaining strong momentum at a compelling entry point of just $0.035. Its innovative DeFi design, real-time liquidity hedging, and robust oracle-based foundation position it as a serious coin for the next cycle of market expansion. With experts sizing up massive multi-X potential once altcoin rotation gains traction, now is the moment to secure MUTM tokens before the presale runs out and prices rise.

52347801,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=821460,1758994365,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52347801.jpeg,Galaxy Digital's Mike Novogratz sees BTC at $200K if Trump appoints a loyalist Fed chair,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mike-novogratz-trump-fed-dove-bitcoin-200k/,"Mike Novogratz is predicting that Bitcoin could blow past $200,000 if Donald Trump goes through with his plan to replace Jerome Powell with a “massive dove” at the U.S. Federal Reserve. Speaking in an interview with Kyle Chasse uploaded to YouTube on Friday, Mike, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, said this single decision might be the biggest trigger for crypto in years. “That’s the potential biggest bull catalyst for Bitcoin and the rest of crypto,” he said. Mike made it clear that if the Fed starts slashing when it has no business doing so, the result won’t just be another rally. It’ll be what he called a “ blow-off top ” for Bitcoin. He said, “Can Bitcoin get to $200K? Of course it could… Because it becomes a whole new conversation if that happens.” But this isn’t something Mike’s rooting for. “Do I want it to happen? No. Why? Because I kind of love America,” he said. Mike warns Trump pick could destroy Fed independence Mike also said the whole setup could be “really shitty for America.” He’s not talking theory. He said outright that putting a dovish loyalist in charge might kill the Fed’s independence. That, he warned, could push investors into full panic mode. “Gold skyrockets… Bitcoin skyrockets,” he said . The change wouldn’t just hit traditional finance, it would slam the dollar too. That’s because when the Fed softens, the dollar usually weakens. And when that happens, crypto looks a lot more attractive. The idea that Trump will pick someone soft is already priced in a little, according to Mike. But not completely. “It was priced in that he was going to pick somebody dovey, but no one is quite sure,” he said. He believes markets won’t fully react until the decision is made official. “I don’t think the market will buy that Trump’s going to do the crazy, until he does the crazy.” Cryptopolitan reported that Trump told people at the Oval on September 6 that he has narrowed down the Fed chair shortlist to three names: Kevin Hassett, Christopher Waller, and Kevin Warsh. “You could say those are the top three,” Trump said. Waller, who currently sits on the Fed’s Board of Governors, had already pushed for a rate cut as early as July. That’s two months before the Fed delivered a 25 basis point cut, its first since last year. Fed cuts rates as stocks climb and Bitcoin eyes the chaos The markets saw the cut coming. But what’s worrying people like Mike is what happens if it becomes a trend. Meanwhile, stocks are racing. The S&P 500 is up more than 12% since January. The rise, despite spring volatility, has many questioning if prices have gone too far. In Rhode Island on Tuesday, Powell was asked how market levels affect Fed policy. “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said . He added that “by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” That was enough to push stocks slightly lower. But Mike isn’t focused on tiny dips. He’s watching the big picture. If Trump puts someone dovish in the driver’s seat, and that person cuts rates when they shouldn’t, crypto investors could see a massive upside — but it’ll come at a cost. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, also weighed in on how hot the markets are. “Probably the oldest tenet in investing is ‘buy low, sell high,’” he said. Right now, most pros are watching the price-to-earnings ratio. The S&P 500 is trading at a 41% premium compared to its 20-year average. That stat alone has analysts asking how long this can last.

He recounted the steep decline from $0.30 to $0.11, a time when many investors exited the market. Rather than step back, he explained that he consistently accumulated XRP while it was priced below $0.15. His post highlights how some traders view market downturns not as setbacks but as buying opportunities. I love watching the charts during capitulation. I remember watching when #XRP dropped from $0.30 to $0.11 and I kept hitting the buy button below $0.15. — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 25, 2025 Community Responses to the Reflection Several users on X shared their perspectives in response to CryptoBull’s remarks. One user, known as Gladiator, noted that panic selling often dominates times of steep price action. However, the ability to take a broader perspective can help investors see potential opportunities. Gladiator suggested that moments of capitulation can provide entry points that are easily overlooked when fear drives decision-making. Another user, MightyMike, added that while he was not active during that particular market downturn, missing that opportunity may not ultimately matter if XRP were to reach prices significantly higher in the future. His comment referenced the long-term optimism that many holders continue to express about XRP’s potential value appreciation. A different account stated that they had accumulated the majority of their XRP holdings during the same market decline mentioned by CryptoBull. According to this user, that decision ultimately allowed them to retire by February 2025. This comment highlights the significance of financial outcomes some individuals report from early and well-timed market entries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Significance of Past Market Moves CryptoBull’s post and the responses that followed underscore the lasting impact of historic price movements within the cryptocurrency market. For many traders, the XRP drop to $0.11 remains a key reference point, both as a warning about volatility and as an example of the opportunities that volatility can create. The discussion surrounding CryptoBull’s reflection suggests that many XRP holders continue to see parallels between past downturns and current or future market conditions. As prices fluctuate, investors often look to history for lessons about timing and decision-making. While no outcome is guaranteed, reflections like these serve as reminders of how quickly circumstances in digital asset markets can change, and how individual strategies during pivotal moments may shape financial outcomes years later.

Just as crypto projects seek to disrupt traditional finance, AI ventures are pushing boundaries in personal tech and public perception. The recent audacious marketing blitz by AI startup Friend in the heart of New York City serves as a powerful case study, demonstrating the immense capital and daring strategies companies are willing to deploy to capture attention in the burgeoning wearable AI device market. The Audacious AI Advertising Campaign That Cost a Fortune Imagine stepping onto a New York City subway car and being enveloped by a single, stark message: ‘Friend.’ This is precisely what AI startup Friend achieved, investing over $1 million in what CEO Avi Schiffman described as ‘the world’s first major AI campaign.’ The sheer scale of this marketing push is remarkable, encompassing more than 11,000 cards on subway cars, 1,000 platform posters, and 130 urban panels. Some key stations, like West 4th Street, became a canvas entirely dominated by these minimalist ads. Schiffman openly called it a ‘huge gamble,’ admitting, ‘I don’t have much money left.’ While other AI-related advertisements have existed, a print campaign of this magnitude is unprecedented. It raises questions for investors and entrepreneurs alike: What drives such a massive, concentrated investment in traditional advertising for a cutting-edge tech product? Is this a visionary move, or a desperate bet? Unpacking the ‘Friend’ Wearable AI Device and Its Vision At the center of this controversy is Friend’s $129 wearable AI device . While the core functionality isn’t detailed in the ad campaign itself, its nature as a ‘wearable AI’ suggests constant interaction and data collection. This is where the narrative shifts from marketing spectacle to ethical debate. Wired writers, for example, have voiced strong criticism, specifically targeting its ‘constant surveillance’ and famously declaring, ‘I Hate My Friend.’ For a product designed to be a companion, such a strong negative reaction from tech reviewers is a significant hurdle. The concept of a device that is always on, always listening, or always observing, touches a raw nerve in an era increasingly concerned with data privacy and digital autonomy. This sentiment resonates strongly with the crypto community, which often champions decentralization and user control precisely to counter such centralized surveillance risks. Public Backlash and the Shadow of Surveillance Capitalism The public reaction to Friend’s AI advertising campaign in New York City was swift and, in many cases, hostile. Some ads were vandalized with pointed messages, labeling the device as ‘surveillance capitalism’ and urging onlookers to ‘get real friends.’ This public commentary highlights a deep-seated skepticism towards AI, particularly in a city known for its discerning and often critical populace. CEO Avi Schiffman acknowledged this sentiment, stating his awareness that ‘people in New York hate AI … probably more than anywhere else in the country.’ His response to this anticipated backlash was part of the strategy: he deliberately chose ads with ample white space, ‘so that they would socially comment on the topic.’ This approach turns potential vandalism into a form of interactive public discourse, albeit one that is largely negative. The term ‘surveillance capitalism’ itself carries significant weight, implying that personal data is being commodified and exploited, a fear that many privacy-conscious individuals, especially those invested in the principles of Web3, actively seek to mitigate. Lessons from Friend’s NYC Subway Ads Strategy The decision to launch such an aggressive campaign through NYC subway ads , despite knowing the city’s anti-AI sentiment, is a calculated risk. It’s a testament to the belief that even negative attention is attention, and that sparking a conversation, however controversial, is better than being ignored. Here are some takeaways: High Stakes, High Reward: The ‘huge gamble’ illustrates the competitive nature of the AI market, where companies are willing to bet big on visibility. Embracing Controversy: Friend’s strategy of inviting ‘social comment’ suggests a willingness to engage with criticism head-on, or at least to leverage it for broader awareness. Targeted Demographics: Despite the backlash, NYC remains a global hub for innovation, media, and early adopters, making it a crucial battleground for public opinion. Public Perception Matters: The vandalism and strong criticism underscore the importance of understanding and addressing public concerns about privacy and technology, especially for products with surveillance implications. This campaign serves as a stark reminder that technology, no matter how advanced, must navigate the complex terrain of public trust and ethical considerations. What’s Next for AI Startup Friend? The future for AI startup Friend remains uncertain. Will this controversial marketing blitz translate into widespread adoption, or will the ‘surveillance capitalism’ label stick, hindering its growth? The bold strategy has certainly put Friend on the map, but the challenge now is to convert that awareness into positive sentiment and sales, especially for a product that has already faced significant privacy critiques. For the broader tech industry, including the cryptocurrency space, Friend’s story offers valuable lessons in public relations and ethical product development. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, understanding and addressing user concerns about data, privacy, and autonomy will be paramount. The battle for public perception is just as important as the technological innovation itself. Friend’s subway ad campaign is a powerful example of the lengths to which AI companies will go to capture market share and public imagination. It highlights the inherent tension between technological advancement and societal concerns about privacy and control. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, the public discourse around devices like Friend will undoubtedly shape the future of how we interact with artificial intelligence.

The three governments triggered the “ snapback ” clause of the 2015 nuclear deal last month, giving Tehran 30 days to comply. That deadline expires Saturday night, according to the Financial Times. The E3 powers wanted Tehran to restart talks with Washington, resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and account for a 408-kilogram uranium stockpile enriched close to weapons grade. Russia and China attempted to extend the timeframe by sponsoring a UN Security Council resolution on Friday, but only four of the body’s 15 members voted in favor. With no extension agreed, the sanctions return automatically. Iran refuses US talks and challenges Western demands Despite a week of UN meetings in New York, European and Iranian officials left without progress. The E3 said Iran would not allow international inspectors into its main nuclear sites. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed negotiations with the United States, saying they would show “surrender” and “disgrace.” Iranian leaders placed blame on Washington and European capitals. President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tehran would respond to sanctions but would not leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty, despite pressure from hardliners. “Certain people inside the country think that we certainly should leave the NPT . . . but the supreme leadership held steadfast . . . and that’s our official policy,” Pezeshkian said in New York. “But if they implement the snapback mechanism and subsequent mechanisms, then we need to know how to respond.” Officials in Tehran added that they may again halt cooperation with the IAEA and stop talking with the E3 altogether. The snapback process is part of the 2015 nuclear agreement signed by Iran, the E3, the Obama administration, Russia and China. That accord has been near collapse since Donald Trump, now back in the White House, withdrew during his first term and reimposed waves of sanctions. Attacks, uranium enrichment and mistrust deepen standoff Following Washington’s withdrawal, Tehran expanded its nuclear program and enriched uranium to 60%, close to weapons grade. European powers remained in the deal but were accused of failing to provide sanctions relief. Meanwhile, US measures cut Iran off from global finance and worsened its economic crisis. Indirect talks between Trump’s administration and Iran were scheduled for a sixth round earlier this year, but they collapsed when Israel launched a 12-day war in June. Those strikes, joined briefly by the US, destroyed several nuclear sites just 48 hours before negotiations were due to start. Trump later said Iran’s nuclear program had been “obliterated.” Western diplomats countered that the sites were damaged but not destroyed, but they did admit to uncertainty over the fate of the 408 kilograms of enriched uranium. After the strikes, Tehran suspended cooperation with the IAEA. A preliminary deal was reached this month with the UN watchdog on a “new modality” of inspections, but European diplomats said it was inadequate because it excluded access to the main facilities. Pezeshkian admitted the mistrust was severe. “The wall of mistrust that has been created between us and the Americans is quite thick and quite high,” he said. “Every step that we take forward, they [US] take two steps back and add more conditions. First show us your sincerity and your good will and we will take two steps towards you.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Economy|EUR|IRR|UN|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|ASIA|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-27 17:51:19

While XRP’s fundamentals, regulatory clarity, enterprise adoption, and network volume remain strong, Remittix (RTX) is gaining media and capital attention rapidly. It is Remittix’s price trajectory that has many expecting a 50x move in Q4, making this rivalry between legacy and utility tokens especially sharp. XRP: balancing strengths and cracks XRP is trading at $2.74, which is close but below resistance zones at around $3.00 and $3.20 that XRP has failed to breach multiple times. Analysts warn that falling under $2.80 could accelerate losses further. Still, some chart watchers argue XRP may surprise in October, citing a falling wedge setup and structural support near $2.85. Remittix: the 50x Q4 challenger Remittix poses a different challenge to XRP. While XRP is mature and well known, Remittix is smaller, more agile, and built for payments adoption. XRP must lean on institutional flows and ecosystem upgrades; Remittix leans on product, incentives, and adoption velocity. In a scenario where capital rotates to high growth but higher risk plays, Remittix could surge 50x and significantly outpace XRP’s gains. Having cleared funding thresholds above $20M and $22M, Remittix has secured two CEX listings (BitMart and LBANK) and is preparing for a third. Remittix has sold over 672 million tokens, is priced at $0.113, and has raised over $26.7 million. Remittix is now verified by CertiK, and Remittix is ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch Tokens. Its wallet beta is live now, with users testing core functionality. Remittix runs a 15% USDT referral program with rewards claimable every 24 hours. It also launched a $250,000 giveaway to attract early users. Here are five core drivers making Remittix a credible 50x candidate: Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Ranked number one among pre-launch tokens Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd These factors do more than make Remittix interesting; they may create the conditions for outsized gains. With functional infrastructure, adoption incentives, and capital backing, Remittix can move on signals, not just momentum. XRP vs Remittix: relevance or resurgence? XRP’s price prediction still has room to run if it can stabilize above key support and overcome resistance zones. But Remittix is forcing a different question, one of potential vs legacy. While XRP battles structural and technical pressure, Remittix’s setup, metrics, and roadmap set it up to be the 50x candidate in Q4.

Here Is a Key Level to Watch for Next Move",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/27/bitcoin-trails-equities-metals-and-usd-in-q3-here-is-a-key-level-to-watch-for-next-move,"Bitcoin (BTC) just ended what is historically the largest cryptocurrency's third-worst week of the year with a greater-than-average drop of 5%. Week 38 effectively closes out the third quarter, which is up about 1%, as well as September, which has managed to hold flat. While the figures are consistent with the period's historical reputation as one of the weakest seasons of the year, a few catalysts might have contributed to the underperformance. On Friday, more than $17 billion in options expired , with the max pain price — the strike price at which option holders lose the most money and options writers profit the most — sitting at $110,000, which acted as a gravitational center for the spot price. A key technical factor remains the short-term holder cost basis at $110,775, which reflects the average on-chain acquisition price for coins that moved in the past six months. Bitcoin tested this level in August, and in bull markets, it typically moves toward this line multiple times. This year, it broke significantly below that level only once: during the tariff tantrum in April, when it dropped to as low as $74,500. Zooming out, it is important to assess whether bitcoin remains in an uptrend characterized by higher highs and higher lows to get an idea of whether the rally is sustainable. Analyst Caleb Franzen highlights that bitcoin has slipped below its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), with the 200-day EMA sitting at $106,186. The previous significant low was around $107,252 on Sept. 1, and for the broader trend to remain intact, bitcoin will need to hold above that level., Macro Backdrop The U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.8% in the second quarter, well above the 3.3% estimate and the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2023. Initial jobless claims dropped by 14,000 to 218,000, coming in below expectations and marking the lowest level since mid-July. While spending data came in line with the market's expectation. The US core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation that excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% in August 2025 from the prior month. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries bounced off the 4% support, and is now trading near 4.2%. The dollar index (DXY) continues to hover around long-term support at 98. Meanwhile, metals are leading the action, with silver at around $45 approaching an all-time high at levels last seen in 1980 and 2011. U.S. equities, in the meantime, are just shy of their records. Bitcoin remains the outlier at more than 10% below its peak. Bitcoin-Exposed Equities Bitcoin treasury companies continue to face severe multiple-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) compression. Strategy (MSTR) is barely positive year-to-date. At one point, it dipped below $300, a negative return for 2025. The ratio between Strategy and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) stands at 4.8, the lowest since October 2024, which shows just how much the largest bitcoin treasury company has underperformed bitcoin over the past 12 months. Strategy’s enterprise mNAV is currently 1.44 (as of Friday). Enterprise value here accounts for all basic shares outstanding, total notional debt and total notional value of perpetual preferred stock minus the company’s cash balance. The silver lining for MSTR is that three of the four perpetual preferred stocks, STRK, STRC and STRF, are all sporting positive lifetime returns as Executive Chairman Michael Saylor looks to buy more BTC through these vehicles. A growing issue for MSTR is the lack of volatility in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's Implied volatility — a measure of the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations — has dropped below 40, the lowest in years. This matters because Saylor has often framed MSTR as a volatility play on bitcoin. For comparison, MSTR’s implied volatility is at 68. Its annualized standard deviation of daily log returns over the past year was 89%, while over the last 30 days it has fallen to 49%. For equities, higher volatility often attracts speculators, generates trading opportunities and draws investor attention, so the decline is likely acting as a headwind. Meantime, the fifth-largest bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet (3350), holds 25,555 BTC and still has roughly $500 million left to deploy from its international offering. Despite this, its share price continues to struggle at 517 yen ($3.45), more than 70% below its all-time high. Metaplanet’s mNAV has dropped to 1.12, down sharply from 8.44 in June. Its market capitalization now stands at $3.94 billion compared to a bitcoin NAV of $2.9 billion, with an average BTC acquisition cost of $106,065.",Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|MetaPlanet|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-27 18:00:17

Buy the dips! — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 26, 2025 But his latest salvo comes with more weight than a casual tweet — it arrives against the backdrop of increased involvement of the Trump family in cryptocurrency with institutional moves that have also drawn scrutiny. A regular critic is Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who often questions the influence of the president’s cabinet and associates on market dealings. Eric Trump maintains optimism with call to buy Trump’s post follows a pattern that is starting to feel familiar. In February, he made an exact post stating, “₿uy the dips!!!” with the first word having the popular symbol of Bitcoin. His return to that stance shows how bullish he is about a market that has taken a bearish position over the week, as major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are testing key support zones. Depending on the trajectory, his message could resonate among retail traders watching for value entries. But market watchers are already debating whether such calls bounce or backfire, with some also pointing out that his position as the son of the President of the United States may affect the market and sentiments. Trump’s crypto footprint Behind the short post lies a deeper, more complex involvement in the crypto space. Eric and his brother Donald Jr. backed American Bitcoin , a mining and accumulation firm launched in collaboration with Hut 8. American Bitcoin recently had its debut on Nasdaq, and the Trump brothers’ stake in the company rose to about $1.5 billion after shares surged in early trading. American Bitcoin holds substantial mining operations and maintains a strategic Bitcoin reserve. So, Eric’s frequent dip calls thus carry both rhetorical and vested undertones. Beyond American Bitcoin, he also holds advisory influence in Metaplanet , a Japanese Bitcoin treasury company planning a capital raise tied to further BTC accumulation. Trump reportedly attended Metaplanet’s shareholders meeting in Tokyo in August. Markets react to Eric’s call to action Reactions to Trump’s post were immediate but mixed, with some retail traders echoing the call and viewing it as a buy signal. At the same time, analysts responded with caution, noting that public figure endorsements in crypto often portend short-term volatility. Others have approached it with memes reminiscent of previous market crashes. After Trump urged increased exposure to Ethereum amid a dip in February, ETH still suffered a 40% decline in subsequent months. However, as the months proceeded, Ethereum experienced a major rally and briefly outperformed Bitcoin.

A popular commentator on X, known as XRP Avengers, argues that the vast majority of holders will cash out as soon as the token reaches double-digit prices. While the claim sounds provocative, it highlights a critical question for serious investors: what would it actually take for XRP to trade anywhere near $100, and who would truly hold on if it did? Market Reality of a $100 XRP XRP’s circulating supply stands at roughly 59.8 billion tokens. At $100 per token, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization would exceed $5.9 trillion—a figure larger than the combined value of the entire crypto market today, which sits near $3.9 trillion. Achieving such a valuation would require extraordinary global adoption, massive liquidity, and a level of institutional demand far beyond anything the market has yet witnessed. This perspective places XRP Avengers’ prediction in context: holding for a $100 target is not just about patience; it would require a structural shift in global finance. 98% of the people will sell their #XRP after $10-$50. I am here to see the price above $100. Who will stay with me? — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) September 26, 2025 Ripple’s Escrow and Supply Dynamics Ripple, the company closely associated with the XRP Ledger, continues to manage large escrowed XRP holdings. These escrows release scheduled amounts each month, and Ripple publishes quarterly reports detailing how much is distributed or re-locked. Any path toward extreme price appreciation must factor in these controlled releases, as they influence circulating supply and market liquidity. Escrow management, therefore, remains a key variable in XRP’s long-term valuation. Exchange Reserves and Investor Behavior On-chain analytics consistently show that exchange balances play an outsized role in price action. Significant withdrawals to private wallets can tighten supply and help support price increases, while large inflows often signal imminent selling pressure. Recent data indicate fluctuating XRP reserves across major exchanges, underscoring how quickly sentiment—and thus liquidity—can change when prices climb. Retail psychology also matters. Historically, many traders take profits once their investments deliver substantial gains. That pattern supports XRP Avengers’ contention that a vast majority could exit the market once XRP trades between $10 and $50 , especially after years of sideways movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Demand and Market Infrastructure A different group of stakeholders— institutional investors, payment providers, and enterprises using XRP for cross-border settlement— is less likely to sell based on price alone. Expanding futures markets, institutional custody services, and new financial products are gradually strengthening XRP’s market infrastructure. If adoption accelerates and more XRP is locked in payment channels or staking-like products, supply pressure could diminish, providing the foundation for higher valuations over time. Who Will Truly Stay the Course? The statement from XRP Avengers that “98% of investors will sell after $10–$50” is ultimately a challenge to the community. While the exact percentage is impossible to verify, history shows that profit-taking is inevitable when early holders see life-changing returns. Yet a committed minority—those focused on utility, enterprise use cases, or strategic long-term positioning—may indeed hold beyond the first major price milestones. Whether XRP ever approaches $100 is uncertain, but the debate forces investors to confront their own strategies. Understanding market math, monitoring escrow releases, and tracking exchange reserves are far more important than any single headline. In the end, only those with both conviction and a clear grasp of the fundamentals will have the resolve to stay when the price climbs into uncharted territory.

That was the clear message from Olaf Sleijpen, the Dutch central bank governor, in an interview published by Het Financieele Dagblad . Olaf made it known that the Transmission Protection Instrument, a tool designed by the ECB to control severe market disruptions, won’t be used to rescue countries that can’t manage their budgets. “The instrument exists — it can be used temporarily under certain conditions, but it’s absolutely not intended for certain things,” he said. “So, I think the idea that the ECB will solve it is a bit too simplistic. Some things really should be resolved by politicians themselves.” Olaf, who took over in July after Klaas Knot stepped down, said he wasn’t interested in being called a hawk or a dove. “Price stability is what I’m paid for,” he said. He pointed out that the ECB has one job—keep inflation under control . “The ECB simply has a very clear mandate, and that is price stability. That’s the most important thing for me. I will commit myself to a monetary policy that aligns with that.” When asked if the ECB’s deposit rate would stay at 2%, Olaf didn’t give a yes or no. “There’s a great deal of uncertainty,” he said. He explained that inflation could drop faster than expected if the economy weakens or if the euro gains strength against the dollar. But higher energy prices are also pushing prices up again. “Furthermore, we don’t yet know to what extent US import tariffs will affect the inflation rate in the long term.” Olaf questions government tax plans and spending habits Olaf didn’t stop at monetary policy . He aimed straight at Dutch politicians, making big campaign promises ahead of the October 29 election. “A whopping €85 billion ($99.5 billion) in tax incentives in the Netherlands has proven ineffective,” he said . He argued that some of that money should be used for actual investments that grow the economy. “A clear and transparent government policy is also crucial for businesses. That costs nothing.” He also questioned the push to exempt public investments from spending rules. “Even for those investments, a euro is a euro that ultimately has to be repaid,” he said. He warned that calling everything an investment doesn’t make it smart spending. “And who decides what the investments are? We’re familiar with those discussions from the past. Soon, everything will be an investment.” When asked about using past tools like quantitative easing again, Olaf was cautious. He said the last round of bond buying came with real costs. “The price tag for the ECB’s quantitative-easing program was high when you consider the profits of central banks and the consequences of low interest rates for financial stability,” he said. And if the main policy rate drops back to zero again, Olaf warned that any similar decision would need to be thought through much more carefully. He made it clear that experience has shown these tools are not to be thrown around lightly. Inflation readings pile more pressure on ECB rate decisions This week’s inflation numbers won’t make the ECB’s next move any easier. Analysts expect consumer prices across the euro zone to jump 2.2% year-over-year in September. That’s a rise from 2% in August and would be the highest reading in five months. Bloomberg surveyed 35 economists, and most agreed that the increase is mainly due to energy and travel prices. It’s the last inflation update the ECB will see before its October 30 decision. That reading will come after national inflation data from the euro zone’s four biggest economies. Spain goes first on Monday, with price growth expected to reach 3%, up from 2.7% in August. France’s number is due on Tuesday, forecast to rise to 1.3%. Italy’s inflation rate is expected at 1.8%, and Germany’s at 2.2%. This puts Olaf and the rest of the ECB’s Governing Council in a tight spot. With inflation creeping above their 2% target, no one in Frankfurt wants to be the one who cuts rates too early and loses control.

Consumer spending in August beat forecasts and incomes rose, even as many expected the country to already be near recession. Households and companies kept buying big items. Inflation was muted. Housing surprised with new home sales hitting a three-year high. In earlier years, this kind of momentum came from stimulus checks, low rates, and liquidity from the Federal Reserve. Today, it comes from Wall Street and the wealth effect of record-breaking indexes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said Friday: “I do think that goes to the bounce in the stock market and the wealth effect. I think all of the spending is coming from the well-to-do high-income high-net-worth households that are seeing their stock portfolios are up and they’re feeling a lot better off and they’re spending.” The rally has been steady all year. Artificial intelligence investment pushed demand, and industrial and communications giants added strength. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 9%. The Nasdaq Composite is up 23%. Consumers often feel better when stocks rise and unemployment is low. Yet sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan is down 23% since January, when President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Consumer mood divides as market climbs In September, the Michigan gauge fell another 5.3%. Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, explained, “Sentiment for consumers with larger stock holdings held steady in September, while for those with smaller or no holdings, sentiment decreased.” The market has hit repeated records this month. Data from the St. Louis Fed show the top 10% of earners hold 87% of the entire market. Those investors are secure, but it shows the risks. Zandi added: “The economy’s very vulnerable if the stock market does turn south, for whatever reason. People start seeing red on their screens and not green on their screens and the savings rate goes up not down. In the current context of no job growth, that’s recession.” Valuation worries loom. FactSet reported the S&P 500 trades at 22.5 times expected earnings for the next year. That is above the five-year average of 19.9 and the 10-year average of 18.6. Despite that, consumer spending in August rose 0.6%, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. Adjusted for inflation, spending increased 0.4%. Inflation still runs above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Core inflation is stuck at 2.9%. But monthly numbers match earlier forecasts, leaving the Fed on track for an October cut and maybe another in December. Growth speeds up while risks stay close Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, a revision that was half a point higher than before. The Atlanta Fed raised its estimate for the third quarter to 3.9%, 0.6 point more than last week. Durable goods orders surged. New home sales jumped 20%. A spike in jobless claims earlier this month was only temporary. Layoffs stayed low, though payroll growth is flat. This suggests stability, but it is still driven mostly by wealthy consumers. Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said , “Often, when people feel pessimistic about the near-future economy, they begin reigning in spending, but that hasn’t been the case thus far. In fact, the strength of the consumer is credited with keeping the economy strong for the past handful of years, despite high inflation, high [interest] rates and great uncertainty.” She warned that the economy sits on a knife’s edge. Large groups of people are not sharing in the stock boom, and overall sentiment is at levels tied to past recessions. “Wealth provides some insulation from perceived economic volatility, and investors have been largely doing OK,” Renter said. She added that, “Consumers are attuned to the current economic risks, inflation and labor market weakness. This could be due to first-hand experiences food prices rose significantly last month, or because they’re on edge from headlines tracking key economic data. In any case, people aren’t feeling great about the economy, their place within it or where it’s all headed.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

In his tweet, Martinez stated that XRP must hold the $2.7 support level to keep the chance of a rebound to $3.2 alive. The emphasis on this level comes at a time when price action interacted with the same support zone over the past several weeks. The chart illustrates how XRP has returned multiple times to the $2.7 area, with the most recent dips happening on September 1 and 22. $XRP must hold $2.70 support to keep the chance of a rebound to $3.20 alive! pic.twitter.com/RZGL4DtJV9 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 26, 2025 Price Behavior and Technical Structure The 12-hour candlestick chart shows that XRP has tested the $2.70 level on at least four different occasions since mid-July. Each time, the token rebounded toward higher resistance levels, confirming the importance of this zone for maintaining bullish momentum. The first rebound in July sent XRP to its all-time high of $3.65 . While it has failed to reclaim similar levels, Martinez’s analysis suggests that another notable rebound could happen if it holds $2.70. At the time of Martinez’s analysis, the price sat near $2.75, only slightly above the highlighted support. The clustering of candlesticks, long wicks around this level, and recent reports of low volatility indicate attempts by buyers to absorb downward pressure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The chart outlines a significant resistance level near $3.2, which has acted as a ceiling on several occasions. In August and September, XRP tested this region but failed to sustain a breakout. The structure suggests a defined range between $2.7 and $3.2, and Martinez’s analysis reflects the importance of holding the lower boundary to keep the possibility of retesting the upper boundary intact. Projected Path Forward Martinez’s chart also provides a projected path that illustrates a potential recovery scenario. The path begins with XRP stabilizing above $2.70, followed by a gradual upward move through $2.82 and $2.94 before approaching $3.10. From there, the projection points to a possible continuation toward $3.2, where resistance could again come into play. If the asset can surpass this level, it could experience a bigger breakout. Analysts are already spotting major breakout signals , and it’s only a matter of time before XRP makes a decisive move.

The network is also experiencing a surge in developer activity and infrastructure improvements, which analysts believe could position it to compete with networks like Base and Solana. Strong Token Inflows And Increased Activity Blockchain analytics platform Nansen shared via X that investors have been making “smart money” moves on BNB Chain in the last day. The ecosystem has recorded notable inflows over the period, with several tokens showing positive movement despite some volatility. STBL led the gains with a 33% increase, attracting $602,000 in new capital, while $BTCB remained steady but added $41,000. WOD continued to trade in the red, yet still drew $22,000. On the other hand, TRAD00R registered a 12% gain with $120,000 in inflows, while PROVE saw a more modest flow of $7,700. Analysts say that these token movements show a growing belief among traders that the BNB Chain is capable of competing with players like Base and Solana. Elsewhere, statistics indicate that the network is actually running at under 30% of its capacity, which means that there remains unused potential for transaction throughput growth. The network has also experienced an influx in developer activity, with new dApps, connectors, and AI-powered platforms being deployed across the ecosystem. Infrastructure improvements like Parallel EVM, gasless stablecoin transactions, and MEV protection have helped the platform become more efficient at processing higher volumes of transactions without losing performance. The current architecture is projected to handle three times more state data while enabling faster block times. Validators have also proposed reducing gas fees from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, which would lower transaction costs to around $0.005 and rank BNB Chain among the most affordable networks in the industry. Similar measures have proven effective before, with the April 2024 fee cut driving a 75% decline in median costs and a 140% increase in daily transactions. BNB Price Outlook Binance Coin (BNB) recently crossed the $1,000 mark, peaking at $1,079 before stabilizing around $1,025. This milestone coincides with a $2.37 billion surge in open interest on BNB futures, which shows greater investor activity. Meanwhile, RSI hovers between 74 and 81, while the MACD line remains above the signal line, showing strong bullish momentum. However, there are also early signs of divergence suggesting the rally may be entering a more fragile phase. CZ is already forecasting stellar long-term returns for BNB, but analysts advise that user and developer growth, and consistent smart capital inflows, are more vital for the project’s survival in the near future.

Because of its dual-lending capability, a groundbreaking innovation enabling users to borrow and lend simultaneously from via 2 mechanisms, Mutuum Finance is boosting capital efficiency and attracting serious institutional interest. This technology, coupled with lightning-fast transactions, boundless liquidity, and solid cross-chain functionality, has driven bold projections that Mutuum Finance could rocket from $0.035 to up to $5 in the next market cycle. Already touted as “Solana 2.0”, Mutuum’s tech and tokenomics could be the building blocks for one of the most dramatic growth stories in crypto. Solana Sees $320 Breakout as Bulls Hold Key $210 Support As Mutuum Finance is garnering attention with its twin-lending concept, Solana (SOL) is still exhibiting enormous strength on the technical front. The altcoin has been in an ever-prevailing bullish trend since the month of April, fighting past the critical $210 resistance, which has now turned into a solid support level. Analysts like Ali believe that this price action is a sign of the big rally that is in store, and $320 is the next key resistance level. The Fibonacci retracement levels of $0.618 and $0.786 are a sign of a bullish consolidation period, and rising trading volume is an indicator of growing market confidence. Although the MACD now signifies moderate bearish momentum, declining histogram bars and potential crossovers suggest a reversal in sight. Mutuum Finance Presale Success Mutuum Finance has reached presale stage 6 where it is 50% sold out with the token up for sale at $0.035. The campaign has moved quite fast and investors have already raised more than $16.4 million. The project seeks to develop a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain to stabilize long-term value and enjoy payback hassle-free. Mutuum Finance has designed a lender-friendly and borrower-friendly DeFi. It can support P2C and P2P types of lending. It is manipulation proof as well as scalable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well-regulated with risk and security-conscious at all levels. The protocol is cautious of under-collateralized and over-lending over-collateralization liquidation. Mutuum Finance does this through cascading Loan-to-Value ratios, liquidity, liquidation charges, and reserve factors hedging and insurance of platform liquidity across states. Variable interest lending is one of the applications available in the market: surplus funds will start lending at subnormal interest and deficit in liquidity will provide extra to enable repayment of the loan and fresh deposits. It implies that lenders can borrow fixed rate borrowing in lending and at desired rate against the variable one and for very liquid collateral only. Buying tokens, exchange listing, and staking are set to boost Mutuum Finance’s long-term growth. It is currently running a running $100,000 giveaway and will reward 10 members each with a $10,000 MUTM reward. To ensure that it has a secure environment on the platform, Mutuum Finance has collaborated with CertiK to bring in an official bug bounty program with a minimum assured award pool size of $50,000. There will be four grading levels rewarded to find vulnerabilities: critical, major, minor, and low. This will ensure end-to-end security and safeguarding. How MUTM Could Rewrite the Next Chapter of DeFi Growth Analysts labeling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as “Solana 2.0” indicates just how quickly the project is building momentum. Already in Stage 6 with 50% of tokens sold, over $16.4 million raised, and a price of just $0.035, MUTM’s innovative dual-lending approach and strong fundamentals can lay the foundation for a breakout to $5 in 2025. With growing institutional support and significant milestones ahead, the time to get on board with MUTM is before the presale ends and potential gains multiply.

This time, Wynn is making a leveraged play on ASTER just days after being liquidated on the same token. Wynn has opened a new 3x leveraged long on ASTER, the native token of the emerging Aster perpetuals exchange, worth over $16,000, entering at $1.97 with a liquidation level around $1.57.The move was first spotted by Onchain Lens . While the dollar amount seems small compared to Wynn's previous positions, the trade is likely to be a hedge on a different position on Aster itself. ""I’m farming the $ASTER airdrop,” the trader wrote on X . “I believe it will be one of the biggest [in] crypto history.” The move is Wynn’s latest high-risk bet on Hyperliquid, an onchain derivatives platform where he previously took out a $1.2 billion long on bitcoin using 40x leverage. That position closed with a $17.5 million loss, before he flipped into a billion-dollar short. At one point, he had his entire $50 million wallet on the line. That wild streak ended with Wynn saying he was walking away “a wynner” after netting $25 million in profit.

Although red candles continue to dominate the charts, a crypto analyst has pointed out key factors suggesting that this unexpected beatdown could be laying the groundwork for a rebound as the final quarter of the year approaches. Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Are Dropping Hard According to market analyst Ash Crypto, the current market decline is being driven by a series of macroeconomic and technical factors. In an X social media post on Thursday, he explained that the first and most immediate factor behind the pressure is the looming options expiry event. With $23 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options set to expire, volatility has intensified. Ash Crypto stressed that whales, who often steer the market toward the “max pain” price, are now actively pushing Bitcoin near $110,000, ETH closer to $3,700, and DOGE down to $0.23. The analyst highlights that this growing pressure has sparked panic selling among retail investors in the crypto market. Additionally, the potential threat from the United States government has further rattled the markets. With a 67% probability of occurring by October 1, 2025, Ash Crypto reports that uncertainty has significantly impacted investor sentiment. Historically, government shutdowns have triggered corrections in the equity and crypto markets, and the current environment is showing similar signs. Meanwhile, a surprisingly robust US GDP growth data has created another layer of bearish short-term pressure. According to Ash Crypto, Q2 GDP was revised to 3.8% from the initially expected 3.3%, signaling strong economic resilience. While positive in the long run, the analyst notes that robust economic indicators tend to reduce the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (FED) . For risk assets like crypto, this has translated into an immediate selloff as traders reposition in anticipation of tighter monetary conditions. Why This Dip Could Be Setting The Stage For A Bounce Amidst the broader market turmoil, another critical factor has contributed to the recent decline in crypto. Ash Crypto notes that retail investors, drawn by the excitement around perpetual DEXs , have piled into high-leverage positions on altcoins, amplifying potential volatility. He stated that at one point, altcoin Open Interest nearly doubled that of Bitcoin. When market sentiment shifted, massive liquidations swept across exchanges , intensifying the sell-off and accelerating the market’s decline. While disruptive in the short-term, the analyst suggests that this process of unwinding leveraged positions often sets the stage for a significant bounce and more sustainable market rallies. He highlighted that by flushing out overextended positions, whales and institutional players create an environment that favours accumulation. Ash Crypto further highlighted that this cycle appears to be a deliberate play by whales to trigger panic selling before the fourth-quarter rally. He disclosed that September began on a bullish note, convincing traders that prices would only continue upward, only for sharp corrections to reset the market.",Crypto News|Ash Crypto|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin options|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|DEXs|Doge|dogecoin|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum Options|Fed|Federal Reserve|US GDP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-27 19:00:35

With the historically bullish “Uptober” now in sight, investors are hoping that the premier cryptocurrency will be able to find some relief and perhaps enjoy some upward momentum in the coming weeks. However, the latest on-chain revelation suggests that the Bitcoin price is at risk of further downward pressure over the next few weeks. According to a prominent analyst on social media platform X, the market leader has fallen below a crucial level, which could trigger a further 10% price drawdown. BTC To Enter ‘Correction Process’ In Next 2-3 Months? On-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci took to the X platform to share an update on the Bitcoin price in relation to the Short-Term Holder (STH)’s Realized Price. According to the crypto pundit, the BTC price has now broken beneath the STH Realized Price—around $111,500—for the fourth time this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Over? These Signals Show Where The Market Is At For context, the Short-Term Holder Realized Price is a metric that estimates the average price at which Bitcoin short-term investors (holding for less than 115 days) purchased their coins. Because it represents the average cost basis of this relevant investor cohort, the STH Realized Price often acts as a dynamic support and resistance level. Kesmeci revealed that the Bitcoin price had previously fallen below the STH Realized Price three times so far during this bull run, which started in November 2022. According to the on-chain analyst, the market leader entered a consolidation phase when this happened the past three times. In the first incident of BTC slipping beneath STH Realized Price, the Bitcoin price witnessed an over 8% decline between August and October 2023. Meanwhile, the flagship cryptocurrency’s value declined by more than 13% between June 2024 and October 2024 in the second occurrence. Most recently, the market leader dipped almost 8% between February and April 2025 when the Bitcoin price fell below the STH Realized Price. Kesmeci highlighted that, on average, these consolidation phases lasted 77 days and each resulted in an almost 10% loss in BTC’s value. Kesmeci concluded that the Bitcoin price could enter a consolidation/correction phase if it does close the week and perhaps the month beneath the STH Realized Price around $111,500. And if history does repeat itself, investors could see the market lose as much as 10% over the next two to three months. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $109,538, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours.

A major shift is currently underway as this capital pivots away from speculative meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and flows into utility-driven projects with explosive potential. The primary beneficiary of this movement is Ruvi AI (RUVI), a project that analysts say is now set for one of the biggest rallies of the year. This forecast is being driven by a presale that is performing at a truly historic level. Ruvi AI has officially surged past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens sold in a timeframe that has left market watchers astounded. Experts are highlighting this achievement, noting that such rapid sales velocity is exceptionally rare and is often a hallmark of projects that become industry leaders. The demand is undeniable; after a quick sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw 20% of its Phase 3 supply get claimed in just days , growing its global community to over 3,900 holders. From Meme Hype to Tangible Value The exodus of smart money from Dogecoin to Ruvi AI represents a critical evolution in investment strategy. While DOGE offered incredible returns based on social media hype, its lack of fundamental utility makes it a high-risk bet. Smart investors are now seeking projects that combine explosive growth potential with a solid, real-world use case. Ruvi AI fits this profile perfectly. Its mission is to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy , providing a tangible value proposition that a meme coin simply cannot match. This utility-driven foundation is why analysts believe its upcoming rally will be both massive and sustainable. The project’s credibility has been a key factor in attracting this discerning capital. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency that serious investors demand. This combination of real utility, verifiable security, and immense market demand is what separates Ruvi AI from the pack. The Super App Fueling the Rally The engine powering Ruvi AI’s anticipated rally is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Last Chance: Secure Your Position Before a 40% Price Jump The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already sold out at record speed, this ground-floor opportunity is rapidly closing. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP bonus structure is designed to maximize returns from this rally: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway further rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. Follow the Smart Money As the presale accelerates and a price increase looms, the message from the market’s most strategic players is clear. The era of speculative gambles is giving way to smart, utility-focused investments. Ruvi AI is at the forefront of this shift, and for those looking to follow the smart money into one of the year’s biggest potential rallies, the time to act is now.

When trading volumes tighten and wallets steadily accumulate tokens, price action can shift from quiet consolidation to explosive rallies. For XRP, current market conditions are stirring fresh debate about how far the next major move could reach. XForceGlobal’s Bold Projection Renowned crypto market analyst XForceGlobal recently reaffirmed a $20–$30 price target for XRP in a post on X. According to the analyst, persistent accumulation and a strengthening market structure are laying the groundwork for a powerful bullish breakout. This target is presented as a primary scenario for the next major cycle, though XForceGlobal notes that near-term resistance must first be cleared. $XRP The more we see $XRP accumulate, the stronger the targets. In other words, more accumulation = more bullish. $20-30 targets still remain as my primary idea. People aren't selling. pic.twitter.com/ocVldMzcFT — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) September 27, 2025 Current Market Landscape As of report time, XRP trades at $2.77, reflecting a period of steady consolidation following earlier gains this year. Recent trading sessions show intraday swings but a generally tightening price band, a technical pattern that many traders interpret as preparation for a significant move. Evidence of Strong Accumulation On-chain data underscores the bullish outlook. Exchange reserves have declined as large holders steadily withdraw XRP from trading platforms, limiting immediate selling pressure. Whale-sized wallets have also registered notable buying activity, reinforcing the narrative that big players are preparing for a long-term upside. These factors reduce available supply and heighten the potential for sharp price increases when demand accelerates. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the $20–$30 Target Matters Reaching a double-digit price would require substantial market-cap expansion. Accumulation effectively tightens liquidity, so even moderate buying pressure can drive prices dramatically higher. Should regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, or further ETF interest align with these supply constraints, the path toward XForceGlobal’s target becomes more plausible. Risks and Market Variables Despite the optimism, challenges remain. Broader macroeconomic factors, sudden regulatory shifts, and profit-taking by large investors could interrupt momentum. Short-term volatility is likely, and traders should recognize that a $20–$30 outcome depends on sustained demand and favorable global market conditions. Outlook XForceGlobal’s projection highlights the growing confidence among XRP’s most committed supporters. While a leap from the current price to $20 or beyond is ambitious, the underlying data on accumulation and tightening exchange liquidity give this scenario credible support. Investors watching XRP’s next moves should monitor exchange flows, large-wallet activity, and macro catalysts to gauge whether the bullish thesis continues to strengthen.

The ACH could reach a maximum of $0.1259 and an average of $0.1099 by the end of 2029. Alchemy Pay price prediction for 2031 projects a maximum price of $0.2675. Alchemy Pay (ACH) is a cross-functional payment solution making significant strides in bridging the gap between fiat and cryptocurrency payment ecosystems. The platform’s robust framework enables global consumers to connect with merchants, developers, and institutions worldwide, facilitating transactions across multiple fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. This functionality enhances Alchemy Pay’s adaptability and positions it as a pivotal player in the financial technology sector. Alchemy Pay’s inclusion in the decentralized platforms of popular projects like Augur, Cryptokitties, and OpenSea, along with its support for the infrastructure of Kyber and Radar Relay, adds layers of credibility and utility, enhancing its investment appeal. Can Alchemy Pay (ACH) get to $0.1? Will Alchemy Pay hit $1? Let’s find out in this ACH price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Alchemy Pay Token ACH Price $0.01793 Market Cap $170.86M Trading Volume (24-hour) $18.62M Circulating Supply 10 Billion ACH All-time High $0.1975 Aug 06, 2021 All-time Low $0.001338 Jul 20, 2021 24-h High $0.01816 24-h Low $0.01768 Alchemy Pay price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $ 0.016913 (-5.56%) Price Volatility 4.07% 50-Day SMA $ 0.020371 14-Day RSI 38.53 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $ 0.022662 Alchemy Pay price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: ACH trades near $0.0178 with RSI showing mild oversold conditions that hint at a possible bounce Daily resistance is at $0.0192 while support on lower timeframes is around $0.0170 Momentum remains weak and consolidation is likely unless bulls push above resistance with stronger volume ACH/USD 1-day chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView Alchemy Pay (ACH) is trading close to $0.0178 right now, and the 1-day chart shows signs that it might be stabilizing after recent drops. The RSI is at 39.68, which means the asset is getting close to being oversold. This could bring in buyers for a short-term bounce. But the MACD is still bearish, which means that the downward momentum hasn’t completely stopped. Bollinger Bands show that there is resistance around $0.0191 and $0.0212, while support is close to $0.0171. If the price goes above $0.019, the chances of recovery will get better. But if it doesn’t stay above $0.017, the price could drop even more. Overall, ACH is being careful right now, and it looks like it will either consolidate or bounce back a little. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView On the 4-hour chart, Alchemy Pay (ACH) is trading close to $0.0178, which means it is not moving much after a long period of decline. The MACD has turned slightly positive, which could mean a change in momentum in the short term, but the signals are still weak. Bollinger Bands show that volatility is getting smaller, with resistance forming near $0.0183 and support around $0.0170. The Balance of Power at -0.65 shows that bears are still in charge, which limits the chances of prices going up. Bulls need to get back above the $0.0183 level with volume support for the rebound to be stronger. Until then, ACH will probably stay in a range, with the risks leaning toward consolidation or small pullbacks.

On the daily timeframe, the price holds around $0.0178, with RSI near 39, suggesting mild oversold conditions and potential for a corrective bounce if buying strength builds. However, weak momentum and overhead resistance near $0.0192 limit upside potential. On the 4-hour chart, consolidation dominates, with MACD turning slightly positive but Balance of Power still bearish at -0.65. Support rests around $0.0170, while resistance stands at $0.0183. Unless bulls reclaim resistance with volume, ACH is likely to remain in a tight consolidation zone, balancing recovery hopes with downside risk. Is Alchemy Pay a good investment? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows mixed signals as an investment. While the current bearish trend and volatility indicate short-term challenges, the solid market capitalization and consistent support levels suggest long-term potential. However, risk-averse investors may prefer to wait for clearer bullish signs or reduced volatility before considering investing in ACH. Will ACH recover? ACH may recover if bulls regain control and maintain support above critical levels. While the current outlook remains bearish, a breakout above short-term resistance levels and consistent buying activity could reverse the negative momentum and lead to a potential recovery in the market. Will ACH reach $0.05? ACH is expected to trade above the $0.05 range throughout 2027, suggesting potential for significant price appreciation compared to earlier years. Will ACH reach $0.1? The price forecasts indicate that ACH could reach a maximum of $0.1385 by 2029. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend. Will ACH reach $1? The predictions for 2034 show an ACH maximum price of $1. While this indicates significant growth potential, ACH is likely to reach $1 soon. Does ACH have a good long-term future? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows a generally positive long-term outlook, with projected steady price growth over the years.

As digital assets continue to redefine financial landscapes, the tools we use to build and manage them must be equally robust. Yet, a silent saboteur is creeping into modern workplaces, threatening to undermine the very promise of technological advancement: AI workslop . This phenomenon, characterized by low-quality, AI-generated content, is not just a nuisance; it’s a significant hurdle to genuine AI productivity and organizational success, particularly in sectors reliant on rapid, accurate information. What is AI Workslop and Why Does it Matter? Researchers from BetterUp Labs, in collaboration with the Stanford Social Media Lab, have introduced the term ‘workslop’ to describe AI-generated content that appears to be productive but lacks true substance. Imagine an AI churning out reports that are technically complete but devoid of critical insights, or marketing copy that sounds generic and fails to resonate. This isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a drain on resources and a roadblock to genuine progress. Organizations striving for digital transformation often invest heavily in AI tools, only to find their teams drowning in this ‘workslop,’ leading to zero return on investment for 95% of those who’ve tried AI. The Insidious Impact of Low-Quality AI Generated Content The core problem with AI generated content that constitutes workslop is its deceptive nature. It ‘masquerades as good work,’ but fundamentally fails to advance tasks meaningfully. This creates a ripple effect throughout an organization: Increased Workload: Instead of saving time, workslop forces receivers to ‘interpret, correct, or redo the work.’ This downstream burden negates any initial time-saving benefits of AI. Contextual Gaps: Workslop is often ‘unhelpful, incomplete, or missing crucial context,’ making it difficult for human employees to build upon or trust. Erosion of Trust: When colleagues consistently receive subpar AI-generated output, it can lead to frustration and a lack of trust in both the technology and the individuals using it. Stagnated Innovation: If teams are constantly correcting basic AI output, they have less time and mental energy for truly innovative tasks, hindering the very digital transformation AI is supposed to accelerate. A recent survey of 1,150 U.S. employees revealed that 40% had encountered workslop within the past month, highlighting the pervasive nature of this issue in the modern workplace AI landscape. Boosting AI Productivity: Strategies to Combat Workslop So, how can organizations and individuals navigate this challenge and ensure their AI investments truly pay off? The researchers suggest a multi-pronged approach focused on thoughtful implementation and clear guidelines: Lead by Example: Workplace leaders must ‘model thoughtful AI use that has purpose and intention.’ This means demonstrating how to leverage AI for complex, value-adding tasks, rather than simply offloading mundane ones without oversight. Establish Clear Guardrails: Set ‘clear guardrails for your teams around norms and acceptable use.’ This includes guidelines on when to use AI, what quality standards apply to AI-generated drafts, and the expectation for human review and refinement. Focus on Augmentation, Not Automation: Emphasize AI as a tool to augment human capabilities, not replace critical thinking. Encourage employees to use AI for initial drafts, data synthesis, or brainstorming, always with the understanding that human expertise is required for final output. Invest in AI Literacy: Provide training for employees on how to effectively prompt AI, critically evaluate its output, and integrate it seamlessly into their workflows to maximize AI productivity . Feedback Loops: Implement systems for employees to provide feedback on the quality of AI-generated content, allowing for continuous improvement of both the tools and their application within the organization. Navigating the Future of Workplace AI The emergence of AI workslop is a critical reminder that technology is only as effective as its application. In a world increasingly shaped by AI, particularly in high-stakes environments like cryptocurrency development and trading, the quality of our digital output directly impacts our success. By proactively addressing workslop, organizations can unlock the true potential of AI, transforming it from a source of frustration into a powerful engine for innovation and efficiency. Embracing thoughtful AI integration is not just about adopting new tools; it’s about cultivating a culture where technology serves human ingenuity, not the other way around. This proactive stance is essential for any entity aiming for successful digital transformation in the AI era. The phenomenon of ‘workslop’ presents a significant challenge to organizations hoping to harness the power of AI. It underscores the critical need for intentional strategy and clear guidelines when integrating AI into daily operations. By understanding what workslop is, acknowledging its insidious effects, and implementing thoughtful practices for AI use, businesses can move beyond superficial AI adoption towards genuine enhancement of human creativity and efficiency. The goal isn’t just to use AI, but to use it wisely, ensuring every piece of AI-generated content truly adds value and propels us forward.

52352209,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=820315,1759003200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52352209.jpeg,Why 80% Of Crypto Analysts Are Backing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Even After Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF Goes Live,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-80-of-crypto-analysts-are-backing-mutuum-finance-mutm-even-after-dogecoin-doge-etf-goes-live/,"In the wake of the Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) launch, DOGE was all but expected to sweep headlines and capital flows, but more and more analysts seem to be shifting their focus elsewhere. One standout coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping into the spotlight with structural benefits and early traction. MUTM has raised over $16.4 million in its presale phase and established a large holder base. Its two-lending protocol offering both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending markets is helping it become a DeFi trailblazer. In contrast, though the DOGE ETF provides memecoin investment some level of validation, it remains hugely dependent on brand and speculative psychology. For the majority of analysts, the appeal of a protocol with actual use case, security audited, and growing roadmap tips in MUTM’s favor under current market conditions. Dogecoin Shows Signs of Breakout Amid ETF Mania Dogecoin remains in the spotlight for the majority of traders because technical indicators are signaling a likely breakout. The memecoin has just broken above a declining resistance line and retested the $0.24 level to great success, which is a bullish indicator typically before the memecoin goes up. Market analysts are closely monitoring a developing double bottom pattern, an aging reversal pattern that could spark a rally to $0.42 in the near term. If DOGE breaks through its upper trendlines, projections go even higher, with some models tipping a charge to the $0.60–$0.70 range. Mutuum’s Presale Performance Mutuum Finance presale has debuted Presale Stage Six, where the tokens are now at $0.035 after a 16.17% round price increase from the previous stage. There is a great deal of anticipation from investors, with over 16,600 buyers and over $16.4 million in funds raised. As it attempts to introduce security on the platform, Mutuum Finance is unveiling a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Bugs are categorized into four types, namely critical, major, minor, and low, to enable their maximum discovery and fix. The protocol is based on close collateral control of the funds to make the system and players secure. Control is maintained through some collateral ratios, lending limitations, and deposit limitations. The undercollateralized positions are shut down very shortly, and call penalty and remediation charges are faced for the purpose of maintaining systemic stability. Creating an Efficient Platform Efficiency comes from maximizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly where overcollateralized credit is concerned. Reserve requirements also serve as a market shock absorber and excess reserves can be used for assuming risk-absorbing exposures in risky assets. Mutuum Finance is a liquidity-based, dynamic model of interest rates. It has borrowing and lending in equilibrium absolutely with variation in market conditions at any given time. With a higher amount of money on the platform, low borrowing rates are kept deliberately to encourage more utilization of money with it as well as instigating market activity. Where liquidity is more restrictive, lending rates rise and that encourages existing borrowers to mature outstanding loans as well as bring in new deposits. That is the feedback loop that generates a superior, more stable state of affairs which protects user interests, trims liquidity flows, and trims the total protocol exposure both in times of market tranquility and stress. MUTM Deftly Amasses a 100x Case Even though the hype of the Dogecoin ETF debut set off renewed attention for DOGE, most cryptocurrency analysts remain optimistic about Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and there’s good reason why. Backed by over $16.4 million in funding from over 16,600 supporters, MUTM’s dual-lending protocol, advanced risk management, and dynamic liquidity solutions offer a lot more than hype-driven speculation. Its security under audit, its efficient collateral management, and building DeFi utility provide a firmer foundation for sustainable growth than tailwinds behind memecoins alone. As tokens reach just $0.035 during Stage 6 of presale, the window for early access is narrowing. Individuals looking for high-potential exposure to budding DeFi should place their MUTM position now prior to demand pushing prices higher.

From its technological design to its regulatory treatment, the cryptocurrency has long divided investors, developers, and policymakers. A recent post by crypto commentator Riz on X highlights why XRP continues to face both intense criticism and steadfast support. Georgetown Law Panel Highlights Riz shared a clip from a Georgetown Law panel featuring Ryan Zagone, a former Ripple executive, who contrasted proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains such as Bitcoin with the XRP Ledger. Zagone argued that PoW networks are energy-intensive and ill-suited for high-volume payments, while XRP’s consensus mechanism delivers far greater efficiency. He noted that the XRP Ledger can process roughly 1,500 transactions per second at a cost of mere fractions of a cent, figures that independent XRPL documentation supports. this is why they shit on XRP. #XRP https://t.co/K9U4iQR62I pic.twitter.com/74QW8AWfui — RIZ.. (@RizXRP) September 27, 2025 Regulatory Uncertainty as the Core Obstacle Despite these technical advantages, Zagone identified policy uncertainty—especially in the United States—as the primary barrier to adoption. While Bitcoin and Ethereum enjoy comparatively clear regulatory standing, XRP has been entangled in years of legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the case has recently concluded , the prolonged litigation discouraged institutions from using XRP, limiting its market presence even as its technology matured. Reasons Critics Persist Skepticism about XRP also stems from its history. Detractors frequently cite centralization concerns, pointing to the large share of tokens initially allocated to Ripple Labs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Even though the network operates as open source and maintains a decentralized validator structure, the early distribution continues to raise questions about Ripple’s influence over supply and pricing. These governance issues, coupled with regulatory ambiguity, fuel ongoing criticism. A Divided Landscape The discussion amplified by Riz captures a lasting divide in the crypto community. Supporters view XRP as a technologically superior solution for global payments, offering speed, low cost, and minimal environmental impact. Critics remain focused on the token’s origins and its uneven regulatory treatment. As Zagone emphasized, achieving a level regulatory playing field is essential for markets to decide which networks prevail. Until that clarity arrives, XRP will continue to attract both ardent advocates and outspoken detractors—illustrating exactly why, as Riz put it, “they shit on XRP.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
