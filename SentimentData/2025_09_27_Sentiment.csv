Compared to ADA’s gradual rise, MUTM’s lending-and-borrowing system, early-stage market price, and solid utility-driven demand offer prospects of explosive price boosts with growing acceptance. As whales drive money into smaller, high-potential coins, the majority see Mutuum as a cycle-breakout token, a venture with the potential to yield exponential returns as bigger-cap assets like Cardano focus on marginal returns. Cardano Trades Above Key Support as Bulls Eye Breakout to $1.20 While investor attention continues to get drawn towards high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Cardano (ADA) is a closely watched large-cap altcoin that is showing itself to be robust amidst ongoing bear pressure. After the 6.1% decline that sent ADA below the pivotal $0.84 support, technical indicators continue to be divided in their outlook, with the RSI at 40 and a bearish MACD crossover suggesting further downside risk towards the $0.76 retracement area. With that said, maintaining above $0.88 does suggest retail buyers are entering against whale selling as a level of entry for a recovery. One to watch is the forming ascending triangle pattern below $0.95 resistance; if ADA is able to break above this level, analysts are forecasting a rally back towards the $1.20–$1.25 region even as newer coins like MUTM come to center stage for growth prospects. Mutuum Finance Record-Breaking Presale Mutuum Finance has recorded incredibly unprecedented interest in Stage Six presale at $0.035, 16.17% higher than the previous round. Investor interest has also been record-high with over 16,570 investors in and over $16.3 million raised so far. Accelerating the growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program in an attempt to further secure the platform. The bugs are ranked on four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, as an attempt to accommodate all the aspects of vulnerability. It is fueled by strong security to provide service to all customers to the best of its abilities. It operates under collateral ratios, caps in lending, and caps in depositing. Undercollateralized positions are closed efficiently through incentivized liquidations facilitated by penalties and guarantee remediation fees in order to stabilize the system. Efficiency of collateral is optimized through Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly for high-collateral lending. Reserve mechanisms are employed for creating a buffer against market fluctuations and excess reserves can be invested in volatile assets in the strategy of offsetting instability. DeFi Lending for All Mutuum Finance has established a lending platform that is as good for lenders as it is for borrowers. It accomplishes this through facilitating Peer-to-Peer, or P2P lending model scalable, immune to tampering and with access to retail and institutional investors. In an effort to steer away from traditional DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance also rewards early adopters in a $100,000 giveaway competition, in which 10 users have a chance of winning $10,000 MUTM. Being a lending protocol, it provides actual returns to lenders and borrowers, as per its vision of an open, transparent platform for every market participant. Cardano (ADA) could reach as high as $1.20, but its gains could be dwarfed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The initiative is currently at $0.035 in Presale Stage 6 and could hit as high as $2 when adoption achieves lift-off, a potential 5,600% gain. More than 16,570 investors have already registered, attaining $16.3 million+. Funded with a $50K bug bounty, $100K giveaway, and a secure dual-lending model, Mutuum is built for long-term growth. Whales are swapping out into smaller, high-upside tokens, and MUTM is at the forefront, according to experts.

According to crypto pundit Zach Rector, network upgrades and DeFi opportunities could encourage holders to commit their XRP for the long term, thereby reducing the number of tokens available for active trading. Zach Rector Warns Of Looming XRP “Supply Shock” Zach Rector, a well-followed crypto commentator, has raised the alarm about what lies ahead for XRP . According to Rector, billions of tokens are on track to be locked and deployed inside decentralized finance protocols in the near future. Rector argues that massive amounts of XRP are on track to leave circulation as they get stored inside long-term blockchain systems and institutional programs. Rector points out that liquidity is no longer moving freely across open exchanges as it once did. Trading volume that once flowed across markets is now shifting into smart contracts, secure custody accounts, and platforms that offer steady returns. Such moves reduce the number of tokens left for open trading on exchanges. As the pool of active tokens shrinks, upward pressure on prices is likely to intensify over time. Short-term traders who focus solely on daily movements may overlook the more profound changes now underway. The Rector’s view suggests that demand is no longer the sole factor shaping XRP. Supply is shrinking step by step , setting up the possibility of a crunch that could change the market’s direction soon. Innovations To Drive Large-Scale Token Lockups At the core of these changes is the XRP Ledger itself, which now includes an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain , opening the door to smart contracts, lending markets, and liquidity pools. These new capabilities allow holders to utilize their XRP directly on the network, making long-term token commitments more attractive. Cross-chain bridges, such as Axelar, allow XRP to move easily between networks, facilitating the deployment of tokens into DeFi projects by institutions and large holders for extended periods. The more effortless movement of assets gives institutions and large holders a clear path to place tokens into DeFi projects for long-term use. Exchanges and custodians are launching yield products, including wrapped tokens and staking-style services, that allow investors to earn rewards while keeping their XRP locked. The rewards make it far more tempting for holders to keep XRP out of trading circulation. Analysts stress that even if adoption grows only at a modest pace, billions of tokens could end up sidelined. A tighter supply could result in significantly fewer tokens in circulation, leading to more intense price movements. While there are still technical and regulatory challenges to be faced, the tools for long-term XRP lockups are already available. With momentum building, the supply shock Zach Rector has warned about may arrive sooner than many expect.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 22:00:35

Underestimating a project with explosive potential is one of them. While established coins like Tron (TRX) offer predictable but limited gains, experts are pointing to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as this cycle’s true high-return play, a 9,900% ROI opportunity that could cost you millions if overlooked. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a conclusion drawn from a presale that is performing at a historic level. Ruvi AI has shattered expectations, raising over $4 million and selling more than 285 million tokens in record time. Analysts are praising this velocity, noting it’s a rare feat typically reserved for projects that go on to become industry titans. The demand is undeniable: after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI became one of the market’s hottest altcoins, proven when 20% of its Phase 3 supply was claimed within days . The Multi-Million Dollar Mistake: Sticking with Slow Movers For investors aiming for life-changing returns, portfolio allocation is everything. Holding onto large-cap coins like Tron offers stability, but it can’t deliver the exponential growth that creates wealth in a bull market. The real opportunity lies in identifying projects like Ruvi AI before they hit the mainstream, a low-cap gem with the fundamentals and narrative to deliver a 9,900% ROI or more. Ruvi AI’s credibility is rock-solid, making it an easy choice for smart capital. It boasts a successful smart contract audit by CyberScope , confirming its security and reliability. Its high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency and legitimacy that serious investors demand. The project’s core value is its mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . This focus on a real-world product, an AI-powered super app, provides a sustainable foundation for long-term growth and is why experts see it as a far superior play to TRX this cycle. The Super App Fueling the 9900% ROI Potential The engine behind these staggering ROI projections is Ruvi AI’s game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Pinpoints viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a critical competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the application. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Final Warning: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already gone, this ground-floor price is disappearing quickly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP program is structured to maximize returns from this opportunity: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards top supporters, further strengthening the project’s unstoppable momentum. Don’t Let This Opportunity Pass You By The market is sending a clear message. Underestimating Ruvi AI’s record-breaking momentum and explosive potential could be a multi-million dollar mistake. As the presale accelerates and a guaranteed price increase looms, the window to act on this cycle’s premier ROI opportunity is closing fast.

Speaking in an interview with Bankless, Grewal argued that Base functions as blockchain infrastructure rather than a platform for matching securities trades. Should @base be regulated like the Nasdaq exchange? Here's what @coinbase CLO @iampaulgrewal has to say: “Base is just a normal blockchain… Yes it’s a layer2. But that doesn’t change its relationship to securities laws.” “We are not matching buyers and sellers of securities…… pic.twitter.com/Cd4M8kizTZ — Bankless (@BanklessHQ) September 26, 2025 “Base is just a normal blockchain,” Grewal said. “Yes, it’s a Layer-2. But that doesn’t change its relationship to securities laws. We are not matching buyers and sellers of securities. We are just a blockchain layer.” He stressed that transaction matching occurs within applications built on top of Base, such as automated market makers or centralized limit order book protocols, not at the Layer-2 level itself. Coinbase’s Base Balances SEC Scrutiny With Decentralization Push His comments come amid growing debate over the role of Layer-2 sequencers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines an exchange as a marketplace that matches buyers and sellers of securities. Commissioner Hester Peirce has previously warned that centralized sequencers could resemble exchange matching engines and therefore fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has backed Grewal’s position, likening Layer-2 networks to cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, which host exchange code but are not classified as exchanges themselves. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also praised Base for combining centralized sequencing with Ethereum’s decentralized security model, describing the approach as key to improving user experience. @VitalikButerin defends @Coinbase 's Base blockchain as a genuine Layer 2 with non-custodial security guarantees through the Ethereum base layer. #Ethereum #Base https://t.co/qdwFwEC9wT — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 Base was launched in 2023 as a low-cost, developer-focused chain built on Ethereum. It has since become a popular scaling solution for decentralized finance applications. Grewal warned that treating Layer-2 infrastructure as an exchange would impose heavy compliance burdens that could hinder innovation and slow the growth of the broader ecosystem. The regulatory debate coincides with a shift in Coinbase’s approach to Base’s long-term roadmap. At the BaseCamp 2025 event in Vermont, Jesse Pollak, who leads the Base project, revealed that the team is “beginning to explore” launching a native network token . Base has explored launching a network token, reversing Coinbase’s earlier stance. @jessepollak and @brian_armstrong confirmed discussions. #Coinbase #Base https://t.co/5vMMa9mHQ3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 The remarks marked a departure from Coinbase’s previous position that Base would not issue a token. Pollak emphasized that no decision has been made on the design, governance, or timeline for a token launch but described the exploration as part of efforts to accelerate decentralization and expand opportunities for developers and creators. The comments came a few weeks after the token distribution by Consensys’ Linea network, which released more than 9.3 billion LINEA tokens to eligible users . Alongside token discussions, Base also announced an open-source bridge with Solana at BaseCamp, allowing interoperability between ERC-20 and SPL tokens. The developments show both the rapid growth of the Layer-2 ecosystem and the unresolved regulatory questions facing infrastructure providers. Base Emerges as a Growing DeFi Powerhouse Amid Shifts in TVL Rankings Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized finance with $86.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), but Coinbase’s Base network is quickly establishing itself as one of the most active ecosystems in the market. Base currently holds $4.83 billion in TVL across more than 700 protocols, showing steady monthly growth despite short-term fluctuations. Liquidity is largely stablecoin-driven, with $4.4 billion in circulating supply on the network, underpinning lending and trading activity. Source: DeFiLlama Daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes approach $2 billion, while perpetuals trading adds another $1.1 billion—placing Base among the most liquid Layer-2s. Chain-level efficiency also stands out. In the past 24 hours, Base captured $237,000 in fees, nearly all of which were converted to revenue. The network processed activity from nearly 740,000 addresses in a single day, showing its broad retail and institutional adoption. Source: DeFiLlama Bridged liquidity stands far higher at nearly $20 billion, indicating large capital inflows that are not yet fully deployed in DeFi protocols. Protocols fueling the ecosystem include Aerodrome, Uniswap, Aave, and Spark. Aerodrome remains a major liquidity hub, though it leans heavily on incentives, resulting in negative net earnings. By contrast, Spark has emerged as one of the fastest-growing lending platforms, posting a 41% TVL increase over the past month. Risk management services such as Gauntlet and Block Analitica also highlight the maturing role of analytics in DeFi. While Ethereum and Solana still command larger ecosystems, Base’s rapid rise, backed by Coinbase’s infrastructure and user base, is positioning it as a contender in the next wave of DeFi expansion. Sustaining growth, however, may depend on whether protocols can reduce reliance on subsidies and maintain long-term liquidity.

The project’s popularity is fueled by its Season 2 points program and key endorsements from industry figures, including former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). ASTER Climbs Rankings The crypto data aggregator reported via X that XLP has achieved the top spot on CoinGecko after a recent airdrop valued at about $10,000 was distributed to holders. Close behind on the rankings are the perpetual tokens ASTER and AVNT. ASTER is the native token of a decentralized perpetual futures exchange by the same name that’s challenging Hyperliquid’s dominance in the sector. It runs on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, but it primarily exists on the BNB Chain. ASTER is trading at around $1.78 today, down by 15.3% in the last 24 hours, but remains up by over 181% over the last week. Since its launch on September 17, the coin’s value has surged by over 2,400%, pushing its market capitalization above $2.9 billion and securing the 50th position on CoinGecko. Aster has been around for over a year, but activity on the platform exploded following the launch of its native token. Since then, the exchange has overtaken Hyperliquid in key metrics. DefiLlama data shows that it reported $35.86 billion in daily perpetual trading volume, surpassing its rival’s $17.16 billion. The strong performance has attracted new traders who see the platform’s liquidity as a competitive advantage. On-chain data reveals that whales have been accumulating ASTER steadily since last week, with more than $48 million invested in the token. Separately, another large holder recently pocketed $7 million in profits from an initial outlay of $300k. Why Aster Is Exploding in Popularity Part of the excitement is coming from the project’s community push around Season 2 of its points farming program. The campaign rewards users for trading, referrals, and margin usage. Crypto analyst Shawn shared on X that only 4% of tokens are released in this round, but participation is already 30 times higher than in Season 1. Aster has also received backing from prominent figures in the crypto industry, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who has publicly endorsed the project and promoted it on his X account. The platform is also supported by YZi Labs, Zhao’s private investment firm, which provides mentorship, technical support, and marketing exposure. Additionally, crypto trader James Wynn has promoted Aster as a superior product to its competitor Hyperliquid. Wynn noted that its counterpart is facing a “slow and painful death” as the newer perpetuals DEX gains ground in the industry.

Day traders who fueled rallies in everything from tech stocks to cryptocurrency are now pulling money out of the most speculative investments. This shift comes even as the Federal Reserve continues supporting markets and major indexes hover close to recent peaks. The clearest sign of this change shows up in leveraged exchange-traded funds, which use borrowed money to amplify daily stock moves by two or three times. These products, popular with individual investors seeking quick profits, have lost about $7 billion in September. According to Bloomberg Intelligence this is the biggest outflow since records began in 2019. The retreat doesn’t signal widespread panic. Instead, traders appear to be cashing in profits and preparing for possible bumps ahead after months of rewards for taking big risks. Chip fund loses $2.3 billion despite 31% gain Take the Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3x Shares fund, known by its ticker SOXL. Despite gaining 31% this month, investors pulled more than $2.3 billion from the fund. Similarly, TSLL, which triples exposure to Tesla stock moves, faces its largest monthly outflow ever with $1.5 billion already withdrawn, even as Tesla shares have been climbing. This careful approach may reflect concerns about upcoming events. A possible government shutdown could delay economic reports and shake investor confidence. Many see the pullback as healthy, given that stock and bond markets have reached levels rarely seen except during the most excited periods of the past twenty years. What stands out is who’s moving first. Individual investors – often called “dumb money” by Wall Street professionals for supposedly making poor timing decisions – have actually been ahead of the curve this year. Their steady buying during the first six months helped drive a rally that many professional investors initially doubted. When markets fell in April due to tariff worries, retail traders were among the first to jump back into risky investments. For the week, the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, marking its first decline in a month. The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 also posted its first down week since late August, falling 0.5%. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF slipped for a second straight week. Crypto crash wipes out $300 billion As Cryptopolitan reported, cryptocurrency markets added to the cautious mood this week. Digital assets lost roughly $300 billion in value as leveraged positions unwound, forcing sales that pushed Bitcoin and Ether sharply lower in one of the most volatile stretches since the summer. Though prices recovered by Friday, the magnitude of the decline and doubts about business interest could pressure individual investors who had accumulated substantial profits this year. Whether driven by gut feeling or exhaustion, the retreat may signal a broader rethinking of risk. But in markets this elevated, even small mistakes or poorly timed exits can prove costly. No signs point to a major downturn yet, but conditions appear more delicate than before. Money is flowing into safer investments – cash-like funds, gold, and volatility products – at the fastest pace in months. Together, these movements suggest markets are quietly adjusting, with speculative betting retreating even as core investments hold steady. Investment firms are making adjustments, too. Lido Advisors, which manages $30 billion, has added protective strategies like selling covered calls for income and buying put spreads as insurance against losses.

The meme coin is currently approaching a high-confluence support zone, sitting at the intersection of a three-month-long trendline and a key Fibonacci retracement level – both converging near the apex of a possible breakout. Whales appear to be positioning ahead of the move. Since PEPE’s recent local top, the top 100 wallets have increased their holdings by over 6 trillion tokens , according to Nansen data . Pepe whales accumulate alongside correction. Source: Nansen. This show of conviction comes as market narratives continue to favor a Q4 bull run. With U.S. inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for further interest rate cuts are strengthening, with the potential to stimulate capital rotation into riskier plays like Pepe. Pepe Price Prediction: Confluence Zone Eyes 100% Move This confluence zone set up the potential breakout of a bullish pennant pattern forming since the May pepe price bull run. The pattern’s upper resistance and lower support are converging toward an apex, with a strong confluence of support acting as a launchpad for the next retest. The 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, often a bottom marker in steep corrections, aligns with a 3-month support level around $0.000009, creating a compelling setup for a bounce. Momentum indicators strengthen the bullish case. The RSI has found footing just above the oversold threshold at 30, signaling buyers may be stepping back in. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is flattening below the signal line, suggesting the early stages of a potential uptrend. If buy pressure builds, a successful breakout attempt would target $0.000019 for a possible 100% gain —a 2x move from current prices. Stronger catalysts, however, could extend the rally. With U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approval on the table under new SEC listing standards, Pepe could retest its all-time high at $0.000029. That would mark a 220% surge and potentially push the price into new discovery before year-end. This New ICO is Bringing Passive Income to Pepe For large-cap meme coins like Pepe, big gains are slow to arrive. This 2x setup has been almost 5 months in the making. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is the first mine-to-earn meme coin that lets anyone build virtual mining rigs to earn rewards – no expensive hardware or technical skills needed. Instead of waiting for the token to launch, early investors can jump into the action right away. The project gamifies crypto mining by allowing users to set up and upgrade digital rigs, which generate passive rewards in the form of popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. It’s a fresh twist on mining – fun, interactive, and built for the degens who don’t want to sit on idle bags during a presale. Built-in deflation strengthens the model. Every $PEPENODE spent on rigs or nodes undergoes a 70% burn, creating long-term scarcity while boosting returns. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has topped $1.4 million in early weeks, and early stakers are still locking in a huge 913% APY. Join the $PEPENODE presale now on the official website to start mining. The current offering is $0.0010745 per token, but the clock’s ticking on the next price increase. To stay updated, you can also follow PepeNode on X (formerly Twitter) .

HSBC announced it successfully tested quantum computing for algorithmic bond trading, boosting prediction accuracy by 34%. While the bank called it an early experiment, the test raised questions about long-term cryptographic security. “Q-Day” — the moment when quantum computing could break existing encryption — may arrive as soon as 2030, according to some developers. For Bitcoin, the shift underscores the need for quantum-resistant upgrades, a move that could enhance confidence in its resilience as a store of value. Kraken’s $500M Raise Fuels IPO Talk Investor confidence in crypto infrastructure is building. Kraken reportedly raised $500 million at a $15 billion valuation, according to Fortune. Though the exchange hasn’t filed an S-1 with the SEC, stronger financial disclosures hint at IPO preparation. JUST IN: #Bitcoin and crypto exchange Kraken raises $500 million at a $15 billion valuation. We are going mainstream pic.twitter.com/cUZ6CbLrCd — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 26, 2025 Founded in 2011, Kraken processes about $1.9 billion in daily trading volume, ranking among the top 15 global exchanges. Its raise follows a surge in crypto IPOs: Gemini’s Nasdaq launch was 20 times oversubscribed, Circle doubled its $1 billion valuation on debut, and blockchain lender Figure saw similarly strong demand. This trend highlights growing institutional appetite for regulated, mainstream crypto exposure — a factor that could feed into stronger Bitcoin demand. BlackRock’s Yield ETF Signals Institutional Shift BlackRock, which manages more than $9 trillion in assets, is preparing to launch the Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. Unlike its $87 billion iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), the new product will sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures to generate yield for investors. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas dubbed it a “ sequel to IBIT ,” pointing out BlackRock’s deliberate focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum while avoiding altcoin ETFs. The move could solve a long-standing critique that Bitcoin lacks income generation, potentially broadening its appeal to pension funds and income-focused investors. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels to Watch Technically, Bitcoin remains under pressure. On the 4-hour chart, price action has broken below a descending channel and failed to reclaim the 50- and 100-SMAs near $113,500. Lower highs continue to define the structure, signaling persistent bearish control. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns reinforce this bias. A shooting star at $116,000 sparked a reversal, followed by bearish engulfing candles and a “three black crows” formation — a textbook continuation signal. The RSI sits near 32, showing oversold conditions but with no bullish divergence. Support rests at $107,300, with further downside targets at $105,200 and $102,800 if momentum persists. Short bias remains below $113,000 First downside target: $107,300 Extended levels: $105,200–$102,800 For novices, think of this as a staircase trending down. Each bounce has been weaker, showing buyers can’t regain control unless Bitcoin closes decisively above $113,000. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $18.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012985—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

The company announced the completion of its first $30 million Toncoin purchase on Thursday. AlphaTON has become one of the largest holders of Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network. The company said its goal is to grow its Toncoin treasury to $100 million by the end of 2025. AlphaTON wants to invest $100M in Toncoin The Nasdaq-listed company closed a $71 million financing round back in early September. The financing round included a $36.2 million private placement of 6.32 million shares. In addition, AlphaTON secured a $35 million loan facility with BitGo Prime. The ex-biotech company stated that it aims to acquire $100 million worth of Toncoin (TON). In the release, AlphaTon announced, “A financing to acquire ~$100 million TON tokens and establish a specialized digital asset treasury company dedicated to building a strategic TON reserve and providing public markets access to Telegram’s rapidly expanding ecosystem of more than a billion monthly active users.” Beyond accumulating Toncoin, AlphaTon wants to generate yield revenue via blockchain validation and staking rewards. The new DAT also wants to back projects within Telegram’s mini-app and DeFi ecosystems. AlphaTon has strategic crypto partners and advisors, including BitGo, Animoca Brands, Kraken, SkyBridge Capital, and Crypto.com, among others. The company is led by CEO Brittany Kaiser, a former director at Gryphon Digital Mining . Executive Chairman Enzo Villani, co-founder of Nasdaq Global Corporate Solutions, is also part of AlphaTon’s leadership. Kaiser said , “Today marks a pivotal moment in AlphaTON Capital’s journey as we officially establish ourselves as a premier digital asset treasury company with substantial TON holdings.” AlphaTon is following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy playbook, but through Toncoin. The Nasdaq-listed firm is copying Ton Strategy, which is another firm that accumulated more than $700 million in TON last month. AlphaTON’s stock closed at $5.77 on Friday. The stock slipped by around 9.8% from the previous session based on data from Yahoo Finance. On the other hand, Toncoin (TON) is currently trading at $2.75. The token has a 24-hour trading volume of $139.9 million and a market capitalization of $6.99 billion based on aggregated data from CoinGecko. Toncoin surged massively during Telegram’s mini-game boom in 2024. The token recorded an all-time high of $8.25 but has since fallen about 60% from its peak. The coin now ranks 32nd by market cap.

While liquidations have sent the crypto market lower yet again today, the market is in a strong position to bounce back once the SEC approvals begin coming in. And this particularly applies to XRP, Pepe and Cardano, which DeepSeek AI predicts could smash their current ATHs in the final weeks of 2025, especially when regulatory and business conditions have become much more favorable in recent months. Ripple ($XRP): DeepSeek AI Predicts Potential Run to $7 As Ripple Captures Cross-Border Market DeepSeek is particularly bullish about XRP, which it says could rise as high as $7 by 2026, almost doubling its current ATH ($3.65). The Chinese AI cites the resolution of the Ripple-SEC case as a major factor in XRP’s growth, suggesting that this gives Ripple the launchpad from which to capture a significant chunk of the cross-border payments market. And Ripple is doing just this at the moment, having signed numerous partnerships in recent months, having made acquisitions , and having expanded into new territories . This leaves XRP in a supremely strong position, with its chart today suggesting that it’s close to rebounding. Source: TradingView Its indicators are all in oversold positions, meaning that it’s selling at a discount and that positive movement isn’t far away. It may return to strong growth as and when the SEC approves one or more of the XRP ETF applications waiting for a decision. There’s little doubt that it will beat its current ATH by the end of the year, although a bull rally could send it even higher. Pepe ($PEPE): DeepSeek AI Predicts 229% Increase for Popular Meme Coin Citing the potential for “meme coin dynamics and viral sentiment,” DeepSeek AI predicts that PEPE could rise as high as $0.000030 by 2026, making for a 229% increase over its current price of $0.00000910. DeepSeek suggests that endorsements from high-profile influencers and even celebrities could drive the PEPE price higher, while also proposing that social media-based FOMO could boost the meme token. What DeepSeek doesn’t mention, however, is that PEPE remains a favorite vehicle among whales, who continue to buy the token and pump its price . As such, there’s a very real chance that the coin could rally hard if the market enters an end-of-year buy rally, especially one that follows a wave of ETF approvals. And there’s an argument that DeepSeek was somewhat conservative in its price prediction, given that PEPE’s all-time high is already $0.00002803. A particularly bullish market could see it eclipse this price, and potentially rise towards $0.00010. Cardano ($ADA): DeepSeek AI Predicts Rally to $12 Amid Growth in Ecosystem Asked to provide a very bullish prediction for Cardano, DeepSeek suggested that it could hit $12 within the next few months, making for a 1,472% increase over ADA’s current price. Such a prediction is based on Cardano’s growth into “a dominant force in decentralized finance and real-world governance,” including the development of dApps running on Cardano. It may seem that Cardano is some way off such a scenario, yet its TVL has been growing steadily in recent years, rising from $50 million in January 2023 to $317 million today . It also continues to roll out new updates and attract new projects to its ecosystem , which could soon attract genuine adoption and usage. On top of this, Grayscale has applied to launch a Cardano ETF, and if it gains approval this could send ADA much higher. As such, ADA’s current oversold position could mean that we’re about to see it surge upwards, crossing $1 in a few weeks before challenging its current ATH of $3.09. And while our chart above sets a target of $4 for the end of the year, DeepSeek believes it could rise even higher. Maxi Doge: Ultra-Bullish Meme Token Raises $2.5 Million in Hugely Popular Sale While DeepSeek has provided very encouraging predictions for the three tokens above, traders may also be interested in diversifying into newer, low-cap coins, which could also enjoy huge rallies towards the end of the year. Such coins also include presale tokens, which have the advantage of starting from a low base, meaning that big gains can be possible in a short space of time. A great example of a new coin holding its presale is Maxi Doge ($MAXI), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $2.5 million. In a sea of red, hold the green fam. pic.twitter.com/TKpRKiyiZ4 — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) September 25, 2025 This provides a bullish sign of its emerging popularity, with Maxi Doge attracting investors by virtue of its unique spin on the familiar Dogecoin-themed template. Boasting a perma-bull trading theme, Maxi Doge is building an online community that will meet on its Discord and Telegram channels, where they’ll have the opportunity to share trading tip and coordinate collective action. Maxi Doge’s social channels will also host regular trading competitions, enabling community members to compete to see who can earn the biggest profits in a given amount of time. Winners will receive rewards in the form of MAXI, which will comes with a total capped supply of 150.24 billion tokens. Holders of MAXI will be able to stake the token for regular staking yields, while Maxi Doge will be retaining 25% of its supply for its Maxi Fund. This fund will support new partnerships and publicity initiatives, something which should help to keep Maxi Doge in the public eye, and to grow its base. Investors can join the coin’s presale by visiting the Maxi Doge website , where MAXI currently costs $0.000259. Investors should act quickly, however, since this price will rise later today and will continue to rise until the sale ends.

Is this DEX’s sudden dominance enough to justify a bullish Aster price prediction ? Looking at data from DeFi Llama, Aster has surpassed top perps DEXs by a long shot. In terms of 24-hour volumes, the latter processed $46 billion worth of transactions during this period, while Lighter and Hyperliquid transacted $18 billion and $17 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, in the past 7 days, Aster’s volumes have surpassed the $100 billion mark, nearly doubling the amount processed through Hyperliquid. Competition in the perps market seems to be heating up. Aster has used incentives to lure traders and bring in higher volumes within its platform. Although some detractors within the community have questioned its strategy, the results seem to justify its approach as the protocol is now the leader of the derivatives market among DEXs with a 72% market share according to data from CoinMarketCap. Aster Price Prediction: Flipping Hyperliquid Would Mean a 350% Gain for $ASTER $ASTER has booked a 205% gain in the past 7 days. The token rose strongly and hit a peak at around $2.4. Looking at the 1-hour chart, the key area of support to watch after this recent pullback is the $1.75 level from which ASTER has bounced multiple times already. If this support bounce ignites a new leg up, Aster could aim at $4 next. Its market cap currently sits at $3 billion compared to Hyperliquid’s $13.8 billion. If the protocol manages to maintain its dominance in the perps market, we could see it catching up to its competitor, meaning an upside potential of around 350% at least. Rising stars like ASTER usually pop up during bull markets, and scooping up these tokens during their early presales could result in big gains. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) seems to be one of these hidden gems. This mine-to-earn (M2E) game offers attractive rewards and a fun environment that could soon attract thousands of players eager to climb the leaderboard. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Brings In $1.4M to Turn Meme Coin Investing into a Mining Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) isn’t just another Pepe clone. It is an interactive mine-to-earn (M2E) game that hands out attractive rewards as top miners climb the leaderboard. Players can build virtual mining nodes, buy as many rigs as they want, upgrade their setups, and collect rewards along the way. The more powerful your nodes are, the greater your earning potential, while top miners unlock bonus meme coin airdrops like $PEPE and $BONK. With over $1.4 million raised in under two months, $PEPENODE has already proven it can keep users engaged long before top exchanges pick it up. To buy $PEPENODE at its presale price, visit the official Pepenode website , and link a wallet like Best Wallet . You can choose to swap crypto like USDT or ETH, or use a bank card to invest.

The video game publisher launched College Football 26 in July, following last year’s edition’s success. College Football 25 became one of 2024’s best-selling releases. The first trailer for Battlefield 6 was also revealed, with plans for release in the current fiscal year. The release may receive a positive outlook as the company plans to transition the franchise following last year’s edition market flop. Electronic Arts ‘ games struggled financially in the first half of this year despite posting strong titles. The latest Q3, 2025 financial results release i n February showed that the company recorded a 6.4% drop in revenue year over year. The firm attributed the decline to weak sales of its FC 25 game and new Dragon Age title. It added that there have been uncertainties in the consumer spending section for its core games amid challenging markets. EA Sports had forecast Q2 results below Wall Street estimates, further driving down the investor confidence in its stock performance. Saudi PIF and Silver Lake among investors circling EA privatization deal To improve investor appetite for its stock, the video game publisher announced a $1 billion stock buyback plan as part of a $5 billion authorization. The buyback was expected to bring in at least $2.5 billion. According to Investgame r esearch , at least $21 billion has been directed into the gaming sector since 2018 by private equity firms and global wealth funds, with 68 deals recorded through that period. The research revealed that the inflows have been supported by the live service models and digital storefronts. In line with that trend, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake have been captured as interested parties in the deal to acquire EA Sports. Other mentions include Dell Technologies, Endeavour, and AMC Entertainment. Elsewhere, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, and Take-Two Interactive acquired Zynga in a $12.7 billion deal. Savvy Games Group purchased $4.9 billion of Scopely in the private equity section, while CVC invested $1.3 billion in Dream Games.

Related Reading: Institutional Investors Are Heavily Accumulating XRP And Solana – Here Are The Numbers Notably, the CME XRP futures crossed $1 billion in open interest (OI) last month, with the altcoin becoming the fastest-ever contract to do so, having hit the mark in just three months. Amid the demand for the altcoin on the derivatives exchange, CME has announced plans to launch options trading on the XRP futures on October 13. This is expected to further boost the demand on the CME exchange, which is a positive for the altcoin. This new milestone for XRP futures comes just ahead of the potential launch of XRP ETFs under the 33 Act, which will also elevate institutional interest in the altcoin. Fund issuers are expected to file amendments for their respective funds as soon as the end of this week. This comes amid the SEC’s approval of the generic listing standards, which could enable these XRP ETFs to launch earlier. If that doesn’t happen, the focus will shift to Grayscale’s October 18 deadline, which is the first final deadline among all seven XRP filings. The commission could approve these funds simultaneously, just as it did with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Massive Demand Expected For The ETFs It is worth mentioning that market expert Nate Geraci had previously alluded to the success of the CME XRP futures as one of the reasons he believes people are underestimating the demand the spot XRP ETFs may record. He also noted at the time that there was already over $800 million in futures-based XRP ETFs. Related Reading: XRP Goes Head-To-Head With Bitcoin In This Metric As South Korean Market Wakes Up In another X post, Geraci doubled down on his statement that people are “severely” underestimating the investor demand for the spot XRP ETFs. He noted how a similar thing happened with the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have so far exceeded expectations. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg also has high expectations for the XRP ETFs, predicting that they could record up to $5 billion in inflows in their first month. He also believes that they could outperform the Ethereum ETFs in the process. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $2.75, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

52310651,https://cryptonews.com/?p=429001,1758926100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52310651.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 26 September – XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-26-september-xrp-dogecoin-cardano/,"The market’s total cap has fallen by 2% in the past 24 hours, having serious implications for the crypto price prediction for XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano. All cryptocurrencies are now worth a combined total of $3.849 trillion, having stood at $4.2 trillion only a week ago. And some coins – such as Aster, Story and Avalanche – have suffered more than others, cancelling out the gains they had made in previous days. However, the ongoing selloff is likely to be positive in terms of the crypto price prediction for XRP, Dogecoin and Cardano, making a rebound increasingly likely. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Ripple Expansion and ETFs Point to New Record Highs Soon XRP has fallen to $2.76 today, confirming a 2.5% loss in 24 hours and a 10% decline in a fortnight. These are steep losses, yet XRP’s fundamental position hasn’t changed during the current downturn, which has been a market-wide phenomenon ( related partly to liquidations ). And this fundamental position is very strong, with Ripple continuing to expand as a cross-border payments business, and with XRP expecting a wave of ETF approvals very soon. Given these factors, XRP’s current chart is therefore very positive, since traders who buy now may be in for big gains over the coming weeks. Source: TradingView Its main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are now very close to bottoming out, while it’s also forming a bullish pennant, from which it could break out soon. This means that, as and when the SEC approves the waiting XRP ETFs, the coin’s price could rally vigorously. It has every chance of returning to $3 in October, while an end-of-year bull rally could see it smash its ATH and rise beyond $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETFs Injecting New Life into Long-Running Meme Token At $0.2267, Dogecoin is down by 3% in 24 hours and by 17% in the past week, although it does hold on to a 3.5% gain in a month. Despite the recent losses, DOGE is also in a very good position, not least because the first Dogecoin ETF – the Rex-Osprey DOGE fund – launched last week . And more Dogecoin ETFs are on the way, with Bloomberg analysts giving the waiting Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares DOGE ETFs a 90% chance of approval . This is extremely bullish, and it means that the Dogecoin price could surge in the event of the above ETFs gaining approval. Source: TradingView If we look at DOGE’s indicators, we see that they’re also moving towards bottoms, pulling the token towards a heavily discounted price that will eventually attract a new wave of buyers. Assuming that the ETFs do obtain the green light, then the coin could reach $0.30 in a matter of days, before climbing back towards its ATH of $0.7316 in the final month of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Layer-One Network Growth Lays Foundation for Big End-of-Year Gains As for ADA, it too has suffered a fall in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.7757 and also falling by 14% in a week. It is, however, still up by 95% in the past year, providing it with a good base from which to grow further towards the end of the year. And while it boasts only 1 ETF application, the fact that this application is from Grayscale gives it prospects for approval. Similarly, because ADA is a relatively small major token (volume at $1.9 billion), the launch of the Grayscale ADA ETF could send it flying. Source: TradingView Its indicators are all sitting in oversold areas, while it remains down by 75% in relation to its ATH of $3.09, meaning that it could grow rapidly once a serious rally starts. Based on this, the crypto price prediction for Cardano looks very good, with the alt on track to pass $1 in the next few weeks, and then close 2025 above $3. This is particularly the case when Cardano remains one of the biggest and most promising layer-one networks in crypto, with its platform under constant development and growth . PEPENODE Raises $1.45 Million in Fast-Paced Presale: Here’s Why Mine-to-Earn Token Could Be Big As good as the three coins above look, traders may want to diversify their portfolios in preparation for the coming end-of-year bull rally, since smaller tokens can outperform more established cryptos. Diversification may also include a smattering of presale coins, since the biggest and most popular of these can rally strongly once they list for the first time. Possibly the most interesting presale token available right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a mine-to-earn token that has now raised $1.45 million in its ICO. This Pepe will chase those Nodes wherever they may take him. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/p2owUBP3kJ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 25, 2025 This is an encouraging figure, especially since its sale opened only a few weeks ago, and it suggests that PEPENODE could become very big once it launches. As a mine-to-earn token, it provides holders with the ability to grow their own virtual mining rigs, which they can use to earn rewards in major tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin. They can grow their rigs by buying additional nodes using PEPENODE, meaning that the coin could experience lots of demand as users make their rigs bigger. Holders can also stake PEPENODE for big staking returns, with the current yield at just above 900%. This is very attractive, and it could mean that demand for the coin will be massive. Investors can get ahead of the curve by joining the token’s presale, which they can do by going to the PEPENODE website . PEPENODE is currently selling at $0.0010745, although this price will continue to rise as the sale progresses.

The company is testing whether its core messaging system, the mechanism that allows more than 11,000 banks to securely talk to each other, could one day run on-chain. The experiment, reported by Grégory Raymond of The Big Whale on X , brings heavyweight partners to the table. BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and several global banks are already involved. For now, it’s still early days as the pilot will reportedly take months before results surface. But one banker close to the project described it as “an important technological transformation for the international interbank payments industry.” Why is Swift considering Linea? Swift’s current system is well-trusted but also criticized by those who claim that it’s expensive, often slow, and heavily reliant on intermediaries. In an era where money and assets are going digital, that centralization is starting to look like a weakness. The fast settlement that’s seen in decentralized transactions has led to people calling for increased usage of blockchain technology. Enter Linea, an Ethereum layer-2 network built by Consensys, the same team behind MetaMask . The appeal lies in its ability to keep data private through advanced cryptography, a must-have for institutions bound by strict regulations. The choice also ties in with Swift’s long-term digital asset push. Last year, it announced trials for central bank digital currencies and tokenized assets. Now, by bringing Linea into the mix, Swift seems willing to test whether blockchain can overhaul its very core: the messaging rails themselves. Why banks are paying attention For big names like BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, this is more than tinkering with new tech. If blockchain-based messaging works, it could merge communications and settlement into a single, seamless layer. That means lower costs and fewer delays. It also helps them keep pace with challengers like Ripple , which has long argued its blockchain system can outdo Swift’s legacy model. But change won’t be easy. Integrating blockchain into existing systems will require time, investment and regulatory patience. Questions remain around how such a system would perform at the scale Swift operates, and whether regulators across the US, EU and Asia would be comfortable with it. Swift has always moved carefully. Over the past few years, it has tested APIs, dabbled with AI to fight fraud, and explored tokenized asset transfers. Partnering with Linea fits this pattern: try a controlled, private environment before scaling anything to the public. If the pilot succeeds, it could become one of the largest real-world blockchain deployments yet. It would also send a strong signal to the rest of the financial industry that blockchain isn’t just for niche use cases anymore — it’s ready to power the systems that move trillions of dollars every day.

A Malaysian trade ministry official told reporters Friday that the country wants zero tariffs on furniture, car parts, and airplane components it ships to America. The official also said Washington has agreed to look at removing tariffs on items the US doesn’t make itself, like cocoa and palm oil. A final decision on these products should come next month. This request comes as Trump announced Thursday he’s putting hefty new tariffs on various imported goods. Kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities from overseas will face a 50% tax, while imported couches, chairs, and other padded furniture will get hit with a 30% tariff. The two countries are trying to wrap up a tariff deal after the US slapped a 19% tax on Malaysian goods back in August. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim wrote on Facebook Thursday that both sides want to finish an agreement before Trump visits Kuala Lumpur in October for a meeting with Southeast Asian leaders. Trump’s latest tariff announcement covers a wide range of products The president said he’s putting a 100% tariff on brand-name medicines and a 25% tax on big trucks coming into the country. He claims these steps will protect American factories and keep the nation safe. These new trade barriers add to the many tariffs Trump has already put in place, some reaching as high as 50% on certain goods. The president has also targeted steel imports and other products from various trading partners. Companies around the world are already dealing with messed-up supply chains, rising costs, and worried customers because of the ongoing trade fights. The Federal Reserve has said these tariffs are also pushing up prices for American shoppers. Financial experts say Trump is now using more traditional legal methods for his trade actions. This shift comes as the Supreme Court is looking at whether his global tariffs are legal in the first place. The new tariff announcements end a quieter period that started when Trump made trade deals with some important partners over the summer. During the spring, Trump was announcing new import taxes almost every week, which made businesses nervous about planning ahead. Tom Barkin from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond told Bloomberg TV that new tariff announcements in specific industries definitely cause setbacks. He noted that some sectors have more clarity about trade rules while others are still uncertain. Stock markets in Asia dropped Friday, with drug companies taking the biggest hits. European markets bounced back from early losses as investors tried to figure out how widely the new tariffs might apply. American stock futures showed mixed results, suggesting investors aren’t too worried about Trump’s latest trade moves, according to BMO Economics. The firm said investors seem willing to stay calm as long as the US economy doesn’t show more serious damage from the trade war. Trump’s announcement on his social media platform didn’t explain whether these new tariffs would be added to existing ones. Recent trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and Britain include rules that limit how high tariffs can go on specific products like medicines. The EU and US made a preliminary deal that would cap tariffs at 15%, though Trump hasn’t signed an official order yet. The European Commission said Friday the agreement clearly sets a 15% ceiling on all tariffs. Claudio Feltrin, who leads Italy’s furniture industry group, worried the tariffs could cause a rush of imports from China and other countries looking for new markets to sell their goods. Japan has a deal ensuring its tariff rates won’t be higher than what the EU and other partners pay, according to Tokyo’s trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa.

After reaching a new all-time high of around $4,950 on August 24, ETH has now shed more than 22% of its value, slipping below the psychological $4,000 level. The steep pullback has left many investors in difficult positions, with some of the largest players in the market also feeling the impact. According to top analyst Maartunn, even BitMine, one of the largest institutional holders of Ethereum, has seen its ETH position dip below its on-chain cost basis. This marks a critical moment, as whales typically act as stabilizers during corrections, and their unrealized losses reflect the depth of current market stress. Despite this downturn, some analysts argue that Ethereum’s retracement may represent a healthy reset after weeks of overheated momentum. Corrections of this scale are not unusual following parabolic rallies and often serve to shake out excess leverage before setting up for longer-term stability. Still, with sentiment fragile and selling pressure mounting, the coming days will be pivotal for ETH as it tests key support levels and investors closely monitor whale behavior for signs of renewed confidence. BitMine’s ETH Play Falls Below Cost Basis According to top analyst Maartunn, Ethereum’s correction has placed one of the market’s largest institutional holders under heavy pressure. BitMine’s ETH portfolio , valued at roughly $7.5 billion, has just dipped below its on-chain cost basis around the $4,000 level. This development underscores the severity of the recent downturn and highlights that even large-scale players are not immune to the pain of corrections. Maartunn emphasizes that this stage of the market is less about timing the perfect entry or exit and more about endurance. As he put it, “It’s about who can hold their breath the longest.” The remark reflects a broader sentiment among analysts who view the current environment as a psychological test for both retail and institutional investors. With volatility high and sentiment deteriorating, the ability to withstand drawdowns may determine who ultimately benefits from the next phase of Ethereum’s cycle. The outlook remains divided. Optimists argue that this is a necessary pullback before Ethereum gears up for a massive leg higher, supported by growing institutional adoption and strong long-term fundamentals. On the other hand, cautious voices warn of a deeper correction, noting that breaking below critical support levels could trigger further downside. The coming weeks will likely prove decisive. If ETH can stabilize above the $3,800–$4,000 range, confidence may return quickly. However, if selling pressure intensifies, the market could face an extended period of uncertainty before momentum rebuilds. Bulls Struggle To Find Support Ethereum (ETH) has broken below the critical $4,000 level, now trading around $3,891, as shown on the 12-hour chart. This decline marks a continuation of the bearish trend that started after the September peak near $4,950. The breakdown has been accompanied by rising trading volume, confirming strong selling pressure and suggesting that bears currently dominate the market. The 50-day EMA has crossed below the $4,400 zone, reinforcing near-term weakness, while the 200-day EMA around $3,650 now acts as the next major support level. The price action shows a decisive rejection from the $4,600–$4,800 resistance range earlier this month, followed by a steep selloff that erased more than 20% of ETH’s value. If ETH holds above the $3,850–$3,900 zone, it could attempt a rebound and retest the $4,200 resistance. However, failure to defend this range risks further downside toward $3,650–$3,700, where the 200-day EMA and previous accumulation levels converge. Ethereum is in a corrective phase, but the volume spike suggests potential exhaustion of sellers. The coming sessions will determine whether bulls can reclaim $4,000 to stabilize momentum or if further capitulation is ahead.

However, the company now faces the challenge of making CEO Sam Altman’s expensive plans work in reality. The company behind ChatGPT rolled out a series of partnerships this week that involve enormous amounts of money and put OpenAI at the heart of the next generation of machine learning systems. The announcements started Monday when Nvidia said it would put up to $100 billion toward helping OpenAI create data center space filled with millions of graphics processing units. The next day, OpenAI shared details about a bigger agreement with Oracle and SoftBank, expanding what they call the “Stargate” project into a $400 billion promise spread across several stages and locations. On Thursday, OpenAI added a business partnership with Databricks, showing the company wants to reach more corporate customers. The company, best known for its ChatGPT chat program and GPT language models, wants to become much more than that. OpenAI hopes to join the ranks of major cloud computing companies, even though it spends billions of dollars and depends completely on money from investors to keep growing. The company’s building plans would need enough electricity to power more than 13 million American homes. Altman has said for a long time that creating the next level of AI technology will need much more computer infrastructure than what exists now. OpenAI says it’s simply meeting customer demand, which keeps growing. The company believes these investments will eventually make money. Inside sources say OpenAI expects to bring in $125 billion in revenue by 2029, based on the company’s own predictions. Major infrastructure challenges ahead But this strategy comes with big risks when it comes to actually building everything. Creating 17 gigawatts of power capacity would need about 17 nuclear power plants, and each one takes at least ten years to build. OpenAI representatives say they’re talking with hundreds of infrastructure companies across North America, but nothing is set in stone yet. The American power grid already has problems, gas turbines are sold out until 2028, nuclear power takes a long time to set up, and renewable energy projects face political obstacles. “I am extremely bullish about nuclear, advanced fission, fusion,” Altman said. “We should build more … a lot more of the current generation of fission plants, given the needs for dense, dense energy.” This week made clear just how big Altman’s plans really are, as the OpenAI CEO started putting specific numbers on his ideas, some of them huge. Industry experts back bold strategy “Unlike previous technological revolutions or previous versions of the internet, there’s so much infrastructure that’s required, and this is a small sample of it,” Altman said Tuesday at OpenAI’s first Stargate location in Abilene, Texas. This approach – direct, ambitious, and ignoring traditional thinking – has marked how Altman leads during this new period. Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, said OpenAI’s infrastructure partnerships with Oracle might look extreme to some people, but he sees it differently. “I don’t see this as crazy. I see it as existential for the race to superintelligence,” he said. Das explained that data and computing power are the two most important things for making AI bigger, and he praised Altman for understanding early how much infrastructure would be needed. “One of his gifts is reading the exponential and planning for it,” he added. Past breakthroughs in AI haven’t come from better computer programs, he said, but from having access to massive computing power. That’s why companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are all trying to build bigger systems. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

SHIB’s deflationary model relies on regular burns, where tokens are permanently removed from circulation using transaction fees collected from trades. While 7 million tokens may seem small compared to the massive 589.55 trillion total supply, every burn event helps ease selling pressure and reinforces long-term scarcity. In the past 7 days, SHIB has booked a 10.7% loss as cryptocurrencies as a whole have retreated following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates by 25 basis points last week. Other assets in the meme coin category, like Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Pepe ($PEPE), have booked higher losses of 17% each. This indicates an ongoing correction that will probably bring late buyers to this bull market. Trading volumes have jumped by 41% in the past 24 hours. If transaction volumes keep rising, this could lead to a higher burn rate that could further reduce the number of tokens in circulation. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Breaks Below Key Support – When Will It Recover? This week’s selling spree has pushed SHIB to break its trend line support. As a result, the token could now be heading to retest the $0.000010 level before it begins to recover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved below the 14-day moving average in the daily chart. This is usually interpreted as a sell signal. Once SHIB hits that psychological threshold, we could expect an explosive move as market conditions still favor a bullish outlook for cryptos as a whole. As altcoin season kicks off, meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) should outperform well-established tokens like BTC and ETH. However, hidden gems like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could deliver higher returns as this early crypto presale is still flying below the market’s radar. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings High-Leverage Trading to the Meme World Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme coin that embraces the typical hype that comes with bull markets. Instead of offering traditional utility, $MAXI doubles down on culture. Holders get an entry ticket to Community Alpha , an idea hub where retail traders can share insights and compare strategies. The token also fuels weekly competitions and themed challenges (like Max Gains and Max Ripped), where top ROI hunters can earn rewards and climb the leaderboard. In addition, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds to the most promising tokens of this cycle with 1000X leverage to max out results. As its powerful community-centered ideas gain popularity, the demand for this meme coin should skyrocket. To buy $MAXI, simply head to the Maxi Doge website and link an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-could-be-set-to-dominate-the-market-heres-why/,"A market analyst has highlighted a technical structure suggesting that XRP’s market dominance could climb to its highest level in six years, a move that may translate into notable price gains if confirmed. Over the past weeks, the broader cryptocurrency market has faced sustained selling pressure, and XRP has mirrored the downtrend. After peaking at $3.187 on September 13, the asset fell below the $3 level on September 21 and has since struggled to regain bullish momentum. Despite this weakness, analyst KriptoMessi argues that historical patterns on the dominance chart point to a potential turnaround. Xrp Dominance Daily Fractal pic.twitter.com/o4a5GlO18z — Kripto Messi (@Kriptomessi) September 24, 2025 Technical Structure Behind the Forecast KriptoMessi notes that XRP’s dominance is currently mirroring a technical pattern that has occurred twice earlier this year. The structure is described as a four-step fractal around a descending trendline. Each cycle has followed a similar sequence: a local high, a decline, a retest of the trendline, and the establishment of a base before a breakout. The first cycle unfolded between March and July. Dominance peaked at 5.35% in mid-March before declining through April and May. After a rebound to 4.63% in May and another rejection, dominance reached a low near 4.04% by late June. A subsequent breakout in early July pushed dominance to 5.53% by July 18, coinciding with XRP’s rally to $3.60. A second cycle emerged in July and August. The 5.53% level in mid-July marked the starting point, followed by another downward stretch. In early August, dominance recovered to 5.17% but failed to break higher. A third retest occurred on September 13 at 4.69%, before dominance slipped again and stabilized around 4.54%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for a Third Breakout KriptoMessi suggests that the latest consolidation could set the stage for another breakout similar to the earlier cycles. If the pattern continues, dominance could rise sharply, potentially reaching 6.19%. This level has not been recorded since 2018 and would represent the strongest expansion of XRP’s market share in years. As of now, the cryptocurrency market’s total capitalization stands at $3.78 trillion, with XRP valued at approximately $170.51 billion. This gives the asset a 4.51% share of the total market. If XRP’s dominance increases to 6.19%, its market cap would rise to approximately $234 billion, potentially driving the price to $3.91. If the wider market also recovers to its August peak of $4.17 trillion, XRP’s market cap could climb even higher to $258 billion. Under such conditions, XRP would be valued at roughly $4.32, marking a new record high. While XRP has recently struggled to maintain upward momentum, technical indicators suggest its dominance could be on the verge of a major shift. If the projected breakout materializes, it could support a meaningful recovery in price, particularly if accompanied by a broader market rebound.

Many investors are feeling the pinch as altcoin prices have seen significant dips recently. However, a fascinating new analysis suggests a turning point might be on the horizon, especially for those holding or looking to acquire altcoins oversold in the current climate. What Does ‘Altcoins Oversold’ Really Mean? The term altcoins oversold refers to a technical analysis condition where the price of an asset has fallen significantly, often below its intrinsic value or recent trading range. This typically indicates that selling pressure has been exhaustive, and a reversal or bounce in price could be imminent. It’s a key indicator many traders look for. According to Negentropic, the X account of Glassnode co-founders Yann Happel and Jan Allemann, altcoins have indeed entered an oversold phase. Their analysis points to an unwinding of excessive leverage in the market, which has contributed to the recent price declines. Think of it as the market shedding its extra weight, preparing for a healthier ascent. Excessive Leverage Unwinds: High leverage can amplify both gains and losses. When prices drop, leveraged positions get liquidated, leading to further selling pressure. This unwinding is often a precursor to market stabilization. Price Correction: This period often follows a rapid run-up, bringing prices back to more sustainable levels. Why Are Altcoins in an Accumulation Zone? Following an oversold phase, assets often enter what analysts call an “accumulation zone.” This is a period where savvy investors and institutions begin to buy up assets, anticipating a future price increase. It’s like collecting valuable items at a discount before their true worth is recognized by the broader market. Negentropic’s insights suggest that many altcoins oversold are now sitting in this crucial accumulation zone. Historically, such periods of consolidation precede an uptrend. It’s not an instant rebound, but rather a gradual build-up of buying interest and demand. This phase is characterized by: Reduced Volatility: Prices tend to stabilize, moving sideways rather than experiencing sharp drops. Increased Buying Interest: Long-term holders and institutional players see these lower prices as attractive entry points. Foundation Building: A strong base is formed, which can support future price growth. Understanding this cycle is vital for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the volatile crypto space. It requires patience and a strategic approach, rather than reacting to short-term market noise. Navigating the Market: Opportunities and Risks for Altcoins While the notion of altcoins oversold entering an accumulation zone sounds promising, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. This period presents both significant opportunities and inherent risks that investors must consider. Potential Opportunities: Bargain Prices: For long-term investors, buying quality altcoins at depressed prices can lead to substantial returns if the anticipated uptrend materializes. Diversification: This could be an opportune time to diversify your portfolio with promising projects that have been unfairly punished by broader market sentiment. Future Growth: Many innovative altcoin projects continue to build and develop, irrespective of short-term price movements. An accumulation phase allows investors to position themselves for their long-term success. Inherent Risks: Further Downside: While oversold, there’s no guarantee prices won’t drop further. Market sentiment can shift unexpectedly, and external factors can impact crypto values. Prolonged Consolidation: The “period of consolidation” mentioned by Negentropic could be longer than anticipated, testing investors’ patience. Project Viability: Not all altcoins will recover. It’s essential to conduct thorough research into the fundamentals of each project you consider. To mitigate risks, consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), where you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This can smooth out your average purchase price over time. Always remember to do your own research (DYOR) and never invest more than you can afford to lose. What’s Next for the Altcoin Market? The analysis by Negentropic suggests that after this period of consolidation, we can expect altcoins to begin an uptrend. This doesn’t mean a straight shot upwards; markets move in waves. However, the foundational work of deleveraging and accumulation sets the stage for potential positive price action. It’s a time for strategic thinking rather than impulsive trading. Keep an eye on on-chain data, market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors. The crypto market is dynamic, and while technical indicators provide valuable insights, they are just one piece of the puzzle. In conclusion, the current state of altcoins oversold presents a compelling narrative for those willing to look beyond the immediate price charts. The insights from Glassnode co-founders highlight a potential shift from capitulation to cautious optimism, paving the way for future growth. Patience, research, and a clear strategy will be your best allies in navigating this exciting phase of the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “oversold” mean in cryptocurrency trading? A1: “Oversold” is a technical indicator suggesting that an asset’s price has fallen significantly, often implying that selling pressure is exhausted and a price reversal or bounce may be near. It doesn’t guarantee a bounce but signals a potential shift. Q2: How is “excessive leverage unwinding” related to altcoins being oversold? A2: Excessive leverage unwinding means that many traders who used borrowed funds to amplify their positions are being forced to sell as prices drop, leading to liquidations. This intensifies selling pressure, driving prices down further, often into oversold territory. Once this unwinding is complete, the market can stabilize. Q3: What is an “accumulation zone” and why is it important for altcoins? A3: An “accumulation zone” is a period after an asset has been oversold, where smart money and long-term investors begin buying, anticipating future price appreciation. It’s important for altcoins because it suggests a potential bottoming process and the building of a strong foundation before a new uptrend begins. Q4: How long does the consolidation period typically last after altcoins are oversold? A4: The duration of a consolidation period can vary widely, from weeks to several months, depending on market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and specific altcoin fundamentals. There’s no fixed timeline, and patience is key during this phase. Q5: What should investors do when altcoins are in an accumulation zone? A5: Investors might consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to buy gradually, conduct thorough research (DYOR) on specific projects, and maintain a long-term perspective. It’s also wise to manage risk by not over-allocating to any single asset and only investing what you can afford to lose.

The global digital assets market surged marginally over the last 24 hours to hover around $3.78 trillion. Bitcoin pushed back over $110,000 while Ether managed to regain $4,000 mark. While the market posted a minor recovery rally, the Fear and Greed depicted among the investors. CoinGlass data shows that more than 133k traders were liquidated over the last 24 hours. The total liquidations turned up around $329 million. The largest single liquidation order of BTC/USDT valued at $3.87 million happened on Binance. $329M wiped out as crypto rebounds Data shows that $186 million worth of liquidated bets (56%) turned out to be long positions. However, Short bets amounted to $143 million. This shows that the crypto market is witnessing heavy fluctuations with pumps and dumps. Cryptopolitan reported that Thursday witnessed $1.1 billion liquidation washout. The recovery coincided with fresh inflation data that matched forecasts. The Fed’s preferred gauge, PCE, rose 2.7% in August, while the core measure was up 2.9%. The numbers were hardly surprising, but they reinforced the sense that price pressures are easing. Analysts suggest that if inflation trends lower, risk assets may find support, but any upside surprises could quickly reset rate cut expectations. Ethereum led the altcoins’ recovery by rising nearly 4%. ETH is down by 18% from its all-time high of above $4,900. Solana and Dogecoin added marginal gains. After a great run, SOL is trailing by 15% in the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $203 at the press time. However, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token was the lone standout in the top tier. It is up by more than 7% and bucking the sea of red. HYPE price is now up by 86% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. It is trading at an average price of $44.64 at the press time. Crypto fear hits 5-month low The Fear and Greed Index dropped to its lowest since April to hit 28 points on the chart. This signals “fear” across the market. Analysts pointed to heavy stress among short-term holders as Bitcoin traded under their cost basis of $109,700 for the first time in five months. Fear and Greed index, Source: CoinMarketCap BTC price has been running down by 6% over the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $109,601 at the press time. The 24-hour trading dipped by 18% to stand at $60.92 billion. Some see a silver lining in the cleanout. Analyst Maartunn, in a post, mentioned that roughly $12 billion in leveraged altcoin bets and $3 billion in speculative Bitcoin positions have been flushed. Stocks and commodities painted a calmer picture as the S&P 500 gained 0.22% and gold edged higher. But a new wrinkle looms with Donald Trump’s latest tariff package set to take effect on October 1.

The scheme promised profits under the guidance of a person called “Coach Wendy,” whose identity is still unknown. The couple lured investors through real estate connections Michael and Amanda Griffis were real estate agents from Clarksville. They operated a pool called “Blessings of God Thru Crypto” between 2021 and 2023. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said the couple raised more than $6.5 million from around 145 investors. The couple first came under investigation in July 2023, when the CFTC filed a case against them. On Thursday, a US court in Tennessee entered a consent order that resolves the enforcement action. The order requires the fraudsters to pay $5.5 million in restitution to victims. They must also pay a civil monetary penalty of $1.35 million. This makes the total penalty equivalent to $6.8 million. The order further imposes lifetime bans on the couple from commodity trading and CFTC registration. According to court findings, the Griffises used their real estate connections to attract investors. They told clients and acquaintances that funds would be traded in crypto futures through the Apex Trading Platform. They said trades would be supervised by an individual called “Coach Wendy.” The trading commission clarified that Apex was not a legitimate trading platform. It was modeled on an overseas exchange that had no local registration in America . Investigators said they have not been able to find the true identity of “Coach Wendy.” More than $4 million from the scheme was sent overseas after being deposited into the fake website. The couple used the rest of the money to pay personal debts and for shopping. The CFTC said around $855,000 was paid to the investors. Those payments were structured in a Ponzi-like fashion, where earlier investors were repaid using funds from newer investors. CFTC warns the public about crypto fraud The CFTC said the case indicates a wider problem of fraudsters using community trust to run Ponzi schemes. The agency pointed to a Denver pastor and his wife who were recently ordered to repay $3.39 million after raising millions for worthless church tokens. In another case, a Long Island man was hit with a $228 million CFTC judgment. A separate operator received a nine-year prison sentence for a Ponzi scheme that targeted members of a Haitian church community. Experts said investors in the Tennessee duo case may have ignored red flags, such as a website without any registered company details. Fraudsters often look for quick money and plan to exit before being caught. In crypto markets , funds can move across borders quickly, which makes recovery difficult. CFTC officials also warned the public about engaging with unverified investment platforms. Charles Marvine, CFTC chief, said, “If an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is, for you and anyone you bring along.” Get seen where it counts.

He labeled Monaco an “enemy of U.S. national security,” citing her previous roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, including her most recent position as Deputy Attorney General. Trump strongly objected to Monaco’s access to sensitive information, especially in light of Microsoft’s many contracts with multiple U.S. government agencies. He raised the potential that her position at the company might threaten national security. Trump said prior federal law enforcement and her new corporate role posed potential conflicts of interest in connection with classified or sensitive government information, which Monaco was charged with securing, he argued. The demand that she be fired comes during increased political scrutiny on former government officials taking senior roles at private tech firms with government connections. Trump’s comments were announced on his social media platform, Truth Social, which has thousands of followers and will further raise his demand. Trump accuses Monaco of misconduct In his post, Trump made serious accusations about Lisa Monaco, suggesting her conduct in former government posts led to removing her security clearances. He also claimed that Monaco had been kept from federal properties, measures he described as a response to “unjust acts.” Trump also accused Monaco of using an “autopen”, a mechanical device capable of duplicating a signature, to forge President Biden’s name on official government papers. He portrayed this charge as part of what he said was a larger pattern of malfeasance, arguing that her conduct in the past creates fear around trust and federal protocols, and questioning whether such conduct indicates her trustworthiness. Trump has accused Monaco’s corporate appointment of being a national security risk, claiming that her purported history of misconduct should disqualify her for access to sensitive government information. Microsoft declines to comment on Monaco allegations There has been no public response from Microsoft to President Trump’s demands to fire Lisa Monaco. The videos have garnered widespread attention, but Microsoft has not commented on the situation. Monaco, who joined the tech giant in May 2025 as President of Global Affairs, has yet to release any statement on the allegations. Despite the backlash, Microsoft continues collaborating with the U.S. government on other fronts, such as through an ongoing partnership with the Department of Defense and other federal departments . The company recently won huge contracts for cloud services, proving it remains an essential government technology provider. These contracts grant Microsoft broad access to sensitive federal systems, and that context helps frame the national security concerns fueled by Trump. Industry analysts said in an e-mail that Microsoft is fairly open about being used by the government and people in power, and that the company is therefore sensitive to how its leaders behave. They noted that Microsoft often balances providing leadership and responding to public and political criticism. The analysts added that the company’s response, or lack thereof, could influence how government clients and outsiders perceive its management. Unclear at this point whether Microsoft will succumb to Trump’s demand or do anything about Monaco. The circumstances illustrate the increasing public spotlight on former government officials and their entry into prominent roles in private-sector companies with ties to the government.

A significant event has just unfolded that could reshape perceptions for a prominent project. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has successfully executed a substantial WLFI token burn , a strategic move aimed at enhancing the value and scarcity of its native token. What’s Behind the Massive WLFI Token Burn? The World Liberty Financial (WLFI) Foundation, a DeFi project with notable leadership, recently announced on X the successful completion of a major token burn initiative. This strategic move saw a total of 6,923,416 WLFI tokens permanently removed from circulation, demonstrating a strong commitment to their tokenomics. The burn was executed in two distinct phases: Protocol Fee Burn: 3,109,320 WLFI tokens were burned, generated directly from Ethereum and BSC protocol fees. This mechanism ensures that a portion of the network’s activity directly contributes to reducing token supply. Open Market Buyback and Burn: An additional 3,814,095 WLFI tokens were bought back from the open market. This buyback utilized USD1, USDC, and USDT stablecoins, conducted at an average price of approximately $0.2093 per token. This direct market intervention reflects the foundation’s proactive approach to managing token supply. This combined effort brings the total number of tokens burned to over 6.92 million WLFI, following the foundation’s earlier commitment to initiate this buyback and burn program this week. Such initiatives are crucial for long-term project health and investor confidence. Why is a Token Burn Important for WLFI’s Future? Understanding the impact of a WLFI token burn requires a look into fundamental economic principles. When tokens are burned, they are permanently removed from the circulating supply. This reduction in supply, assuming consistent or growing demand, can lead to increased scarcity. Increased scarcity often translates into a higher perceived value for the remaining tokens, potentially benefiting holders. For World Liberty Financial, this action signals several key intentions: Value Enhancement: By reducing the total supply, the foundation aims to bolster the value proposition of each remaining WLFI token. Deflationary Mechanism: Regular token burns introduce a deflationary aspect to the tokenomics, which can be attractive to investors seeking assets with controlled supply. Investor Confidence: Proactive measures like buybacks and burns demonstrate a project’s commitment to its token holders and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. It shows that the team is actively working to create value. This commitment to managing token supply is a critical factor for any DeFi project striving for stability and growth in a dynamic market. How Does This Strategic WLFI Token Burn Impact the Ecosystem? The recent WLFI token burn by World Liberty Financial has immediate and long-term implications for its entire ecosystem. For participants within the Ethereum and BSC protocols, the fee burn mechanism means that network activity directly contributes to the token’s scarcity, aligning user engagement with token value. Moreover, the open market buyback injects demand directly into the market, which can help stabilize or even appreciate the token’s price in the short term. Beyond immediate price action, this initiative fosters a sense of transparency and accountability. The foundation’s announcement on X, detailing the specific amounts and sources of the burn, builds trust within the community. It reinforces the idea that the project is managed with clear objectives and a focus on sustainable growth. As a result, the WLFI ecosystem becomes more robust, attracting new users and investors who are looking for projects with strong fundamentals and transparent operations. Looking Ahead: The Future of World Liberty Financial Post-Burn The successful execution of this significant WLFI token burn marks a pivotal moment for World Liberty Financial. It underscores a clear strategy to manage token supply and enhance long-term value. This action is not merely a one-off event but rather an indicator of a well-thought-out tokenomics model designed to support the project’s growth and stability in the competitive DeFi landscape. Investors and community members will likely watch closely for future buyback and burn announcements, as these programs often become a recurring feature in projects committed to deflationary models. The foundation’s ongoing efforts to create a sustainable and valuable ecosystem through such strategic financial maneuvers will be key to its continued success and influence in the decentralized finance sector. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s recent burn of over 6.92 million WLFI tokens is a powerful statement. It highlights a strategic commitment to enhancing token scarcity, bolstering investor confidence, and fostering a robust DeFi ecosystem. This significant WLFI token burn serves as a clear indicator of the project’s dedication to long-term value creation and transparent financial management. Frequently Asked Questions About the WLFI Token Burn What is a token burn in cryptocurrency?

This action reduces the total supply of tokens, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially enhance the value of the remaining tokens. Why did World Liberty Financial conduct a WLFI token burn? World Liberty Financial conducted the WLFI token burn primarily to reduce the total supply of WLFI tokens. This strategic move aims to increase scarcity, potentially boost the token’s value, and demonstrate the foundation’s commitment to long-term sustainability and investor confidence. How many WLFI tokens were burned in this initiative? A total of 6,923,416 WLFI tokens were burned. This includes tokens generated from Ethereum and BSC protocol fees, as well as tokens bought back from the open market. What was the average price at which WLFI tokens were bought back?

In a year marked by $2.7 billion in stolen funds , cross-chain bridge breaches, and AI-driven scams, the debate over the best wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP has never been louder. Hardware wallets remain the traditional champion of safety, but software and MPC-based wallets are advancing fast, reshaping how investors think about custody. Yet while the community wrestles with these questions, another narrative brews at the edges of the conversation. Alongside institutional-grade security, retail investors are talking about new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE —an early upstage token being added to watchlists as a speculative wildcard. It’s a reminder that in crypto, debates about safety always run in parallel with the hunt for growth. The Case for Hardware Wallets: Offline, Tested, and Trusted Advocates of hardware wallets argue their case is airtight: keep your private keys offline, and attackers lose their entry point. Devices like the Ledger Nano S Plus and the Trezor Model T remain industry benchmarks, supporting Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and thousands of other tokens. Their security comes not from fancy features, but from their very isolation from the internet. Supporters point to a spotless record: despite the chaos of 2025’s hacks, neither Ledger nor Trezor has been directly implicated in a major theft. Add backup features and compatibility with popular software wallets, and hardware wallets continue to be the gold standard for long-term storage. For those who treat crypto like digital gold, the debate seems already settled. The Counterargument: Software and MPC Wallets Catching Up But others argue the old orthodoxy is outdated. Why limit yourself to hardware when software wallets like MetaMask , Coinbase Wallet , Trust Wallet , and Bitget Wallet combine accessibility with security innovations? MetaMask, with its 100 million+ users , remains the gateway to Ethereum, DeFi, and NFTs, pairing easily with hardware for layered protection. Coinbase Wallet offers custody across multiple chains with the backing of institutional audits —a feature hardware loyalists can’t replicate. Trust Wallet ’s open-source transparency and Bitget Wallet ’s multi-party computation (MPC) model offer an extra layer of comfort in a world where even centralized giants like Crypto.com have suffered breaches. Critics of hardware-only approaches argue that for everyday crypto use—staking, trading, gaming, or DeFi—hardware is simply too rigid. Instead, the future lies in hybrid custody models : blending offline security with online accessibility. Real-World Incidents Fueling the Debate The debate isn’t theoretical. This year alone, attacks like the UXLINK hack ($11M lost due to multisig flaws) and the SFUND bridge exploit (linked to DPRK hackers) underline the vulnerability of hot wallets and centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, AI-driven phishing scams have stolen over $3 billion in H1 2025 , with deepfakes and impersonation bots fooling even seasoned traders. These stories strengthen both sides of the argument. Hardware advocates point to them as proof you must go offline. Software supporters counter that with layered protection (MPC, audits, protection funds) , wallets can adapt faster to new threats than hardware locked in static firmware. NAV, Yield, and Long-Term Custody vs. Daily Use A secondary debate arises when wallets are compared through the lens of functionality vs. safety . Long-term holders favor devices like Ledger and Trezor for cold storage, but active participants in Ethereum staking, XRP liquidity pools, or Bitcoin DeFi often need faster, integrated access. That’s where wallets like Exodus (with local encryption and staking support) or Trust Wallet shine. Experts now recommend a layered strategy: Hardware wallets for large, long-term savings. Audited software or MPC wallets for active participation. Strict key management with offline backups. It’s not a matter of either/or—it’s about balancing risk with usability. A Wildcard in the Debate: MAGACOIN FINANCE Amid this fiery discussion, something unexpected is happening. While crypto veterans weigh the merits of hardware versus software, retail traders are buzzing about MAGACOIN FINANCE . Not because it’s a wallet, but because it represents the other half of crypto’s eternal paradox: safety vs. speculation. As the debate rages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being quietly added to investor watchlists as a high-upside token. And importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already been audited , giving early adopters added confidence in its tokenomics and smart contract integrity. Analysts suggest its growth profile is unlike anything offered by the custodial models debated today. If hardware wallets represent the vault, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the wild lottery ticket investors can’t resist carrying in their pocket. Conclusion: Two Sides of the Same Coin The crypto security debate of 2025 is unlikely to crown a single winner. Hardware wallets still dominate long-term custody, while software and MPC wallets are catching up fast with usability and institutional-grade safeguards. The takeaway for investors is clear: layer your defenses . Hardware for safety, software for access, vigilance everywhere. Yet crypto has always thrived on paradox. As security experts fight to keep assets safe, traders continue to chase speculative edge. MAGACOIN FINANCE captures that tension perfectly—it doesn’t solve the wallet debate, but it shows how the hunger for growth runs alongside the obsession with safety. In 2025, the best portfolios may not just include the best wallets—they may also leave room for the bold bets that keep crypto’s story alive.

This portability transforms BTC from just a digital gold narrative into a living, breathing monetary network that gold can never match. According to mhar_leeck’s perspective on X, the true evolution of BTC lies in its capacity as a platform for innovation, to move, evolve, and even teach. Unlike gold, which stays locked away, this narrative confines the asset to a passive role. The Build on Bitcoin (BOB) layer 2 solution is presented as the crucial technology that enables this shift. Build On Bitcoin Powering The Narrative Furthermore, by creating a new, more expressive layer on top of BTC, BOB turns the theory of a programmable BTC into a practical reality. This combination is often referred to as a hybrid L2, which allows builders to transition from simply reading about decentralized finance (DeFi) to experimenting, testing, and creating in real-time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Rival Gold In Central Bank Vaults By 2030: Deutsche Bank The unlocking of BTC’s liquidity extends beyond its use in high-throughput applications. It is about unlocking a space for true innovation, where every project sparks, and momentum keeps building. Mhar_leeck noted that the most exciting next chapter for BTC is not about simply holding the asset, but about actively building on it. Crypto Sinan has also stated that he has been in BOB for a while now, and the ride has been nothing short of exciting. The promise of BTC actually working across DeFi with one click highlights the focus on user experience, and no wrapped tokens or shady bridges that introduce new trust assumptions. However, by bridging the liquidity of both BTC security and ETH-grade flexibility, BOB opens the door to a wide range of yield-generating opportunities. As a result of allowing native BTC moves to earn multichain yield without the risks of opaque wrapping solutions, and a growing community that feels like it is building the future in real-time. “If you still think BTC is only a static store of value, maybe BOB is the place where you will finally see the digital gold become productive gold.” Crypto Sinan mentioned. The Biggest Profit-Take In Bitcoin History Bitcoin continues to experience bearish action, impacting investors’ sentiment. Niels, the co-founder of Tedlabsio, has revealed that Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are cashing in a historic amount of coins than ever before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Done Yet Despite Price Crash To $112,000, Here’s Why In this cycle, BTC Long-Term Holders have realized a record amount of profit, totaling an enormous 3.4 million BTC, larger than the profit realized in any previous bull run.

Commodity Pool Fraud Costs Couple Millions, CFTC Says According to the September 25 press release , married realtors Michael Griffis and Amanda Griffis convinced 145 people to contribute $6.5 million to a community pool known as “Blessings Thru Crypto.” . @CFTC Obtains Order for Over $5.5M Restitution for Victims in Commodity Pool Fraud by Tennessee Couple: https://t.co/UIOg9SvJlq — CFTC (@CFTC) September 25, 2025 The duo claimed that the funds would be “used to trade commodity futures on the Apex Trading Platform with guidance from an individual known only as Coach Wendy.” In reality, the commodity pool was a copy of an overseas exchange and it is still unclear who exactly “Coach Wendy” is. “More than $4 million of the pool’s funds were sent to the illegitimate overseas exchange where it was immediately sent to a variety of other accounts and offshore trading platforms,” the press release states. “The remaining funds were misappropriated for personal expenses, including paying personal debts and buying a variety of consumer goods,” the press release continues. CFTC Bans Realtor Couple For Alleged Crypto Scheme According to a newly filed consent order in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, the couple $5,528,121 in restitution to defrauded victims and a $1,355,232 civil monetary penalty. In total, the duo will have to pay over $6.8 million in monetary relief. They are also banned from trading and registering with the CFTC and are prohibited from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. “This case is a stark warning to be cautious about whom you trust with your money,” said Charles Marvine, Acting Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Retail Fraud and General Enforcement Task Force. “If an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is, for you and anyone you bring along.” The post Tennessee Couple Ordered To Pay Almost $7 Million In Crypto Trading Fraud Scheme appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|CFTC|Crime|Fraud,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|TRADING|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-27 00:00:18

Analysts argue that such integration could provide indirect benefits to XRP, which serves as the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). CFTC’s New Approach to Tokenized Collateral The potential link between RLUSD and the derivatives market arises from a recent initiative launched by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Under the leadership of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, the agency introduced a program exploring the role of tokenized collateral, including payment-focused stablecoins, within derivatives contracts. This initiative forms part of the CFTC’s broader effort , often referred to as a “crypto sprint,” aimed at enhancing collateral management, increasing capital efficiency, and implementing recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets . To advance this plan, the commission is currently seeking public input until October 20, 2025, after which it intends to design pilot programs. If approved, stablecoins issued by licensed U.S. entities could be incorporated into derivatives trading. As a U.S.-backed stablecoin operating directly on the XRPL, RLUSD is well-positioned to benefit from regulatory advancements. Market Size and Potential Impact At the end of 2024, the global notional value of derivatives surpassed $700 trillion. Of this, the U.S. accounted for roughly 27%, or $189 trillion, falling under the CFTC’s oversight of swaps, futures, and options markets. The scale of this market means that even limited adoption of RLUSD as collateral could significantly increase settlement activity on the XRPL. Since XRP functions as the gas token for transactions on the ledger, higher RLUSD usage could lead to greater demand for XRP. This connection underpins the belief among some analysts that Ripple’s stablecoin initiative might have broader implications for XRP’s valuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Possible Price Scenarios for XRP To explore potential outcomes, Google’s Gemini AI was asked to project XRP’s performance if RLUSD were adopted within the U.S. derivatives sector. The system noted that such an event would bring several advantages: increased transactional volume on the ledger, stronger regulatory legitimacy for RLUSD, and heightened interest from traditional financial institutions in adopting XRPL infrastructure. Based on these factors, Gemini suggested that XRP could reach a price range of $10 to $20 within a year of RLUSD’s integration into the derivatives market, assuming a favourable regulatory and adoption environment. Despite these optimistic scenarios, the relationship between RLUSD’s adoption and XRP’s market value remains speculative. While regulatory approval could establish RLUSD as a credible tool for collateral management and indirectly strengthen XRP’s utility, there is no certainty that these changes would translate into sustained price increases. Market conditions, investor sentiment, and broader macroeconomic factors will continue to play a major role. The CFTC’s initiative is a significant move toward allowing stablecoins in U.S. derivatives markets. Should RLUSD gain traction in this space, the ripple effects could extend to XRP through increased network activity and institutional engagement. However, predictions of dramatic price growth remain hypothetical, and investors are advised to approach such projections with caution.

Instead of a straight shot upwards, a significant number of market participants are now betting on a substantial dip before any major rally. This shift in sentiment highlights the unpredictable nature of digital assets and the complex factors influencing market movements. What’s Driving This Surprising Bitcoin Price Prediction? Recent data from the decentralized prediction market Myriad Markets reveals a fascinating trend. Traders are increasingly convinced that Bitcoin (BTC) will dip below the $105,000 mark before it manages to break through the $125,000 barrier. Decrypt reported this intriguing development, underscoring a growing bearish sentiment in the short term. Currently, the probability of BTC falling below $105,000 first stands at a notable 68%. This figure represents a significant increase of over 25 percentage points in just the past seven days. Such a rapid change in market sentiment suggests that underlying forces are at play, pushing traders to reconsider their immediate outlook on the Bitcoin price prediction . Why Are Traders Betting on a Dip Before the Surge? It might seem counterintuitive for traders to anticipate a fall when many hope for new all-time highs. However, this particular Bitcoin price prediction is often influenced by several factors: Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may look to secure profits, leading to selling pressure. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate decisions, can impact risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Technical Resistance: Key technical levels often act as strong resistance points, making a pullback more likely before a breakthrough. The market often experiences corrections, which are healthy for long-term growth. Traders might view a drop below $105,000 as a necessary retest or a chance to accumulate more BTC at a lower price before the next major upward move towards $125,000. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider for Their Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding these market dynamics is crucial, but making informed decisions requires careful consideration. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this period of uncertainty: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the methodologies behind prediction markets. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term fluctuations can be dramatic, many long-term investors focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risks associated with any single asset’s performance. Remember, prediction markets reflect current sentiment, not guaranteed outcomes. The market can shift rapidly, making any Bitcoin price prediction a snapshot in time. The Broader Market Context for This Bitcoin Price Prediction The current sentiment around a potential dip for Bitcoin doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The broader cryptocurrency market, alongside global economic indicators, plays a significant role. Institutional adoption continues to grow, and major regulatory discussions are ongoing. These factors create a complex environment where price movements can be influenced by both internal crypto dynamics and external global events. As we move forward, monitoring these broader trends will be just as important as watching the immediate price action for any accurate Bitcoin price prediction . In summary, the decentralized prediction market Myriad Markets highlights a prevailing sentiment among traders: a notable dip for Bitcoin below $105,000 is more probable than an immediate surge past $125,000. This fascinating Bitcoin price prediction , gaining significant traction, underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. While such predictions offer a glimpse into market psychology, they also serve as a crucial reminder for investors to remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and manage their risks effectively. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be an exciting, albeit volatile, one. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Prediction Q1: What is Myriad Markets?

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6785 Market cap $721.24M Trading volume (24-hour) $19.43M Circulating supply 1.059B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6856 24-hour low $0.6566 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.25% 50-day SMA $0.7751 14-Day RSI 32.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.7009 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is consolidating around $0.67 but remains under bearish pressure. A breakdown below $0.6578 could push XTZ toward $0.64. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the daily chart for September 27, Tezos is consolidating just above $0.67 after a sharp selloff. The Bollinger Bands are widening, with price leaning toward the lower band at $0.6578, signaling persistent downside risk. The MACD remains negative, with the histogram still favoring bears, and OBV shows no meaningful uptick in buying volume. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView XTZ’s immediate resistance is at $0.7383, while support sits at $0.6578. A close below the support level could open the way toward $0.64, while only a break above $0.70–$0.74 would start easing selling pressure. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Tezos is trying to stabilize after bouncing from the $0.65–$0.64 zone. The Alligator lines remain in bearish alignment, with price struggling to clear the red line at $0.6779. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView If bulls manage to reclaim $0.6876, short-term relief could push price toward $0.70, though rejection at current levels could drive another retest of $0.6547 and $0.6424.

Based on both timelines, Tezos is still under pressure and needs a firm reclaim above $0.6876 to shift sentiment. Until then, expect consolidation with potential downside. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.
