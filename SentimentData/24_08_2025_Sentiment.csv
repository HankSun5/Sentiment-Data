In the latest development, a victim lost 783 Bitcoin, worth approximately $91 million, in such an attack. Hackers Impersonate Wallet Support Prominent on-chain investigator ZachXBT reported that the attackers impersonated both exchange and hardware wallet customer support. Blockchain data shows the thief has already laundered the stolen funds through the privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet Wasabi. The incident coincidentally occurred on the one-year anniversary of the $243 million Genesis Creditor theft. ZachXBT explained that large-scale breaches have left massive amounts of personal information exposed online, which makes it easier for threat actors to exploit victims. By leveraging these data leaks, attackers can convincingly impersonate exchange or wallet support, gain trust, and ultimately carry out such scams. When asked by a community member how one can avoid falling victim to social engineering, ZachXBT offered a blunt but practical piece of advice: treat every call or email as a potential scam by default. Social Engineering: A Dominant Attack Vector TRM Labs recently highlighted the growing dominance of social engineering in crypto-related thefts. The firm found that the first half of 2025 witnessed a record $2.1 billion stolen through hacks and exploits. Over 80% of losses were tied to infrastructure intrusions such as compromised private keys and seed phrases, which were often made possible through social engineering tactics or insider threats. The average hack size also doubled compared to 2024, as it hit $30 million during the same period. TRM noted that the Bybit incident in February, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored actors, was the largest crypto hack in history, as it accounted for nearly 70% of total losses. Beyond that mega theft, dozens of other attacks occurred in January, April, and May, with several exceeding $100 million each.

In Argentina, where inflation hit triple digits, millions have turned to dollar-linked stablecoins to protect their savings. In Venezuela, stablecoins have become a workaround for currency restrictions. And in Brazil and Mexico, a wave of fintech startups is pushing crypto into mainstream financial services. This backdrop makes Mexico City an ideal venue for Stablecoin Conference 2025 , taking place on August 27–28 at the World Trade Center. It’s the first large-scale event in the region focused solely on stablecoins—the digital assets pegged to fiat currencies that many see as crypto’s most practical use case. The conference is organized by Bitso, Latin America’s largest crypto exchange and a key player in the region’s fintech ecosystem. The guest list underscores the event’s weight: participation from BitGo, Ripple, Bridge, Polygon, Solana, Arbitrum, and other global heavyweights places the Stablecoin Conference on the crypto world’s calendar. The Side Events That Matter Big crypto conferences often make headlines with keynote speeches, but much of the real action happens in smaller, closed-door gatherings. On August 27, BitGo will host a VIP event with Outset PR as a co-host. The exclusive gathering is set to bring together entrepreneurs, investors, and builders of Latin America and beyond. Outset PR will also share data from its LATAM Crypto Media Report , an internal study mapping the shifting influence of regional outlets. The report is meant to address a growing blind spot in crypto PR. Many brands entering Latin America rely on pre-packaged deals that promise media coverage but obscure how traffic and influence are actually distributed. For Outset PR, a communications agency focused on Web3, it’s an opportunity to position itself not only as a PR shop but as a provider of insights into the stories driving adoption. For BitGo, the digital assets infrastructure company, the event provides a platform to highlight its presence in LatAm and other markets where stablecoins are increasingly seen as essential financial tools. Why Stablecoins, Why Now Stablecoins have been part of the crypto toolkit for nearly a decade, but their relevance in Latin America has accelerated. When local currencies swing wildly, stablecoins offer something close to predictability. They’re increasingly used for remittances, cross-border payments, and even everyday commerce, as merchants warm to the idea of faster, cheaper transactions without the friction of traditional banks. The conference agenda mirrors these realities. Panels will dig into regulation—still a patchwork across Latin America—along with adoption by businesses and the role of stablecoins in financial inclusion. Sponsors range from Circle to Visa to Solana, a lineup that signals just how seriously global players are taking the region. Mexico as a Stage Hosting the event in Mexico City is no accident. The country has become a hub for fintech innovation and sits at the crossroads of remittance flows between the U.S. and Latin America—a sector worth over $150 billion annually. With so much at stake, the choice of Mexico for the first stablecoin-focused regional conference underscores the country’s rising influence in digital finance. What to Watch Stablecoin Conference 2025 arrives at a time when Latin America is moving from early adoption to broader integration. Whether the discussion is about inflation protection, financial inclusion, or regulatory frameworks, the outcomes will shape how stablecoins function across the region. And while the conference will feature headline panels and high-profile sponsors, the smaller gatherings may prove just as pivotal. With BitGo and Outset PR bringing together industry leaders and adding fresh insight from regional media analysis, the event highlights how Latin America is adopting global crypto trends.

As the flagship coin faces pressure, attention shifts to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE)—two meme-driven tokens with surprisingly strong communities and unique growth stories. Much like Outset PR identifies undercurrents in market sentiment before they hit the mainstream, this analysis explores whether SHIB and DOGE can weather current volatility and carve out gains in the next phase of the cycle. Bitcoin Bounce Back: Why the Crypto King Still Thrills Investors Source: tradingview Bitcoin is the first and biggest cryptocurrency. It’s like digital gold. People trust it because of its limited supply and strong technology. In past years, big dips often led to strong climbs. The recent market dump might just be setting the stage for another rise. Bitcoin often drives the whole crypto market. With its history, Bitcoin could lead the next exciting altcoin season. Smart investors are watching closely, hoping for gains like in 2021. The coin's groundwork is strong, making it an attractive choice for those ready for the ride. SHIB: Poised for a Comeback as Altcoin Season Approaches Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB), a standout meme coin, continues to draw attention. Known for its playful dog mascot, SHIB gained fame with a grassroots backing and significant price surges in 2021. With its strong community and growing ecosystem, SHIB offers more than just a fun token. It runs on Ethereum, bringing advantages like security and smart contract capabilities. Recent market dips might present a buying opportunity for those optimistic about altcoin season. If patterns from 2021 repeat, SHIB could rise again. With its expanding use cases and strategic developments, this coin might seem attractive to those believing in the next bull run.

These milestones often set the tone for the broader crypto market, shaping how investors approach altcoins and emerging tokens. Much like Outset PR , which identifies turning points in media narratives with precision, this analysis looks at what’s driving BTC and ETH right now—and which other cryptocurrencies might seize the moment as confidence builds. Bitcoin Bounce Back: Why the Crypto King Still Thrills Investors Source: tradingview Bitcoin, often called ""digital gold,"" is the original and largest cryptocurrency. Its appeal stems from its limited supply and robust technology. Historically, significant market downturns have often preceded strong rallies, suggesting the recent market dip could be a precursor to a new upward trend. Bitcoin's movements typically influence the broader crypto market, and its past performance indicates it could spearhead the next altcoin season. Astute investors are closely observing, anticipating returns akin to those seen in 2021. The coin's solid fundamentals make it an appealing prospect for those prepared to navigate its volatility. Ethereum: A Bright Spot in the Crypto Universe Source: tradingview Ethereum stands out in the crypto world. It powers more than just digital money. Ethereum supports smart contracts, which let applications run automatically. Developers use it to create decentralized apps, offering endless possibilities. ETH, its coin, fuels the network. This past success hints at gains during market rallies. Recent drops might be chances to enter at lower prices. Many believe Ethereum will lead the next big wave, thanks to its technology and developer support. If history repeats, Ethereum could shine brighter in the coming months. It's an attractive choice for those looking forward to an exciting altcoin season.

According to multiple crypto analysts, three altcoins are showing strong potential to deliver 25x returns in the upcoming bull cycle: Polygon (POL) , XRP , and MAGACOIN FINANCE —a new project currently in its presale phase that’s generating major buzz across DeFi circles. With Polygon delivering technical upgrades and XRP finally free from regulatory uncertainty, all signs point to massive growth ahead. But it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE —a high-energy, community-driven finance token—that might just deliver the biggest upside of them all. Let’s break it down. Polygon: DeFi Booming, Tech Upgrades Rolling In Polygon (now transitioning from MATIC to POL) is having a powerful 2025. Here’s why analysts are bullish: As of August 19 , Polygon’s Total Value Locked (TVL) hit a 2025 high of $1.23 billion —a 43% increase YTD. Key platforms like QuickSwap and Polymarket are driving these numbers, making Polygon a serious DeFi contender once again. The POL token is already outperforming sector averages. POL/USDT Chart: TradingView Polygon’s Heimdall v2 upgrade drastically reduced transaction finality time to 4–6 seconds , making dApps and user experience smoother than ever. Meanwhile, the Bhilai upgrade boosted capacity beyond 1,000 TPS —with a roadmap aiming for 5,000 TPS by Q4 . Set for September 4, 2025 , the migration from MATIC to POL brings a unified token for staking, gas, and governance across Polygon’s entire ecosystem. It’s the beginning of Polygon 2.0 —and analysts believe this transition could spark the next price breakout. XRP: Legal Clarity at Last, but Mixed Signals Persist After four long years, Ripple and the SEC finally settled on August 15 . U.S. public exchange sales of XRP are no longer classified as securities , giving the green light to retail investors. This is a major overhang removed and a bullish sign for long-term holders. Large holders scooped up 120 million XRP last week, showing strong institutional faith. However, XRP ETF approvals were delayed until October, and a harsh security audit caused a short-term dip below $2.90 . Still, many investors are watching the $2.78 support level , seeing it as a potential launchpad once market jitters subside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Sleeper Pick Analysts Love While Polygon and XRP are already well-established giants, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE —a rising DeFi project still in presale—that’s turning heads in the crypto community. MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than just a meme token. It’s a bold, community-led crypto finance movement that combines powerful branding, real utility, and an aggressive growth roadmap. Designed to empower holders and decentralize wealth, it’s quickly gaining traction as the next gem . Early buyers get access to tokens at rock-bottom prices before the public listing. With limited allocation, FOMO is setting in fast. Audited smart contracts and anti-rug mechanisms make MAGACOIN FINANCE a safer bet for investors. With strong community backing and a narrative that taps into the energy of cultural movements, MAGACOIN FINANCE is primed for breakout success . Final Thoughts Unlike legacy tokens like XRP and POL, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its infancy —which means the growth ceiling is much, much higher. Crypto experts say that the combination of: Early-entry presale pricing High-volatility upside Growing community hype Real-world roadmap …makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a prime candidate for 25x return during the next crypto rally. With Bitcoin stabilizing and altcoin season beginning to stir, getting in early on tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE can mean the difference between modest gains and life-changing wealth .

The blow came fast. Trump made the claim with no evidence, but the damage didn’t need proof. According to data from Bloomberg, the firing shook long-standing confidence in what used to be seen as the most neutral set of economic numbers in the U.S. Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth Management, said he’s used BLS data for decades, not as the only input, but definitely one of the key ones. Now he doesn’t trust it the same way. Philip said, “It calls into question the validity going forward,” and added that if the numbers get political, “you can’t rely on them, and you’re going to have to rely on everything else.” That feeling isn’t just his anymore. Others on Wall Street are saying the same thing, out loud. Wall Street leans harder on private data firms Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, said flatly, “The optics of this situation are not very good.” He said he’ll be giving “more emphasis” to employment reports from ADP Research and pulling back from BLS releases. That’s becoming the pattern. Reports from private companies like ADP, Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Institute for Supply Management, and S&P Global are no longer just extra data—they’re becoming central. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said private data has become the “check and balance to the public data.” He’s watching Senate confirmation hearings to see if Trump’s pick to lead the BLS will change how the numbers are put together. Brian said he’ll wait to judge the nominee but warned, “If it becomes politicized, we’d notice it pretty quickly.” He also pointed out that private reports let analysts spot mistakes. So far, the stock market hasn’t gone haywire over Trump’s moves, but it’s clear that trust is fading. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said that less trust in data could mean investors want higher risk premiums. That would drag down valuations and make data feel shakier. “If you have less confidence in it, then you probably on the margin have maybe a higher risk premium,” Keith said. Old BLS issues add to the fallout The BLS had problems long before Trump stepped in. The agency’s budget has been tight for years. It’s lost staff. It’s still using outdated methods. People aren’t answering their surveys like they used to. That’s made the data more incomplete, and the revisions are getting bigger. Sometimes they even have to make up missing data points, filling gaps with guesses. That’s been the case for years. But people put up with it because they believed the BLS wasn’t being influenced by politics. That belief is now cracking. Julian Emanuel, chief equity and quantitative strategist at Evercore ISI, said attention is growing fast around private sources. His firm also publishes labor market numbers. “The move toward private data is getting increasingly greater focus as the data from the government increasingly becomes a question mark,” he said.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP continue to dominate conversations, supported by institutional inflows and strong market positioning. Yet, analysts are also pointing to a hidden presale gem — MAGACOIN FINANCE — as the play that could rival the earliest winners of past cycles. Bitcoin: The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the whole cryptocurrency universe. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently consolidating between $113,000 and $115,000, following a correction from its all-time high above $124,000. According to analysts, BTC continues to be the sector’s most reliable store of value. According to analysts, large corrections like this one have occurred in past halvings, and since institutional interest is still high, many are expecting further growth towards $130,000 or above later in 2025. Bitcoin remains a must-hold for investors looking for growth and stability. Ethereum: Driving Web3 Innovation Ethereum is the clear leader in web3 and decentralised finance, according to experts. Even though ETH was down in the short-term trading at about $4200, some believe that institutional inflow into the ETH ETF recently crossed 1 billion dollars. Forecasting from a technical point of view indicates that the price may move toward $5,000 soon. The first resistance is $4454, while the second one is $4702. The dominance of Ethereum’s network across DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 scaling makes it a core pick for investors for riding long-term adoption trends. XRP: Legal Clarity Fuels Growth XRP has staged a strong comeback after receiving the clarity it has long waited when it comes to the SEC. XRP is currently trading around $2.90, with more than 93% of its supply now in profit. Whale buying has picked up too, as major buyers accumulate hundreds of millions of tokens. Analysts think XRP might go back to $3.39 in a few months, especially with ETF speculation building in October! In the realm of crypto assets, XRP’s designation as a payment-oriented asset offers tangible and unique value. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden 25,000% ROI Play Thousands of investors have already joined the wave into MAGACOIN FINANCE, with analysts forecasting a staggering 25,000% ROI in the next bull run. Ranked among the best altcoins to buy right now , momentum is accelerating quickly. Momentum is already evident. Trading activity from early buyers has surged, and social engagement continues to accelerate faster than rival launches. Research groups note that this isn’t just speculative noise — it reflects sustained conviction from both smaller investors and large holders positioning ahead of exchange listings. Analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE capped supply, verified audits, and whale-backed inflows give it the kind of fundamentals that fueled the earliest breakouts of Solana and Ethereum. If momentum continues at its current pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin, ETH and XRP are the three strongest candidates for investors for the coming up bull cycle owing to hefty institutional demand and strong fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is, however, being compared to the early-stage big winners of the market, which can return up to 25,000% making it difficult to ignore. If you are an investor looking for stability with asymmetric upside, pairing the leaders with MAGACOIN FINANCE as breakout altcoin offers an attractive strategy for 2025.

Tokens like BNB, ADA, and Solana are emerging as strong contenders, each backed by growing ecosystems, active communities, and resilient fundamentals. Much like Outset PR identifies early signals in the media landscape before they shape narratives, this analysis highlights the altcoins that may lead the charge as the market transitions into a new growth phase. BNB: A Hidden Gem with Growth Potential in the Crypto World Source: tradingview BNB, the native coin of Binance, stands out in the crypto world. As a utility token, it powers transactions on Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges. BNB is more than just a trading fee discount; it's part of Binance Smart Chain, allowing for smart contracts and decentralized applications. BNB often performs well in bullish markets, and its strong fundamentals make it promising. The current dip mirrors past patterns before significant surges. With growing use cases and reliability, BNB might be a smart choice for those anticipating another vibrant crypto market upswing.

Let Outset PR Tell Your Story With Verifiable Impact Why Cardano (ADA) Could Soar in the Next Altcoin Season Source: tradingview Cardano, known by its ticker ADA, is grabbing attention again. This blockchain platform uses a proof-of-stake system which is more energy-efficient than Bitcoin's mining method. Cardano seeks to improve scalability and sustainability for cryptocurrencies. Despite the recent market dump, this coin shows strong potential like in early 2021. Advances such as smart contracts and a strong community make it a strong contender for the next altcoin season. With its focus on research and security, many see ADA poised for growth. This could make Cardano an attractive option in today's market cycle, especially for those who believe in a bright future for altcoins. Solana: Ready to Shine Again in the Next Altcoin Season Source: tradingview Solana, often dubbed the ""Ethereum killer,"" is a fast-rising star in the crypto world. It offers super-speedy transactions and lower fees, making it ideal for developers and users alike. The coin saw massive growth in 2021, hitting new highs and gaining attention for its innovative tech. This blockchain stands out with its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. As the market looks set to flip bullish again, Solana's history of resilience and rapid recovery makes it an attractive option. Its community is strong, and developers are busy building on its platform. Keep an eye on SOL; it might just lead the charge in the next bull run. Conclusion BNB, Cardano, and Solana each showcase qualities that could help them thrive in a market environment where Bitcoin’s grip is loosening. Whether it’s BNB’s expanding utility, ADA’s focus on sustainability and innovation, or Solana’s speed and scalability, these tokens present opportunities for investors watching the next phase of altcoin season.

The reason? Crypto enthusiasts and meme fans are shifting their attention to the Ethereum Layer 2 newcomer, Layer Brett (LBRETT), whose viral presale and surging popularity have many forecasting a potential meme token outbreak in 2025. Entry level per token is currently just $0.0047. The $1 million investment mark is about to be toppled. With DOGE and PEPE losing momentum, the best meme coin opportunity may be unfolding right now on Ethereum Layer 2. Layer Brett: Layer 2 Presale Layer Brett (LBRETT)’s presale is rapidly gaining ground as investors chase the next big crypto. By fusing meme coin energy with real blockchain utility, Layer Brett is drawing analyst buzz as the project with the potential to 100x and even outshine established names like Pepe Coin and Dogecoin. Early stakers have seen APYs of over 25,000%, though this figure is falling as more participants stake, creating urgency and FOMO among traders. This DeFi meme coin runs on Ethereum Layer 2, delivering near-instant transactions and ultra-low fees, making it a top gainer crypto and a strong contender for the next 100x meme coin. Dogecoin price in the spotlight: Can DOGE recover? Dogecoin (DOGE) is the original meme coin, but recent weeks have seen the Dogecoin price slip. While DOGE has a robust community and institutional interest, technical indicators for August 2025 show a mixed outlook. The EMA and MA lines have flattened, while the RSI hovers around 49, indicating neutral momentum. The MACD remains below the signal line, suggesting continued consolidation rather than a bull run. Despite past Elon Musk endorsements, traders are increasingly considering Layer Brett over DOGE for higher returns. Pepe Coin faces uncertainity Pepe Coin (PEPE) remains a high-risk, high-volatility asset, with prices recently dipping and market sentiment turning cautious. Analysts predict PEPE could slide further as speculative trading intensifies. With no major news or partnerships and the price action mostly driven by FOMO, PEPE holders are increasingly drawn to newer meme coins demonstrating real utility, such as Layer Brett and its explosive presale . Layer Brett’s explosive growth: Why investors are piling in Layer Brett is capturing headlines for more than just memes. Its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation means it is high-speed, secure, and scalable, anchored to the world’s most trusted smart contract blockchain. The current presale allows early backers to buy LBRETT at just $0.0047 , with payments accepted in ETH, USDT, or BNB. The next price rise is imminent. Staking rewards remain impressive, with APYs still in the tens of thousands, though dropping quickly as the user base surges. As a meme coin with real tech, Layer Brett provides decentralized, self-custodial access and no KYC requirements. Then there is the $1 million giveaway fueling community excitement. These features are setting it apart from legacy meme coins like DOGE and PEPE, making it one of the best crypto to invest in for 2025. Hype and utility: The new meme coin landscape The meme coin sector is rapidly evolving, and traders are looking for more than just cute dogs or frogs without utility. Layer Brett stands out with its blend of community power, genuine utility, and financial incentives. As LBRETT presale fills up and the crypto bull run of 2025 reaches new heights, Layer Brett’s opportunity for exponential 100x growth places it ahead of PEPE and DOGE. The hype for Layer Brett is practical. Don’t miss out—the most scalable meme project on Ethereum Layer 2 is still in presale , but will finish fast.

The target for ETH is $10,000,” Lihua said. According to Lihua, during the interest rate cut process, not only ETH but also other major cryptocurrencies such as SOL, TON, LTC, along with tokens such as ENA, AAVE, Pendle, UNI, which are strong projects in the ecosystem, are showing an upward trend. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Charles Hoskinson Predicts a “Gigachad Bull Run” in the Market - “Two Things Are Needed” Lihua issued a warning to investors, saying, “I'm reminding you again: avoid short positions and buy on pullbacks. Don't be afraid of high prices in a bull market, but don't use high leverage and be wary of short-term corrections. Also, focus on exploring OTC income opportunities.” However, the price of Ethereum recently broke its all-time high. Following Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole, which was interpreted in a dovish light, the price of ETH experienced a significant surge. *This is not investment advice.

As liquidity rotates back into digital assets and institutional demand accelerates, top-performing altcoins are once again drawing investor attention. Solana and Cardano remain firmly on analysts’ radars, but new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also being highlighted as high-upside plays for the year ahead. With whale-backed inflows and strong momentum, these projects are seen as some of the best cryptos to buy into the next cycle. Solana: Scaling for the Next Institutional Wave Solana (SOL) shows that it is still a leading player of Layer 1, after all. The network upgrades, including the imminent “Alpenglow” consensus proposal, aim to reduce settlement speeds to 150ms, potentially giving Solana a competitive edge in institutional-scale trading. Solana’s DeFi ecosystem exceeded $9.3 billion total value locked, while ETF inflows underscored the growing interest from institutions. A surge beyond the $250 mark is likely for Solana (SOL) under strong market conditions as it prepares for the next wave of liquidity. Cardano: Poised for Recovery and Expansion Although Cardano’s ADA has been extremely volatile, its fundamentals remain quite strong. At a low price of less than 1 dollar ADA is a good long-term accumulation point. Staking remains vigorous, and the recent smart contract upgrades are once again drawing focus to its DeFi ecosystem. Crypto experts believe that ADA may cross $1.10 on average in 2025 and price may go as high as $5 in a bull cycle. With rumors of an ETF and renewed developer engagement, Cardano has emerged as one of the most strategically undervalued plays for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale to Watch As the 2025 bull market approaches, analysts rank Solana and Cardano as strong plays — but say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout to watch. With forecasts of 40x ROI and whale-backed inflows accelerating, it’s being called one of the best cryptos to buy now . Early buyers using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are running out quickly. Having already surpassed major fundraising milestones and supported by verified audits, MAGACOIN FINANCE has gained credibility as more than just a speculative play. Analysts emphasise that the combination of capped supply, secure smart contracts, and growing whale participation makes this presale one of the rare growth opportunities in 2025. Investor demand is accelerating fast, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most-watched tokens of the year. Ethereum: Institutional Demand Builds Ethereum (ETH) is the backbone of the digital asset market, serving DeFi, NFTs and Web3 applications. Institutions are gaining confidence as ETFs see inflows of over $1 billion. Despite fluctuations around $4,000, the longer-term outlook is bullish and could move toward $5,000 as demand increases. If you want to own a sustainable asset, large-cap exposure to Ethereum is a good choice for 2025. XRP: Utility and ETF Speculation XRP’s ecosystem has finally received regulatory clarity after years of uncertainty. Due to delays in ETF proposals until October, there has been short-term volatility, but whale accumulation continues to support the outlook. If the ETF gets approved, analysts believe it could retest its all-time high of nearly $3.84. XRP remains a solid long-term hold, particularly for those focused on utility adoption in cross-border finance. Conclusion As the bull market gears up, Solana and Cardano remain reliable plays, while Ethereum and XRP provide institutional-backed momentum. However, analysts are increasingly pointing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout altcoin for 2025, citing whale-backed demand, transparent audits, and massive upside forecasts. For investors seeking to balance established blue chips with high-growth opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents one of the most compelling investment cases of the cycle.

Ondo has climbed back above $1 after finding support, hinting at a possible run toward $3. Solana continues to display a bullish trend, with capital inflows and chart patterns pointing toward a potential breakout past $210. These two projects are exciting traders, but BlockDAG (BDAG ) is stirring investor interest at a scale that goes far beyond short-term speculation. With 20 confirmed exchange listings, a $380 million presale haul, and a growing base of 2.5 million X1 mobile miners, BlockDAG is turning attention into tangible progress. Its BlockDAG Explorer adds transparency by giving users live insights into network activity, boosting confidence in a project that already feels prepared for launch. Against this backdrop, buyers are rushing to secure positions before the discounted presale ends. Ondo Market Analysis Shows Rising Momentum Ondo (ONDO) is back at $1.02 after bouncing from $0.92 support, reinforcing its bullish outlook. The breakout from a descending wedge that had capped price action since November 2024 has shifted the mid-term structure. A successful retest in July confirmed upside momentum. Indicators align with this strength: the 4-hour RSI sits at 52.86, while the MACD shows a narrowing bearish gap, signaling growing buying pressure. Trading activity jumped to 6.6 million recently, reflecting strong market attention. ONDO now faces resistance between $1.70 and $1.85, a level that stalled previous rallies in late 2024. Analysts suggest clearing this zone could pave the way toward $2.30 and $3.00, following a breakout-retest-continuation setup on the daily chart. A higher low formed in August compared with July highlights accumulation, with ONDO maintaining structure above the channel midline. If overall market sentiment continues improving, ONDO could test higher price levels, keeping traders closely engaged. Solana Bullish Trend Targets Breakout Territory Solana has surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour perpetual futures trading volumes, signaling a major shift in decentralized derivatives demand. Weekly settlements on Solana totaled $2.89B, driven by strong appetite for permissionless trading and seamless access through the Phantom wallet. Drift, Solana’s leading perpetual protocol, now secures $1.2B in value locked, with SOL and JLP tokens making up 68% of activity. Ethereum maintains ecosystem strength with perpetual growth across Layer 2s such as Arbitrum and Base, where low fees and faster speeds keep usage high. ETH perpetual activity on its main chain also remains solid, supported by deep stablecoin liquidity and steady fee generation. Yet, Solana applications often generate higher fees per app, showing stronger user engagement. With Solana’s TVL topping $10B and stablecoin liquidity rising above $12B, analysts believe its momentum in perpetuals could keep setting records. Even as Ethereum holds the broader advantage, Solana’s bullish trend is pushing toward new breakout levels. BlockDAG’s 20 Listings & Explorer Strengthen Investor Frenzy While Ondo and Solana make technical progress, BlockDAG is building infrastructure designed for scale and adoption. The project has already raised $380M in presale, with BDAG priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29 ahead of a projected $0.05 launch. This level of presale success signals both demand and confidence in its fundamentals. A major milestone has been securing 20 confirmed exchange listings, including top names like MEXC, LBank, and BitMart. This preparation ensures instant liquidity and global reach from day one, avoiding the scramble many projects face after launch. Adoption is expanding through the X1 mobile miner app, already used by 2.5 million people worldwide. By letting users mine BDAG on smartphones without costly setups, BlockDAG is driving mass participation. Adding to this, the X10 hardware miner, unveiled in July, showcased plug-and-play functionality that makes mining accessible for everyday users. The BlockDAG Explorer complements these efforts by providing real-time visibility into transactions and miner engagement. This transparency fosters trust, giving participants clear insights into the ecosystem. With exchange readiness, millions of miners, and a transparent monitoring tool, BlockDAG is driving a frenzy of investor interest as the presale nears its final stages. Closing Thoughts Ondo is regaining strength with a bullish structure, and Solana is edging closer to a breakout at $210. Both are offering short-term setups for traders, but BlockDAG is going beyond market moves by building long-term foundations. Its $380M presale, $0.0276 entry price, 20 exchange listings, and massive miner adoption show clear signs of readiness. The addition of the BlockDAG Explorer further reinforces its image as a functioning network before launch. While SOL and ONDO dominate headlines, BlockDAG is defining itself as the project with the strongest structural base for growth. As launch approaches, investors seeking higher returns are finding BlockDAG’s mix of liquidity, accessibility, and transparency too persuasive to overlook.

50565268,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=790999,1755990034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50565268.jpeg,A Fed paper says the US can hit 250% debt-to-GDP without spiking interest rates,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-debt-250-of-gdp-without-spiking-rates/,"A new paper presented at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole summit says the United States could pile up government debt equal to 250% of its economy without forcing interest rates to rise, so long as the demand for Treasury bonds keeps up. This projection came from Adrien Auclert of Stanford, Hannes Malmberg of the University of Minnesota, Matthew Rognlie of Northwestern, and Ludwig Straub of Harvard, who ran the scenario at the annual gathering of global central bankers. Straub, who spoke for the group at the Wyoming event, explained the setup: “Until fiscal consolidation occurs, there will be a race between the rising asset demand of an older population and the rising debt issuance needed to finance the associated increase in government expenditures.” In simple terms, as older Americans look for safe places to park their money, they could keep buying government bonds even while Washington keeps borrowing more. But Straub warned that “without large adjustments, the supply of debt will eventually outrun demand, forcing interest rates to rise.” Fed paper ties ballooning debt to future rate pressure Right now, that tipping point hasn’t arrived. The public currently holds US government debt equal to 97% of GDP. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by Republican lawmakers in July, added fuel to the fire. When the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ran its numbers back in January, it expected the debt ratio to reach 117% by 2034. But after that legislation passed, the CBO added another 9.5 percentage points to its projection. The research team looked all the way out to 2100. Their conclusion? It’s technically possible to reach a debt-to-GDP ratio of 250% by the end of the century and still maintain today’s low rates. But they were blunt: getting there requires cutting the fiscal gap by at least 10% of GDP. No one in Washington is currently doing that. As Straub explained, “The longer this adjustment is delayed, the more government debt supply outstrips its demand, eventually making government debt unsustainable.” Meanwhile, the government’s interest payments are exploding. Over the last 12 months, the US Treasury has paid $1.2 trillion in interest. If the Fed holds rates steady, that number will rise to $1.4 trillion by 2026. That’s because the average maturity of government debt is about 5 to 6 years, and right now the 5-year yield sits near 3.8%. To prevent interest costs from snowballing, the yield needs to drop below 3.1%. That would require the Fed to cut interest rates by at least 75 basis points, and soon. Powell pivots toward jobs as labor data falls apart Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is ready to do just that. He’s shifting attention away from inflation and toward jobs. In his own words, “The shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” That’s Fed-speak for “We’re about to cut.” This isn’t because inflation has cooled. It hasn’t. CPI has stayed above 2% for 53 months straight, and PPI inflation just jumped 0.9% month-over-month, the biggest increase since 2022. Core CPI is also back over 3%. But job numbers are crumbling. In the last update, 258,000 jobs were erased from May and June reports, and so far in 2025, 461,000 jobs have been revised away. That’s more than the population of Scottsdale, Arizona. The Fed is spooked. Its job is to balance inflation and employment, but since 2021, it’s been obsessed with inflation. Now, Powell clearly sees unemployment as the bigger threat. That’s why the rate cut is coming. The stock market will cheer, because every time the Fed cuts while the S&P 500 is within 2% of record highs, the market pops. According to Carson Research, this move has happened 20 times, and the average return 12 months later is +13.9%. But that’s great news only if you own assets. Most Americans don’t. And as in the post-COVID run-up, wage growth won’t keep up with inflation, and the wealth gap will widen. This dynamic is almost guaranteed to repeat. Those at the top will feast while the bottom half sinks under higher living costs. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Some tokens stand out not only for their strong communities but also for their potential to generate huge returns. Analysts are pointing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Shiba Inu as the names to watch in the year ahead. These aren’t just hype coins—they carry catalysts that could trigger explosive upside. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn fresh attention as the rising star of the best presales in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Breakout Pick with 35x Potential The MAGACOIN FINANCE project has quickly become a talking point for traders looking at multipliers. Analysts say it could become the breakout success of the best presales in 2025 , fueled by growing interest in patriotic-themed tokens. Forecasts point to a huge 35x crypto gains potential, and the hype around this token is hard to ignore. What’s catching even more eyes is the PATRIOT50X code , which gives early buyers a 50% bonus . The promotion is limited and spots are running out, which is why traders looking for top crypto presales in 2025 are rushing in. Many see MAGACOIN as a unique play compared to typical meme tokens—positioning it as both a cultural statement and a financial opportunity. Solana Price Prediction: ETF Approval Could Drive $500+ One of the most discussed altcoins right now is Solana. Analysts tracking the Solana price prediction for 2025 are eyeing a bullish range of $500–$1,000. The key driver is the SEC’s decision on spot Solana ETFs, which has a final deadline of October 16, 2025. Many believe approval could trigger heavy institutional inflows, mirroring what happened with Bitcoin ETFs. Already, the REX Shares Solana Staking ETF has gathered over $150 million in assets under management, showing strong investor interest. With active on-chain growth and increasing demand through regulated investment vehicles, Solana is repeatedly being named one of the best altcoins to buy now . If the ETF approval comes through, Solana could easily rank among the top crypto presales narratives of 2025. SHIBA INU Forecast: Meme Power Meets Layer-2 Shiba Inu remains a crowd favorite, and the SHIBA INU forecast for 2025 puts potential highs between $0.00006 and $0.00010. The optimism comes from multiple fronts—ongoing token burns, Shibarium’s Layer-2 scaling progress, and renewed cycles in meme-based coins. Recent prediction roundups even highlight $0.00008471–$0.00010 as possible peaks if market conditions stay favorable. For investors scanning the best altcoins to buy now, SHIB continues to rank high because of its community-driven approach. Its loyal base and ability to move with broader risk-on cycles keep it well-positioned among the best presales in 2025 discussions. Final Thought: Where the 35x Gains Could Land Crypto in 2025 is shaping up around opportunity. Solana has the institutional story. Shiba Inu brings meme energy with real technical progress. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one drawing headlines for its bold 35x crypto gains forecasts. With early access bonuses, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being talked about as one of the top crypto presales for traders who want in before wider exposure.

Last week, Ethereum-based ETFs captured a record $2.9 billion in inflows , accounting for nearly 78% of all crypto ETF activity. Yet while Wall Street is piling into ETH, retail investors and savvy traders are looking one step ahead—into MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap gem with 40x return potential that analysts say could outperform Solana over the next market cycle. With Ethereum ETFs validating broader crypto adoption and Solana riding high on ecosystem buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout candidate in the best crypto presale market today —and it’s still early enough to get in before the mainstream catches on. Ethereum ETF Boom Signals Bull Market — But ROI Is Shrinking Ethereum’s recent surge in institutional inflows proves what crypto veterans already knew: ETH is here to stay . Spot Ethereum ETFs saw: $2.9B in net inflows last week Over $17B in trading volume across ETH ETFs Delayed approvals have caused the SEC final decisions to be postponed until October 2025. Ethereum ETF Data : The Block While these numbers show strong long-term conviction , they also signal that much of ETH’s upside may already be priced in —especially with daily outflows like the $197 million withdrawal seen this Monday. Solana’s Progress Is Impressive — But Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could 40x Faster Solana is gaining momentum with impressive real-world adoption: $1.15B IPO funded by Solana-based stablecoins Over $2.1B in tokenized stock trading volume on Solana WEEX “Solana Ecosystem Week” boosting short-term activity Despite a solid recovery to the $180 range , many traders remain cautious, waiting on the SEC’s spot-SOL ETF decision (expected August 25) to confirm the next leg up. Yet Solana is already ranked among the top 10 coins. In fact, a substantial rally may only end up giving as little as a two to three times return on the current value. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase —and analysts project it could deliver up to 40x gains as it moves from stealth to spotlight. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Best Crypto Opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a community-centric crypto project with a strong political influence, designed to mesh with viral power and true tokenomics. Whereas Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate the media coverage, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still pulling in the early users who are keen on finding the next 75x gem before it gains widespread popularity. Key Reasons Traders Are Jumping In: · Early-Stage Entry: MAGACOIN is in presale mode—buy before the big centralized exchange listings. · Bonus Tokens: Investors using the PATRIOT50X code are securing 50% extra tokens , adding rocket fuel to their potential ROI. · Cult-Like Community: MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into political meme energy and digital culture, creating the same viral conditions that launched PEPE, DOGE, and WIF. · Analyst Forecasts: Experts say MAGACOIN has 75x upside , outperforming even fast-growing chains like Solana over the next 12–18 months. MAGACOIN FINANCE has gone the same way as the fast-rising Shiba Inu, and from its very beginning, it has been able to generate a similar upward trend, with the possibility to virus-like spreading and meme-driven momentum. Just like SHIB rewarded early adopters with life-changing returns, MAGACOIN is positioned to follow a similar path—with powerful community backing, meme appeal, and early-stage tokenomics that create the perfect setup for exponential growth. Final Thoughts The Ethereum ETF explosion is about more than just ETH—it’s a massive signal that crypto is being taken seriously by the financial elite. But history shows that the biggest returns go to early investors in small-cap coins , not large-cap assets already favored by institutions. That’s exactly where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in. As ETH ETFs bring billions into crypto and SOL gains enterprise traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a lane for those who want to multiply their capital, not just protect it .

These tokens carry a unique appeal because their low entry point allows room for massive percentage gains — the type of returns that can turn small investments into life-changing sums. With altcoin season approaching, many traders see this as the perfect chance to buy the dip. Some are also turning their attention to new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts believe could be one of the surprise performers in this cycle. Cardano (ADA): The Academic Blockchain Cardano’s ADA has been a consistent name in the sub-$1 category, drawing attention for its research-driven development and peer-reviewed foundations. Built with a proof-of-stake system, ADA stands out as one of the most energy-efficient blockchains in operation. Why investors are excited about ADA: Its scientific approach to development has built a secure, scalable foundation. Smart contracts and DeFi capabilities expand its ecosystem. Staking rewards encourage long-term holding. A strong reputation as a sustainable blockchain positions it well for mainstream adoption. TRON (TRX): The Entertainment Network TRON’s TRX has carved its place in crypto by focusing on content, gaming, and entertainment. Its high-throughput, low-cost transactions have made it popular among developers and everyday users alike. Key factors behind TRON’s potential: Entertainment and content sharing remain central to its mission. Fast and cheap transactions attract developers and users. Strategic acquisitions , like BitTorrent, expand reach and adoption. Stablecoin integration gives TRON a strong role in payments and transfers. The MAGACOIN FINANCE Factor Beyond established players like ADA and TRX, emerging tokens are capturing attention — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most talked about. The project has already raised millions in record time, and its limited early rounds are selling out quickly. Investors point to its expanding global community and ambitious roadmap as signs it could replicate the type of explosive gains seen in the early days of XRP. In fact, some forecasts suggest that a 15,000% gain is not out of the question if momentum continues, making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most compellin g under-the-radar plays this altcoin season. Building Wealth with Sub-$1 Altcoins While no coin guarantees millionaire status overnight, history shows that early positions in low-priced tokens can deliver exponential rewards when adoption accelerates. Both Cardano and TRON have strong fundamentals, while new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE bring the excitement of early-mover opportunities. The key for investors is to balance risk and reward by researching thoroughly, diversifying wisely, and acting before altseason fully takes off. For those bold enough to seize the moment, today’s cheap altcoins could be tomorrow’s life-changing investments.

The company’s risk committee recently confirmed that XRP has passed all thresholds required under its newly launched Eligible Asset Framework, which puts it alongside BNB and HYPE as top candidates for onboarding. XRP’s massive liquidity, its market capitalization of over $181 billion, and daily trading volumes comfortably above $10 billion now see it ready to take on a new role in the USDe ecosystem. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss Ethena’s Eligible Asset Framework Ethena Labs, the company behind the USDe stablecoin, recently introduced the Eligible Asset Framework as a formalized system to expand the collateral options backing USDe. According to an announcement, the framework is based on specific thresholds that assets must meet before gaining approval. These thresholds include maintaining over $1 billion in average open interest across two weeks, daily spot trading volumes above $100 million, and perpetual futures volume exceeding $100 million per day. Liquidity requirements are also included, such as a spot order book depth of more than $500,000 and perpetual futures depth above $10 million on a two-week average. XRP has cleared all these requirements, which means that it is strong enough from a risk perspective to be considered as part of USDe’s perpetual futures collateral system. For years, XRP has maintained its status as one of the most liquid digital assets in the market. Its market capitalization, which is at $181.944 billion at the time of writing, has grown massively in the past year. This has seen it climbing in market cap ranks, and it is now sitting behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Beyond the numbers, XRP’s deep order books and global trading presence in exchanges in America, Europe, and Asia allow it to handle large transactions without disrupting price stability. This level of liquidity and depth makes XRP an ideal candidate for integration into USDe, which has already been minting hundreds of millions of dollars weekly. For instance, data shows that USDe mints were in excess of 670 million over the past week. What Does This Mean For XRP? According to Ethena, XRP, alongside HYPE, has only met all the thresholds and is a candidate for onboarding shortly. Only BNB has been approved as the first new eligible asset for the perpetual futures portion of the collateral backing of USDe. If Ethena formally onboards XRP for onboarding, it would become an important expansion of XRP’s utility. It might not be the update expected by XRP holders, but this development could open a new chapter in the cryptocurrency’s utility and adoption.

Moreover, Ripple is extending RLUSD’s global presence by partnering with SBI VC Trade to bring it to the Japanese market by early 2026.

He believes that the price could reasonably double ahead of the approval of U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), although he also cautions that investors should prepare for a potential correction once approvals are finalized. Anticipation of ETF-Driven Gains In his most recent analysis, Rector explained that speculation surrounding XRP ETF approvals may drive strong demand in the coming months. He compared the current situation to previous cases involving Bitcoin and Ethereum. Before their ETFs were approved, Bitcoin advanced by nearly 80 percent, while Ethereum gained around 25 percent. However, once trading began, both assets faced notable declines. Bitcoin retraced by roughly 30 percent, and Ethereum fell by about 40 percent. XRP can easily double from here. pic.twitter.com/btU1ouQ1lg — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) August 21, 2025 Applying these observations to XRP, Rector argued that a similar trajectory is possible. He expects strong accumulation leading into the approvals, which could propel XRP’s value to levels twice as high as its current price. At the same time, he warned that a significant pullback may follow once the ETFs officially begin trading. SEC Decision Timeline Extends Into October The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed rulings on multiple XRP spot ETF applications, including those submitted by major firms such as Grayscale, 21Shares, and CoinShares. The final deadline for decisions has now been set for late October 2025. According to Rector, this delay creates a clear timeline that traders and institutional participants will be watching closely. He emphasized that the period leading up to the October deadline could see intensified speculative trading, with the final ruling likely to trigger either a wave of profit-taking or further market momentum, depending on the outcome. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Capital Could Shift the Outlook While he acknowledged the risk of a short-term correction after approval, Rector also noted that inflows from institutional investors could alter the post-launch trajectory. Industry forecasts suggest that billions of dollars may move into XRP ETFs once they become available. For instance, Steven McClurg, Chief Executive of Canary Capital, has estimated that XRP could attract approximately $5 billion within the first month of trading. Analysts at JPMorgan have issued their own projections , suggesting inflows of up to $8 billion over the first year. Under scenarios of strong institutional participation, some models have placed XRP’s potential price at $26 or higher. Multiple Catalysts Converge in October October 2025 could be a decisive month not only because of the ETF deadlines but also due to Ripple’s pending federal banking charter application with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ripple applied earlier this year, and the review period indicates that a decision is also likely in October. If both the ETF rulings and the banking charter approval occur in the same month, XRP and Ripple would be positioned at the center of two major regulatory milestones. According to Rector, the convergence of these events could create significant volatility but also set the stage for broader institutional engagement with both Ripple as a company and XRP as a digital asset.

Yet the project’s locked token supply and lack of liquidity continue to frustrate holders. Investors appear ready to shift focus, with many now eyeing Remittix as a lower entry, higher upside alternative grounded in real-world utility. The comparison has become clearer in recent weeks, as Remittix advances on milestones while Pi struggles to maintain community attention. With confirmed listings and product launches ahead, Remittix appears to be drawing stronger conviction among both retail and institutional investors. Pi Loses Momentum Amid Bearish Sentiment Pi is currently trading near $0.36, registering more than a 10% drop over the past week and nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, signaling downward pressure. Sentiment data shows Pi’s social dominance has fallen to just 0.096%, indicating a sharp decline in community chatter and investor interest. Analysts warn Pi may sink further unless it breaks above its $0.42 resistance soon. Several believe it could fall to the $0.30 to $0.32 zone if recovery does not materialize. Remittix Gains While Pi Struggles Against this weakening backdrop, Remittix (RTX) is gaining momentum. New data shows insiders are offloading Pi Coin, while Remittix is drawing increasing whale attention. With over 614 million tokens sold at $0.0969, raising more than $20.7 million, and access to BitMart already live, it is building a bullish foundation. A second listing at $22M could unlock substantial liquidity and visibility. Pi’s sluggish mainnet rollouts and liquidity constraints contrast sharply with Remittix’s working infrastructure and firm milestones. Pi holders refer to Remittix as a “once in a cycle” buying opportunity, as it prepares its Q3 wallet beta launch and runs a $250,000 giveaway. Here’s why investors are shifting interest: Direct crypto to bank transfers across 30+ countries Built for adoption, not speculation Wallet beta launching this quarter (Q3 2025) Deflationary tokenomics for long-term value Audited by CertiK for trust and transparency Utility Driven Momentum Beats Hype Pi’s recent slump underscores the risk of hype held tokens without ongoing development or liquidity support. Remittix shows that execution and roadmap clarity matter.

The recent rollercoaster ride of the YZY token—a highly publicized Solana meme coin spearheaded by Kanye West—perfectly exemplifies this pattern. After surging to a staggering $3 billion market cap, YZY crashed 60% as profiteers exited en masse. This volatility has driven traders toward meme coins with tangible utility, such as Layer Brett, which analysts now predict could surge up to 100x, setting a new standard for what it is to be a meme coin. Why Layer Brett (LBRETT) is making noise: Utility meets meme magic Layer Brett’s (LBRETT) presale is on everyone’s lips. It is merging the viral energy of a meme coin with real-world blockchain utility. With staking APYs that started above 25,000% and remain eye-catching even as more backers join (causing a decrease in the APY), the project’s Ethereum Layer 2 technology delivers DeFi functionality, faster speeds, and lower fees. This combination of meme potential and blockchain utility is making Layer Brett a top contender for explosive gains, drawing attention away from the likes of typical hyped up meme coins like YZY. YZY token: Hype, crash, and the risks of celebrity meme coins The YZY token rocketed to a $3 billion market cap in days, only to plummet by 60% just as quickly. As a Solana meme coin with no practical utility, launched by a celebrity, YZY’s trajectory was almost predictable—a classic recipe for disaster. While the token could experience another surge due to the infamous volatility seen by most Solana meme coins, any bounce is likely to be short-lived, with another sharp crash always looming. For traders, this pattern makes YZY and other hyped meme coins far less appealing than projects like Layer Brett. The Layer Brett advantage: Features that fuel exponential growth Layer Brett (LBRETT) stands out for its potential to grow exponentially, which is why its presale faces increasing demand. $1 million has been invested in a few short weeks, with the next token price about to happen. The project leverages several features that position it above well-known meme coins like Dogecoin and even the overhyped YZY. Anchored to Ethereum’s security, LBRETT is built on a Layer 2 network to deliver fast, low-cost transactions. The ongoing presale offers early access at a favorable price point of $0.0047, giving initial buyers a significant advantage. Staking rewards for early adopters were initially substantial, topping 25,000% APY, but these rates are decreasing as the community expands, creating urgency to join in early. Additionally, a $1 million incentive pool and a series of community campaigns are driving excitement during the presale. Beyond its meme coin appeal, LBRETT offers genuine utility within DeFi and Web3. This project is technology-backed, providing real value instead of just hype. You can participate with full self-custody and decentralization, as no restrictive KYC is required. Better than YZY: The next 100x meme coin is LBRETT After witnessing the unsustainable volatility in YZY, traders are seeking projects with real staying power. Layer Brett’s combination of viral meme appeal, Ethereum Layer 2 technology, and lucrative staking rewards makes it the obvious choice. The project’s transparent tokenomics, DeFi integration, and ongoing community campaigns place it far ahead of YZY. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is in its presale phase , and its potential for 100x growth in the 2025 crypto bull run is clear. Don’t miss the chance to get in early on it before the presale runs out and the token rises once it hits exchanges. Don’t miss your entry into the most scalable and rewarding Meme Token on Ethereum Layer 2.

Rising institutional demand is aligning in favor of the Solana price lately as it sees millions of dollars in inflow. Top Solana price prediction after the $500 million Circle USDC minting now projects it could hit $300 as early as November. However, even with this high Solana price prediction, Remittix is getting more attention this month as analysts say it could see 60x this year. As uncertainty grows with the altcoin bull run this season, here is why Remittix investment is becoming the top choice. This Is Why Solana Price Prediction Is Averaging $300 This Year While the current Solana price setup shows a downtrend with the price trading around $180, experts are seeing a potential for an uptrend. This is with the growing list of fundamental factors adding to the Solana price prediction for a breakout later this year. The average of the Solana price prediction at this moment shows a potential for the coin to hit $300 by December. The main driver fueling bullish sentiment right now is the US spot ETF, which is near approval. But, while the Solana ETF continues to fuel institutional demand, new partnerships and further whale accumulation are also adding to the push towards a breakout. Experts say Solana’s rise in DeFi solutions, network upgrade, new whale accumulations, and a final ETF approval this year are aligning together to fuel a surge near $300 this year. How Solana Price Could Perform In The Next Four Months The Solana price prediction suggesting a potential $300 surge is following new accumulation. Whereas the current price setup does not yet show the effect of this accumulation. In fact, the current outlook is also showing a 7% drawdown from last week. However, new ecosystem progress and upcoming fundamental factors indicate a potential surge. The Solana price is also currently showing a reversal from the bear, as it takes support at the 30EMA. A recovery above $200 by early September could trigger renewed confidence that sees the buying momentum jump higher. Remittix Positioned For 60x Surge Before December 2025 Remittix has captured a significant amount of market attention in the last few weeks, drawing towards a full breakout with the bulls. This includes a surge in accumulation, with the coin raising over $20 million to gain interest in a BitMart listing. Hence, with BitMart announcing interest in listing the Remittix token this year, experts say the token could be seeing a surge as high as 60x by December. Investors’ accumulation has also moved higher with a rise in buying momentum this month. Catalysts ready to pump the Remittix token harder this year include: Surge in in-wallet buying with the beta wallet launch in September 30+ cross-border fiat currencies payment using crypto Rise in Remittix staking interest to help investors maximize profit Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|ZRX|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-23 23:59:00

Bitcoin continues to hold its crown as the first mover and the ultimate store of digital wealth. Ethereum, however, has made itself the core of decentralized applications, providing everything from DeFi to NFTs. Each is suited to a different usage, but combined they hold the majority of the attention of investors. The debate as to whether Ethereum will ever flip Bitcoin, at least in terms of market value, lingers every cycle. Some may insist that the limited supply and simplicity of Bitcoin will keep it on top; while others might believe that the growing utility of Ethereum will eventually come to its day. Spot ETFs, staking yields, and scaling advancements are among the factors that are making the Ethereum-versus-Bitcoin gap smaller than ever. And as this dynamic unfolds, new names built on Ethereum are quietly building momentum in the background, smaller projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE reminding investors that the biggest opportunities often lie outside the obvious two giants. A history of the flippening narrative There is nothing new about discussing the possibility of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin. The first whispers of this were heard during the 2017 bull run when Ethereum was able to raise assets through ICOs at a greater speed than Bitcoin. Once again, in 2021, Ethereum was associated with DeFi and NFTs, which led to another wave of speculation. On every occasion, however, Bitcoin dominance has reinstated itself. Now the lesson from the last few cycles is evident: Ethereum is constantly gaining market share, but the gap brings in more than just pricetrend; it brings in investor sentiment. Bitcoin offers unparalleled brand recognition and scarcity appeal, whereas Ethereum nearly constantly gains more utility and adoption. The “flippening” conversation may therefore be less about absolute victory and more about the narrowing difference between two giants that now coexist at the core of crypto finance. Why 2025 is different What is different about 2025 is the involvement of institutions never seen before in Ethereum. The entry of large asset managers into ETH is evidence that this cryptocurrency is no longer considered a high-risk, long-term investment, but a technology that should have a place in the investment portfolio. Fundamental data indicates that billions of ETH are now bound into staking, which adds pressure to supply. An increase in throughput, as a result of upgrades such as Danksharding and Layer 2 expansion, is likely to make Ethereum even more important as Web3 infrastructure. In the meantime, Bitcoin will continue to focus on its current narrative of being a form of money and scarcity, and ETF demand is driving the price. A rise in Bitcoin above the $100,000 mark would also have implications on Ethereum valuations as well – indicating a possible shift in the dominance between the pair in this cycle. The key, however, is that institutional money is moving on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the most explosive gains seem to be in smaller, more emergent tokens. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Unlike ETH or BTC, which now require billions in capital inflows to move significantly, MAGACOIN is still in its presale phase. Its lean structure means even modest inflows can spark make outsized moves. What makes MAGACOIN stand out isn’t just scarcity, it’s the narrative. By mixing political branding with the Ethereum technologies, it is capturing both cultural momentum and technical capabilities. Early audit completions and structured presale rounds have added legitimacy, while its capped supply ensures that demand, once exchange listings arrive , could have a disproportionate effect on price. For new investors looking at the flippening debate and wondering how to capture outsized ROI, MAGACOIN represents an entirely different lane, one that mimics the early-stage trajectories of projects like Shiba Inu or Dogecoin before they exploded. Looking ahead So, will Ethereum ‘flip’ Bitcoin? History shows that it might continue to close the gap but fail to pull ahead of the original crypto giant. Nevertheless, the utility of Ethereum and the usability that it has had in the institutional market are indisputable drivers. Bitcoin will most likely stay at the center, but Ethereum can reduce dominance to a greater degree than ever. For retail investors, however, the real question may not be whether ETH surpasses BTC, but whether smaller players can outperform them both . With projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE entering the market at early stages, the opportunity for asymmetric returns is alive and well. XRP, Solana, and even Sui may all benefit from altcoin season, but MAGACOIN’s positioning shows how niche narratives and scarcity can create the kind of exponential growth that the larger caps no longer provide. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum are essential pillars of the crypto landscape, and the flippening narrative will remain a key storyline in 2025. However, history shows that though ETH may be just as successful in adoption as BTC, the truly high potential oftentimes exists elsewhere. In the case of investors in search of stability, BTC and ETH are incomparable. But for those chasing the kind of explosive gains that define crypto cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the dark horse. Ethereum and Bitcoin might battle for dominance, but MAGACOIN is showing why small-cap innovation can sometimes outshine even the biggest names.

While Bitcoin recently cooled after reaching a record peak above $124,000, attention has swung toward meme-driven projects and alternative tokens that promise resilience and potential outsized returns. Within this climate, analysts are increasingly spotlighting Dogecoin and MAGACOIN Finance as projects capable of capturing both cultural momentum and serious market interest. Dogecoin’s Market Position Dogecoin’s resilience is particularly evident in its recent rebound from $0.21 to around $0.22, supported by whale accumulation exceeding 680 million tokens this month. Analysts suggest that despite technical uncertainties, the token’s social reach and enduring celebrity endorsements continue to underpin bullish long-term expectations. Forecasts indicate potential gains between $0.70 and $1.30 in the coming cycle, reinforcing its inclusion among the best altcoins to buy . This momentum is further strengthened by institutional attention, such as corporate acquisitions linked to influential political figures. Such developments enhance Dogecoin’s credibility and sustain its role as a gateway meme asset in mainstream finance. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Momentum Draws Analysts’ Focus After raising millions and riding meme-fueled momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being spotlighted alongside Dogecoin as one of the best crypto presales of 2025. With analysts eyeing explosive ROI potential, momentum is shifting fast—and early entries could secure outsized upside. The growing narrative around MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that meme projects still have the potential to make investors massive returns in the upcoming cycle. Although meme tokens are often seen as speculative plays, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE combines cultural relevance, retail interest, and a strong-community backing. Investors who follow the market know that these factors are what matter in securing a strategic position, and this is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the center of 2025’s presale conversation. On-chain data shows that the project’s supply is fast depleting, and those who act out may miss out on what many are calling a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Conclusion: Momentum Beyond the Giants Bitcoin and Ethereum may continue to shape the cryptocurrency market’s direction, but analysts say the real opportunity lies in projects with the right timing and positioning. The rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that meme-driven projects can secure a unique role in investor portfolios. With transaction volumes surging and the community fast expanding, MAGACOIN FINANCE has gotten the attention of investors and traders, who say the project may be the best altcoin to buy this year. However, only those who act fast will benefit.

This achievement not only strengthens BNB’s role in the market but also signals that capital is flowing beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin ecosystem. Many investors believe this momentum could trigger a powerful rally across multiple altcoins. During times like these, smart investors are also scouting emerging projects that could deliver outsized returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE, for example, is gaining attention for offering a 50x opportunity for early participants before major exchange listings , positioning itself as one of the most attractive plays in today’s market. XRP: Regulatory Clarity Could Unlock Growth XRP remains one of the most closely watched assets in the crypto world. Despite recent price struggles, including a 17% monthly decline, the long-term outlook is optimistic. The XRP Ledger continues to grow in usage for payments and real-world asset tokenization. The ongoing lawsuit with the SEC is the biggest wildcard, but once resolved, it could open the floodgates for institutional adoption. In a bullish scenario, analysts see XRP potentially hitting the $4.00–$6.50 range , fueled by regulatory clarity and increasing utility. Toncoin (TON): A Telegram-Backed Powerhouse Toncoin’s close ties with Telegram give it one of the most compelling adoption cases in the industry. With Telegram’s massive user base now experimenting with wallet integration and TON-based services, demand could rise quickly. Institutional accumulation has also begun, with firms mirroring strategies once used for Bitcoin treasuries. TON’s price, consolidating around $3.00–$3.50 , may be at the edge of a breakout if Telegram’s ecosystem integration expands further or new DeFi applications emerge on the network. Litecoin (LTC): Digital Silver with a Fresh Edge Litecoin has long been known as “digital silver” and has a history of outperforming during bullish phases. Though it hasn’t reached fresh all-time highs like BNB, LTC’s consistent network reliability, low fees, and strong brand recognition make it a safe bet for many institutional investors. Its steady upward momentum and increasing adoption by major financial institutions show that Litecoin still has plenty of room to run in this cycle. A Rising Start During Altcoin Season MAGACOIN FINANCE is also beginning to stand out among investors searching for the next major winner. With a potential 50x upside for early buyers before major exchange listings, the project has already gained traction with its growing global community. Many analysts are comparing this phase of MAGACOIN FINANCE to the early days of breakout tokens that led previous bull markets. This combination of scarcity, demand, and utility is making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most anticipated altcoin opportunities on the market today. The Market Signals Are Clear The approval of spot ETFs, combined with surging institutional and retail participation, has created a fertile ground for growth. BNB’s breakout past $880 is a clear sign that investors’ risk appetite is back, often paving the way for the kind of capital rotation that sparks altcoin season. With XRP, TON, and LTC already showing strong fundamentals, the coming months may see explosive moves across these assets. For investors looking beyond the usual names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly standing out. With its 50x upside potential before major listings and a rapidly expanding community, it’s being compared to early opportunities in legendary altcoins that later took off in past bull markets. Conclusion BNB’s all-time high is more than a milestone—it’s a signal that the crypto market is gearing up for the next wave of altcoin growth. XRP, TON, and Litecoin all look well-positioned to benefit, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fresh opportunity for those chasing outsized returns. The stage is set, and the next altcoin season could be one for the history books.

The bank’s analysis suggests that the token could experience steady appreciation over the next three years, potentially entering double-digit valuations for the first time. According to Geoffrey Kendrick , who leads the bank’s digital assets research, XRP is expected to reach $5.50 by late 2025, with subsequent milestones of $8 in 2026 and $10.40 in 2027. By the end of 2028, Kendrick anticipates a stabilization around $12.50, which would represent gains of over 300% from current prices near $3.01. Market Position and Ethereum Comparison One of the more notable elements of the bank’s forecast is the suggestion that XRP could challenge Ethereum’s position in the cryptocurrency rankings. At present, XRP’s market value is approximately $182 billion, while Ethereum commands a capitalization above $569 billion. If XRP were to appreciate to $12.50, its valuation would rise to around $743 billion, exceeding Ethereum’s current level. However, Standard Chartered acknowledges that Ethereum itself is expected to grow in parallel. Recent assessments from the bank have placed ETH at $7,500 before the end of this year, implying that Ethereum would likely retain a lead in market value even as XRP expands. Drivers of Growth The bank attributes much of its optimistic outlook to several near-term catalysts. A central factor is the possibility of U.S. regulators approving a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP by October. Standard Chartered estimates that such a product could generate inflows ranging from $4 billion to $8 billion within its initial year of operation. Another important development has been the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case was settled for $125 million, with no further appeals pending. This outcome has removed a significant source of regulatory uncertainty that had weighed on XRP for years. Beyond regulatory clarity, the bank points to the continued utility of the XRP Ledger as a cross-border payments platform. Its efficiency and low transaction costs have positioned it as a competitive alternative to legacy settlement systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s recent initiatives, including the launch of its stablecoin RLUSD and broader tokenization strategies, are also highlighted as potential contributors to adoption. Challenges and Competitive Pressures Despite the constructive outlook, Standard Chartered emphasizes that risks remain. XRP’s relatively limited developer base and minimal transaction fees may reduce its capacity to capture long-term value compared to other blockchain networks. In addition, the rise of stablecoins, rival digital assets, and central bank digital currencies presents meaningful competition in the payments market that XRP seeks to serve. The Broader Market Context Kendrick’s report places XRP’s growth within the wider expansion of the digital asset sector. His long-term view includes a projection of Bitcoin reaching $500,000 by 2029. Should this scenario materialize, the increased visibility and liquidity of the overall market could reinforce momentum in alternative assets such as XRP. Standard Chartered’s outlook positions XRP as one of the most significant cryptocurrencies to watch over the next three years. While challenges remain, the combination of institutional adoption, potential ETF approval, and Ripple’s continued expansion in payments and tokenization underpins the bank’s belief that XRP could cross the $12 threshold by 2028.

Analysts forecast up to 30x ROI as interest builds ahead of broader market rallies. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Among the Best Presales Today The MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has become one of the most talked-about events in the market this year. With over 15,000 wallets participating and more than $14 million already raised, the project has captured attention for its fair tokenomics and zero-tax model. Early forecasts suggest up to 30x ROI could be on the table, putting it in the spotlight for presale buyers. Security and Transparency Driving Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE places emphasis on safety and openness, backed by independent audits from HashEx and an ongoing CertiK review. The token follows a fully decentralized structure with no hidden allocations, making it attractive for those looking for transparency. Its wallet compatibility across MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet further builds confidence in accessibility and reliability. Bitcoin’s Rise Creates Room for Altcoin Outperformance Bitcoin is once again at the center of bullish long-term predictions, with industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong forecasting prices as high as $1 million by 2030. As the leading digital asset strengthens, it often creates a favorable environment for smaller tokens to surge beyond expectations. History shows that when Bitcoin rallies, investor interest in alternative projects grows rapidly. This backdrop is why many see MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the hidden winners. With a fair launch model and no insider allocations, the project is well-positioned to capture attention as traders look beyond Bitcoin for higher ROI opportunities. Conclusion For those seeking the best presales today, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to stand out with forecasts pointing to 30x ROI. With the presale still open, traders have a limited window to secure an early position before exchange listings.

According to data from CoinGecko, the price of ETH increased by more than 14% on the day. After its initial struggles during the week, the Ethereum price finished by reclaiming and surpassing its former all-time high of $4,878, reached as far back as 2021. Interestingly, a prominent crypto founder has put forward an audacious prediction for the price of Ethereum over the next few months if it breaks its record high. What’s Next For ETH Price? In an August 22 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson shared an exciting prognosis for the Ethereum price in the coming months. According to the crypto expert, the second-largest cryptocurrency may be entering another fear-driven scenario before the start of a new re-accumulation phase if it doesn’t cross the former record high. Related Reading: Analyst Puts XRP Cycle Top Above $20, But Says Price Must Hold Last Line Of Defense Wedson revealed the possibility of algorithmic trading activity clustering around the $7,000 – $7,500 range, further strengthening the case for a reaccumulation stage. This pattern can be associated with cycle shifts where market makers absorb liquidity, suppress volatility, and set themselves up for the next round of major capital inflows. The Alphractal founder highlighted that the Ethereum price movements have coincided with the cyclical pattern of Bitcoin’s market dominance. As shown in previous fractal cycles, the price of ETH tends to absorb a significant share of Bitcoin’s capital flow, typically after 28 days of BTC price consolidation. Wedson revealed that the current market data suggests this pattern may be playing out again, increasing the chances of Ethereum price embarking on an extended rally over the next few months. It is worth noting that the price of ETH has reached a new all-time high, implying that the altcoin may not even witness the initial downside volatility before entering a new growth phase. The crypto expert, however, urged investors to do their due diligence, as the market data only looks at the typical behavior of Market Makers during cycle transitions. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $4,716, reflecting an almost 9% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the altcoin is up by more than 11% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weakness Vs.

With several months to go in 2025, analysts are highlighting a number of projects as the best altcoin to buy now. While analysts’ watchlists would often feature established tokens such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink, a newcomer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has made its way into the list, indicating its potential to deliver massive returns to investors. XRP and ADA Outlook XRP is trading around $2.89, but recent pullbacks haven’t scared off long-term holders. Ripple’s slowed token release schedule and its position in cross-border payments suggest room for growth, with some predictions calling for $4.78 or more in the next cycle. Cardano is sitting close to $1.00 and has whales quietly buying up nearly $100 million in ADA this summer. That kind of confidence, paired with upgrades like Hydra that improve speed and scalability, makes ADA a strong contender on lists of the best altcoins for 2025. LINK’s Continues to Gather Strength Meanwhile, Chainlink recently climbed above $26 after a series of buybacks and high-profile partnerships with names like ICE and Google Cloud. With nearly 40% of its supply staked, LINK continues to look like a long-term infrastructure play. Analysts following the token highlighted its potential to deliver gains but noted such gains may be incomparable to that of newer and emerging altcoin contenders. Analysts Predict Up to 5000% ROI For MAGACOIN FINANCE Holders XRP, ADA, LINK—and now MAGACOIN FINANCE —are topping analyst lists of best altcoins to buy for 2025. However, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only project that could deliver up to 5,000% ROI for investors. The reasons are clear. The slowdown in the market appears to have no effect on the project as momentum is building. Traders following the token say its trajectory mirrors life-changing rallies from previous bull cycles. That sounds bold, but experts argue it’s not out of the question. Why? Because MAGACOIN FINANCE combines a rare mix of utility, hype, and community backing, and these are factors investors look for when markets heat up. Bottom Line If 2025 plays out like past bull runs, the winners may not only be Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP, ADA, LINK, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are on track to deliver strong narratives and, potentially, explosive gains. However, for investors hoping to make massive returns on their investment, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned the pick as the best altcoin to buy in 2025.

Many are seeking early-stage projects with strong fundamentals that can outperform established giants. Hidden gem presales are attracting attention not only for their upside potential but also for their ability to outpace even blue-chip tokens. Among the fresh names making waves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about projects, with analysts linking it to extraordinary ROI projections. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight The MAGACOIN FINANCE forecast is shaking up discussions across trading circles. Analysts are projecting a staggering 22,500% return, pushing it far ahead of traditional players. Touted as one of the best crypto presale events of 2025, expectations now suggest a possible 40x rise. The excitement is driven by strong community backing and capped availability, which has fueled urgency among those chasing early entry. In comparison to legacy coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the bold new contender—an option for those hunting presales with high ROI . 2. Cardano: Q4 Upgrades and Bullish Outlook The Cardano price outlook for 2025 has been steadily improving thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Analysts remain optimistic: Digital Coin Price sees ADA climbing as high as $2.69 with an average of $2.46. CoinCodex pushes the ceiling even higher, projecting a $5.33 maximum target. Whale activity is also ramping up, with 200 million ADA bought in just 48 hours. Beyond speculation, Cardano is actively building. Hydra’s Layer-2 scaling reached one million transactions per second in tests, while Project Acropolis is cutting sync times by 40%. Cardano 1Y price chart With ETF approval odds surging past 80% on Polymarket, bullish bets are growing stronger. This makes Cardano one of the top crypto investments 2025 could deliver. 3. MATIC/POL: Bold Targets and Expanding Utility Polygon has undergone one of the most ambitious transitions in the space with its full migration to POL. The MATIC bullish prediction for 2025 paints an aggressive picture: Flitpay puts the top target at $6.25. TokenMetrics anticipates $3.91 by year-end. Participation in the migration has exceeded 85%, highlighting strong community support. Polygon’s AggLayer and Chain Development Kit are unlocking cross-chain liquidity, while 100 million POL are allocated yearly for project growth. With predictions spanning from $0.47 at the low end to multiple dollars in bullish scenarios, the MATIC bullish prediction narrative is hard to ignore. Like Cardano, Polygon is positioning itself among the top crypto investments 2025 watchers are tracking closely. Final Word: Which Hidden Gem Presales Stand Out? For those eyeing hidden gem presales, the field looks stacked with opportunities. Cardano and MATIC remain strong candidates thanks to robust development and institutional interest. However, the MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one turning heads with its bold 22,500% ROI projection. The limited entry slots and a fast-growing community narrative make it one of the presales with high ROI traders don’t want to overlook. In short, while ADA and MATIC are cementing their place as reliable long-term holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in as the rising star tipped as the best crypto presale of 2025.

Avalanche (AVAX) price analysis shows an asset attempting to rebuild momentum, bolstered by network growth and a lift in derivatives activity. Kaspa (KAS), meanwhile, sits on unstable footing with its price clinging to the $0.09 zone. By contrast, BlockDAG has redefined what presale credibility looks like in 2025. Having already raised over $380 million, priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29 ahead of a $0.05 launch, the project has backed its fundraising with concrete delivery. Dashboard V4, fresh security validations, and a live Explorer tool have turned attention firmly in its direction. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Analysis: Recovery Meets Barriers Avalanche has shown signs of recovery but still faces a steep climb. Trading near $25, AVAX is up 21% from August lows, reflecting renewed speculative interest. Yet this recovery is fragile, prices remain 58% below December highs and over 80% under its peak levels. Data shows AVAX search activity climbing sharply, hinting at growing retail focus, while derivatives open interest surged to $854 million. At the same time, AVAX faces heavy resistance near $27, a barrier that has capped upward movement. Trading activity on decentralized exchanges has also rebounded to late-2024 levels, strengthening the case for resilience. Fundamentally, Avalanche is making moves with Visa integration for stablecoin settlement and plans to onboard $250 million in tokenized assets. But until spot buying strengthens, the project risks being trapped under strong overhead pressure, keeping its bullish case unproven. Kaspa (KAS) Price Prediction: Holding a Fragile Line Kaspa’s setup reflects the difficulty of sustaining upward momentum in a cautious market. Trading at $0.0889, the price recently lost the $0.09 handle, marking a 3% decline on the day. Immediate resistance sits between $0.092 and $0.095, while firmer resistance is at $0.10. On the downside, support has weakened at $0.087, with risk extending to $0.084 or even $0.080 if selling accelerates. Volume rose slightly during the pullback, showing active selling rather than panic. Open interest holds steady at $470 million, suggesting participation remains engaged, though the tilt toward short positions shows bearish conviction building. Unless Kaspa reclaims $0.092 with volume support, the likely outcome is a sideways range between $0.087 and $0.092. The current setup points to a cautious stalemate rather than decisive growth. BlockDAG: Dashboard V4, Security Validation, and Explorer Drive Momentum BlockDAG is setting itself apart with delivery that underlines its presale momentum. Now in Batch 29 at $0.0276, with a confirmed $0.05 launch price, the presale has secured over $380 million, cementing one of the most successful early-stage raises this cycle. Unlike projects relying solely on chart setups, BlockDAG has introduced features designed for usability and trust. Dashboard V4 is at the center of this progress. Functioning like a full trading platform, it includes live BDAG charts, order book data, instant buy/sell access, and wallet monitoring. Leaderboards and referral tracking add gamification, making the presale interactive and transparent, while giving participants a preview of post-launch trading. On the security front, BlockDAG passed audits from CertiK and Halborn, ensuring system integrity after early refinements. Multi-signature protocols and parallel Proof-of-Work mechanisms enhance network resilience. This security-first approach offers peace of mind, often missing in presale projects. The BlockDAG Explorer further raises the bar. It allows real-time monitoring of transactions, miner output, and network throughput while also doubling as an educational hub with on-chain credentials. This combination of visibility and learning deepens community engagement and builds confidence in the network. Together, Dashboard V4, robust security measures, and the Explorer illustrate why BlockDAG’s presale is more than fundraising; it’s structured growth with transparency and functionality. Final Take Avalanche’s recent recovery has fueled optimism, but overhead resistance continues to hold back momentum. Kaspa’s price prediction shows a coin trading on fragile ground, with sideways action likely unless bulls take control. Both show promise but remain mired in technical uncertainty. BlockDAG, by contrast, has delivered $380M in presale funding, coupled with tangible features like Dashboard V4, completed audits, and the Explorer. With a structured price path toward $0.05 and infrastructure already live, it has shifted the conversation from speculation to delivery. While others battle resistance and fragile sentiment, BlockDAG is building measurable foundations, making it one of the most decisive projects to watch in 2025.

Bitcoin dominance holds, altcoin rotations are getting stronger and institutions are sustaining the flow in the direction of mainstream adoption. As far as many investors are concerned, it is no longer a question of whether it is going to occur at all in 2025, but how to position themselves to reap the most benefits when the bull run takes place. In the dynamic environment, along with reputable projects such as Ethereum and Solana, new presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as prospective early-cycle beneficiaries. Lessons from Past Bull Runs Looking back provides clear guidance. The 2017 rally resulted in Ethereum increasing in value by over 1,000% after liquidity ran out of Bitcoin. In 2021, meme tokens such as Dogecoin and SHIBA INU surprised markets by generating some of the most considerable returns of the cycle. The unifying factor was timing, investors that got in before mainstream awareness bottoms had a huge winning capture as momentum investors ride the exponential wave. This pattern is why analysts are emphasizing preparing early. Anticipating the headlines to signal a bull run is likely to mean a missed opportunity. In 2025, the strategy will focus on the assortment between mature players, cross-checking Bitcoin dominance as an indicator of rotation, and investing in good presale propositions. The Role of Presales in Bull Markets Presales have historically offered unique opportunities. They enable investors to invest before exchange listing and at reduced valuations, as projects gain traction and community support. When the larger altcoin season hits, these presales will have the ability to provide multiples that other larger-cap tokens will not be able to match. The risks of presales are, of course, present, but teams have to come through with what they promise, communities have to remain engaged, and further utility has to develop. Of the bull runs, though, at least a few tokens in the presale phase have become household names, minting fortunes to early adopters. That is why presales are being treated more and more as the high-reward element of gearing up for the next bull run. In this presale story, one of the most talked-about opportunities is MAGACOIN FINANCE. What is special about it is the scarcity of supply, branding, and timing. Allocation rounds are limited and they sell out fast, making the need to be positioned early especially important to investors. It has cultural currency, with a politically motivated brand that makes it stand out even outside tech and crypto communities. Analysts note that forecasts predict a 55x–65x ROI as presale momentum accelerates with early buyers securing bonuses. This projection is made together along the aspect of scarcity and increase in whale-interest in proportion to the privacy of long holders who build up in anticipation of the availability of an exchange. The ecosystem that is growing around the project is supportive of the sentiment that MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than just the hype- it is a narrative-driven project that follows structural market trends. Timing the Market: Why Preparation Matters Markets rarely reward hesitation. By the time it is in full retail swing, much of the upside may already be reflected in the price. Getting ready for 2025 suggests paying attention to rotation signs, Bitcoin consolidating after new peaks, Ethereum getting stronger with institutional flows, and liquidity starting to overspill to altcoins. This is the time when presale initiatives such as MAGACOIN FINANCE find the project stories catch fire. The advantage of having a position secured in advance is that the investor is not anxious to get green candles but is in a position to ride out this natural cycle. Practical Steps for Investors Not just token selection can get people ready to experience a bull run. Risk management remains vital. Limits of setting allocations, balancing between previous and emergent assets, and the use of secure wallets are available in constructing a sustainable plan. Investors should also monitor any regulatory solutions: welcomed explicitness could quicken the take-up. Findings narratives are equally important to metrics at the same time. In 2017, DeFi was barely on the radar. By 2021, it was central to the cycle. The process of tokenization of real-life assets, meme culture, and politically appealing branding could be such factors in 2025. A project such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, compatible with these stories, can be one of the largest beneficiaries. Conclusion: Positioning Ahead of the Curve The bull run of 2025 is on the horizon, and being prepared will mean average good gains or big ones. It is shown time and again that the first mover, the one who understands how to diversify, and those who align themselves with breakout narratives in the market tap into the greatest riches. As the forecasts indicate, its ROI is expected to be 55x65x, and each of the presale rounds is selling out especially fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates the philosophy of being ahead of the curve. For investors seeking to reposition themselves for the next cycle strategically, it presents one of the most interesting opportunities in an already competitive market.

But the tale could be much longer than the memecoin’s typical volatility, because Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes center stage with a whale surge that indicates widespread bullish sentiment. Over 15500 investors have already invested in the project presale, and over $14.7 million has already been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has just begun presale stage 6. Price will rise 14.29% to $0.04 in stage 7. As DOGE continues to follow, Mutuum Finance’s recent movements show that shrewd positioning by large holders may be setting the stage for a wider rally within the next couple of weeks. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Weathering Resistance in the Face of Market Activity Dogecoin (DOGE) exchanges hands at $0.2210, a 4.35% gain over the past 24 hours. The token recently broke out of levels of consolidation, gaining a 26% increase and reaching its initial resistance level target between $0.23–$0.34. The price is having difficulties overcoming the $0.24 resistance level, which is the point of turning for a probable increase. Analysts are observing a rounding bottom pattern, and it is reported that a breakout above $0.29 will drive DOGE to $0.80. Alternatively, failure to hold support at $0.215–$0.221 may lead to a drop to $0.20. While the direction of price in Dogecoin remains in the balance, increasing whale activity in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can also influence overall sentiment in the market. Mutuum Finance Pre-empts to Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance just concluded Phase 5 of its presale and entered Phase 6. Tokens are bought in Phase 6 for $0.035 apiece. The presale itself has been an enormous success, with over $14.75 million in capital and over 15,550 holders worldwide. This level of ramping reflects the confidence of the community in the project as well as the prospects of the project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Token demand continues to rise with every subsequent presale round, reflecting high levels of consumer demand as well as mounting adoption levels for Mutuum Finance. The transition to Phase 6 is not just the crossover point of community expectation but also a strategic development roadmap that the project has been adhering to. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Partners with CertiK for a $50K Bug Bounty. Following its quest for utmost security and openness, Mutuum Finance joined hands with CertiK, a leading blockchain security and auditing firm. It also introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program to entice security researchers and white-hat hackers to find any probable loopholes in the system. Further measures have been put in place to increase security.

With analysts spotlighting familiar names like XRP and Stellar, one surprising entry is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Tipped for a massive surge, this rising player is drawing early attention as traders weigh where the next wave of top presale coins will come from. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Force in the 2025 Cycle MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines as analysts forecast it could deliver up to a 20,000% ROI. While established tokens dominate conversations around the best crypto presales, MAGACOIN is breaking through as a new contender. Early allocations are already gaining traction, with forecasts placing it among the top presale coins of the year. Unlike legacy tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on fresh momentum, with projections that it may rival or even surpass older networks in growth rate. For investors searching the best crypto presale to buy now, this project offers a blend of hype and upside potential rarely seen in the cycle. XRP Price Prediction: Eyes on ETF Approval When it comes to legacy tokens in the best crypto discussion, XRP continues to stand tall. Analysts frame its price trajectory in 2025 around ETF approval and regulatory clarity. Projections place XRP between $3 and $5 by late 2025, with bullish scenarios aiming for $5.50 if flows and institutional adoption expand. This XRP price prediction shows how one regulatory move could reshape the market. With the SEC delaying spot XRP ETF filings to October 2025, traders are watching closely. For anyone tracking the best altcoins to buy now, XRP’s position as a long-term utility coin is hard to ignore. Stellar Crypto Forecast: Network Upgrades Fueling Momentum Stellar’s growth path in 2025 looks increasingly tied to its network upgrades. Analysts set bullish targets of up to $1.29 for XLM, while more conservative forecasts outline a band between $0.48 and $0.75. Both ranges highlight strong upside if adoption continues. A big part of the Stellar crypto forecast revolves around the Protocol 23 upgrade set for validator vote in August 2025. The upgrade will add parallel execution for Soroban smart contracts, unified events, and better cost structures. These technical moves are expected to lift Stellar’s throughput and long-term adoption. Within the discussion of top presale coins, Stellar continues to hold its place thanks to both utility and development consistency. Final Thoughts: 3 Coins to Watch in 2025 The race for the best crypto presales 2025 comes down to a mix of legacy giants and rising contenders. XRP has its ETF-driven upside, Stellar shows strength through technical growth, and MAGACOIN FINANCE adds fresh fuel with a forecasted 20,000% ROI. For investors scanning top presale coins, the blend of established credibility and new explosive potential makes this group stand out. MAGACOIN FINANCE, while newer, is quickly becoming one of the most discussed names in crypto circles, showing why many view it as one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Institutional and retail flows are still gravitating towards seasoned players XRP and Polygon (MATIC), but MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted more and more as the breakout altcoin to catch and is tipped to provide 20,000% ROI this next rally. Given the mounting whale-backed demand for the token and growing speculation about future listings, it is a smart bet for 2025. XRP Consolidating Near $3 With Institutional Accumulation XRP price has seen a slight dip, closely hovering around the $3.00 mark. Although the token may experience price changes, strong institutional support and whale buying activity will help maintain a price floor in the short to medium term. Many XRP price predictions point to Ripple’s partnerships with banks and payment providers as a reason for its strength. Analysts believe XRP will become the global standard for cross-border settlements. XRP is one of the top tokens to buy for long-term growth amid ETF speculation. Polygon (MATIC) Building Utility Through Upgrades Polygon’s switch to the POL token is going well. Besides, the development of its network in 2025 has been significantly large. Recently, the total value locked in DeFi has increased to more than $1.2 billion. Moreover, the rise is due to new protocols. The new scaling solutions, which will allow 5,000+ transactions per second, show how Polygon is the premier layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. MATIC’s institutional appeal may be boosted by these updates, giving it a long-term play potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE Drawing Whale Attention While XRP and MATIC remain solid, XRP and MATIC are strong contenders, but analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout altcoin to watch, with forecasts of 20,000% ROI potential in the next bull cycle. Backed by whale inflows and speculation over future exchange listings, it’s being called one of the best cryptos to buy now . Early investors using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, though allocations are disappearing fast. This combination of scarcity and mounting demand is setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from other presales. Analysts argue that its trajectory mirrors the early stages of Ethereum and Solana before their exponential growth, positioning it as one of the most compelling high-upside opportunities heading into 2025. Investor excitement is further fueled by MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparent audits, whale accumulation, and the narrative energy driving its community momentum. Other Altcoins With Bullish Potential Aside from the three, several other altcoins are gaining investor attention. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently holding steady above $540, with technical indicators suggesting a move to $600. In the meantime, Kaspa (KAS) is trading in consolidation near $0.086, where forecasts for more gains are up as activity on the network grows, as do new exchange listings. You should look beyond the majors to find other strong accumulation plays. Conclusion: Strategic Accumulation for 2025 The next bull cycle will see massive returns in fundamentally sound and fundamentally speculative projects. XRP and MATIC are two coins that would be dependable at this stage, given their institutional adoption and technical growth. The likelihood of MAGACOIN FINANCE being one of the biggest wildcard high-upsides of this cycle with a whopping 20,000% ROI of the forecast. As presale allocations dwindle and whale inflows increase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being eyed as a token to watch in 2025.

Market Context According to CoinDesk Data , ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at about $4,783 at the time of writing, near its all-time highs, reflecting strong investor demand amid growing institutional adoption. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, CIO of Fundstrat Capital and chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), told CoinDesk last month that ETH could reach $15,000 by the end of 2025. His comments highlight renewed optimism around Ethereum's growing importance for stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Direct ETH ownership: the purest play Owning ETH outright is the most straightforward way to participate. Holders gain full control of the asset and direct access to Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT and staking ecosystems. ETH trades 24/7 across global markets, but investors must manage custody and security — whether through self custody wallets or third party custodians — and contend with evolving regulations. Costs are generally limited to exchange fees and gas. Spot ETH ETFs: regulated simplicity, with staking proposals pending Spot ether ETFs have made it possible for traditional investors to gain regulated ETH exposure through brokerage accounts. Some issuers are now seeking permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to add staking to their products. If approved, staking would allow funds to earn additional yield by securing Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network and pass that income to shareholders. That would represent a first for U.S. crypto ETFs. Prominent ETF analyst Nate Geraci said on July 30 that staking-enabled ether ETFs are likely to be “the SEC’s next hit list” before it takes up applications for other spot crypto products. His point reflects a broader expectation that regulators will scrutinize staking first, since it blends DeFi-native mechanics with traditional fund structures. For investors, that means staking-enabled ETFs could reshape exposure by adding income streams beyond price appreciation — but only if regulators are satisfied that custody, transparency and market manipulation concerns are addressed. For now, the SEC has acknowledged amendments to allow staking but has not yet granted approval, leaving timing uncertain. Corporate treasuries: equity exposure with added volatility Another path is investing in shares of publicly-traded companies that hold ether in their treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, for example, disclosed on Aug. 18 holdings over 1.5 million ETH currently worth around $7.3 billion. This approach ties shareholder value to ETH price movements and, potentially, corporate staking income. But equity exposure adds new risks: Capital raising risk: Companies need strong share prices to issue new equity for ETH purchases. A weak stock price directly limits their ability to grow treasuries. Double volatility: Even if ETH rises, the company’s stock might fall due to unrelated factors (earnings, sentiment, governance), meaning investors face risks beyond ETH’s price swings. Comparing the options Direct ETH Pros: Full control, access to DeFi/NFTs, 24/7 liquidity Cons: Custody and security risks, regulatory uncertainty Best for: Hands on investors comfortable with wallets Spot ETH ETFs Pros: Regulated, simple brokerage access, potential staking yield (if approved) Cons: Fees, SEC hurdles, no DeFi access Best for: Traditional investors seeking simplicity Corporate Treasuries Pros: Exposure to ETH plus potential corporate growth/staking returns Cons: Double volatility, dilution risk, governance exposure Best for: Equity investors looking for a hybrid play Choosing a path With ETH near record highs and bold forecasts fueling investor interest, the question for 2025 is less about whether to own ether and more about which vehicle best fits each investor’s risk appetite.",Markets|Ethereum|Ether|ETH|Ether ETFs|Ethereum Treasury|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-24 01:34:43

These presale tokens come with the possibility of going up in value by multiples, giving investors a scarce chance to jump on a project before it becomes popular. This week, three standout projects are being ranked among the best crypto presales to buy now: MAGACOIN FINANCE , Bitcoin (BTC) , and Dogecoin (DOGE) —tipped for 30x ROI potential by leading analysts. These tokens are prime candidates for explosive growth due to certain factors. Let’s analyze those factors one by one. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Breakout Presale With 30x Potential At the top of the best crypto presales list is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a powerful new project capturing major attention in the early investment community. Experts believe it has the right mix of early-stage potential, strong community support, and growth-focused tokenomics. It’s gaining attention as a high-upside choice for those seeking big returns this cycle. The countdown is live and only a limited number of tokens remain. Demand is surging before the next price jump. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been selected as one of the best altcoins to buy for investors building aggressive bull run portfolios. For investors seeking massive upside in early-stage crypto, MAGACOIN FINANCE ranks among the best crypto presales available this year — and possibly this cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) — Market Leader Now Entering a Strategic Accumulation Phase While Bitcoin is recording strong surges, many analysts are treating the current market consolidation near $113,000–$114,000 as a rare “re-entry window” — and with good reason. BTC recently slipped below $114,000 amid heightened trading volume and mixed sentiment. Support lies at $112,000 with bears watching the $110,000 level. However, U.S. banking groups are pushing for friendlier crypto regulations, and the SEC is updating oversight policies, potentially paving the way for broader institutional access. BTC/USDT Chart: TradingView Despite volatility, major players like Harvard and MicroStrategy continue buying. Over 30% of circulating BTC is now held by centralized institutions. If BTC rebounds above $116K, analysts forecast a retest of $120K and possibly new highs by Q4. For long-term investors, Bitcoin remains one of the best crypto presales in spirit — offering a relatively discounted price for an asset still poised to lead the next bull run. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Coin King Ripe for Institutional Breakout Dogecoin continues to surprise analysts with its growing institutional appeal and on-chain adoption. Though not a traditional presale, DOGE’s current price action and whale activity make it behave like a stealth presale opportunity before the next big breakout. DOGE is trading just above critical support at $0.22. Analysts warn of a drop to $0.18 if support breaks, but a rebound to $0.30 is likely with ETF approval news. With an 80% approval probability, Dogecoin could be the next meme coin to attract institutional ETF capital. The growing number of Dogecoin application scenarios, investors’ trust in it, and the favorable regulatory outlook are all factors that make the presale of Dogecoin one of the best in the crypto space with the potential of a steep rise of value, thus turning it into an asset that is still valuable at its current price. Final Verdict: Best Crypto Presales for 30x Gains When identifying the best crypto presales , it’s not always about brand-new coins — it’s about timing, potential, and momentum . MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin each represent unique opportunities to invest before major price moves. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new investor, now is the time to act. MAGACOIN FINANCE the best crypto presales to consider this week — before the next leg of the bull market begins.

Instead of pushing endless ads or chasing flashy exchange listings, it has grown steadily, pulling in $380 million through its presale, onboarding 2.5 million mobile miners, and attracting 4,500 developers before its mainnet is even live. The project’s approach raises an important question: can this quiet but powerful momentum carry it into the top 50 cryptocurrencies? A Deliberate Path Toward Growth BlockDAG’s presale stands out for its structure and discipline. Currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276, the project has already sold 25.3 billion coins. Compared to other 2025 presales that have struggled to hit even eight figures, raising nearly $400 million without an exchange listing shows an unusual level of confidence. What’s more, wallets linked to larger players have joined in, suggesting that attention is moving beyond small-scale buyers. This steady buildup feels similar to the early stories of Avalanche or Kaspa. Both built their infrastructure first, then scaled visibility. For BlockDAG, the presale itself has doubled as a test of how much traction can be achieved before launch. So far, the numbers speak for themselves. Beyond capital, the activity around the project is significant. More than 300 decentralized applications are already being built, supported by compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). That choice allows developers to bring existing projects over with minimal friction. The network design also plays a role. Its hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG system has demonstrated speeds of up to 10 blocks per second, outpacing many established blockchains. By building scalability into the base layer, BlockDAG avoids the common trap of patching performance issues after demand spikes. By launch, it won’t be entering an empty arena. It will have nearly 19,400 miners sold, more than $7.8 million generated through hardware sales, millions of users engaged, and developers already building. That foundation could make the early trading phase more stable than most new listings. Why Analysts Consider the Top 50 Possible Reaching the top 50 requires more than hype; it demands strong capitalization, wide liquidity, and real usage. If BlockDAG launches at its projected $0.05, the market cap could immediately push into the billion-dollar range. With a large presale base spread across millions of holders, liquidity will also be less concentrated, helping resist the sharp swings often seen in young projects. The psychological angle matters too. Unlike projects that burn bright and fade quickly, BlockDAG has kept expectations measured. There’s no loud promise of instant dominance, just a patient build-up of tangible milestones. This approach lowers the risk of backlash and sets a steadier path for adoption. Looking Ahead Of course, success isn’t guaranteed. The market is full of examples where projects raised heavily and built well, only to lose relevance. BlockDAG still has to prove long-term activity, maintain developer interest, and deliver consistent user engagement. Yet, its current track record is hard to dismiss: $380 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, 2.5 million miners active, 4,500 developers building, and nearly 19,400 hardware units shipped. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% gains from Batch 1 to Batch 29, with the presale momentum showing no signs of slowing. If those figures translate into strong on-chain activity after launch, slipping into the top 50 becomes not just possible, but likely. And for a project that has built its foundation almost quietly, that outcome would speak volumes.

MAGACOIN FINANCE—Analysts See a 70x Surge Potential While HBAR, LINK, and SUI are looking strong, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the hidden gem of this cycle. Forecasts indicate that it might jump 70x, and early adopters are already feeling the FOMO . Adding to this is a 50% extra bonus thanks to code PATRIOT50X—early investors get more upside before the market gets going. People don’t want to miss out on MAGA in 2025 because of its growing community and appeal. Final Outlook The pursuit of the hidden gems is gaining momentum as the next bull market approaches. HBAR, LINK, and SUI all stand on the verge of great breakouts, but the altcoin on everyone mind at the moment is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Investors are keen on this one while it is still young to get an edge.

Cardano, NEAR, Hedera, VeChain, and MAGACOIN Finance are all drawing attention as options trading under $100 that could see more interest this year. Cardano (ADA) Holds Institutional Interest At $0.85, Cardano remains one of the best crypto options under $100 in 2025. Despite a pullback, ADA has gained over 141% year-on-year, with development activity still among the most active in the market. Grayscale’s Cardano ETF filing adds an institutional layer, suggesting possible future traction. With strong research-driven development and consistent ecosystem upgrades, ADA’s narrative remains centered on adoption and growing recognition. NEAR Protocol’s Expanding Ecosystem NEAR Protocol is currently priced at $2.45, making it a budget-friendly pick under $100. NEAR has posted a 31.9% gain over the last 60 days, showing steady progress in both ecosystem development and staking adoption. Its network efficiency and growing developer community keep it relevant in an increasingly competitive market. As altcoin liquidity returns, NEAR is positioned as one of the more accessible plays in 2025’s digital asset space. Hedera (HBAR) Drives RWA Tokenization Hedera, trading at $0.23, is carving out a role in the tokenization market. Its partnership with Swarm enables 24/7 tokenized stock trading for Apple and Tesla, giving it a unique use case among public blockchains. With Aberdeen Group and other institutions exploring tokenization, Hedera’s relevance to real-world finance is increasing. Its growing stablecoin activity highlights a clear push toward scaling in the $16 trillion-plus tokenized asset market. VeChain (VET) Expands Utility Through Partnerships VeChain, at just $0.02, continues to rank among the best crypto to buy under $100 thanks to its mix of utility and enterprise links. Its Stargate staking program drew over $125M, reflecting engaged community participation. The new integration with Wanchain unlocks cross-chain DeFi functionality, expanding use cases beyond supply chain solutions. Combined with its historically low inflation model, VeChain remains one of the more practical altcoins on the market. MAGACOIN Finance: Undervalued Gem Under $1 MAGACOIN Finance enters the conversation as an undervalued altcoin priced far below $1. Traders often recall missed opportunities with Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which were once available at similar low levels before wider recognition. Unlike many meme-inspired tokens, MAGACOIN combines cultural appeal with real DeFi utility, building credibility with audits and transparent tokenomics. For those seeking a low-entry option under $100, MAGACOIN Finance is being compared to early-stage opportunities once overlooked. What Should Traders Do? For those exploring the best crypto to buy under $100 in 2025, these five altcoins offer a mix of affordability and unique stories. MAGACOIN Finance stands out for those looking for a new entry point, particularly while it remains under $1.

Currently priced at $2.85 with a market cap of over $300 million, Pudgy Penguins has built a solid community and gained popularity for its unique character and meme status. However, the volatile nature of the crypto market has left many investors wondering: Will Pudgy Penguins maintain its momentum in 2025, or is it due for a setback? Despite its meme coin status, Pudgy Penguins has garnered attention for its staying power. However, recent market conditions have raised concerns, with some analysts suggesting that its price may not see a substantial increase in 2025. In contrast, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is creating a buzz, with early-stage investors already seeing impressive returns. At a presale price of $0.00088, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an exciting opportunity for those seeking higher potential returns in the meme coin space. What’s Next for Pudgy Penguins in 2025? As we look ahead to 2025, predictions for Pudgy Penguins are mixed. Some analysts forecast a modest price increase, with potential growth to $5 by the end of the year, while others predict that the coin could fall to $2 or lower. Pudgy Penguins’ success in 2025 will depend heavily on several key factors. One of the most important will be community engagement. Pudgy Penguins has one of the most active fan bases in the meme coin space, and the success of the coin will be largely driven by whether this community continues to support it. Another key factor will be broader market sentiment. Like all meme coins, Pudgy Penguins’ price is closely tied to the overall state of the cryptocurrency market. A downturn in major coins like Bitcoin could negatively impact the price of meme coins, including Pudgy Penguins. Despite these uncertainties, Pudgy Penguins’ cultural relevance in the meme coin space cannot be ignored. For investors willing to take the risk, Pudgy Penguins still offers a unique opportunity, but only time will tell if it will continue its upward momentum in 2025. Will Pudgy Penguins Continue to Attract Whales? Whale activity plays a pivotal role in the price movements of meme coins, and for Pudgy Penguins, large investors (whales) have shown interest. However, sustained engagement from these whales remains uncertain. Meme coins like Pudgy Penguins are often driven by speculation, and their value can fluctuate rapidly. Without significant utility or partnerships, Pudgy Penguins might not be able to retain the interest of institutional investors or long-term holders. In contrast, Arctic Pablo Coin has been designed to attract a broad range of investors, including whales, with its staking rewards and community-driven incentives. The presale model allows early investors to lock in a guaranteed return, which makes it more appealing to larger investors who typically seek stability and high potential returns. What Does 2026 Hold for Pudgy Penguins? Looking to the future, projections for Pudgy Penguins in 2026 are somewhat uncertain. Some analysts believe Pudgy Penguins could continue to grow if it solidifies its brand and expands its community engagement. If the coin continues to perform well, it could reach a price of $10 by 2026. However, without significant developments or real-world utility, Pudgy Penguins may face challenges in maintaining its current value. The success of Pudgy Penguins in 2026 will depend largely on its ability to innovate and attract new investors. Without fresh features or use cases, the coin may struggle to compete with newer projects like Arctic Pablo Coin, which is quickly gaining traction with its unique presale structure and staking rewards. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: The Best Meme Coin to Buy in 2025 While Pudgy Penguins has a loyal following, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly gaining traction with its presale. Currently priced at $0.00088, the Arctic Pablo Coin presale has raised over $3.5 million, attracting significant investor interest. With its 66% APY staking rewards and the innovative BONUS100 token bonus, Arctic Pablo Coin presents a promising opportunity for those looking for high returns in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining attention for several reasons. The staking rewards of 66% APY make it an attractive option for investors seeking passive income. By staking their tokens, investors can earn rewards while their holdings grow. In addition, the presale success is noteworthy. Over $3.5 million has been raised already, and early-stage investors are seeing promising returns. Based on analyst predictions, Arctic Pablo Coin could see a price increase to $0.10 by the end of 2025. Investors entering the presale now could see returns as high as 11,263.63% if the coin reaches its predicted price. The presale offers exciting incentives for early investors. The BONUS100 code doubles tokens, adding extra value to every investment. With a well-structured presale and the potential for high returns, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as one of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. Final Thoughts: Pudgy Penguins vs. Arctic Pablo Coin In conclusion, Pudgy Penguins remains a beloved meme coin with a strong community, but its future performance in 2025 and beyond is uncertain. While it has a solid following, the coin’s reliance on meme appeal and speculative trading could limit its growth potential. Without significant innovation or real-world utility, Pudgy Penguins may struggle to maintain its appeal in the long run. On the other hand, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a unique opportunity for investors in 2025. With its exciting presale structure, staking rewards, and high potential for ROI, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself as one of the best meme coins to buy this year. The BONUS100 code further enhances the appeal of Arctic Pablo Coin by doubling early investors’ tokens, providing a clear pathway for substantial returns.

Institutional inflows are reaching all-time highs, Bitcoin ETFs are making all of the news, and altcoins are primed for what could be the most explosive rotation since 2017. For many this year is not just another cycle, it is a test of strategy, getting the right mix of stalwarts and new entrants could lead to life-changing gains. Ethereum continues to command preference among developers for its smart contracts and DeFi capabilities, whereas Solana is beginning to make a name for itself in speed and scalability. Both are clear leaders with long-term staying power. History teaches us that the biggest surprise often comes from a lean, low-key project that can develop community momentum before mainstream coverage. In this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE has begun appearing on the investor watchlist. Hence, the race for 2025 may not just have the tried and tested names but also some breakouts. Solana: The Speed Advantage Solana is often referred to as the fastest challenger to Ethereum and has made a significant comeback in its history. Speed defines the advantage of Solana. Its transaction throughput far exceeds most of its competitors. Additionally, it charges near-zero fees. Hence, its choice of developers building consumer-facing apps. Solana’s ecosystem has slowly matured from NFTs to Gaming to DeFi with big-name partnerships and increasing retail adoption. Every day, there are more active addresses, and there is trading volume on decentralized exchanges. Solana is no longer just speculation; it’s real and alive. Analysts remain confident since Solana is consolidating price around mid-$150s. If Solana’s momentum continues, it could see new all-time highs and price discovery by late 2025, according to Crypto Goon. Solana is still known as the “Ethereum alternative” as users continue to look for faster, cheaper, and more scalable options. Still, as impressive as Ethereum and Solana are, altcoin history shows us explicitly that the largest returns usually come not from those top-tier players, but from those little-known contenders. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Contender This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which require billions in inflows to move significantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is lean, early, and primed for outsized moves. What makes it stand apart isn’t just size, it’s narrative. Tokens spurred by politics have grown very quickly in 2025, but only a few have cultural weight with real structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than just a meme or trend. This Ethereum-based project has successfully gone through audits, has a capped supply of tokens and consistently sells out early-stage allocations quickly. Analysts have often remarked that its setup is akin to the early ETH days, where timing and community power drove absurd returns. The presale has already generated momentum, with limited allocations sparking urgency among early buyers. What makes this compelling is how little liquidity MAGACOIN FINANCE needs to accelerate. In a market where billions of dollars rotate out of Bitcoin after peaks, even a fraction of those inflows can cause exponential upside for a lean project like MAGACOIN FINANCE. For newcomers and seasoned investors alike, it represents what altcoin seasons are truly about: asymmetric opportunities where risk and reward collide. Ethereum: The Utility King Ethereum is the leading platform for DeFi, NFTs and smart contracts. Despite enduring market cycles and regulatory oversight, as well as scaling difficulties, the network continues to be the ecosystem where most developers still congregate. Institutional adoption has also picked up. Investors and exchange-traded funds are scrambling for exposure, with ETH-linked products experiencing record inflows throughout the summer of the year. Analysts believe the staking economy gives ETH a new incentive structure that transforms it from a speculation-based asset into a yield-bearing instrument. For traditional investors, the combination of growth and yield makes it a familiar bridge to the future of finance on the blockchain. When talking about price, Ethereum has consolidated around $4,000-$4,200. Long-term forecasts are still predicting five-figure territory if things continue at this rate. Given its large market cap, Ethereum lacks sufficient room to grow exponentially like smaller tokens. Still, it remains the “blue-chip” token to have in any portfolio. The Case for Smaller Altcoins in 2025 The cycle is pretty much the same every time. Bitcoin rallies, Bitcoin consolidates, liquidity moves to alt. Investors will see higher returns in smaller cryptocurrencies than the larger ones like Ethereum or Solana. Mid and small cap tokens tend to do better often grossly outperforming what one may think will happen in a year. In 2017, digital currencies XRP and NEO surged ahead of Bitcoin. In 2021, it was Solana and Avalanche. The combination of story and entry by 2025 could work in favour of MAGACOIN FINANCE-like projects. Investors need to understand this rhythm. Balancing between stability (ETH, SOL) and high-upside bets (MAGACOIN FINANCE) can take a portfolio from average to exceptional. Conclusion: Building the Balanced Portfolio Tokens like Ethereum, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE show the opportunities available in 2025. For anyone looking for long-term exposure, Ethereum can be thought of as the rock-solid builder. With speed and adoption that creates momentum, Solana has a good shot at price discovery. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a classic example of altcoin season; a low market cap coin with a lot of room for upside. For new and seasoned investors alike, the lesson is clear. Don’t forget to pay attention to the giants, but also realise the importance of smaller players. Altcoin seasons are all about surprises; while Ethereum and Solana will take the lead on utility and adoption, ultimately, a token like MAGACOIN FINANCE has the potential to shock everyone with their explosive growth.

50572974,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=809333,1756002653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50572974.jpeg,Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Entering Expansion Phase – Here’s What It Means,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/analyst-says-dogecoin-price-is-entering-expansion-phase-heres-what-it-means/,"According to crypto analyst Cas Abbé, Dogecoin’s current movement suggests it is stepping into a new expansion phase after an extended period of accumulation. This development comes after months of relatively muted sentiment with strong price support, which now appears to be forming the groundwork for another strong breakout. Notably, technical analysis of various charts tracking Dogecoin’s hash rate, CVDD levels, alpha pricing, and network stress index provides context to this technical outlook, which might see Dogecoin surge to new price highs. Signs Of An Expansion Phase In Dogecoin Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Cas Abbé explained a few reasons as to why the Dogecoin price is about to enter into an expansion phase. The first being that Dogecoin has been trading inside a wide accumulation range in the past few months. This base has been at the $0.20 price level since the beginning of August. This type of prolonged base-building is mostly always known to precede sharp upward moves, as it reflects the gradual buildup of strong demand. Furthermore, the analyst noted that the current breakout attempts are backed by rising trading volume , which he interpreted as institutional accumulation . This is unlike past Dogecoin bull cycles, which were mostly based on retail hype. Technical momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are currently in a mid-range position , and this means that Dogecoin still has significant room to climb before hitting overbought conditions. Another factor is the Dogecoin mining hash rate chart. As shown in the image below, the hash rate has been rising massively since the beginning of 2025, showing that network strength has been steadily climbing even during price consolidations and declines. Historical Patterns Back Expansion Outlook One of Abbé’s key points is that Dogecoin’s price cycles have consistently followed a similar pattern of long sideways stretches followed by sudden vertical expansions. This cycle structure can be seen in the cumulative value days destroyed (CVDD) chart. As shown in the chart below, Dogecoin’s price action stayed well within its accumulation zones before breaking higher in 2018 and then in 2021. However, unlike the peaks in 2018 and 2021 where on-chain metrics were overheated, current conditions are calm, which shows more of genuine accumulation rather than profit-taking and distribution. The expansion phase is not about short-lived spikes but rather the start of a new directional trend that could redefine Dogecoin’s price structure. Although the analyst did not define a price target, technical analyses from other analysts point to price predictions that will take the Dogecoin price well above its 2021 peak of $0.7316 into the $1 threshold and beyond. A similar analysis by crypto analyst Javon Marks points to a Dogecoin price target of $1.25. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.237, up by 9.5% in the past 24 hours.

Stellar and XRP are leading discussions thanks to upgrades and ETF speculation. But analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the breakout contender, with projections hinting at up to 50x upside. Stellar’s Forecast Gains Strength Stellar (XLM) is set for growth with its Protocol 23 upgrade, designed to improve smart contract speed and reduce costs. Analysts tracking the Stellar (XLM) forecast see rising interest from DeFi projects and institutions. Price expectations range from $0.22 to $0.87 in 2025, with stretched targets near $1.44 if adoption expands. A confirmed close above $0.50 could spark rallies toward $0.64 or higher. With ISO 20022 compliance supporting cross-border payments, Stellar remains one of the high ROI crypto picks that investors continue to monitor. For those scanning cheap cryptos with potential, Stellar has remained a consistent entry on lists of the best altcoins to buy now. XRP’s 2025 Price Prediction The XRP price prediction 2025 is shaped by growing institutional interest. Several spot ETF applications are under review by the SEC, with Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton all pushing to secure approval. Large investors have already accumulated $3.8 billion in XRP positions, showing clear conviction. Bullish scenarios forecast prices between $6 and $8, with the chance of $10+ if tokenized finance expands in sync with the next market rally. For those considering the top altcoins for 2025, XRP’s mix of institutional demand, regulatory progress, and liquidity makes it one of the best altcoins to buy now. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Contender for 50x While Stellar and XRP hold the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a strong challenger for the next cycle. Analysts point to unique fundamentals and early positioning, with some forecasting up to 50x upside potential. Momentum in altcoins is shifting toward cheap cryptos with potential , and MAGACOIN FINANCE is being ranked alongside the top altcoins for 2025 . For investors scanning high ROI crypto picks, it is gaining traction as one of the best altcoins to buy now before the cycle accelerates. 2025 Could Be Defined by These Three The 2025 cycle is shaping up to highlight proven projects and fast-rising challengers. The Stellar (XLM) forecast suggests strong technical progress, the XRP price prediction 2025 highlights ETF-driven demand, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a breakout growth path with forecasts of 50x upside. For investors seeking the best altcoins to buy now, Stellar and XRP bring stability and adoption while MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the chance to capture growth from the ground up. It is fast becoming one of the most discussed cheap cryptos with potential, earning a place among the top altcoins for 2025 and high ROI crypto picks for the next cycle.

After reaching multi-year highs, XRP now faces selling pressure from some of its largest holders. On-chain data shows that wallets with millions of tokens are unloading their positions, a move that often signals an upcoming downturn. For traders, this wave of whale sell-offs raises concerns that XRP’s latest rally could be losing steam. Many of these large holders are also exploring new opportunities, with some looking at emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for diversification and stronger upside potential. Whale Activity Signals Trouble Ahead Whale activity has always been a critical factor in XRP’s market behavior. In the past, accumulation during dips supported rallies, but now the trend has flipped toward distribution. This reversal suggests that whales may believe XRP’s latest run has reached its peak, at least in the short term. Their actions often set the tone for retail traders, and the current selling wave could amplify downward pressure if demand fails to absorb the supply hitting the market. Market and Regulatory Pressures Weighing on XRP At the same time, broader market conditions are not helping. Bitcoin and Ethereum are under pressure, dragging altcoins lower, while uncertainty in global markets has made investors more cautious. Regulatory clouds are also hanging over XRP, with delays on spot ETF approvals and continued scrutiny from regulators dampening institutional demand. Why Whales Are Exploring Alternatives Amid this uncertain backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the projects catching investor attention. Early participants are already seeing strong momentum, with demand far outpacing supply. What makes it stand out is its rapid community growth and potential to deliver life-changing gains – a $2,500 position could turn into more than $50,000 for early entrants if growth continues at its current pace. With whales diversifying into such opportunities, smaller investors are watching closely to secure their own spot before wider adoption. Will XRP Crash or Recover? Looking ahead, the critical question is whether XRP can hold its current levels or if selling will accelerate. While a sharp crash is not guaranteed, the combination of whale sell-offs, weak technicals, and regulatory uncertainty is keeping sentiment fragile. A sudden positive catalyst could still reverse the trend, but for now, traders are bracing for more downside. In short, XRP faces a crucial test in the coming weeks, while investors are increasingly looking to diversify into fast-growing alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE that promise bigger upside potential in the next market cycle.

Once again, all eyes are on Dogecoin while newer entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting traction thanks to whale-backed inflows and presale momentum. These projects are the 3 best buys to watch this week, alongside other trending altcoins. Dogecoin (DOGE): Leading the Meme Coin Comeback Meme coins’ cultural flagship Dogecoin is still attracting strong retail participation. After a brief drop, trading recently stabilized at $0.21, but DOGE is still up over 100% YTD. Experts anticipate that the price will have short-term resistance between $0.225 and $0.28. If the meme-driven momentum returns fully, a run towards $1 is possible. The strength of DOGE lies not only in price speculation but also because it has attracted a community with liquidity. Moreover, the coin enjoys a tipping culture to a good extent. Finally, it is almost universally recognized as a meme asset. As September sentiment turns risk-on, Dogecoin is the latest market leader to catch the attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Forecast 40x Upside Meme coin momentum is back, with Dogecoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. Analysts forecast 40x upside for MAGACOIN FINANCE, calling it one of the best altcoins to buy this week . With over significant funding already raised, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing the same early signs of breakout potential that Dogecoin and Shiba Inu displayed in prior market cycles. Early buyers are using PATRIOT50X to unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are disappearing fast as September inches closer. The September surge in meme trading will only accelerated inflows, making it one of the most-watched tokens of the season. Ethereum (ETH): A Stable Anchor for September Although meme coins have been dominating the world’s attention, one token that still remains critical is Ethereum. ETH has dropped from above $4,700 to levels near $4,150. Ethereum may experience short-term volatility, but its fundamentals remain strong as ETF inflows exceed $1 billion, dominance in DeFi and NFTs continues, and network upgrades support long-term scalability. Analysts think that the near-term support will be at $4,150. From there, the bulls can try to take the Bitcoin price to $4,700 and $5,000 if general risk sentiment improves. Investors experience momentum and utility when they are involved with ETH, rather than having to deal with a meme coin. Conclusion: Meme Coins Meet Market Strategy This week’s market reflects the two forces of September momentum: meme coin lift and institutional Layer 1 strength. Dogecoin is defining meme energy, Ethereum is anchoring broader adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout opportunity with analyst projections of 40x upside. With the significant investment flows and presale allocations tightening, it has quickly become one of the most discussed tokens to buy now.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The 4-hour chart shows the price below the Alligator lines with declining volume. The $0.000105 support level must hold to prevent a deeper correction toward $0.00009489. FLOKI on the daily timeframe FLOKI is trading at $0.00010631 on August 24, down 0.25% as the token remains trapped within the range between $0.00009489 and $0.00012420. The price action shows a series of indecisive candles following earlier volatility, with the 21-period SMA at $0.00010906 acting as immediate resistance above current levels. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram displays minimal momentum, suggesting neither bulls nor bears have gained control, while the signal lines remain tightly compressed near zero, indicating a potential breakout could be brewing. The key concern lies in FLOKI’s inability to reclaim the upper range boundary at $0.00012420, which continues to cap any meaningful upside attempts. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe The 4-hour chart shows that FLOKI’s recent rally attempt from $0.000098 to $0.000108 has been met with consistent selling pressure and declining volume participation. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The Alligator indicator lines remain intertwined, suggesting the market lacks a clear directional bias, while the price continues to trade below all three lines, maintaining a bearish structure. The Balance of Power indicator sits at -0.27, confirming that sellers currently hold the advantage in this consolidation phase. Volume has steadily declined from the earlier spike, indicating waning interest and potential for a breakdown if support at $0.000105 fails to hold. Floki Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00008727 BUY SMA 5 $0.00009455 BUY SMA 10 $0.0001 BUY SMA 21 $0.000107 SELL SMA 50 $0.000113 SELL SMA 100 $0.00009988 BUY SMA 200 $0.000106 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.000109 SELL EMA 5 $0.000107 SELL EMA 10 $0.00009864 BUY EMA 21 $0.00008676 BUY EMA 50 $0.00008186 BUY EMA 100 $0.00009662 BUY EMA 200 $0.000119 SELL What to expect from FLOKI FLOKI faces a make-or-break scenario where failure to defend $0.000105 support could trigger a swift move toward $0.00009489, while any breakout above $0.00011133 resistance with increasing volume would target the range high at $0.00012420. The declining volume and bearish structure suggest downside risk outweighs upside potential in the near term. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

While the anticipation is building, smart investors are already positioning themselves in projects primed to lead the charge. As in all crypto cycles, large-cap tokens are getting the most attention. However, on-chain data reveals a segment of the market is quietly building up their position in MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts are placing on top of their list of the best altcoins to buy now before the market heats up. 1. Solana: Scaling and Adoption Solana’s reputation as one of the fastest blockchains remains intact. Recent network stress tests showed it can handle over 100,000 transactions per second, far ahead of rivals. With a thriving DeFi ecosystem valued above $12 billion and strong developer interest, Solana is positioned to recover quickly from short-term pullbacks. Institutional exposure through futures and ETFs adds another layer of strength for the upcoming bull run. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Spotlight Presale Analysts have placed Solana, Ethereum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE among the 5 Best Altcoins to Buy before the bull run starts — but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the token stealing the spotlight. So far, the project’s presale has attracted thousands of investors, cementing it as one of the most popular new crypto launches this year. While the momentum is still brewing, early movers can take advantage of a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the exclusive code PATRIOT50X. The window is open, but not for long. Those who remember the early days of Solana and Ethereum will see the similarities between MAGACOIN FINANCE and these established tokens. For those who missed out on previous breakout opportunities, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the next token to shock the market. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Favorite Ethereum continues to prove its staying power as more than just a cryptocurrency. With over $13 billion in spot ETF inflows and corporate treasuries holding billions in ETH, institutional adoption is stronger than ever. Large wallets are steadily moving ETH off exchanges, hinting at long-term accumulation. Despite recent volatility, Ethereum’s role in DeFi and smart contracts makes it a consistent answer for anyone asking what’s the Best Altcoin to Buy Now. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Utility at Scale BNB powers the world’s largest crypto exchange ecosystem and consistently ranks in daily transaction volume. Priced just below $830, it has shown resilience during volatile market weeks. With new projects launching on the BNB Chain and analysts predicting a push toward $1,000, it remains a core altcoin for diversified portfolios. 5. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DeFi Innovator Hyperliquid is gaining traction as one of the most innovative decentralized exchanges. Its multi-quote spot trading upgrade and permissionless liquidity pools have pushed its total value locked close to $3 billion. Whale interest is increasing, and analysts see potential for HYPE to rally toward $60–$70 if momentum continues. For investors willing to take on a newer, higher-risk project, Hyperliquid offers exposure to the next wave of DeFi growth. Conclusion The market is already shaping up and smart investors are racking up their positions in the altcoins highlighted as breakout contenders. Established leaders like Ethereum and Solana will no doubt attract the most excitement, but the strongest excitement is around MAGACOIN FINANCE. For those asking what the best altcoin to buy now is, the answer may lie in balancing proven giants with emerging contenders such as MAGACOIN FINANCE ready to surprise the market.

According to the post , this development opens the door for institutional capital to enter the market with greater ease. The author described it as a significant moment for long-time observers of the digital asset space, noting that Wall Street focuses less on hype and more on reliable financial infrastructure. Details from the Shared Graphic To reinforce the point, the tweet was accompanied by a WisdomTree-branded explainer titled “WisdomTree Insight: Basis Trading & The Rise of XRP Futures.” The document explained the basics of trading, where investors can profit from differences between spot and futures prices. It referenced funding rates from exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit, and outlined how futures contracts on Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and now XRP are used as trading instruments. The report suggested that XRP stands out with regulated, onshore futures access, contrasting with the risks of offshore markets. It also presented XRP as part of a broader futures landscape, noting comparisons across assets in terms of return and risk profiles. $XRP is CME-listed for onshore futures The door for institutional money is wide open.

This was described as providing institutional investors with safe and regulated access to the asset. It further framed XRP as a tactical option for yield through basis trading, allowing investors to take advantage of spreads between spot and futures markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to the material, this setup reduces exposure to risks such as low liquidity or counterparty concerns that can occur in offshore environments. The document positioned XRP as a secure and scalable product within the futures market, underscoring its potential role in professional trading strategies. Institutional Implications The post suggested that CME access could significantly change how institutional investors approach XRP. This means XRP’s regulatory positioning gives it an advantage in attracting institutional flows, as safe and transparent access is a central requirement for such participants. By highlighting the arrival of onshore futures, the material implied that XRP may now meet compliance standards that were previously limiting. In his concluding remark, X Finance Bull emphasized that “Wall Street doesn’t chase hype, it chases rails, suggesting that long-term capital is more likely to flow into technologies that provide essential settlement, liquidity, and payment rails, rather than projects driven primarily by market enthusiasm.

This event adds to the already long list of similar attacks the year has seen so far, and worryingly, continues to see. The Losses Increase Financial crime continues to weigh heavily on the crypto industry, with billions lost to date this year alone in various attacks and exploits. The North Wales Police Department’s cybercrime unit has flagged the most recent incident, disclosing the theft of £2.1 million ($2.8M ) in BTC from a cold wallet via impersonation. They believe this was a targeted attack, possibly identified through a data breach, in an elaborate ruse with the scammer posing as a senior representative of UK law enforcement with a fabricated story. Reportedly, the person posing as an officer claimed they had arrested someone who had the victim’s personal identification documents stored on their phone, alerting them to a possible security breach. With the target alarmed and fearful that their information had been stolen, the hacker took advantage of this and provided instructions for “securing” the victim’s cryptocurrency assets. Unbeknownst to them, they were provided with a malicious link to a fake website that prompted them to log in to their cold wallet. Believing they were following the police’s instructions, they proceeded by entering the seed phrase into the site, and within minutes, the scammer was able to siphon the $2.8 million and vanish without a trace. The police are now attempting to track the funds and have issued several reminders to the public, as well as to anyone else holding crypto assets, to be cautious of such individuals. Authorities in any state or country will never call the public to discuss their holdings, let alone how and where they store them. Additionally, when in doubt, it’s perfectly fine to hang up, and if possible, verify whether the information you were given over the phone or the channel you were contacted on is correct. Moreover, no legitimate organization will ever ask for your seed phrase, so it’s best not to enter it on links provided by third parties under any circumstances. Phishing Attacks Continue to Claim Victims Social engineering attacks are far from the only type of fraud the cryptocurrency world has seen, but they are certainly one of the most commonly used methods. CryptoPotato previously reported that this type of attack resulted in a loss of at least $65 million from the Coinbase exchange in December 2024 and January 2025 . Later in the current year, an elderly person was scammed out of over $330 million in Bitcoin, and a fraudulent phone call made to an engineer from the Indian CoinDCX exchange led to the loss of $44 million.

Morgan has released projections on the level of capital inflows a potential XRP exchange-traded product could attract once it receives trading approval. In his post, SMQKE described the study as “sizing up the XRP ETP opportunity,” pointing directly to figures that attempt to quantify early adoption levels for such a product. The attached slides indicate that J.P. Morgan applied benchmarks based on the penetration levels already observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs to estimate how XRP and Solana could perform under similar conditions. JP Morgan is actively releasing projections on the anticipated capital inflows an XRP ETP could attract once it secures trading approval. They call it: “Sizing up the XRP ETP Opportunity.” Documented. pic.twitter.com/N6UXTaFoZF — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 21, 2025 The Benchmarking Method The first slide illustrates the overall market capitalization of Bitcoin at approximately $1.874 trillion, Ethereum at $395 billion, Solana at $91 billion, and XRP at $146 billion. Within that comparison, bitcoin’s ETP assets are shown to equal about 6% of its total market cap, while Ethereum’s stand closer to 3%. These percentages are then used as the basis for modeling similar outcomes for Solana and XRP, presenting a straightforward comparison that applies the same levels of penetration. XRP and Solana Scenarios The second slide narrows the focus to a six- to twelve-month time frame. Solana’s market cap is listed at $90.5 billion, with potential ETP assets ranging from $2.7 billion at 3% penetration to $5.2 billion at 6%. For XRP , the figures are larger due to its higher market cap. With $146.5 billion as the reference point, J.P. Morgan’s estimates place the potential ETP inflows at $4.3 billion at 3% penetration and $8.4 billion at 6%. The projections are presented as possible outcomes in the first year, reflecting the scale of assets that could be captured if XRP follows the same adoption curve as bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reactions to the Estimates An additional comment from an X user, Sac Lib, was included in the thread. The user noted that at first glance the figures appeared to be in the millions, only to realize they were in billions. The comment further emphasized that the calculations only covered ETPs, suggesting that exchange-traded funds could potentially represent an even larger opportunity. The slides shared by SMQKE indicate that institutional frameworks are now being applied to assess the potential demand for products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. By using ETP penetration rates from these two assets as benchmarks, J.P. Morgan provides a reference model for how XRP and Solana could be integrated into regulated investment products. According to the material, XRP’s estimated inflows of $4.3 to $8.4 billion within its first year would represent a substantial initial allocation relative to its market cap. The figures do not assume guaranteed approval or market outcomes but indicate the possible scale of institutional demand if such products were introduced.

Solana continues to impress with record-setting speeds and growing institutional backing. Cardano is gaining momentum with whale activity and long-term adoption narratives. Yet, a new name — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is drawing attention, with early entry seen as one of the rare crypto presale opportunities before the market surges. Solana: Setting Records and Eyeing $482 in Forecasts Solana has become a standout candidate when searching for the best crypto to buy before bull run . The blockchain smashed a technical barrier with 107,664 transactions per second, a milestone that few rivals can touch. The Alpenglow Upgrade aims to cut finality to 150 milliseconds, which could cement Solana’s role in high-frequency trading and institutional DeFi. SOL 7D price Institutional demand is growing too. Upexi’s acquisition of 1.9 million SOL, valued at more than $320 million, shows growing corporate appetite. Gov Capital projects a Solana price prediction 2025 at $364.24, while DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average of $482.56. For many traders, these forecasts place Solana among the top altcoins for 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Star in Early Market Entry While Solana and Cardano dominate headlines, the hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is building rapidly . This project is turning heads because early investors see it as one of the best presales to buy before the market’s next major surge. The entry point is still favorable, but with growing chatter in investor circles, momentum could pick up fast. Solana and Cardano may already be recognized giants, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rising star. For traders seeking crypto presale opportunities ahead of Q4, this project could be the rare window to secure gains before prices shift upward. Many already consider it among the best crypto to buy before bull run, adding fresh diversity to portfolios built on established names. Cardano: Whale Moves and Long-Term Expansion Cardano has always drawn attention from patient investors, but 2025 has brought an added spark. More than $73 million flowed into ADA through institutional channels, bringing total holdings above $900 million. The surge highlights growing confidence in ADA’s long-term role. ADA price chart 7D The global Cardano Summit tour is another boost, alongside Hydra’s mainnet launch set for Q4. Hydra’s scaling potential could power real-time gaming and micropayments, making ADA one of the top altcoins for 2025 . Analysts suggest ADA could average $1.36, with price bands stretching between $2.46 and $3.17 in the medium term — giving the project strong Cardano upside potential if adoption keeps pace. Final Word: Where the Next Big Moves May Come From The market is filled with speculation, but three names stand out when weighing the best crypto to buy before bull run . Solana continues to lead with speed and Cardano is carving its own path. Then comes MAGACOIN FINANCE presale , the surprise factor attracting attention as investors seek fresh crypto presale opportunities. With the potential to become one of 2025’s most talked-about tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something Solana and Cardano no longer do — a rare entry point at ground level.

50578432,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-gains-steam-with-380m-presale-while-xrp-holds-steady-and-tron-eyes-growth/,1756008021,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png,BlockDAG Gains Steam With $380M Presale While XRP Holds Steady and Tron Eyes Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-gains-steam-with-380m-presale-while-xrp-holds-steady-and-tron-eyes-growth/,"The crypto market is juggling optimism and caution. XRP has kept its ground near $3 despite pressure from inflation data, while Tron is signaling strength through steady futures and spot demand. Both projects are showing resilience, but BlockDAG has been pulling more attention. With a presale raising $380 million so far, coins priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, and a wave of new features including Dashboard V4, sports deals, and a growing ambassador network, BlockDAG is shaping a unique story before launch. XRP Finds Its Footing at $3 Ripple’s XRP has managed to stay firm at $3 even after fresh inflation figures unsettled the market. July’s Producer Price Index jumped 0.9% on the month and 3.3% year over year, stirring worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve may push back interest rate cuts. This weighed on major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum and knocked XRP to $3.12, sparking $62 million in liquidations, largely from long positions. Even so, trading activity rose sharply. Daily volumes surged 30% to $12 billion as buyers stepped in to defend the $3 threshold. Analysts believe a breakout above $3.40 could open the path to $4, with further hurdles near $3.66. On the fundamentals side, Ripple’s push with its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin could boost usage for cross-border transfers. With the SEC case resolved, regulatory pressure has eased, and long-term forecasts now suggest targets of $4.50 to $6 by 2025, with the possibility of even higher moves later on. Tron’s Metrics Signal Optimism Tron (TRX) has been showing strength as both spot and futures markets signal fresh upside. TRX is trading near $0.357, up 5.48% on the week and 19% across the month, despite a small daily dip. Analysts point to the Futures Volume Bubble Map, which remains in neutral territory, leaving room for growth. The last time Tron’s market sat in this range, the price climbed from $0.26 to $0.45. Open Interest has dipped from $340 million to $313 million, meaning weaker long positions have been flushed out. Still, the Funding Rate has stayed positive for four straight days, showing stronger buyers remain in play. Spot demand is also rising, with the Spot vs Perp Premium at 0.0014 and RSI at 74, both signaling steady buying pressure. If momentum holds, TRX could break back to $0.37 and head for $0.40, although a further drop in OI could cause a retrace toward $0.33. BlockDAG Brings Transparency and Growth Ahead of Launch While XRP and Tron are playing out their moves on the charts, BlockDAG is building its case through delivery and scale. The project has already raised $380 million in its presale, with more than 25.3 billion coins sold at the Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Buyers from Batch 1 have already seen gains of 2,660% compared with today’s price, showcasing how quickly momentum has built. Alongside this, nearly 19,400 hardware miners have been purchased, generating more than $7.8 million in sales. One of the most talked-about updates is Dashboard V4, a redesigned presale interface that mirrors the look and feel of a live trading platform. Users can view BDAG charts in real time, track balances, check referral earnings, and even see order book depth, all before the official listing. This level of transparency has set BlockDAG apart, building trust with its growing community. At the same time, sports partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas are widening its visibility. Rugby fans are receiving NFTs and collectibles, while cricket followers are engaging with fan coins and exclusive experiences. These partnerships are pushing BlockDAG into mainstream cultural spaces, far beyond just crypto circles. Adding to its momentum is the Ambassador Program, designed to empower community leaders worldwide. Participants gain access to rewards, event invitations, and early features, strengthening the grassroots foundation of the project. Together, Dashboard V4, sports tie-ins, and global ambassadors are driving BlockDAG’s rise as one of the most anticipated launches of the year. Final Word XRP is holding its ground, Tron is signaling a possible climb, but BlockDAG is making its case in a different way. With $380 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, a transparent dashboard, global sports alliances, and an expanding ambassador network, it is proving that adoption can be built even before a listing. As XRP eyes $4 and Tron moves toward $0.40, BlockDAG is demonstrating real traction on the ground. For those scanning the market for stories with depth and growth, it is shaping up as one of the most compelling names to watch.

50576658,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=175800,1756008057,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/50576658.jpeg,Are We in a Bear Market? Crypto Market overview for the Rest of 2025,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-we-in-a-bear-market-crypto-market-overview-for-the-rest-of-2025/,"The crypto market is standing at the foot of a crossroads, as the lingering question is whether this market is still in the bear market or whether the current turmoil is just the beginning of a new bull market. Earlier in the year, Bitcoin and most other major indexes suffered a sharp decline. Yet that they rallied to new all-time highs shows the resiliency of the asset class. In this regard, one of the surveys carried out by the Investopedia indicates that nearly two-thirds of the retail investors can be deemed as optimistic . The said degree of confidence is anchored firmly on strong corporate portfolios and the capacity of the economy. Almost on par with consumer support is institutional backing of Bitcoin. The SEC move to legalize the spot bitcoin ETFs has catalyzed the rise in prices and liquidity in the international market. This does not only help Bitcoin but the crypto market at large. Given that crypto is now thoroughly integrated into mainstream finance—a fact demonstrated by a series of high-profile IPOs and the growing trend of companies establishing digital asset reserves—the overarching narrative continues to lean much more bullish than bearish. Market Signals & Interpretation Despite those shorter-lived downward infusions that, technically, qualified as being in bear territory, i.e., down sharply more than 20%, the overall situation has been quite murky. The strong economy and much cash to move into the ETFs have played a huge role in giving rise to Bitcoin. Money is pouring into the market, small cash is bullish, and the future is bright with the new guidelines of cryptos in the U.S. A lot of news about money talks about how popular initial coin offerings (ICOs) are and how many companies hold crypto. Plus, over 135 public companies now name Bitcoin as a backup asset on their balance sheets. This shows that Bitcoin is becoming more prominent. Also, good news like the proposed Genius Act and state rules that back it up is making people trust organizations even more. This makes people even more sure that crypto is a safe way to handle money. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an excellent opportunity that is becoming extremely relevant in this complex and dynamic world. Customers can already find Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP very expensive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its infancy and this aspect aligns with the way organizations are evolving. The clever money is investing more of its money in MAGACOIN FINANCE now as money is on the move. The phases of this presale of the project were sold quickly since they were restricted in number. That indicates that demand was excessive long before any typical cyclical surges enjoyed their start. It is the politically charged branding and community that makes MAGACOIN stand out the most, as its history follows a similar pattern of powerful cultural trends of power. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an isolated case in the industry where the attitude towards promotion is rational, with the frequency of its usage sufficiently high to end up with development. Broader Market Context From a macro standpoint, even traditional markets are holding onto a fragile sort of optimism. Sure, U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies are climbing, but you can’t ignore the nagging worries about core producer prices and this stubborn inflation that just won’t quit—it’s all still very much on everyone’s radar. Taking a macro view, even ordinary markets are showing some sort of insecure faith. Despite the rising stocks and cryptocurrency, people remain worried about the core producer prices and inflation that is not declining. Simultaneously, an increasingly symbiotic relationship between crypto and traditional banking, such as with the emergence of new crypto-linked loans at JPMorgan or concurring changes regarding the government digital asset strategy, inevitably begs the question as to what may be systemic failure points, despite what may seem to be a robust performance in the market at this present time. Nonetheless, the majority of analysts are still saying that the bear market has not really started. An example for illustration is that PlanB and other popular predictive applications maintain to prophesy consistent tracking of Bitcoin strengthening through long-term period windows. Even business leaders are saying that the market is experiencing temporary and macro-caused corrections rather than long-term business-cycle decline. Conclusion: A Transitional Phase In a nutshell, although 2025 has already had periods of significant technical drawdown, all the prevailing indicators—healthy fund tracking products and fees, rapidly advancing institutional scaling, proactive regulation, and intense initial public offering activity are working in favor of this not being a traditional bear market. The current market situation can be characterized as one of transition, and there are indications that the market could harbor the entrance of so many people in the market and could also expand over the long term. The market stands at a crossroads, and it is a good time to make a purchase by buyers who love planning in advance. These developments are providing space to new ideas to emerge. Its concept of core scarcity, the entire politically motivated brand built around it, and the accumulation of major players before the era of mass usage of the given concept even commences is a definite strength of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Once the market turns again in the other direction, such pre-sale tokens with their appealing narrative and sound fundamentals may have a strong head start ahead of the older and already tired projects.

XRP, Stellar, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are consistently ranked among the top seven assets expected to post strong ROI, joined by Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin. Each plays a distinct role in the broader market picture — from payments infrastructure to retail-driven speculation. While XRP and Stellar bring proven adoption and Solana anchors institutional growth, it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that has quickly become the wildcard. Rising from a presale narrative into the mainstream, its projected upside is what ties the list together, giving the “top seven” both stability and breakout potential heading into 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGACOIN) — Breakout Presale Momentum Analysts now place MAGACOIN FINANCE in the same top-seven rankings that feature long-standing players like XRP and Stellar, citing its ability to draw both institutional attention and retail enthusiasm. The crypto presale project has rapidly shifted from a niche meme-fueled presale to a candidate for wider adoption, with momentum building ahead of anticipated listings. Investor sentiment is strong because MAGACOIN FINANCE straddles two narratives at once — the viral energy of meme coins and the structured rollout of more established tokens. That mix has allowed it to capture early inflows from whales while maintaining grassroots appeal. Comparisons to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are common, but analysts argue MAGACOIN’s trajectory looks more deliberate. Its placement alongside established payment networks shows how far it has climbed in market perception, moving from outsider status to one of the most closely watched crypto presales of 2025. For risk-tolerant investors, the token’s rise signals not just speculative hype but a strategic chance to secure exposure to what could become one of the cycle’s breakout performers. XRP — Post-Clarity Resurgence XRP enters 2025 with a tailwind after finally clearing regulatory hurdles with the SEC. That clarity has reignited institutional interest, making XRP one of the few established assets analysts see as capable of a major re-rating. The network’s fast, low-cost transactions and deep global partnerships remain its backbone, but what excites markets now is the potential for ETFs and broader adoption in cross-border finance. XRP is no longer treated as a “maybe” asset; it has moved back into the core discussion of blockchain-based finance, with analysts framing it as a mature play with room for sharp upside. Stellar (XLM) — Parallel Payments Growth Stellar doesn’t command the headlines XRP does, but it often moves in tandem with the Ripple-linked digital asset. Analysts routinely place it in the “next seven” for ROI growth because of its role in remittances and NGO-driven adoption. Its steady partnerships with financial institutions give it a more understated but resilient profile. For investors, Stellar is seen as a hedge within the payments narrative: less speculative than MAGACOIN FINANCE, less institutionally dominant than XRP, but positioned to rise if adoption accelerates across the sector. The Wider Top Seven The 2025 analyst shortlists don’t stop at MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Stellar. Four other altcoins — Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, and Dogecoin — are consistently highlighted as part of the group expected to drive ROI growth next year. Together, they provide balance to the list, covering infrastructure, cross-chain connectivity, and retail-driven demand. Solana continues to dominate discussions of scalability. The network’s low fees and institutional traction — amplified by the approval of a Solana ETF — make it the growth pick for investors looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum . Cardano , while slower to develop in past cycles, is regaining attention thanks to ecosystem upgrades and its expanding footprint in DeFi. Chainlink is being recognized as a utility cornerstone. With its oracle services underpinning cross-chain liquidity and DeFi protocols, analysts see it as indispensable infrastructure that should benefit directly from broader blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin retains a place on the list as the retail favorite. Despite lacking the technical depth of the others, its cultural staying power and recurring waves of speculation continue to make it a candidate for outsized returns in bullish markets. Final takeaway By combining these four with the breakout narrative of MAGACOIN FINANCE and the payment-focused growth of XRP and Stellar, analysts argue the “top seven” represents the full spectrum of ROI opportunities — from speculative bets to institutional-grade platforms. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale once dismissed as speculative, presence among these established names in top-seven lists of ROI growth candidates, showing how investor attention is shifting toward projects that blend viral momentum with breakout potential.

Stellar (XLM), SEI, and Aptos (APT) are consistently ranked at the top due to their network upgrades, strong fundamentals, and growing developer ecosystems. But among crypto presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the breakout contender, with accelerating demand and rising urgency ahead of 2025 allocations. Stellar (XLM) — Upgrades Fuel Renewed Interest Stellar has experienced a sharp recovery in 2025, with its price doubling in July following the successful rollout of Protocol 23. This upgrade significantly boosted scalability and interoperability, allowing Stellar to extend its role in supporting smart contracts. Analysts believe this development strengthens its long-term viability, particularly in remittances and nonprofit finance, where Stellar has already established strong partnerships. Price projections vary, but some forecasts now see XLM trading between $20 and $40 if adoption accelerates under the new protocol. For investors watching entry points, analysts note that pullbacks could provide compelling opportunities to build positions before altseason momentum takes hold. Stellar’s dual role as both a payments network and a smart contract platform continues to make it one of the more resilient projects in the sector. SEI — A Top “Buy the Dip” Candidate SEI has also earned regular mention in analyst rankings, often appearing in “best presale” lists for 2025. Its innovative consensus model and growing developer ecosystem make it a technology-driven project with potential to outperform once new upgrades and launches roll out. Although its price action has shown weakness in recent weeks, analysts say this volatility makes SEI a “buy the dip” opportunity. With its mainnet improvements and feature deployments expected to accelerate over the coming months, SEI is viewed as one of the higher-upside candidates for early investors positioning ahead of altseason. Aptos (APT) — Builder Momentum Remains Strong Aptos continues to stand out as a developer-focused blockchain, particularly with its Move programming language and distinctive execution layer. These features have kept it on analysts’ watchlists even during periods of price decline, as the network remains attractive to developers building next-generation decentralized applications. For investors, the recent price weakness is seen as an opportunity to accumulate APT at lower levels. Analysts describe Aptos as one of the more innovative infrastructure plays in crypto, with its focus on execution speed and developer experience marking it as a long-term contender ahead of the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Breakout Crypto Presale While Stellar, SEI, and Aptos rank high among established networks, presale investors are increasingly turning their focus to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts describe it as the breakout presale of 2025, with sharper upside potential than most early-stage projects currently on the market. Demand has been accelerating quickly, with whale inflows and retail buyers competing for allocations. Momentum has been fueled by a presale structure that rewards early participation.The urgency around MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting it apart from other presales, with growing consensus that it could deliver one of the most dramatic revaluations of the upcoming cycle. For investors positioning ahead of altseason, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being ranked alongside established names as a must-watch. The combination of rising demand, early-stage availability, and aggressive growth forecasts has made it the presale generating the most market buzz as 2025 approaches. Conclusion — A Blend of Stability and Early Upside The upcoming altseason is drawing attention to projects with both proven fundamentals and early presale momentum. Stellar, SEI, and Aptos remain highly ranked for their upgrades, technology, and ecosystem growth, offering longer-term strength for investors seeking resilient entries. But MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a separate lane as the breakout presale, attracting accelerating demand and delivering urgency that few others match.

Ethereum jumped to an all-time high, continuing a surge that started in April when it bottomed at $1,350. This article looks at the top catalysts for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market this week. NVIDIA earnings The most important catalyst for the stock and crypto market this week will be the NVIDIA earnings on Wednesday. These numbers will be particularly important because it is the largest company in the world and a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence industry. Therefore, strong results will hint that the industry is doing well and push the stock and crypto markets higher. Analysts predict that NVDIA’s revenue will be a whopping $46 billion, 53% jump from last year. One analyst sees the number being $52 billion. There are other notable companies that will publish their results this week, including CrowdStrike, Dell, and Marvell Technologies. US PCE report to impact crypto market Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market will react to the upcoming Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) report on Thursday. This is a crucial number that provides information on price movements on goods and services in the urban and rural areas. This differs from the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which looks at the prices in urban areas. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will publish the latest PCE report on Friday. Economists expect the data to show that the core PCE rose 0.3% in July, translating to a YoY gain of 2.8%. The agency will also release the personal income and spending data. This report, together with the August inflation and nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data, will influence the next actions of the Federal Reserve. The other top macro data to watch this week will be GDP, consumer confidence, and the durable goods report.

Historically, these unlocks have been bearish because they increase supply when there is limited demand. Pi Network will continue its daily unlocks by releasing 49 million tokens in the market. This will not be a surprise since Pi is known for its huge unlocks that will continue for years. Axelar will be the other major crypto to have an unlock this week. It will unlock tokens worth $5 million, representing 1.5% of the float. Ronin, one of the top players in gaming, will also unlock tokens worth $10 million. The biggest unlocks will come from Optimism (OP) and RedStone, which will unlock $25 million and $16.5 million.

The market in 2025 has already seen major changes, with institutional money streaming into altcoins. While established brands like Cardano and Stellar continue to do well, emerging projects are getting a lot of attention since they have a lot of potential for growth. One of the standout names investors are talking about right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE. In addition to MAGACOIN, other cryptocurrencies like Solana, Avalanche, Ripple, and Toncoin are still good choices because their ecosystems are growing and they are being actively developed. Each of these coins offers something unique, making them attractive choices for buyers looking to position themselves before the next major rally . MAGACOIN FINANCE—The Rising Star MAGACOIN FINANCE has swiftly become one of the most talked-about altcoins on the market. MAGACOIN is getting a lot of attention from both retail traders and early-stage investors because of its aggressive presale strategy and promise of high returns. Early buyers are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, unlocking a 50% EXTRA BONUS with code PATRIOT50X as it outshines Cardano and Stellar. The buzz about it isn’t just hype; it’s based on the clear chance for growth. Analysts believe that MAGACOIN might generate up to 45x ROI, putting it ahead of several known altcoins. This momentum has caused a lot of people to want to buy before the price goes up even further. Solana (SOL) Solana keeps showing that it is one of the most scalable blockchains. It recently set a record for throughput with 107,000 transactions per second. The “Alpenglow” update made more improvements, which kept Solana ahead in terms of speed and cost-effectiveness. Institutional money is also flowing in, with ETF inflows hitting $164 million. Its DeFi and NFT ecosystems are doing well, and engineers are still working to make them better constantly. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche has become the platform of choice for businesses. Its unique subnet architecture lets users construct their own blockchains. A lot of DeFi projects and big partnerships have come to this platform because of how flexible it is. AVAX is still a strong competitor since transactions are confirmed quickly, in approximately a second, and the number of validators is expanding. Its market cap of around $14 billion shows strong investor confidence, and many expect the ecosystem to keep expanding as blockchain adoption increases. Ripple (XRP) Ripple has been an established leader in cross-border payments. XRP is still being used by financial institutions because of its low transaction costs and settlement speed. Regulatory positive outcomes have also earned people the confidence to trust the project once again. XRP has a good liquidity and market cap of 30 billion. It is exchanging at $0.50 to $0.55. As the global partnerships expand, XRP remains one of the most helpful altcoins with real-life applications. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin is growing super fast because it is highly integrated with Telegram, and this exposes it to millions of users across the globe. The TON ecosystem has an increasing number of decentralized apps, and the low fees and high transaction rates render it extremely helpful. TON, which has a $6 billion market cap, is trading at $1.20-1.30 and is niching itself to pursue social media with blockchain. It is worth watching due to its usefulness and popularity amongst users. Conclusion The number of good altcoins is numerous in 2025. Solana is quick and scalable, Avalanche supports businesses, Ripple remains the best payment system, and Toncoin intends to bring social media and crypto together. All these alternatives aside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the most exponentially growing altcoin . Most early investors believe that MAGACOIN is the next big success story since it promises a ROI of 45x.

He attached a market snapshot showing XRP trading above $3 and reporting a valuation of approximately $180 billion. This development reflects the growing strength of XRP in the broader market. Securing a place among the top 100 assets worldwide positions it alongside major corporations and commodities, showing its rising prominence beyond the cryptocurrency sector. JUST IN: $XRP BECOMES A TOP 100 GLOBAL ASSET BY MARKET CAP! pic.twitter.com/ReppPuiwf7 — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) August 23, 2025 XRP’s Growth Trajectory XRP’s entry into the global top 100 list highlights both its expanding valuation and its increasing relevance to investors. The ranking affirms that digital assets are continuing to secure a place alongside traditional financial instruments. Market observers have long followed XRP’s performance as a barometer for broader adoption, and this milestone demonstrates that the asset is now competing on a much larger stage. The growth also reflects sustained confidence in XRP’s utility and role in cross-border payments . As the token cements its market presence, the recognition among global assets could open the door to further institutional participation . Growth Drivers and Positive Signals Several factors contributed to the shift in valuation. Renewed investor demand, combined with accumulation by whales , created sustained buying pressure. However, one of the biggest factors driving confidence in XRP is regulatory clarity. The asset has been the only altcoin with full regulatory clarity for a long time, and the confidence of market participants has increased significantly following the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Earlier this month, the court approved a joint stipulation to dismiss the appeals filed by both Ripple and the SEC, effectively bringing the dispute to a close. The dismissal of these appeals removes a major hurdle that had created some uncertainty for XRP’s future. With the case resolved, exchanges and institutions can now reassess their engagement with XRP. Gemini’s recent announcement of a major Mastercard-related service using XRP indicates a shift in the market toward XRP. Outlook for XRP Having secured its place in the top 100 global assets, XRP is now positioned for potential new milestones. This feat reinforces its credibility within both crypto and traditional financial circles, and now that the Ripple lawsuit is resolved, XRP is well-positioned to pursue further achievements as adoption and institutional interest continue to develop.

Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention with projections of a 30x ROI, while other leading altcoins continue to shape market narratives. Here are the 7 best cryptos to buy now. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for 30x ROI in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about altcoins this year. Built on a zero-tax, security-first infrastructure, it combines meme coin appeal with real DeFi utility. Analysts point to its fair tokenomics and decentralized design as major strengths, making it a standout in a crowded field. With forecasts suggesting a 30x ROI in 2025, many traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as an early-entry opportunity before upcoming exchange listings. Bitcoin Cooling Before Next Big Move Bitcoin remains at the center of market discussions, currently trading around $115,300 after peaking at $124,450 last week. According to technical analyst CasiTrades, Bitcoin’s recent pullback could pave the way for a bounce toward $119,900–$121,900 before its next decisive move. While some anticipate further downside, others are eyeing the bigger picture, with comparisons being drawn to gold’s historic breakout in the early 2000s. If that pattern repeats, Bitcoin could climb toward $600,000 by 2026. For now, Bitcoin’s consolidation keeps traders alert to the next breakout signal. Ethereum Leads Stablecoin Activity Ethereum continues to dominate the stablecoin market, with an average of $521,000 transferred per holder over 30 days. Hosting 51% of the global stablecoin supply, Ethereum plays a vital role in both institutional and retail transactions. As stablecoin adoption grows, Ethereum benefits through higher fee revenues and broader usage, strengthening its position as the backbone of on-chain finance. Its dominance makes it one of the best cryptos to buy now for those focused on utility-driven networks. Stellar Gears Up for Upgrade Stellar (XLM) is trading around $0.403, with attention shifting to its Protocol 23 upgrade aimed at boosting scalability. Alongside strategic moves like SDF’s investment in UK-based Archax, Stellar is carving a path in real-world asset tokenization. Historically, upgrades have triggered rallies in XLM, and traders are watching closely to see if this trend continues. NEAR Protocol Attracts New Users NEAR Protocol is trading at $2.52 and has outperformed many peers in user growth. Weekly active accounts surged 18.4% to 16 million, surpassing Solana for the first time. With institutional inflows, new AI initiatives, and a major upgrade scheduled, NEAR is gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to buy now. A proposal to cut inflation further adds to its appeal for long-term holders. Solana Maintains Speed Leadership Solana remains a leader in performance, recently recording 107,664 transactions per second. Trading just below $205, Solana has the potential to move toward $250 despite regulatory delays around Solana-based ETFs. Its unmatched speed and scalability continue to attract developers and institutions, making it a strong contender for those seeking high-performance blockchain exposure. Chainlink Benefits from Integration Growth Chainlink (LINK) has climbed above $24, gaining over 30% in the past month. Its growth is fueled by rising institutional adoption and increased wallet activity. As the key provider of off-chain data to blockchains, Chainlink’s utility ensures its relevance. Analysts suggest LINK could advance toward $50–$55 by the end of 2025, reinforcing its position as one of the best cryptos to buy now. What Should Traders Do? With MAGACOIN FINANCE poised for a possible 30x ROI in 2025 and leading tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana shaping the market, traders have a diverse set of opportunities. Those seeking early exposure may consider visiting the official MAGACOIN FINANCE channels to act before broader listings arrive.

Recent launches—Chainlink Reserve, Data Streams for equities, and automated compliance engine—position LINK for institutional adoption and long-term growth. Technically, LINK shows bullish momentum with positive RSI and MACD signals, suggesting further upside, but profit-taking is advised at key levels. Risks include competition and cycle unpredictability, but ChainLink’s leadership and ecosystem integration support a positive long-term outlook. I'm providing an update on the cryptocurrency ChainLink USD ( LINK-USD ), which I wrote about back in December 2024 . ChainLink increased about 17% since my article was published, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's ( SPY ) 9% gain. My theory back in December was that ChainLink was likely to perform well along with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the other main cryptocurrencies as part of this BTC halving cycle. I also pointed out ChainLink's real-life use cases as long-term growth drivers for its underlying price. New Developments for ChainLink ChainLink, as the standard for onchain finance, had multiple developments in 2025 that demonstrate its real-life use cases. These use cases can help drive the price of the underlying ChainLink coin higher as more investors become aware of LINK as an investment and bid up the price. On August 11, 2025, ChainLink and Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) announced that high-quality FX and precious metals rates from ICE Consolidate Feed will serve as a contributor to the derived data set that Chainlink Data Streams provides to over 2,000 applications asset managers, leading banks, and infrastructure in the ChainLink ecosystem. This marks a milestone for ChainLink to have a path towards the adoption of mainstream onchain finance. ICE has a market-leading data feed for numerous precious metals and currencies, which provides a new level of reliability to onchain markets. ICE also supports new types of tokenized assets and products. ICE serves as one of multiple high-quality data providers on Chainlink Data Streams, which supplies DeFi (decentralized finance) applications with access to tamper-resistant data. ChainLink's data standard handles the rigorous requirements of traditional capital markets and unlocks a new class of institutional-grade applications with ICE's data. The demand for tokenized real-world assets is expected to reach $30.1 trillion by 2034 . This market is still in its infancy and was worth about $5 billion in early 2024. Chainlink Data Streams helps organizations tap into this large opportunity by providing on-demand access to secure and reliable high-frequency market data. This allows onchain applications to leverage ChainLink's institutional-grade infrastructure. This provides fast, user-friendly experiences. On August 7, 2025, ChainLink announced the launch of the Chainlink Reserve , which is a new upgrade of a strategic onchain reserve of LINK tokens. This is designed to support the sustainability and long-term growth of the ChainLink Network. This is accomplished by accumulating LINK tokens using offchain revenue from large enterprises that are adopting the ChainLink standard and from onchain service usage. ChainLink Co-Founder, Sergey Nazarov, stated: ""The launch of the Chainlink Reserve marks a pivotal evolution in Chainlink, establishing a strategic LINK reserve funded using offchain revenue, as well as from onchain service usage. Demand for the Chainlink standard has already created hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, substantially from large enterprises. The Chainlink Reserve provides a clear answer to how offchain revenue and large scale institutional adoption of the Chainlink standard will be connected back to the growth, security and sustainability for those standards."" On August 4, 2025, ChainLink announced the launch of Chainlink Data Streams for U.S. Equities and ETFs. This is real-time, high-throughput market data that is now available onchain to power the next generation of tokenized financial products. This is being adopted by DeFi protocols: GMX, Kamino, and GMX-Solana. Chainlink Data Streams enables tokenized stock trading, synthetic ETFs, and perpetual futures with institutional-grade reliability. On June 30, 2025, ChainLink launched the automated compliance engine [ACE] . This was done in partnership with Apex Group, ERC-3643 Association, and GLEIF. ACE is a unified and modular standard to solve all onchain compliance issues and bring institutional capital onchain. This is designed to support traditional and decentralized finance. ACE enables the creation of compliance-focused digital assets/services across private and public blockchains. This sets up the potential for over $100 trillion of institutional capital to enter the onchain economy. ChainLink partnered with Mastercard ( MA ) in June to enable over 300 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly onchain. This is accomplished through a secure fiat-to-crypto conversion. This combines Mastercard's trusted global payments network with ChainLink's secure interoperability infrastructure. This development removes barriers so that mainstream users can access the onchain economy. World Liberty Financial collaborated with ChainLink in May to accelerate the adoption of the world's fastest-growing stablecoin, USD1. This involves the integration of ChainLink's Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol [CCIP] with World Liberty Financial to expand access to the institutional-grade stablecoin by enabling secure transfers of USD1 across blockchain networks that would otherwise act as silos of value. ChainLink enables USD1 to move seamlessly between Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and BNB Chain networks with a rigorous plan for additional blockchain integrations in the future. Those were most of the recent developments. However, there were others from earlier in the year that can be reviewed from the first link 'multiple developments' in this section. Technical Perspective ChainLink (LINK-USD) Monthly Price Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) It's important to keep an eye on the technicals for LINK since we can't track earnings and valuation like a standard company. The price of ChainLink tends to be correlated with Bitcoin's halving cycle. Since there are sharp drops in each cycle, I think it is wise to lock in profits near the peak price in every cycle. Then, investors can get back in near the price bottoms. It might be difficult to time it perfectly, but having a long-term view on the monthly chart makes it feasible. The monthly chart above shows how LINK peaked in the last cycle after the price moved into an extreme overbought condition when the RSI moved above 80. What was tricky about the last cycle was that there was another pump from July through October after sharp declines in May and June. The RSI is currently in bullish territory as it is above the 50 level but still below the overbought area above 70. The MACD is showing a bullish crossover as the blue line crossed above the red signal line. This is confirmed by the green histogram bar appearing after the recent red bars. This shows that a new positive trend has formed. This suggests that there could be more upside runway for LINK over the next few months. Selling when the monthly RSI moves above 80 is probably a good time to lock in profits. Profit-taking tended to take place at this level each time that occurred. This can be cross-checked with the MACD as the histogram bars turn from dark green to light green and shorten in length. The buying point after the last cycle occurred when the RSI moved down to about the 40 level and when the MACD histogram bars turned from red to pink and shortened in length. This was when the price of LINK dropped to the single digits. Risks for Investing in ChainLink There is no guarantee that the past patterns for LINK will repeat like they did in the past. So, it might be wise to use the price action of Bitcoin as a guide, which tends to have more consistent patterns. My latest Bitcoin analysis can be read here . Of course, there is no guarantee that using Bitcoin as a guide for price peaks and bottoms will repeat the patterns of past cycles. Investing is about weighing risks while attempting to maximize gains. So, sometimes the higher-risk assets yield higher total returns, but it could also lead to losses. ChainLink could lose ground due to competition. It is possible that one or more of ChainLink's competitors offers more attractive technology that is adopted by large players. ChainLink competes with Pyth ( PYTH-USD ), Chronicle, Switchboard, and WINkLink (WCoin USD) ( WIN-USD ). I doubt that these competitors will overtake ChainLink in this space, but the possibility is there. ChainLink's Outlook I like the numerous real-world developments that ChainLink is involved with. ChainLink has partnerships with many large companies and organizations. This shows that LINK is a leader in the space with the potential for strong future growth.

Fresh stories are driving hype and big moves. Which themes will win in 2025—and which might fail? Recent patterns reveal what could shape the next wave. Dive in to see what’s setting the pace this time around. TAO: The Coin That Pays Machines to Think Together TAO powers Bittensor, a public network where many small brains work as one big brain. Each model shares its best ideas, learns from others, and earns TAO when its answers help the group. People outside the network can ask questions, guide tasks, and pay in the same coin. Because the code is open and the rules live on a blockchain, anyone, anywhere, can join, build, and own a piece of the growing mind. AI coins are hot this cycle, yet many just chase buzz words. TAO stands apart because it already links real work to real pay. Bitcoin secures money, Ethereum runs apps, but TAO rewards thought. Its fixed supply and steady demand for learning may support price even in storms. Big firms now spend fortunes on data and chips; Bittensor taps global hobby rigs for the same goal and shares the gains. If the market keeps favoring useful networks over hype, TAO could move from niche idea to core holding. HBAR: The Fast, Green Token Challenging Blockchain Giants Hedera Hashgraph does not use a classic blockchain. It runs on a “hashgraph,” where computers share tiny pieces of data instead of bulky blocks. This design needs no mining, so it saves energy and lowers fees. Each HBAR pays for actions on the network and helps guard it through Proof of Stake. The result is quick, cheap moves for payments, games, and even stock trades. Big names—like Google and IBM—sit on its council, adding trust and money to the project. Today’s market rewards coins that cut costs and waste. Bitcoin is strong but slow. Ethereum is busy and pricey when traffic spikes. New rivals such as Solana promise speed but battle outages. HBAR reaches high numbers of deals per second without sweating and keeps fees under a penny. Its code is patented, which may slow open-source fans, yet it also sets Hedera apart in a crowded field. With eco talk rising and firms seeking stable rails, HBAR looks well placed for the next upswing. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Ondo Finance: Turning Safe Bonds into Smart Money Ondo Finance mixes the trust of old finance with the speed of blockchain. It turns safe assets like US Treasury bills into digital tokens that anyone can hold. Two teams drive this plan. One builds the products, the other codes the tech that lets them move with ease. Strong names back the project. BlackRock handles the bonds, and Coinbase keeps the crypto keys safe. Clear reports and strict rules add another layer of calm. The flagship token, USDY, acts like a stable coin but also pays yield from the bonds behind it. In the current market, many coins chase hype yet swing wildly. ONDO offers a different story. Its value leans on real income from government bonds, not just code promises. As rates stay high, those bonds pay solid interest, and holders see that flow in tokens. Few other crypto projects can say the same. Rival stable coins often sit idle, and pure DeFi coins still face hacks and heavy swings. For investors seeking steadier growth while waiting for the next bull run, ONDO looks like a calm port in a rough sea. Conclusion TAO, HBAR and ONDO remain solid picks. XYZVerse (XYZ) unites global sports fans, targets 20,000% upside, runs open presale, community control and GameFi links, hinting at outsized returns.

Both ecosystems occupy central roles in the crypto landscape. Ethereum stands as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralized finance. Solana positions itself as the challenger with superior speed, scalability, and minimal transaction costs. Every network has its own strengths and disadvantages that stand out. Both platforms have their own groups of developers and investors. Ethereum benefits from its history, clearer rules, and more institutions using it. Solana has a lot of momentum, is very flexible with technology, and is quickly adding new integrations in the gaming, DeFi, and NFT industries. For investors who are trying to choose which platform to back, the choice is still not easy. At the same time, as money changes hands and altseason stories grow, new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are joining the discourse in unforeseen ways. Ethereum’s Case: Security and Institutional Depth Ethereum remains the most recognized smart contract platform globally. Its massive developer base provides continuous innovation and maintenance. Deep liquidity pools ensure stable trading environments for large transactions. The network’s unmatched DeFi footprint makes it the default choice for institutions and startups alike. Layer-2 solutions effectively reduce transaction costs and network congestion. Upcoming upgrades aim to make staking more efficient and wallets more user-friendly. For investors, Ethereum represents security and credibility through its proven track record. The network has weathered multiple market cycles and adapted through consistent innovation. Each adaptation has strengthened its position in the global marketplace. The ecosystem prioritizes resilience over raw speed. These qualities matter significantly to institutional players building products intended to last for decades. Solana’s Case: Speed, Costs, and Growing Adoption To fix Ethereum’s biggest problems with transaction speed and cost, Solana was built from the ground up. The network can handle traffic that is lightning fast. Its transaction fees stay very low, at just a few cents. Because of these things, it is the best chain for uses where size is important. Major NFT platforms have moved to take advantage of its features. It works very well, which helps on-chain game projects. On its network, high-frequency DeFi techniques work better. The chain has come back from technical problems and market downturns in a big way. This comeback has earned the trust of developers and sparked new energy in the community. Partnerships with both standard banks and tech companies have made it even more credible as an alternative. For many people, Solana is more than just faster internet. It looks like this is the chain that could make blockchain more widely used by making it easy for regular people to use. Developers and Security: Two Philosophies It’s hard to understand Ethereum, which is both good and bad. Because it has a very large smart contract infrastructure, it can make things that are quite sophisticated. This level of complexity also makes projects that use shared code or centralized deployers fragile. People think the network is powerful since it has been assaulted a lot in the past. Speed and ease are the most important things to Solana’s design philosophy. The software tools it makes are getting better and easier to use. With these technologies, producers may create swiftly without having to worry about Ethereum’s problems with scale. Like any other blockchain, there are good reasons to worry about security. The network has proved that it can change by adding frameworks that make it harder to hack. In the end, Ethereum is more stable than Solana, which is more adaptable. These are two quite distinct ways of thinking that investors and producers should think about. The New Challenger: MAGACOIN FINANCE While the spotlight remains on Ethereum and Solana, the market’s most interesting opportunities often come from outside the top ten. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the scene with notable momentum. Some analysts compare its early movement to the early days of SHIBA INU and Dogecoin. Unlike the established giants with large valuations, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains at the presale stage. This early stage magnifies its potential growth significantly. Market models currently project possible rallies of up to 12,000% during intensified altseason rotations. Scarcity mechanisms form the heart of this optimistic outlook. Token allocations remain intentionally limited across all distribution rounds. These limited rounds have been selling out rapidly since launch. Early whale accumulation has added credibility to the project’s narrative. This activity signals that sophisticated players are positioning themselves ahead of exchange listings. The project’s unique branding makes it particularly compelling. Its connection to political and cultural currents captures attention beyond crypto’s usual circles. This combination of scarcity, branding, and early adoption mirrors historical traits that fuel breakout altcoin stories . Investors watching for the next cycle’s cultural driver see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a unique opportunity. The established networks cannot replicate this opportunity due to their maturity. Timing the Rotation Altcoin seasons follow a familiar and predictable rhythm across market cycles. Bitcoin rallies typically occur first and strongest. Ethereum then consolidates gains and establishes support levels. Liquidity eventually flows into smaller tokens after these initial movements. During these capital transfers, both Solana and Ethereum will gain. When people are most excited about shopping, newer projects often see the most rapid growth. Outperforming assets have clear trends that can be seen in past cycles. Tokens with new designs and features for scarcity did much better than well-known brands. This trend from history fits nicely with MAGACOIN FINANCE. Since Bitcoin’s popularity is staying the same and capital is getting ready to move, now seems like a good time for MAGACOIN FINANCE to gain huge traction. Which Ecosystem Should Investors Choose? How much risk an investor is willing to take will have a big impact on whether they choose Solana versus Ethereum. Ethereum’s established system and well-aligned rules make it stable. These qualities make it more probable that institutions will do well over time. Solana is quick and works well for apps that need to handle a lot of traffic. This makes it attractive to both developers and customers who demand good performance. If investors are willing to go beyond the main networks, they might uncover other options. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not like any other sites that are already out there. It’s an early-stage chance centered on a story and the premise that things are hard to find. Even if Ethereum and Solana will still get most of the attention, purchasers often find the inconsistent returns they’re searching for during altcoin season in new coins. Conclusion: Giants and Newcomers Together Shape the Future There won’t be a clear winner in the fight between Solana and Ethereum. It’s conceivable that both ecosystems will do well by using different methods and areas of expertise. Ethereum will keep expanding as it becomes more mature and trustworthy. Solana will grow by becoming faster and cheaper. The market might not remember 2025 only for this competition, though. This year could be known for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that made history. Market models that predict big rises make for interesting stories. Limited amounts make potential investors feel like they need to act quickly. Branding that appeals to people outside of the crypto community gives it cultural importance. This mix shows a different type of business idea based on timing and cultural momentum. This mix could really change things for early participants in a year when altseason rotations are supposed to get stronger.

Fresh Proof that 589 Is Special for XRP Is Making Rounds,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-589-fresh-proof-that-589-is-special-for-xrp-is-making-rounds/,"A prominent and well-known XRP meme account operating under the name “$589” has drawn attention once again to the recurring appearance of the number “589” in relation to XRP and recent developments within the ecosystem. In a recent tweet, the account presents official filings that it believes demonstrate a consistent link between XRP, Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD , and intellectual property filings associated with Ripple-affiliated figures. The $XRP trademark featuring 589 has been making its rounds again lately… Reminder its also in the RLUSD trademark. 589 985 As well in @JoelKatz and @ahbritto Polysign patent. It’s undeniable that #XRP and 589 are connected. pic.twitter.com/cl4W2nzGJP — $589 (@589CTO) August 21, 2025 Trademark Details for XRP and RLUSD The account noted that the XRP trademark carries the registration number 4458993, which contains the digits “589.” This trademark has long been finalized and is listed as “Accepted and Acknowledged” by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. By contrast, the RLUSD trademark, tied to Ripple’s newly introduced U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin , remains in its early application stage under serial number 98537677. The account highlighted the mirrored numbers between the two filings, citing “589” within the XRP registration and “985” within RLUSD’s serial number. According to the commentary, this connection underscores a deliberate alignment between XRP and RLUSD, reinforcing the long-standing significance of “589” within the XRP narrative. Patent Filing Connected to PolySign The tweet further pointed to a U.S. patent issued on September 17, 2024, originally filed in October 2021, and assigned to PolySign, Inc. The patent, titled Preventing an Erroneous Transmission of a Copy of a Record of Data to a Distributed Ledger System, carries the patent number 12095897, once again containing “589.” The inventors listed on this filing are David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, and Arthur Britto, a co-founder of Ripple. The $589 account emphasized the presence of “589” in this patent as another example of how the number repeatedly surfaces in XRP-related intellectual property and developments linked to individuals central to Ripple’s history. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Community Significance of “589” Within the XRP community, “589” has become a notable symbol tied to speculation and commentary about XRP’s future. What began as a meme linked to bold predictions about price potential has endured as a recurring reference point. Over the years, community members have continued to highlight instances where the number appears in documents, filings, or developments associated with Ripple and its ecosystem. The $589 account framed these latest examples as evidence that the number’s persistence is not coincidental. It described XRP and “589” as undeniably connected, citing the XRP trademark, RLUSD’s filing, and the PolySign patent as converging points where the number continues to appear.

On-chain address growth adds fuel to the move. Meanwhile, ETH tokens like Ethena, Aave, and Remittix are showing strong upside potential. Remittix, in particular, has sold over 616 million tokens, is priced at $0.0969, and has raised over $21 million, boosted by its upcoming Q3 wallet beta and $250,000 giveaway as listing momentum builds. Ethena (ENA): Buybacks, TVL Surge, and a Clear Upside Path Ethena has defied broader crypto weakness, rallying about 18 % in 24 hours after buybacks and strong demand for its USDe stablecoin. Price sits at $0.73, with volumes jumping and TVL doubling to $11.9B, a clear sign of growing adoption. Analysts flag $0.71 as the key support; hold that, and a run toward $0.83 stays on the table. Recent price prediction models suggest Ethena could reach $1.37 if this zone holds and sentiment remains positive. Aave (AAVE): Lending Leader Rips on Network Expansion Aave (AAVE) is leading DeFi’s daily gainers with a nearly 19 % surge to around $371, the top gainer among the largest tokens. This rally follows its expansion onto Aptos and renewed DeFi demand amid dovish central bank signals. Aave’s one-week performance shows a 28 % jump from the previous week. Market watchers highlight its role in flash loans and lending infrastructure as key longer-term drivers. Remittix (RTX): PayFi Utility With Listings Remittix taps into tangible, real-world use. It has sold over 616 million tokens, is priced at $0.0969, and raised over $21 million, metrics that speak to real investor interest. Having cleared the $20 million mark, it launched on BitMart and is preparing to reveal a second exchange upon hitting $22 million. Additional momentum comes from its approaching Q3 wallet beta launch and a $250,000 giveaway. Here’s what puts Remittix in the spotlight: Cross-border payout rails live and are expanding Built for adoption, not speculation Crypto to bank utility aimed at freelancers and global earners Utility first token built around transaction volume Funding and product delivery confirming real progress With exchange listing momentum building, Remittix could outperform even high-flying tokens if execution continues. ETH’s $5K Bid and the Alt Plays to Watch Ethereum Price Prediction of a breakout past $5,000 is grounded in strong institutional demand and technical setups. Tokens like Ethena and Aave offer compelling setups: Ethena reopening on chain activity and price structure, Aave benefiting from platform expansion and bullish sentiment. Yet, Remittix blends execution, utility, and incentives, potentially rewriting what altcoin upside can look like.

50582964,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-october-2025-price-prediction-whats-next-ahead-of-etf-decisions/,1756017000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50582964.jpeg,XRP October 2025 Price Prediction: What’s Next Ahead of ETF Decisions?,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-october-2025-price-prediction-whats-next-ahead-of-etf-decisions/,"XRP has once again taken center stage as investors prepare to face a crucial October 2025. The asset, which has long been the subject of legal and regulatory disputes, has become a center of speculation as to the next round of crypto ETF approvals. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already showed how conventional market tools are having an ability to redefine liquidity and mainstream capital. In the case of XRP potentially joining them, analysts claim that October may become the turning point in the long-term trajectory of the token. The stakes are high. If an XRP-based ETF is approved, it would drive substantial institutional investments and cement XRP as more than just a token to facilitate cross-border payments. This may become the strongest rally ever seen in XRP since the end of the SEC battle in 2023. Current forecasts for October highlight a minimum price of $3.05, an average around $3.30, and a potential high of $3.47 , signaling a 21% ROI from recent trading levels. At the same time, many investors have noticed that capital is flowing not only into established giants like XRP but also toward emerging presales carrying explosive momentum – MAGACOIN FINANCE being a prime example . Current XRP price performance Over the past month, XRP has shown notable volatility. According to CoinMarketCap data , the token slid from late July highs above $3.55 to its current level around $2.80 . The chart provides repeated selling actions in and around the $3.20-$3.30 area, and stiff resistance at $3.50. Despite this correction, analysts remain optimistic. As buying support stays above the 2.70 mark and ETF-based short speculation increases, October projections indicate that XRP might rally when a sentiment reversal occurs. Traders are also tracking volume patterns, which are signaling accumulation below $3.00. If buying pressure increases ahead of ETF decisions, XRP may regain its $3.30 range and push toward October’s projected peak of $3.47. This momentum would mean more than a simple technical bounce, as it would be a validation of XRP as a tool ready to compete with Ethereum and Bitcoin when it comes to institutional attention. ETF decisions shaping the landscape There is an increasing expectation on the SEC to speed up its position regarding the altcoin-related ETFs. Institutional investors have invested billions in Bitcoin and Ethereum funds and are seeking new opportunities. XRP is particularly well-positioned because of its liquidity, international relations, and clarity in the law after its partial court win. The implication of approval of an XRP ETF in October would transcend the effect on price action. There would be greater liquidity, reduced volatility, and an inflow of capital driven by wealth managers and retirement funds. Such a scenario would put XRP one step closer to its aim of mainstream integration, unlike other altcoins, which still lack unresolved regulatory issues. Although XRP might captivate headlines, keen investors understand that real alpha tends to come in the form of earlier-stage projects. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured market imagination. Already joined by over 10,000 investors , the project’s presale has been selling out in rapid phases, underscoring intense demand. Analysts have gone as far as forecasting a 10,000% ROI potential in the next bull run, driven by scarcity mechanics, cultural momentum, and strong branding. Ranked among the best altcoins to buy right now , MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t competing with XRP directly. Rather, it fulfills a different purpose, leveraging a narrative-based boost that has proven to yield some of the most explosive crypto assets. Where XRP depends on regulation and institutional adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on early adoption cycles, community hype, and the allure of outsized returns. For new investors, this dual dynamic, anchoring in an established player like XRP while adding speculative exposure through MAGACOIN FINANCE, presents a diversified strategy tailored for 2025’s evolving market. Comparing XRP with emerging narratives The contrast between XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights the shifting landscape of crypto investment. XRR represents regulatory resilience and institutional readiness, and the ETF decision in October has been an incentive to drive mainstream inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, symbolizes raw momentum and speculative opportunity, capturing the same cultural spark that propelled DOGE and SHIB in previous cycles but with a 2025 twist. Investors are increasingly combining these approaches, for example, maintaining balances in mature altcoins like XRP to provide stability and holding a limited number of presale coins that have high upside potential. As more investors gain exposure to the liquidity, this bet of both security and leverage may be the new play to follow in the bull run of 2025. Conclusion October 2025 promises to be a pivotal month for XRP, with price forecasts pointing to gains as high as $3.47 if ETF approval injects fresh optimism into the market. Current trading near $2.80 highlights both the risk and the potential reward: a recovery could mark the start of XRP’s next major breakout. Yet, the broader picture also reveals a parallel story. MAGACOIN FINANCE, already accelerating with thousands of early investors, offers a speculative counterpart that embodies crypto’s culture of bold ROI potential. For investors positioning ahead of the next wave, XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE together paint a compelling picture: one represents the steady march toward regulation and adoption, while the other captures the explosive energy of narrative-driven growth. Both can describe the potential possibilities that will come in the next few months.

With predictions of strong rallies, analysts are paying close attention to Polygon (POL), XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Polygon and XRP are seen as steady players in the space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as a rising star with bold projections of a possible jump. Together, these three are shaping up as the top crypto to invest in as analysts look ahead to the next wave of growth. Polygon Price Prediction Points to Steady Upside Polygon has built its name by solving Ethereum’s scaling challenges, giving users faster and cheaper transactions. This strength has made POL one of the most talked-about networks for DeFi and NFT projects. POL 7D price chart Analysts suggest Polygon price prediction could land around $1.30 to $1.55 by late 2025, with some models even hinting at a move past $3. This growth outlook has put Polygon on several lists of the best altcoins to buy, especially for investors targeting altcoins with high potential in the Ethereum ecosystem. With strong developer activity and expanding institutional attention, POL is consistently mentioned as one of the top crypto to invest in for the next market cycle. XRP 2025 Forecast Raises Hopes for Big Moves The XRP community is hyped up over potential ETF approval in 2025. Reports suggest an 85% to 98% chance of approval by October. Analysts believe this could drive XRP’s value to $25 or beyond, placing it among the best crypto to buy now for those seeking exposure to regulated institutional demand. The XRP 2025 forecast aligns with the idea that ETFs could trigger mainstream flows into the token, making it one of the altcoins with high potential for gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE Targets Breakout Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting analyst attention for its explosive projections . Market watchers suggest it could see near-term rallies of 120% to 180%, while longer-term models point to possible 60x returns. This bold outlook places MAGACOIN FINANCE in direct conversation with established names like Polygon and XRP. The coin is increasingly mentioned among the best altcoins to buy and best crypto to buy now, as investors shift focus toward newer projects showing breakout potential.

In a post on X, He wrote, “THIS IS BAD #XRP!!!!!!!!! Watch Out.” He captioned a detailed video in which he analyzed XRP’s market position using cycle theory and technical indicators. According to the analyst, while the outlook could still allow for an explosive upside in the short term, the signals suggest that XRP might be approaching the late stage of its current bull cycle. Halving Cycle Framework Applied to XRP In his breakdown, Steph Is Crypto explained that he applied the Bitcoin halving cycle profit indicator directly to XRP’s chart. He noted that historically, every four years, the cryptocurrency market has followed a repeating pattern of accumulation, breakout, and eventual peak. He referenced XRP’s behavior during the 2017 bull run and again in 2020, pointing out that the current 2025 market phase mirrors these historical structures. The analyst stressed that this did not mean the market could not extend or behave differently this time, but he emphasized that previous cycles suggest XRP may be nearing the “final surge” phase. He described this period as one where a strong upward movement occurs before a subsequent correction or bear market sets in. THIS IS BAD #XRP !!!!!!!!! *Watch Out* pic.twitter.com/JO6yGDKRbj — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 22, 2025 Holder Profitability and Market Risk Steph Is Crypto is also focused on the profitability of XRP holders as an important metric. He highlighted that over 90 percent of XRP investors are currently sitting in profit, which is historically significant. In his analysis, similar conditions were observed in 2018 and 2021, both of which were followed by substantial corrections that marked the end of cycle peaks. He pointed to this metric as further evidence that XRP is poised to reach the end stage of the current bullish run. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While he acknowledged that history may not repeat exactly, he cautioned that the convergence of profitability levels and cycle theory made the situation noteworthy. He framed this data as a signal for investors to be prepared rather than a recommendation to sell. Technical Indicators and the RSI Trend Line Another critical component of his analysis was the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on XRP’s monthly chart. Steph Is Crypto pointed out a multi-year downward trend line that has remained since 2017. Each time XRP’s RSI has touched this line, it has coincided with either a sharp correction or the start of a bear market, such as what occurred in 2018. He noted that in January 2025, XRP touched this trend line once again, leading to a correction of more than 50%. According to him, the RSI now appears to be on course to retest the same trend line, which could allow for one more upward move before a potential downturn. Steph Is Crypto concluded his analysis by stressing the importance of awareness and preparedness among investors. While the data points and historical comparisons suggest that XRP may be nearing the final phase of its current bull cycle, he left open the possibility that the market could behave differently this time. He reiterated that the signals he presented were not predictions of immediate decline but rather an attempt to highlight patterns and risks that have consistently influenced XRP’s past performance.

Although much of the coverage early on centered around Bitcoin being digital gold and Ethereum being a smart contract pioneer, 2025 presents a powerful new narrative: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Analysts suggest that this industry can be a multi-trillion-dollar industry as soon as within a decade, so this kind of industry is bound to change the way ownership, liquidity and access to investment work in the global markets. At its fundamental stage, tokenization can transform physical/financial assets, real estate, commodities, equities or even intellectual properties into tokens included in the blockchains and could be traded around the clock. This opens up liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets, opens them up to fractional ownership, and makes access to asset classes traditionally only available to institutional investors. The possible impact is enormous: a 100-million-dollar office building may be turned into 100,000 share tokens, which may be sold to any buyer in the world with a digital wallet. Why tokenization is the next frontier The efficiency and ease of accessing RWA token is the selling point. The conventional transferring of assets hinges on brokers, custodians, and weeks of paperwork. Assets tied with tokenization are in the form of numbers and digital values, which accelerate the settlement process to a few seconds in place of days. In addition, blockchain can guarantee transparency and immutability, a quality that has been lacking in such opaque markets as real estate or private equity. A 2025 report by Boston Consulting Group states that by 2030 tokenized assets could be worth more than 16 trillion and make up 10 percent of global GDP. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also described tokenization as the next generation of markets via its potential to remove friction and give access to the markets to a wider range of people all over the globe. It is not an exaggeration that banks, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds are piloting tokenization platforms with such heavyweight endorsements. However, as institutions table safe bets with cautious trials, the crypto investor is eager to find early, nimble endeavors likely to move up towards a larger outcome prior to mainstream integration. It is this very setting, where traditional markets are confronted with blockchain, that investors feel that it is here where the next breakout and altcoin stories will be established. Although tokenization is a titanic new trend, not all of them will reap the benefits of it. It is here that MAGACOIN FINANCE has started to shine. When more settled cryptocurrencies such as XRP or Solana are already priced to their limits due to institutional activity, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents an innovation to buy a more politically charged, community-backed token identified to lie in similar adoption patterns to the broader market. With early buyers already treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as a play beyond the normal position, analysts have noted that momentum shifts are already being witnessed . With its limited allocation model, people are feeling a sense of urgency with presale rounds filling out in short order and smart money flows contributing toward quiet accumulation by whales. To put it in other words, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned at the border of society influence and internal changes in the market that have traditionally separated the largest participants of crypto cycles. The same way SHIB rode a crypto cultural energy in 2021 and how Ethereum took advantage of the DeFi boom in 2020, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now positioning itself with tokenization as the trillion-dollar trend of the decade. A trillion-dollar opportunity in the making The scale of potential is staggering. Consider bond markets, valued at over $120 trillion globally. Even a fractional migration of these instruments onto blockchains would inject immense liquidity into the crypto ecosystem. Similarly, real estate, a $350 trillion global asset class , is highly illiquid and fragmented. Tokenization could allow smaller investors to hold fractions of prime properties, enabling diversification once reserved for ultra-wealthy families and funds. Moreover, tokenization paves the way for new financial products. Fractionalized fine art, tokenized intellectual property royalties, and digital representations of commodities like gold or oil can all be instantly tradable across decentralized platforms. This fusion of tangible and digital worlds makes crypto not just a speculative asset but a gateway to previously unreachable value. Lessons from past cycles History suggests that the biggest opportunities emerge not from following institutional leaders, but from anticipating shifts before they become obvious. In 2017, few believed Ethereum could rise to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance. In 2021, meme coins shocked the world by outperforming established altcoins. By 2025, tokenization projects, and those that position themselves adjacent to this trend, are the candidates to surprise again. The common thread? Branding, timing, and scarcity. Projects that can capture investor imagination while offering limited, strategic entry points tend to create the flywheel of growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this mold, with presale scarcity mimicking the early stages of DOGE and SHIBA, while its political identity builds stickiness in a noisy market. Institutional validation and the retail opportunity It’s worth noting that institutions are not ignoring tokenization. JPMorgan’s Onyx platform already processes billions in tokenized collateral, while Goldman Sachs has announced RWA initiatives across bond markets. But institutions move slowly, bound by regulation and risk frameworks. This creates a gap for retail investors: the chance to enter ahead of Wall Street, in projects that mirror the coming wave but are still small enough to deliver exponential growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies that early positioning advantage. With whales quietly rotating from older meme tokens like PEPE and DOGE, analysts argue it’s being treated as a next-cycle candidate capable of linking cultural power to structural financial innovation. Its scarcity-driven model reflects the very forces that make tokenization itself so compelling: limited supply, broad access, and democratized participation. Conclusion: a trillion-dollar narrative in motion Tokenization of real-world assets is no longer a fringe idea, it’s a structural shift that could reshape global markets. By bringing liquidity, transparency, and fractional access to assets worth hundreds of trillions, it represents the next great frontier for blockchain adoption. Analysts are nearly unanimous: this sector will create the stories of the next crypto cycle. Within that story, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being spotlighted as a rare opportunity. With limited allocations, political branding, and growing whale interest, it mirrors the patterns that defined the early breakout tokens of past cycles, only this time, its narrative aligns with one of the most powerful economic shifts of our generation.

Recent trends point to several digital assets with huge potential in this cycle. With prices already starting to move, missing out now may lead to regret. This article breaks down which cryptocurrencies everyone is eyeing before it’s too late. Toncoin’s Road Ahead: Fast Rails, Big Dreams, Bold Prices Toncoin powers The Open Network, an online rail first built by Telegram in 2018. After a court halt in 2020, volunteers renamed it and kept coding. The coin now runs on a stake-based system that speeds up checks and cuts power use. Users can send cash-like transfers in seconds and pay only tiny fees. Plans reach far beyond payments: cloud storage, friendly names, private surfing, and small apps can all sit on the same chain. This wide vision gives Toncoin a lively, growing crowd of fans and builders. Price watchers see wide moves ahead. Models that follow bitcoin’s halving rhythm place Toncoin near $6.45 at the low and $30.30 at the high in 2025, a jump of over threefold from today. Later years swing, with lows of $5.39–$16.27 and highs of $12.04–$40.52 through 2030, yet the top calls stay well above current levels. In a market where older coins fight to stay fresh, TON’s fresh code and busy updates stand out. If the network keeps adding tools, those bold targets may look less like dreams and more like milestones. Hyperliquid: The Gas-Free Highway for Perpetual Crypto Trading Hyperliquid is a new base network built only for fast money apps. Its secret sauce is a fresh way for computers to agree, so trades lock in almost at once. All orders sit on the chain, not on side lists, so anyone can check them. Because the team controls the whole stack, they cut fees to zero. You pay no gas to place or close a trade. Behind the code stand builders from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT who left big tech and Wall Street to chase a bold idea. In a market that loves speed, Hyperliquid could steal users from giants like Ethereum, where busy days still cost a few dollars per click. It also rivals Solana’s pace while offering full openness in its order book. Fresh coins that solve pain points often run hard when the wider crypto cycle turns up, and many watchers see early signs of that turn now. If volume keeps rising and the zero-fee promise holds, the token may ride the next wave with energy. As always, buyers should look past buzz and watch real use grow. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ , the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet . Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Mantle (MNT): A Lean Rollup Riding the New Wave of Ethereum Growth Mantle is a new helper chain that works with Ethereum . It bundles many steps into one, so moves and trades happen fast and cost less. The chain is made of parts that can be swapped without harm. This helps builders create apps that feel smooth. Users can lock their ETH through Mantle’s staking plan and earn extra coins while still using their money. A big pool of funds backs the project. People who hold the MNT coin vote on how that money and the tech are used, so all plans stay open to the public. Speed, clear rules, and deep pockets make Mantle stand out. Many helper chains focus only on code, yet few give everyday users a loud voice. Money is now flowing back to fast chains that also bring in fees, like Arbitrum and Optimism. Mantle’s coin still trades cheaper than those rivals even though its fund is larger. If more action shifts to side chains and coin locking stays hot, need for MNT may grow. Still, success hangs on builders picking the chain and on voters guiding the fund with care. Conclusion TON, HYPE and MNT promise solid gains, yet XYZVerse’s all-sport meme power, GameFi roadmap and 20,000% target hint at greater upside as the bull run accelerates.

In the breakdown, he described the move as significant both for Ripple’s broader financial ambitions and for the potential role of XRP within institutional markets. According to his assessment, the credit facility is not only a lifeline for Gemini but also a calculated step that aligns with Ripple’s larger strategy of integrating its stablecoin, RLUSD , and positioning itself as a player in U.S. banking infrastructure. RIPPLE JUST DID SOMETHING THAT SHOULD TERRIFY JPMORGAN AND THRILL XRP HOLDERS. A $150M credit line to Gemini. A federal crypto bank in the making. This isn’t just big—it’s historic. Let me break it down. pic.twitter.com/2AeyylsG3b — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) August 21, 2025 Credit Facility and Gemini’s Position As outlined in the analysis, Ripple extended a secured $75 million credit line to Gemini, expandable to $150 million. No funds have been drawn yet, but the credit line was included in Gemini’s IPO filing. The significance of this, according to All Things XRP, lies in Gemini’s financial condition. He noted that in the first half of 2025, Gemini recorded $282 million in losses and reported liabilities exceeding $2 billion. In that context, the credit line is described as essential support as the exchange prepares for its Nasdaq IPO. Connection to RLUSD Adoption All Things XRP highlighted that Ripple’s decision to extend this facility goes beyond assisting Gemini. If Gemini draws over $75 million, Ripple can convert the loan to RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. He emphasized that this could establish a pathway for institutional adoption of RLUSD, particularly if Gemini uses the stablecoin to settle IPO flows. He connected this to Ripple’s earlier role in Bullish’s IPO, in which $1.15 billion was settled through RLUSD. The analysis suggests that Ripple may be applying a similar model again, but this time with greater implications given Gemini’s upcoming listing. Ripple’s Bank Charter Application The analysis also drew attention to Ripple’s filing for a U.S. national trust bank charter in July. If approved, Ripple would be authorized to hold Federal Reserve reserves, offer FDIC-insured crypto deposits, and potentially use XRP held in escrow as regulatory capital. All Things XRP opined that this could elevate Ripple into the ranks of the top 20 banks in the United States, supported by its 40 billion XRP held in escrow. He described this as a pivotal development, particularly because it would be entirely on-chain and under regulatory oversight. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry Pushback and Competitive Dynamics In his commentary, All Things XRP noted opposition to Ripple’s charter application from major banking organizations, including the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC), JPMorgan, and Bank of America. He interpreted this resistance as stemming from the view that Ripple is not merely seeking to join the financial system but is attempting to restructure its underlying infrastructure. Benefits to XRP The analysis concluded that Ripple’s approach carries indirect but meaningful benefits for XRP. Every RLUSD transaction is settled on the XRP Ledger, generating activity and fees in XRP. Increased utility, combined with reduced need for Ripple to sell escrowed holdings, could create favorable momentum for the asset. All Things XRP summarized Ripple’s overall trajectory as building a crypto-native banking framework, consisting of credit facilities, stablecoin infrastructure, institutional integration, and regulatory structure.

And that’s because XRP’s price performance in the coming months is uncertain due to the mixed ETF chatter. Yes, talk of an XRP spot ETF flared, but BlackRock says it isn’t filing “for now.” Also, other Ripple headlines point to postponed/denied applications and next dates into October 2025. You don’t anchor your thesis on an ETF this quarter, and that’s why this piece will explore two alternative projects tipped to do exploits in the remaining months of 2025. Why Caution Around XRP Price Is Growing Despite the recent regulatory clarity and strong settlement with the SEC, experts are growing wary about Ripple’s performance in the coming months. Here’s what’s making analysts scratch their heads: Profit pressure ahead: the share of XRP supply that’s currently in profit has surged to nearly 94% after the August rally to around $3.10, putting it in the same “euphoria zone” we saw before prior sell-offs. That signals a high likelihood of short-term profit-taking. Selling under the hood: On-chain tracking suggests that selling pressure has been quietly increasing around recent highs, as a growing number of holders cash out at levels that feel “too rich.” Catalysts look light: With much of the 2025 upside already baked in, any fresh lift for XRP now will probably need a new catalyst, say, institutional payments uptake or movement on ETF filings, rather than further hype. In short, the market isn’t broken, but right now, most smart investors are standing back and asking: What’s next? Alternative 1: Avalanche (AVAX) — Quiet Strength, Continued Buoyancy If analysts are drawing more cautious lines under XRP, Avalanche is among the next-generation projects quietly gaining attention: Recent coverage has kicked up headlines, placing AVAX among the “top potential crypto projects for 2025.” Its gaming ecosystem, modular architecture, and growing DeFi usage give it resilience and upward potential. Momentum has followed; one report spotlights its ability to surpass $30, buoyed by a surge in network activity and developer engagement. Analysts view AVAX as both pragmatic and agile, contrasting with XRP’s more compliance-driven trajectory. The $30 level now stands as a technical aperture, with possible gains toward $40 if adoption picks up. Alternative 2: Remittix (RTX) — The PayFi Newcomer with Big Gain Potential For investors looking beyond infrastructure, Remittix is staging a breakout narrative: It’s building PayFi rails, enabling crypto-to-fiat payouts into bank accounts across 30+ countries; real-world utility with ongoing presale traction. Remarkably, RTX has surpassed $21M raised, with a first CEX listing on BitMart already lined up and a Q3 beta wallet on the horizon. Analysts are talking 100× potential returns, far beyond what’s often pitched for XRP. If adoption of its payment infrastructure scales, even modestly, the upside could dwarf many traditional altcoins! In the end, Ripple RTX’s mood is cautious and not bearish. AVAX offers a well-supported infrastructure story with real momentum. Meanwhile, Remittix is emerging as the speculative darling in PayFi for those willing to take more risk for potentially massive upside, and who believe crypto’s next frontier is payments, not just speculation.

According to Binance data, the record $900 price was a result of the recent surge in Ethereum and other altcoins. Interestingly, some other exchange-linked tokens also experienced similar increases. BNB is not currently directly associated with the Binance exchange, but it is known that the coin was developed by the exchange and has serious support. However, a tweet by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance's founder and former CEO, during a time when the BNB price was breaking records, caused a stir on social media platforms. CZ, who was visiting Kyrgyzstan, shared a photo of himself being assigned a vehicle with the license plate “888 BNB.” The $888 price was a reference to the coin's all-time high. Related News: Experienced Analyst il Capo Predicts What Will Happen to Bitcoin and Altcoins Following Recent Developments CZ, who shared the photo, also stated that the license plate in question wasn't planned. However, the most important point was what he said next. CZ stated that the number 8888 is considered lucky in China. This unexpected rise sparked speculation that CZ had set $8,888 as his next target for the BNB price. For the coin's price to reach $8,888, its total market capitalization would need to reach approximately $1.2 trillion. Given that Ethereum's current market capitalization is $573 billion, this seems at least a distant scenario for now. *This is not investment advice.

This trend has intensified recently, and here are some of the latest additions. Slowly Climbing Up One of the more recent procurements comes from Ming Shing Group, a publicly traded Hong Kong-based company listed on the NASDAQ (MSW), specializing in wet trades, such as plastering, tiling, and bricklaying, among others. The purchase agreement is for 4,250 bitcoins, worth approximately $482 million, with an average price of $113,638 per unit. It is currently ranked 45th on the BitcoinTreasuries leaderboard, with 833 BTC, having started accumulating in early January, trailing the Nordic healthcare company H100 Group’s stash of 911 BTC. Its stock has reacted positively to the announcement, rising over 11% daily earlier tshi week, according to the most recent data from Google Finance. Source: Google Finance A Known Face Earlier in the week, KindlyMD increased its holdings by a notable 5,744 BTC, with an estimated cost of $679 million, at an average cost per bitcoin of $118,204. It’s an American healthcare and healthcare data company, also trading on the NASDAQ (NAKA), having merged with its Bitcoin-native holding company, Nakamoto Holdings Inc., at the start of May. The firm joined the race later in the same month, with the mission of accumulating a million of the leading crypto asset. They’re much further ahead in the rankings, holding 5,765 BTC and currently sitting in 16th place, with a notable lead over Semler Scientific, which owns 5,021 BTC at print time. “This acquisition reinforces our conviction in Bitcoin as the ultimate reserve asset for corporations and institutions alike. Our long-term mission of accumulating one million Bitcoin reflects our belief that Bitcoin will anchor the next era of global finance, and we are committed to building the most trusted and transparent vehicle to achieve that future,” noted the CEO and Chairman, David Bailey. The company’s stock, however, did not react so well to the news and has been declining since the start of the week, as indicated by data from Google Finance at the time of writing.

Below are the 10 best cryptos to buy now, including a hidden altcoin already tipped for a 20,000% ROI. Ethereum Whale Bets Big on the Next Move Ethereum tops the list of best cryptos to buy now after a whale opened a $16.35 million long position on ETH at $4,229. With Ethereum trading slightly above that level, even a modest 1% price move generates $163,000 in profit. Analysts highlight liquidity clusters around $4,336 that could make this trade highly profitable. As Ethereum stabilizes above key levels, investor confidence grows, placing it among the most closely watched assets. Stellar Upgrade and Institutional Push Stellar continues to attract attention among the best cryptos to buy now, thanks to its upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade designed to handle 5,000 transactions per second. On top of that, the Stellar Development Foundation recently backed UK-regulated Archax to drive tokenized money market funds. With real-world adoption accelerating after Franklin Templeton’s $446M treasury tokenization in July, Stellar’s mix of scalability and institutional partnerships is strengthening its place in the market. SUI Gains from RWA Integration SUI ranks as one of the best cryptos to buy now due to its progress in real-world asset integration. The launch of XAUm, a gold-backed token on Sui, connects the network directly with a $22 trillion global gold market. DeFi integrations and growing inflows have pushed its TVL past $2 billion, while ETF proposals under SEC review could open the door for further institutional interest. Despite some volatility, the network’s direction puts SUI firmly on this list. Solana Hits New Speed Milestone Solana makes the best cryptos to buy now list after reaching a record 107,664 transactions per second. With SEC decisions on ETFs delayed, uncertainty remains, but Solana’s unmatched throughput and low fees continue to keep it a favorite for developers and traders. Toncoin Benefits from Telegram Integration Toncoin holds steady at $3.39 and earns its place among the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its integration with Telegram. With one of the largest messaging apps backing adoption, TON remains one to watch for future network-driven growth. Bitcoin on Path to $600K? Bitcoin leads discussions among the best cryptos to buy now after analysts suggested a rally that could push BTC toward $600,000. Currently consolidating around $115,000, its price action mirrors gold’s trajectory between 2006 and 2020, before the metal broke to record highs. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could cement its “digital gold” status and attract trillions in global capital, reinforcing its role as the backbone of the crypto market. TRON Expands with MetaMask Integration TRON enters the list of best cryptos to buy now after securing native integration with MetaMask, giving over 100 million users easier access to TRX and DeFi apps. This upgrade could drive usage across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, building new support for TRX even as traders take some short-term profits. Cardano’s $71M Upgrade Plan Cardano is included among the best cryptos to buy now as its community approved a $71 million proposal for upgrades focused on scalability and interoperability. Historical upgrades like Alonzo triggered strong rallies, and the new roadmap introduces enhancements such as Hydra scaling and Mithril syncing. XRP Whale Buying Continues XRP secures its place in the best cryptos to buy now as whales purchased 440 million tokens worth $3.8 billion during the latest dip. Despite concerns over Ripple’s transfer of $600 million in XRP, large holders remain confident, signaling that long-term interest is far from fading. MAGACOIN: Hidden Altcoin With 20,000% ROI One of the most talked-about hidden altcoins among the best cryptos to buy now is MAGACOIN . Currently in presale, the project has already raised over $12 million while building a reputation for transparency and audited security. Analysts have tipped it for gains up to 20,000%, making it a rare entry point in today’s crowded market. With growing demand and listings expected soon, this altcoin is fast moving onto traders’ radar. What Should Traders Do? With Ethereum whales taking bold bets, Stellar upgrades, and Bitcoin’s gold-like setup, traders have several options among the best cryptos to buy now. However, MAGACOIN stands out as the hidden altcoin with a 20,000% ROI forecast.

And they got them — for a second. YZY blasted up to a $410 million market cap in under an hour, only to collapse nearly 70%—back down to ~$140 million, on the same day. The coin launched with the typical influencer-megaphone fanfare: celebrity name, viral memes, fast listings. But within hours, the reality set in. YZY followed the same tragicomic arc as dozens of “influencer coins” before it — moon, collapse, cope. That violent cliff-dive wasn’t the only eyebrow-raiser. On-chain data reveals a staggering concentration of power: just four wallets control about 80% of the YZY supply. What is more, the entire episode stinks of a setup. Crypto sleuths flagged the launch as potentially a scam, pointing to leftover tweets (since deleted) where Ye rejected a $2 million offer to promote a fake token. Suddenly, the narrative flipped: was this a controlled flip of sentiment, or a deepfake hijack of Ye’s digital persona? In short: YZY didn’t just crash, it imploded under suspicion, proving a headline and a hype tweet can launch memecoins, but can also crater them before most people even realize what hit them. The token surged to a sky-high market cap, and then crashed just as quickly as whales and insiders cashed out on day one, leaving retail bag-holders stunned and angry. The irony? A coin with billions of attention couldn’t sustain even a full week of interest. No roadmap. No structure. No trust. LIBRA, MELANIA, TRUMP — Same Stuff, Different Coin YZY wasn’t the first one. The $ LIBRA token was once touted as a political power move in Argentina. It ended as a scandal, with millions lost and angry holders left in the dust. There were rumors of inside jobs, botched launches, and maybe even government connections. And just like YZY, the token pumped on a name and crashed on the lack of substance. Turns out, it was just the latest in a string of political meme coin rugs orchestrated by the same guy: Hayden Mark Davis. Before $LIBRA, he dropped $TRUMP , then $MELANIA — coins that fooled thousands into thinking they had official backing. But it was all smoke. The tokens pumped fast, dumped faster, and left retail bleeding. If you look closer, it almost feels like these projects are run by the same crew recycling the same playbook. The playbook is simple: Attach to a big name Drop on a meme narrative Hide tokenomics Let early wallets win Vanish by the weekend Crypto isn’t falling for it anymore. The crowd is too sharp, too burned, too degen-smart to ape into “celebrity rug 15.0” . Why political meme coins are especially toxic These are much more than celebrity clichés. Political tokens often ride waves of false legitimacy promoted by supposed political insiders, sometimes via actual officeholders. That creates a dangerous illusion of authenticity, even while the underlying mechanics are pure rug-pull. The “trusted” illusion When a president or first lady seems to endorse a coin—or there’s that photo op with some tech influencer—retail investors get fooled into trusting the project. But that trust is usually a façade, floating over pump-and-dump rails. The insider advantage These coins are pre-loaded with opaque structures: a handful of wallets or insiders control the supply, dump it at the peak, and blow out — while the crowd gets left holding the bag. Fractions of seconds from “price pump” to “trust dump” These launches are hyper‑compressed: explosive spikes, instant dumps. Political memecoins potentiate this volatility because they can claim “establishment backing”—only to bite investors when the insiders exit. This isn’t just speculation. For $LIBRA, investors lost hundreds of millions after Mania‑style hype and rapid collapse. The Meme Coin Game Is Changing We’ve hit rug fatigue. The dopamine high of a Twitter-powered launch doesn’t last. People want something older, a tried-and-true format — like an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Why? Because structured presales and ICO-style launches still carry something hype coins don’t: a path to trust. A way to grow holders organically. A plan. It’s not 2017 anymore — but ironically, it’s that same ICO structure that might be the last reliable way for meme coins to reach 10x or 100x in this cycle. ICOs Still Work When Done Right Let’s break it down. What does an ICO meme coin offer that celebrity-driven tokens don’t? Structured Presale Phases – Instead of launching at peak FOMO, ICOs offer tiers where early believers buy in cheap — incentivizing community, not just whales. Transparent Tokenomics – ICOs usually share public vesting schedules and allocations. No “oops all insiders” nonsense. Locked Liquidity – No rug pulls. Funds and LPs are locked or multisigged. You know where the money is. Community-Driven Growth – ICOs build armies. Meme coins with ICOs onboard early holders who stick, not tourists who flip. Roadmaps & Delivery – Even basic. Even memes. But they give something to hold onto beyond a celebrity tweet. It’s when old-school structure meets new-school degen energy. And that’s the formula that still has room to run. XYZVerse: Start With Structure, Not Celebrity The “celebrity coin → instant moonshot” days are over. The market is too informed, too skeptical, too fast. But that doesn’t mean 1000x plays are dead — they’ve just shifted to a different model. Unlike hype-driven, instant-launch coins, XYZVerse.io ($XYZ) is taking the structured ICO route — and it’s working. The project is still in presale mode, and has already raised over $15 million from a growing base of early believers. Here’s what makes it different: Clear tokenomics — Transparent allocation, structured vesting, and no shadow bags. Roadmap with delivery milestones — From gamified staking and utility integrations to listings and burn mechanics. Community traction — Organic growth, holders accumulating, and a rising presence across crypto socials. Locked liquidity — XYZVerse allocates 15% of its total supply to liquidity, explicitly reserved to ensure smooth trading and a stable foundation post-launch The Only Meme Coins That Can 1000x Now Are ICO Memes like $XYZ XYZVerse ($XYZ) is already proving that structured meme coin launches can still capture serious upside. Starting at just $0.0001 , the token has surged through multiple presale stages to reach $0.0053 — marking an impressive 53× return for early participants. To date, over $15 million has been raised — a clear signal of growing investor demand and market belief in the project’s long-term vision. And the momentum continues: with each new stage, the price climbs. It’s currently approaching $0.0054 , with the roadmap eyeing $0.01 soon, and ultimately targeting $0.10 at launch That $0.10 listing price is more than just a round number — it represents a nearly 1,000× gain from the original presale price of $0.0001. This kind of upside doesn’t happen by accident — it comes from strategy, structure, and serious backing. Even conservative analysts estimate the token could spike to $0.15–$0.25 shortly after listing , depending on how exchange support and post-launch utility unfold. How $XYZ Can Actually Get There Phase Mechanism & Milestones Presale Momentum Tiered price model pushes the price higher as capital pours in. Roadmap Execution Active delivery: community engagement, ecosystem partnerships (e.g., bookmaker.XYZ) Built-In Scarcity 17.13% of supply permanently burned—deflationary pressure for long-term holders Upcoming Liquidity Events Listing on major CEXes and DEXes; discussions underway with KuCoin, Binance, and OKX Community Activation Aggressive airdrops (10%) and strong social media growth are building hype and loyalty Final Verdict: Structure Wins, and $XYZ Is Proof Celebrity coins are collapsing under their own hype. Today’s market demands structure, not noise — and only well-built meme coins have any shot at real returns. $XYZ is leading that shift. It’s already delivered 50x+ in presale, with a clear path to launch at $0.10, strong tokenomics, and actual utility. Forget rugs and fame-fueled flops. If you want 100x potential, structured ICOs like $XYZ are the last real play left.

According to him, the asset is poised for what he described as explosive price movement before the end of the year and into early 2026. He stated that XRP would surpass the $4 mark in the near term and reach a double-digit all-time high in the range of $10 to $15. This, he suggested, would represent a significant shift in XRP’s market valuation as it establishes itself at levels not yet seen in its trading history. $XRP will see explosive price movement over the next few months and again in early 2026 $XRP will skyrocket past $4 and finally hit a double digit ATH $10-$15 Early 2026 could see another big rally as $XRP shoots up past $10-$15 towards $50 And…. if we get announcements of… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) August 21, 2025 Early 2026 Rally and Mid-Term Targets Looking further ahead, BarriC projected that early 2026 could bring another surge in XRP’s value . He stated that prices would move beyond the $10 to $15 range and push toward $50. His view highlights a belief that the asset’s growth trajectory will not be limited to one rally but will extend into multiple phases of price expansion over a longer time horizon. These predictions position XRP where sustained institutional interest and growing adoption could form the foundation for such levels of valuation. Impact of Bank Adoption BarriC further elaborated that the most significant factor for XRP’s valuation would be the official adoption and utilization of the asset by banks. He emphasized that any announcements confirming banks making use of XRP in their operations would fundamentally alter the price dynamics. In his words, such developments would not merely reinforce XRP’s movement within a $10 to $50 range but could elevate it to a far higher level. He suggested that with such an adoption event, the starting point for XRP’s value could be at $1,000 , describing this figure as a minimal threshold in that scenario. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Mixed Reactions from the Community The comments in response to BarriC’s prediction reflected a range of views. A user named Wildflowers rejected the outlook, describing it as lacking logic and dismissing it as guesswork. Another participant in the conversation, however, defended the projection, arguing that it was grounded in clear reasoning. This response highlighted the relationship between demand and price in market dynamics, suggesting that if the adoption scenarios outlined by BarriC occur, higher valuations would naturally follow. The reply also criticized Wildflowers, asserting that a misunderstanding of the logic did not equate to flaws in the argument presented. BarriC’s predictions present one of the most ambitious XRP outlooks currently circulating among its supporters. His vision combines short-term projections of new all-time highs with the possibility of exponential long-term growth if banking adoption takes place. While the community responses show disagreement about the likelihood of such outcomes, the central point of his statement emphasizes adoption as the primary driver of transformative price levels for XRP.

Strategic Tokenomics : A fixed supply of 420T tokens, mirroring Pepe, with allocations for presale, staking (242% APY), marketing, and liquidity, designed to support sustainable growth. Utility-Backed Ecosystem : A demo version of the Pepeto Exchange has already been displayed on socials, showcasing the zero-fee exchange, swap tech, and bridge. Applications are opening for Web3 projects to list in Stage 2. While its branding taps into meme culture, Pepeto is positioning itself as a token with real value. Its ecosystem includes a zero-fee exchange , PepetoSwap , and a cross-chain bridge , while staking rewards of 242% APY incentivize long-term holding. The project has also completed audits by SolidProof and Coinsult , giving added assurance of security.

Over 300 financial institutions are now using RippleNet for cross-border payments, processing billions in settlements with remarkable efficiency. Reports confirm that in Q2 2025, institutional purchases of XRP reached more than $7.1 billion , underlining its growing acceptance by banks and payment providers. Yet as institutional flows consolidate around giants like XRP, retail traders and agile funds often rotate into leaner, high-upside plays where smaller inflows can spark exponential gains. That dynamic has recently brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight, as conversations among analysts highlight it as a next-generation contender positioned at the opposite end of the spectrum—small enough to multiply rapidly, yet structured enough to capture long-term narratives. Why banks are betting on Ripple Global institutions such as Santander, SBI Holdings, and PNC Bank have already deployed Ripple-powered platforms. Santander’s “One Pay FX” app allows near-instant global transfers, while SBI Remit leverages XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity for Asian remittances. These real-world use cases are no longer theoretical—they are live, regulated banking solutions used by millions of customers. This momentum has been reinforced by regulatory clarity. The landmark settlement with the SEC officially determined that XRP should not be classified as a security in secondary markets. That legal breakthrough has already triggered the relisting of XRP on U.S. exchanges and renewed optimism around the prospect of spot XRP ETFs . With regulatory obstacles removed, banks and asset managers now have a clear runway to integrate Ripple’s solutions at scale. Ripple’s expansion in the U.S. is equally telling. By applying for a bank charter and Federal Reserve master account access , Ripple is positioning itself not as a fintech outsider, but as a regulated participant in the financial system. This ambition underscores why banks are increasingly aligning with Ripple: they want crypto technology that can scale within compliance frameworks. While banks focus on Ripple’s utility and compliance, retail investors are chasing the next big narrative. Here, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. Positioned as a culturally resonant, it blends scarcity mechanics with an audited, capped supply structure that appeals to traders looking for asymmetric returns. Analysts suggest MAGACOIN’s trajectory mirrors early-stage meme tokens that later gained mainstream traction. But unlike many short-lived experiments, MAGACOIN comes with strategic expansion plans, audited credibility, and a rapidly growing early community. This combination has drawn attention to its presale phases, where entry costs remain low compared to future projections. For those who missed XRP’s institutional-scale growth, MAGACOIN offers a very different, but potentially just as rewarding, avenue for participation in 2025’s shifting crypto landscape. Forecast models even suggest that 25x growth could easily be achievable as liquidity expands and adoption grows. XRP sets the rails, MAGACOIN rides the narrative Banking adoption of XRP gives crypto legitimacy, ensuring regulatory structures embrace digital assets instead of excluding them. This creates downstream effects: when institutions validate crypto, investor appetite for smaller tokens often surges. MAGACOIN Finance could benefit from that renewed appetite. Historically, altcoins with strong cultural hooks have captured retail interest once the market environment turns bullish. XRP might become the backbone of institutional settlement, but it is tokens like MAGACOIN that capture attention and liquidity from traders seeking exponential upside. The timing is fortuitous, just as Ripple cements its role in banking, MAGACOIN positions itself as the retail growth story for 2025. Conclusion: banks fuel XRP, culture fuels MAGACOIN FINANCE Ripple’s XRP is the clear institutional favorite, backed by regulatory clarity, financial integration, and global adoption. But while XRP offers steady credibility and gradual gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the early-mover potential of explosive growth . For investors, the pairing is complementary: Ripple defines the rails, MAGACOIN rides the narrative. With forecasts pointing to 25x potential upside , MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning a place on 2025’s shortlist of altcoins to watch. Just as banks move decisively into XRP, retail participants are eyeing MAGACOIN as the bold counterpart driving cultural momentum.

Amid a sea of fleeting memecoins, Neiro has not only survived but thrived, transforming from a meme into a credible, structured, and transparent project noted among the top memecoins on Binance. The Genesis and Evolution of Neiro Neiro's journey began under unique circumstances that set it apart from typical memecoins. Rooted in authenticity, Neiro was born with an official license for its character, derived from Kabosu, the Shiba Inu known as the face of the Doge meme. This connection established a deep cultural resonance from the outset. Beyond its pedigree, Neiro was sculpted with principles of radical transparency and community involvement. Its foundational tactics—public multisig treasury, no insiders, and volunteer-driven initiatives—were pivotal in cultivating trust and engagement among its holders. Significantly, the Neiro community early on endorsed the establishment of a legal foundation, ensuring governance structures that supported both transparent operations and strategic growth. Cultural and Charitable Impact Neiro transcended the usual trading metrics by embedding purpose and philanthropy into its operations. Remarkably, it funneled substantial support towards animal welfare, with the Neiro Foundation facilitating a landmark donation of 200 ETH to support various causes. This approach not only showcased Neiro's commitment to societal impact but also aligned its brand with meaningful, cultural moments, enhancing its reputation beyond mere speculative interest. Five Pillars of Sustainability in Memecoins Reflecting on its first year, Neiro has articulated five core principles essential for any memecoin aspiring to longevity: Ensure the authenticity of the cultural narrative through ownership or licensing. Maintain transparency in financial operations. Implement effective governance structures from the start. Incorporate charitable actions into the economic model. Preserve core values as a competitive advantage. Looking Ahead: Neiro's Second Year As Neiro steps into its second year, it aims to widen its sphere through strategic partnerships and innovative, revenue-generating initiatives. The focus will remain on real-world impact, continuing to challenge the norms of what a memecoin can achieve. The vision for Neiro is clear—not merely to exist as a token but to become a sustainable public good that retains its value and cultural significance. Snapshot: Neiro at a Glance Anniversary: July 27, Year One Identity: “Sister of Doge” with exclusive licensed IP On-Chain Transparency: Ethereum and Base contracts published; public multisig treasury Core Values: No insiders, full transparency, community-led and volunteer-driven Impact: $300K+ donated to grassroots causes, including a 200 ETH gift to the Neiro Foundation In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, Neiro's approach and achievements mark a roadmap for others to follow, proving that with the right foundations, a memecoin can indeed become a lasting and impactful enterprise.

For memecoins, the pace is even more unforgiving. In the last twelve months, we've watched hundreds of tokens ride meteoric hype cycles only to crash back to earth just as quickly. Celebrity-backed launches would spike in value for a week before vanishing from the charts entirely. Copycat projects flooded social media timelines with promises of overnight riches, only to drain liquidity pools and disappear into the digital ether. In this relentless cycle of ""blink and you miss it,"" survival itself is an achievement. Longevity is almost unheard of. Neiro turned one on July 27th. Not only did it survive its inaugural year, it matured. What began as a simple meme evolved into a structured, transparent, and culturally legitimate project that now ranks among the top memecoins traded on Binance. This is the story of how we did it, and why it matters. Neiro at a Glance Anniversary: July 27, Year One Identity: “Sister of Doge” with exclusive licensed IP On-Chain Transparency: Ethereum and Base contracts published; public multisig treasury Core Values: No insiders, full transparency, community-led and volunteer-driven Impact: $300K+ donated to grassroots causes, including a 200 ETH gift to the Neiro Foundation Why Neiro Was Different From Day One From its very first block, Neiro anchored itself in something most memecoins lack: authenticity. The project operates under an exclusive license to the Neiro character, granted directly by Atsuko Sato, the owner of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu whose expressive face became the original Doge meme. Neiro is Kabosu's adopted ""sister,"" and this lineage runs deeper than symbolism. It connects our project to one of the most recognizable and enduring cultural images on the internet. But pedigree alone doesn't guarantee survival. The community built Neiro with radical transparency as our foundation. Our contract addresses on Ethereum and Base are fully public. The treasury operates through a visible multisig wallet, with every allocation explained to our community in real-time. This ""no insiders"" philosophy meant no venture capital allocations, no pre-mines, and no backroom deals. Instead, Neiro grew organically as a volunteer-driven, bottom-up movement. Early in our journey, the community voted to fund the establishment of a legal foundation in the Cayman Islands using multisig treasury resources. This wasn't bureaucratic theater, it gave us the governance infrastructure to operate compliantly and professionally while protecting our community's collective assets. Impact That Goes Beyond Trading Neiro has become more than a speculative trading instrument. Over the past year, our community has donated nearly $300,000 to grassroots animal welfare organizations worldwide. A single 200 ETH contribution to the Neiro Foundation became a catalyst for even greater philanthropic efforts, demonstrating that crypto communities can make real-world impact a core budget priority, not merely a marketing afterthought. We've tied token burns to meaningful cultural moments, provided regular treasury updates to maintain accountability, and consistently delivered on our promises to act with genuine purpose. Every decision reinforced our commitment to being builders, not just traders. Five Lessons in Memecoin Sustainability Our first year has crystallized five fundamental principles for memecoins that aspire to longevity: Own or license your cultural foundation – Authentic cultural legitimacy beats borrowed branding every time, while creating clear pathways for compliant business partnerships. Make your finances transparent – Publish contract addresses, operate through multisig wallets, and narrate every treasury decision publicly. Establish governance structures early – Even basic legal frameworks signal your intention to operate professionally and persist beyond the initial hype cycle. Build purpose into your economics – Charitable giving and community grants should be integrated into your tokenomics, not treated as optional extras. Defend your values as competitive advantage – Transparency, fairness, and grassroots volunteer culture create sustainable trust that manufactured hype simply cannot replicate. The Road to Year Two Our work has only just begun. In our second year, Neiro will expand strategic licensing partnerships, explore revenue-generating products and services, scale our community-led grant programs, and continue measuring tangible real-world impact. Our ultimate goal is ambitious but achievable: proving that memes can evolve into durable cultural assets with lasting value. If a meme can be properly licensed, democratically governed, and held truly accountable to its community, then it transcends mere speculation. It becomes a public good that happens to have a ticker symbol. Neiro's first year proves this transformation is not only possible, it's replicable. The next challenge is making it normal.

The current presale of Layer Brett (LBRETT) is making waves in the community, with analysts forecasting it as the next 100x altcoin, while DOGE trades near $0.22 and SHIB hovers at $0.00001328. The difference? Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 innovation, offering near-instant transactions, dramatically reduced gas fees, and a scalable ecosystem that outpaces both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Unlike DOGE and SHIB, which both face congested chains and high fees, Layer Brett processes activity off-chain for speed and anchors security on Ethereum. This means users enjoy low gas fee crypto transactions and lightning-fast confirmations, a critical advantage as Layer 2 blockchains are projected to process over $10 trillion annually by 2027. How LBRETT rewards early buyers and beats DOGE at its own game Early adoption is everything in crypto, and Layer Brett’s (LBRETT) presale gives users access at just $0.0047 per token. With ETH, USDT, and BNB accepted, and wallet support for both MetaMask and Trust Wallet, entry is seamless. Compare that to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, whose main appeal is price nostalgia and meme status, not cutting-edge technology. Staking crypto with LBRETT stands out: Presale buyers can lock in APYs over 2,480% (correct at the time of writing), far outstripping static meme tokens like DOGE. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and transparent tokenomics—25% reserved for staking—early backers are set up for potentially explosive DeFi rewards. Main selling points of Layer Brett: – Built on Ethereum Layer 2 for high-speed, scalable, and secure transactions – Staking rewards over 2,480% APY for early buyers – Ultra-low entry price with presale access at $0.0047 – Community-first project with a $1 million giveaway and active campaign incentives What makes Layer Brett different from Brett, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk Layer Brett isn’t just a new meme coin—it’s where meme meets mechanism. Unlike Brett (original), which launched on Base with limited utility, Layer Brett is purpose-built for performance, scale, and user rewards. It combines viral culture with legitimate blockchain scaling, breaking away from the utility-free origins of coins like Dogecoin, SHIB, Pepe, and Bonk. While DOGE and SHIB have achieved major market caps ($30 billion and $7.83 billion respectively), both coins face stagnant development and lack new features. Pepe and Bonk have seen recent token burns and ecosystem tweaks, but neither offers the Layer 2 speed, low fees, or DeFi coin potential of Layer Brett. Even Brett’s $550 million market cap and recent price volatility can’t match the staking and scaling features of Layer Brett. Why the crypto community is getting behind Layer Brett and leaving DOGE behind Crypto users want more than just hype—they want top DeFi tokens with real rewards. Layer Brett delivers with its ongoing crypto presale, gamified staking, and unique NFT integrations. The roadmap includes a DAO for future governance, making it a true Web3 project. As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu face technical stagnation, Layer Brett is capturing attention as the best crypto to buy now and a potential top gainer crypto for the 2025 crypto bull run.

Our Pepe price prediction for 2025 is a maximum price of $0.000035 In 2030, we expect the Pepe price to touch $0.0258. The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty. This causes fluctuations in PEPE prices as they oscillate in search of a solid support level to initiate a recovery. Considering investing in Pepe crypto?

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000984, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000821. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price gained minor selling pressure after buyers failed to gain control. This triggered strong selling pressure toward $0.000011. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000015 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A whale moved 500 billion $PEPE worth $3.85M to Binance after facing a huge $450,000 loss for holding $PEPE for 40 days. PEPE Price Prediction August 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) August 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

XRP is powering ahead as trading volumes surge, proving that market participation is still alive despite global uncertainty. Meanwhile, Solana’s long-awaited ETF applications remain in limbo as the SEC pushes back its decision once again, leaving approval hopes on pause until mid-October. While these setbacks dominate headlines, BlockDAG has carved out a very different narrative. Its presale has already surpassed $380 million, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276 and over 25 billion coins sold. Backed by live showcases of its X1 app and X10 miner, the competitive Buyer Battles program, and 20 confirmed exchange listings, BlockDAG has positioned itself as one of the most anticipated launches of 2025. By blending transparency with consistent delivery, it’s building the kind of excitement that keeps the spotlight firmly on its presale progress. XRP Trading Activity Shows Strong Market Interest Ripple’s XRP is holding firm just above $3.00, a level closely watched after hotter-than-expected U.S. PPI data added pressure on Federal Reserve policy moves. Earlier in the week, XRP touched $3.35 before slipping back as inflation concerns weighed on sentiment. Futures market activity has cooled, with Open Interest falling below $8 billion from a $9 billion peak, well under July’s $10.94 billion high. That pullback highlights fading speculative appetite and less aggressive long positions. Even so, retail metrics remain balanced, with no signs of overheating. Historically, this kind of neutral setup has left room for upside bursts in XRP’s past rallies. From a technical standpoint, failure to hold the $3.00 support could bring $2.90 and $2.72 into focus. With RSI trending lower and MACD flashing a sell signal, bearish pressure may linger short-term, but strong volume keeps optimism alive. Solana Traders Brace for Mid-October Decision The SEC has once again pushed back decisions on multiple Solana ETF applications, prolonging uncertainty for those awaiting clarity. Proposals submitted by Bitwise, 21Shares, and others targeting a Cboe BZX Exchange listing remain under review until at least mid-October. Analysts like James Seyffart suggest that while demand is solid, delays reflect the SEC’s cautious handling of crypto-based products. Driving the postponements are Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s cautious stance, procedural updates, and heightened scrutiny after previous ETF turbulence. For Solana, the news has sparked volatility; its price recently hovered around $196 after slipping from $210 highs, with $72 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. Until October, SOL’s path will likely remain tied to regulatory updates, broader ETF sentiment, and macroeconomic conditions. BlockDAG Presale Momentum Surges With Buyer Battles! While XRP and Solana face mixed fortunes, BlockDAG is charging ahead with milestones that highlight its growing traction. The project has already raised $380 million, pricing coins at $0.0276 in Batch 29, on the path to a confirmed $0.05 launch. Across 25 billion coins sold so far, early buyers from Batch 1 have already secured 2,660% gains compared to Batch 29 pricing. Momentum is being fueled by more than numbers. The live demo of BlockDAG’s X1 mobile app and X10 plug-and-play miner gave the community an early glimpse of real-world functionality. The X1 app makes mining accessible without extra hardware, while the X10 device can generate up to 200 BDAG daily, showcasing scalability for both casual and dedicated users. Excitement is further amplified by Buyer Battles, a gamified presale twist where the day’s top buyer claims all unsold allocations for free. This mechanic keeps engagement buzzing and adds daily suspense. On top of that, 20 confirmed exchange listings, including MEXC, LBank, BitMart, Coinstore, and XT.com, are locked in, guaranteeing immediate liquidity and visibility post-launch. With proven demos, a $380M presale haul, community-driven competitions, and ready listings, BlockDAG isn’t just growing, it’s igniting frenzy across the space. Looking Ahead XRP is showcasing resilience through trading strength, Solana is stuck in regulatory delays, but BlockDAG is making the biggest noise with tangible progress. Its $380 million presale at $0.0276, combined with live miner demos, Buyer Battles, and guaranteed listings on 20 exchanges, has created a momentum-driven story that’s hard to ignore. While established names wrestle with macro and regulatory challenges, BlockDAG is proving that progress comes from delivery and accessibility. This blend of adoption, community engagement, and structural transparency makes it one of 2025’s most exciting breakout projects. For those looking at where the energy in crypto is really building, the answer is clear: XRP and Solana are moving, but BlockDAG is driving the real frenzy.

Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) shared his views on X with a chart suggesting that XRP is on its way to a new all-time high of $5, and he expects the asset to hit this target very quickly. What the Chart Shows The chart shows XRP’s price movements from March, showing two rounding bottom patterns labeled as a double bottom. The first developed from April into July and was followed by a vertical green projection box showing a move of roughly 91.88% from the breakout level. This surge saw XRP hit an all-time high of $3.65 . After this, the asset succumbed to bearish market pressure and entered a corrective phase. This phase began in early August and has formed the second part of this double bottom pattern. Steph suggests that a breakout is imminent. #XRP Double Bottom.. Send us to $5 with haste! pic.twitter.com/iTnyyXrwUF — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 23, 2025 XRP’s Next Target In classical technical analysis, a double bottom suggests reversal when price prints two comparable lows separated by a recovery, then clears the midpoint high with strengthening momentum. Steph’s chart treats July’s breakout as the template and applies the same measured-move logic to the present structure. Applying the 91.88% surge to the current market, Steph expects the asset to hit a target of $5.3543. The repeating pattern and Steph’s sound technical analysis reinforce this bullish expectation, and the chart suggests this rally is just around the corner. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP is currently trading at $3.02, and would need to climb approximately 77% to hit this target. The 91.88% label describes the magnitude of the prior leg and the modeled leg anchored to the new base, suggesting the asset has already begun this climb. Key Takeaways for XRP The chart offers a clear path to a new all-time high for XRP. Confirmation would require a decisive push above the previous high with broad participation from bulls, while failure would involve a loss of the recent lows that define the formation. Other analysts have identified the previous high of $3.65 as a crucial level that the digital asset must overcome before heading for double-digit prices. Steph’s prediction could be the first phase of that journey, with $5 serving as a potential jump-off toward much higher prices.

Powell’s message was deliberately sober. He said the “effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible” and will keep filtering through with uncertain timing. Headline PCE inflation ran 2.6% in July and core 2.9%, with goods prices flipping from last year’s declines to gains. He framed the labor market as a “curious kind of balance,” with payroll growth slowing to about 35,000 a month in recent months from 168,000 in 2024 while unemployment sits at 4.2%. Immigration has cooled, labor force growth has softened and the breakeven pace of hiring needed to keep joblessness steady is lower, which masks fragility. Net-net, he said near-term risks are “tilted to the upside” for inflation and “to the downside” for employment, a mix that argues for care rather than a rapid easing cycle. He also reset the framework. The Fed dropped 2020’s “average inflation targeting,” returned to flexible 2% targeting and clarified that employment can run above estimated maximum levels without automatically forcing hikes, but not at the expense of price stability. He underscored, “We will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.” Policy is “not on a preset course,” and while September is live, the bar for a fast series of cuts looks high unless the data weakens more. That macro stance lands inside a new political backdrop that markets cannot ignore. Powell’s current term ends May 15, 2026, and he has said he intends to serve it out. Donald Trump has attacked Powell and calls for lower rates, but legal protections mean a president cannot remove a Fed governor or chair over policy disagreements. Trump can announce his preferred replacement for Powell well before 2026, giving markets time to price in a chair who is likely to be more dovish and tolerant of growth risk than Powell. That looming shift matters for how the path of rates evolves into 2026, even if the next few FOMC meetings remain data dependent. Political tension surfaced again on Friday when Trump publicly threatened to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud if she did not resign. Like Powell, governors have strong protections and can only be removed for cause. Markets read this less as an immediate governance threat and more as a sign that personnel pressure on the Fed could grow, increasing uncertainty around future leadership and communication. What this means for U.S. Treasurys The speech points to a slower, shallower easing path in the fourth quarter of 2025 unless inflation retreats convincingly. Tariff pass-through keeps goods prices sticky while services ease only gradually, which argues for front-end yields staying firm and the curve steepening only if growth data weakens. A future, less cautious chair could compress term premiums later by signaling a quicker path to neutral, but between now and then rate volatility stays high and rallies are data-led rather than policy-led. What this means for U.S. equities A careful Fed supports the soft-landing narrative but not a quick multiple expansion. Earnings growth can carry benchmarks, yet rate-sensitive growth stocks remain vulnerable to upside surprises in inflation or wages that push cuts further out. If markets begin to price a chair who is more willing to ease into a warm inflation backdrop, cyclicals and small caps could catch a bid, but credibility risk rises if inflation expectations drift. For now, equities trade the gaps between each inflation print, payrolls update and Fed communication. What this means for crypto Crypto lives at the intersection of liquidity and the inflation story. A higher-for-longer stance curbs speculative flows into altcoins and crypto-related equities like miners, exchanges and treasury-heavy firms because funding costs stay elevated and risk budgets tight. At the same time, sustained inflation above target keeps the hard-asset narrative alive and supports demand for assets with scarcity or settlement finality. That combination favors bitcoin and large-cap, cash-flow-supported tokens over long-duration, storytelling-heavy projects until the Fed signals more conviction on cuts. If a successor chair in 2026 is perceived as less cautious, the liquidity cycle could turn more decisively in crypto’s favor, but the price to get there is more volatility as traders handicap leadership, Senate confirmation and the data. Why the path matters more than the first cut Even if the Fed trims rates in September, as it now seems highly likely, Powell’s framing implies a glidepath paced by inflation expectations, not market hope. Housing transmission is muted by mortgage lock-in, so small cuts may not unlock growth quickly. Global easing elsewhere adds a marginal liquidity tailwind, yet the dollar’s path and term premiums will hinge on whether U.S. inflation behaves like a one-time tariff shock or a stickier process. In the former case, crypto breadth can improve and risk can rotate beyond bellwethers; in the latter, leadership stays narrow and rallies fade on hot data. The 2026 wildcard Markets now must price a two-stage regime: Powell’s cautious data-driven stance through 2025, then the possibility of a chair chosen by Trump who is less patient with above-target inflation if growth weakens, or more willing to accept inflation risk to support activity. Appointment constraints and Senate confirmation are real, so a wholesale pivot is not automatic, but the distribution of outcomes broadens. For Treasurys that can mean fatter term premiums until leadership is known; for equities it can mean rotation and factor churn; for crypto it can mean a stronger medium-term liquidity story paired with choppier near-term trading. Bottom line Powell asked for time and data as tariffs lift prices and the jobs engine downshifts. Markets now have to trade that caution through the fourth quarter of 2025 while also discounting the realistic chance of a less cautious Fed chair in 2026. That two-step makes the next year a test of patience in Treasurys, a grind in stocks and a volatility trade in crypto — with the payoff determined by whether inflation proves transitory enough for this Fed to cut, or persistent enough that the next one chooses to.",Markets|Federal Reserve|Inflation|Monetary Policy|Jerome Powell|crypto market|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-24 09:16:44

At first, it may look shocking but experts say it may not be bad news for the market. Just like in earlier cycles, it seems the momentum drivers for Bitcoin may not necessarily be the whales but a different type of investors. As Ethereum adjusts to these changes, new opportunities are being noticed across the crypto space. Projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing growth, as investors begin looking for new coins that could outperform the giants for great returns. The early enthusiasm for this emerging altcoin suggests the changes and developments could herald the next generation of crypto. Ethereum Whales Retreat, Sharks Step In According to on-chain strategist Joao Wedson, there is a decrease in number and supply share in Ethereum whale wallets. Despite the ETH price pump, large players linked to custodians or exchanges seem less active. However, this has allowed for new investors or “sharks” to come in – wallets with 10,000-100,000 ETH that have been accumulating since April, instead of dragging the market down. On the contrary, on-chain data shows that sharks have added approximately 4.4 million ETH in this time. New Opportunities in Focus As Ethereum whale and shark address balances shift, investors are also diversifying into new growth projects. One of the distinct specs MAGACOIN FINANCE has attracted attention from early participants who believe it will capture a lot of eyeballs before listing on major exchanges. Experts believe that an initial bet of $2,500 could have turned into more than $50,000. As demand continues to rise and allocations become increasingly difficult to obtain, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the cycle’s biggest bets worth watching. Why This Trend Benefits Ethereum Unlike whales who sit on inactive holdings, sharks are active traders and play a more important role and impact on prices. Their aggressive accumulation suggests that Ethereum’s growth story is still alive and well. If the current pace continues, however, it may well be the trigger for ETH’s next major upside. For investors, this represents a dual opportunity: Ethereum remains strong at its core, while newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer exposure to potentially outsized returns for those positioning early. Conclusion Ethereum whales abandoning their holdings should not be interpreted as weakness. Instead, transferring such coins to more active investors will help drive the market. Currently, new opportunities, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are becoming one of the main focuses of capital flows as investors look for ways to take advantage of upward movements in the crypto world.

Most altcoins are also sluggish on a daily scale, which is why we will focus on their weekly performances, and OKB stands in a league of its own. BTC Stalls at $115K The business week didn’t go all that well for the primary cryptocurrency as its price started to lose traction from Monday. It first dipped to $115,000, and after an unsuccessful bounce, it quickly resumed its downfall with a nosedive to $113,000 by Wednesday and Thursday. Friday was expected to be an even more volatile trading day and didn’t disappoint. At first, bitcoin dug a new local low, dropping below $112,000 for the first time since early July. However, as Jerome Powell took the stage to address the nation about the Fed’s upcoming monetary policy changes, the cryptocurrency began to recover lost ground rapidly. Within an hour, the asset skyrocketed to over $117,000 as Powell hinted about potential rate cuts coming as soon as September. Nevertheless, BTC’s momentum has cooled off since then, and the asset is just under $115,000 as of press time, which is essentially the same as yesterday. Its market cap has slipped below $2.290 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken another hit and is down to 56.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Going Wild Following Powell’s speech on Friday, many altcoins produced even more impressive gains than BTC. This included ETH, which rocketed to just under $4,900 to set a new all-time high . Although it has retraced slightly since then, it’s still 5% up weekly. SOL has performed even better, gaining nearly 8% since this time last Sunday. XMR, TRX, LINK, and AVAX have jumped by around 3-5%, while AAVE has soared by 14% weekly to $350. OKB has stolen the show as a 60% pump has driven it to almost $200 as of now. In contrast, XRP, DOGE, HYPE, ADA, SUI, and XLM have declined by up to 7.5% in the case of Hyperliquid’s native token. The total crypto market cap has lost over $40 billion since yesterday and is down to $4.060 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

It’s holding steady after a sharp rally from the $4,100 lows earlier this month. This price action has sparked renewed debate among traders and analysts: is Ethereum merely consolidating, or is this the start of a longer climb toward $20,000? Ethereum Technical Picture: Bull Flag and Breakout Potential On the technical analysis side, ETH is building strength, supporting a bullish Ethereum price prediction . Price action has carved out a bullish ABCD harmonic pattern, with the surge to $4,900 confirming strong conviction buying. Since then, ETH has been consolidating just beneath resistance, forming what resembles a bull flag—a continuation structure that often precedes another push higher. Ethereum is consolidating near $4,760 after a strong rally. Chart shows a bull flag under $4,900 resistance. A breakout could target $5,300–$5,700. #ETH #Crypto pic.twitter.com/xCZZVrDRLZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 24, 2025 Momentum remains constructive. The RSI sits at 65, showing strong demand without tipping into extreme overbought territory, while the MACD has flipped firmly bullish, with widening histogram bars pointing to building momentum. Candlesticks reveal higher lows and tightening consolidation, suggesting healthy accumulation rather than exhaustion. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key levels stand out: support at $4,600 and $4,420, resistance at $4,900. A closing of candles just above $4,900 can open further room for buying until $5,300, with odds of extending upward toward $5,700 and even the psychological $6,000 mark in the near term. Ethereum On-Chain Metrics: Funding and Open Interest Align Beyond the chart, Ethereum’s derivatives data reinforces the bullish setup. ETH Funding Rate – Source: Coinglass Funding rates across major exchanges remain positive but not overheated, a sign that long traders are in control, yet without the kind of extreme leverage that often leads to sharp corrections. ETH Open Interest Rate – Source: Coinglass Open interest tells an even clearer story. Total ETH futures OI sits at 14.6M ETH ($69.8B), with Binance holding 20% and CME 15%. This rising open interest, combined with stable funding, signals that fresh capital is entering the market in a balanced way. Funding rates are positive but not overheated — bulls in control without excess leverage. Open interest rising to $69.8B confirms fresh capital. Healthy setup for ETH’s next leg higher. #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/uUcxs3iJLp — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 24, 2025 Unlike July—when overheated leverage triggered long squeezes—the current environment looks healthier, marked by institutional accumulation on CME and steady retail participation on Binance. In simple terms, the “fuel” behind Ethereum’s rally is growing, but without signs of reckless speculation. The Path to $20,000: Accumulation Accelerates for Ethereum Institutional flows, whale accumulation, and ETF demand continue to boost Ethereum’s long-term narrative. Recent on-chain data shows that large holders have increased positions, while U.S.-listed ETH ETFs absorbed over 1.6M ETH in July alone, creating a de facto floor in price. This accumulation trend is the bedrock of the $20,000 forecast many analysts now call achievable within this market cycle. For traders, the setup is simple: an entry above $4,900 with stops under $4,600 aligns with trend continuation, targeting $5,300–$5,700 in the short run. For investors, today’s consolidation may prove to be the base camp for Ethereum’s next advance—one that could carry it to $20,000 and beyond as macro tailwinds, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption converge. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

The dominance of 2025 near multi-month highs has once again confirmed Bitcoin’s place as the leading hedge against inflation and driver of digital adoption. Nevertheless, just holding Bitcoin has seldom been sufficient for maximizing returns. With tactical strategies to boost portfolio gains and manage risk, successful investors mix BTC exposure. Interestingly, along with the continued strength of Bitcoin, as BTC starts to resurface in investor conversations, some view it as a new opportunity outside the traditional BTC trade. Strategy 1: Swing Trading Bitcoin One of the most popular ways to profit from Bitcoin’s volatility is through swing trading, which does not require constant monitoring. An investor makes use of moving averages, RSI and Fibonacci retracement levels to catch medium-term moves that last for days/ weeks. For example, purchasing around the $100k support level and trimming profits in the $105-$110k zone has repeated itself over the months. This may take a measure of discipline, but when complemented by strict stop-loss management, it can easily outperform simply holding. Strategy 2: Hedging with Stablecoins One of the most overlooked strategies in crypto is hedging. Selling a bit of Bitcoin into stablecoins during parabolic rallies can help preserve profits and provide dry powder to re-enter. With Bitcoin’s tendency to pullback aggressively in every cycle, the trend of hedging with stablecoins has proven to be valuable for traders who don’t want to take 100% exposure yet are looking for returns with relatively less risk. This strategy will also allow you to invest in altcoins during market dips, which could be the next in rotation. With the maturing of bitcoin strategies, investors are looking to newer assets with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has made headlines due to the strong traction of its presale which is predicted to reach 20,000% ROI . Thousands of investors have already entered, citing its capped supply, ongoing audits, and branding that is appealing to retail traders. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently in the accumulation phase which means any amount of investment would yield good returns. Unlike Bitcoin, which already has a trillion-dollar market cap. Experts believe this is the type of gem that pairs well with Bitcoin in order to capture explosive gains in the next bull cycle. Strategy 3: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Despite the momentary volatility, DCA remains a major strategy for building more exposure to Bitcoin. When a person invests a fixed amount weekly or monthly, they take advantage of the market swings and avoid wrong entries. Over the years, DCA has beaten most active strategies of retail investors, especially in sideways markets. Investors can secure one of the best and most affordable entry points, which may guarantee reliability and longevity in line with DCA, while also gaining high upside potential in the near future with early entries into select altcoins, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Strategy 4: Using Bitcoin for Liquidity Rotation Throughout history, when Bitcoin gains dominance and breaks through major resistance zones, liquidity generally ends up flowing into altcoins. This happened in 2017 and 2021 and is starting to happen in 2025. Smart investors are taking note of these inflection points to shift some of their Bitcoin profits into other altcoins. In the past, there have been rotations that made XRP, Solana and Polkadot rise. But now, most of the eyes are on newer narratives, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one. Conclusion Traders are using layered strategies to achieve better returns, while Bitcoin remains the anchor of the market. There is more than one way to increase the portfolio gains besides just holding, such as swing trading, DCA, stablecoin hedging, and liquidity rotation. The emergence of presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE simultaneously serves as a reminder for investors to position themselves early in emerging assets, offering them asymmetric upside in addition to their Bitcoin exposure. All these approaches together make for balanced thinking going into the key phases of the 2025 cycle.

50591007,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79704,1756029644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Cardano (ADA) Aims for $1, But Analysts Rank Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Higher for 2025 Returns",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-aims-for-1-but-analysts-rank-mutuum-finance/,"Cardano (ADA) has remained one of the most talked-about altcoins in the cryptocurrency space, backed by a dedicated community and a vision for long-term development. Its steady climb in the last bull run rewarded early investors, but recent years have shown a slowdown in momentum. While ADA eyes a return to the $1 mark, analysts are increasingly pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the token better positioned for strong returns heading into 2025. Cardano’s Rise and Where It Stands Today Currently trading near $0.85, Cardano sits comfortably among the top altcoins by market capitalization. Its blockchain is recognized for its focus on scalability, sustainability, and academic-driven development. During the peak of the 2021 bull run, ADA surged from under $0.10 to an all-time high of around $3, creating life-changing wealth for early adopters who invested when the project was still under the radar. However, since then, Cardano’s growth has slowed. The network continues to build, but price performance has been less dramatic, leaving many investors with more modest returns. While ADA remains a respected player in the space, traders searching for higher gains are beginning to diversify into tokens that combine both early-entry potential and strong use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention as it is currently priced at $0.035 in presale, set to launch at $0.06 and operates as a non-custodial liquidity protocol. Users can act as lenders by depositing assets into liquidity pools to earn yield, or as borrowers by securing overcollateralized loans. The platform issues mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio to deposits, which increase in redemption value over time as interest accrues. When redeemed, mtTokens return the original asset plus earned interest, giving investors sustainable returns linked directly to platform activity. With its beta version scheduled to launch alongside the token, early investors will have immediate access to Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing features. ADA vs. MUTM: Where Investors See Bigger Gains While Cardano is aiming to break back above $1, the growth rate is relatively moderate compared to what analysts project for MUTM. For investors seeking outsized returns, the difference between holding a top-ten altcoin and getting in early on a presale project is substantial. Take this investment example: An allocation of $900 at the presale price of $0.035 secures around 25,700 MUTM tokens. At the confirmed launch price of $0.06, that investment is already worth about $1,600. Once MUTM reaches $0.80 in line with 25x growth predictions, the same holding would be valued at over $20,500. By contrast, if ADA climbs from its current $0.83 to $1.5, investors would see a less than 2x return. While ADA remains a stable long-term project, Mutuum Finance is capturing attention for its potential to deliver significantly higher gains over a shorter timeframe. Why Analysts Favor MUTM for 2025 The growing interest in MUTM which raised 14.75 million and more than 15,550 holders comes from more than just its presale pricing. Analysts highlight its buy-and-distribute model, where platform profits are used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This mechanism ensures ongoing demand for the token while directly rewarding committed participants. Combined with its clear roadmap, real utility at launch, and whale accumulation, these factors make MUTM stand out as a project with strong upward potential. A New Contender in the Race for Returns Cardano’s run to $3 in 2021 proved it could deliver explosive returns, and it still remains a solid blockchain project aiming for renewed growth. But as ADA targets $1 again, investors are increasingly looking for tokens that offer both utility and massive upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its presale entry of $0.035, launch price of $0.06, and projected 25x trajectory, is shaping up to be a serious contender for the best crypto to buy now. For those seeking high returns in 2025, analysts believe MUTM holds the stronger case.

He pointed to a structure on the daily chart, showing that the currently unfolding pattern is setting up a strong continuation if momentum returns, and it could send the asset to more than twice its current price. New Targets for XRP In his post, the analyst stated that “XRP will take us to $7-8 in the next few weeks,” pairing the claim with a one-day chart from Bitstamp. The screenshot shows the price near $3.01 with a small daily decline and highlights a maturing consolidation . His message keeps the timeframe tight and the target specific, implying a potential breakout window in the near term. The chart also highlights the 200-day moving average, which sits below the price. A rounding bottom pattern spans months, beginning in early January and curving upward into August, culminating after XRP’s rise to a new all-time high of $3.65 in July . To the right of the chart, converging trendlines form a symmetrical triangle around the $3 area. The pattern follows a sharp advance, which traders treat as a bullish continuation when subsequent volume expands after a period of compression near the apex. #XRP will take us to $7-8 in the next few weeks! pic.twitter.com/HSK6fHIXkr — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 23, 2025 How Can XRP Reach These Targets? The $7 to $8 zone is more than twice XRP’s current price of $3.02, and it fits a measured-move logic. The depth of the rounded base and the height of the preceding rally can translate, on breakout, into a target roughly double or more from the triangle’s apex. Positioning above the rising 200-day average supports that view because long-term trend indicators typically strengthen bullish setups when the asset’s price holds above them. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The triangle’s lower boundary and the 200-day average act as nearby risk markers. A daily close below that trendline would weaken the continuation case and shift focus back. Conversely, a clean break above the triangle’s upper boundary , especially on rising turnover, would confirm the prediction and place the prior high as the first checkpoint before any run toward the $7 to $8 band. CryptoBull presents a bold, time-bound call backed by visible patterns and a very bullish setup. Traders following the view will watch for a breakout signal, volume confirmation, and strict risk control as XRP compresses near $3.

50591437,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791081,1756029824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50591437.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: Can Increased RLUSD Adoption Mean Boom for XRP Holders? Analysts Say Layer Brett Can Boom More,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-increased-rlusd-adoption-mean-boom-for-xrp-holders-analysts-say-layer-brett-can-boom-more/,"Brett was stuck on Base, but now he’s breaking chains on Layer 2—bringing memes, speed, and massive rewards to Ethereum. With the Layer Brett (LBRETT) presale live at just $0.0047, early backers are buzzing. The big question for crypto fans: Will increased RLUSD adoption send XRP soaring, or will next-gen projects like Layer Brett offer even more explosive gains? Analysts suggest that while XRP price predictions remain bullish, Layer Brett could outpace classic memecoin competitors in the coming crypto bull run. Why Layer 2 gives Layer Brett the edge While Ripple (XRP) has recently hit an all-time high of $3.67 and consistently ranks among the top altcoins, its network still faces challenges with congestion and transaction fees. By comparison, Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 tech to deliver lightning-fast, near-instant transactions and ultra-low fees—far outpacing legacy chains. Layer Brett users can buy and stake LBRETT in seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB, and staking rewards are amplified due to reduced operational costs. Unlike Shiba Inu, Pepe, or Bonk, which remain confined to their original chains and struggle to offer meaningful utility, Layer Brett is purpose-built for high-speed scaling and community rewards. The project offers: Presale access at $0.0047 for early buyers Staking APYs exceeding 2,480% (and up to 55,000%+ for the earliest stakers) No KYC and full self-custody for users $1 million giveaway and ongoing community campaigns XRP price prediction vs. Layer Brett’s growth potential The Ripple (XRP) price prediction remains a hot topic after its surge to $3.67. Yet, recent volatility—down nearly 20% in a month despite a yearly gain of 405%—has some investors seeking fresh opportunities. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are also experiencing mixed momentum, with Shiba Inu celebrating 1 million holders and Bonk struggling to recover from its previous all-time high. In contrast, Layer Brett is still in its presale phase, offering early supporters a rare entry point before exchange listings. Its unique blend of memecoin energy and real blockchain utility positions it ahead of Brett (original) and Pepe, both of which have seen price stagnation and lack major ecosystem upgrades. The transparent tokenomics—10 billion max supply, 30% for presale, and 25% for staking rewards—ensure sustainable growth and ongoing rewards for the community. What makes Layer Brett (LBRETT) different? Unlike Brett (original), which remains a basic meme token on Base without real utility, Layer Brett combines viral culture with advanced Layer 2 scaling solutions. While Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Bonk enjoy strong community support, they lack the technical innovation and community-first roadmap that defines Layer Brett. The project’s roadmap culminates in a DAO, empowering holders to shape the future of the ecosystem. Layer Brett’s interoperability plans, NFT integrations, and gamified staking further differentiate it from Dogecoin and others, making it a top contender for the next 100x altcoin in the 2025 crypto bull run. Analysts argue that Layer Brett’s smaller market cap relative to XRP and Shiba Inu leaves far greater room for exponential growth. Why crypto investors are flocking to Layer Brett With the crypto presale still live, Layer Brett offers a rare chance to buy early and stake for APYs in the tens of thousands. Its blend of Ethereum Layer 2 speed, meme power, and real utility sets it apart from Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, Dogecoin, and Brett (original). Don’t miss out—Layer Brett is poised to lead the next wave of top meme coins and DeFi innovation. Stake your claim before the presale ends and ride the next big crypto wave.

Collins emphasized that while labor market growth has slowed, economic fundamentals remain solid, adding, “This is a complex picture. We need to balance both the potential rise in unemployment and the risks of inflation.” Collins stated that monetary policy is currently “moderately restrictive,” which is appropriate given current conditions. However, he argued that data releases in the next four weeks will be critical. “We'll see more data before we make a decision,” he added. “Nothing is certain right now; all options are on the table.” Related News: What to Expect for Ethereum (ETH) Price After the Record? Analyst Predicts Target for ETH and When the Bear Market Will Begin The Boston Fed President stated that they are closely monitoring the inflationary pressures of tariffs. Collins said, “Tariffs have a broad impact on intermediate goods, not just direct imports. Therefore, we expect inflation to remain elevated until the end of the year. My baseline scenario is for it to decline next year, but I don't rule out the possibility of a more persistent impact.” Regarding the labor market, Collins noted that employment growth has slowed, but some indicators remain strong. “If the risk of layoffs increases, it may be appropriate to reduce the restrictive nature of policy,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Investors are turning their focus toward mid-cap cryptocurrencies, eyeing opportunities for substantial gains. This article highlights which digital assets are poised for significant growth following Ethereum's movements, offering insights into the best investment options. Ethereum’s Bullish Pulse Amid Key Support and Resistance Ethereum has seen strong growth with a 28.18% increase over the last month and a remarkable 73.68% rise over the past six months. The coin moved steadily over the last week with a 5.57% gain, reflecting consistent upward pressure in trading sessions. Price action over these time frames shows a clear momentum buildup, indicating that the market has been open to buying pressure and traders remain optimistic. This solid performance in both the short and medium term has attracted renewed interest as traders recognize Ethereum’s potential in a rising market. The current price is trading between roughly $2,736 and $4,301, presenting defined levels that frame its near-term movements. Immediate support sits at about $1,774 while the nearest resistance is near $4,903, with a further cap at around $6,469 signaling additional profit-taking zones. While the RSI near 66 highlights a mildly overbought condition, the Awesome Oscillator at 335.56 and a Momentum Indicator of 213.47 still show dominant bullish energy. The market is oscillating between these clear technical boundaries. Traders might consider buying near support levels and watching for a breakout through resistance for longer positions. SOL Price Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Boundaries SOL has experienced varied performance recently. Over the past month, the coin witnessed a pullback with prices falling by around 4.23%. In contrast, the trend over the last six months has been positive, with an increase of nearly 14.48% that shows a gradual recovery. A mild weekly gain of about 2.32% signals some short‐term strength amid the overall adjustment. The shifts in the price pattern from a pullback to a longer-term uptrend hint at the natural ebb and flow observed in this market. Currently, the market places SOL within an actual price range of roughly $142.77 to $204.08. The nearest support level sits at about $113.23, while the nearest resistance level is found at $235.85. Price behavior suggests that bulls hold a cautious position without commanding full control. The market lacks a strong directional push and appears to be testing these key levels, prompting traders to consider entry points and tighten their exit strategies. Buyers might look to capitalize on moves near support, while sellers could seek profit from rallies toward resistance. Cardano ADA: Stable Growth and Key Levels in a Bullish Environment ADA experienced a modest monthly increase of 2.77% with a more pronounced six-month rise of 20.03%. Price movements have stayed within a defined range, reflecting cautious investor interest while laying the foundation for more significant gains. The steady climb over the past half-year points to a growing confidence among buyers and a market that has slowly overcome earlier sluggish periods. Low volatility in the last month suggests that traders maintained a balanced approach, keeping ADA within its established price corridors as accumulation gradually took hold. The current price situation sees ADA trading between $0.54 and $0.94, with nearby resistance at $1.14 and key support firmly positioned at $0.34. Bulls appear to be gaining control as indicators such as the Relative Strength Index at 59.94 and modest momentum readings hint at underlying strength. The setup presents an opportunity for traders to test the upper resistance level while keeping a keen eye on support. A break above $1.14 could pave the way to approach the second resistance near $1.54. In contrast, failure to hold the current range might push prices down closer to key support. The overall market sentiment remains cautiously bullish, suggesting that controlled trades within these levels may offer favorable entry points for those anticipating the altcoin season ahead. Sui Price Movements and Key Levels in Focus SUI price performance over the past month shows a nearly 7% decline, while the six-month period records a gain of 9.10%. The price action experienced downward pressure followed by a gradual recovery, indicating a mixed sentiment among market participants. Traders faced volatility recently, marked by short-term losses but a longer-term positive trend. The market has been testing its limits, reflecting both caution and resilience in trading behavior. Current trading levels have Sui priced between $2.70 and $4.49. Immediate support is at $1.78, with nearby resistance at $5.36 and a second resistance at $7.16. The lack of a defined second support level adds uncertainty. Indicator readings show an Awesome Oscillator at -0.21 and a momentum indicator at -0.15, indicating limited bullish strength. Bulls and bears are balanced, resulting in a sideways trend. Trading between these levels may involve buys near support or preparing for a breakout above resistance, with preset stop-loss orders advised to manage risk. Conclusion When ETH rises, attention shifts to promising mid-cap cryptos. SOL and ADA show strong potential for significant growth. SUI also emerges as an intriguing option worth considering. These coins present opportunities for those looking to diversify beyond ETH. Key players among cryptos are expected to benefit from the momentum created by ETH's upward movement.

Unseen patterns hint at potential growth, making these coins worth watching. This article dives into the hidden signals that suggest a bullish trend. Discover which cryptocurrencies are poised for a breakout. Avalanche (AVAX): Price Dynamics, Key Levels, and Market Balance AVAX experienced a modest pullback over the past month with a decline near 3.31% and a similar drop of about 3.18% over the last six months, while the recent one-week gain of 5.81% hinted at a short-term rebound. Price fluctuations have remained contained within a defined range, reflecting a mix of cautious sentiment and periodic recovery. At present, the price of Avalanche trades within a range of approximately $17 at the low end to about $27 at the high end, providing traders with a platform to gauge activity based on significant key levels. Immediate resistance is observed near $32, with further barriers forming around $43. On the downside, support is noted around $12, with a secondary support near $1.50. Oscillator readings show a slightly negative signal, while the relative strength index holds at 56. In this market environment, the fight between bulls and bears remains evenly poised, and traders may consider entering long positions if the price bounces off the $12 support or opt for short trades if a breakdown occurs below $17. Starknet Price Analysis: Past Trends, Current Levels, and Trading Ideas Over the past month, Starknet experienced a modest decline of 5.72% alongside a notable weekly gain of 6.46%, hinting at short-term volatility. Over the six-month period, Starknet saw a steeper drop of 40.17%, demonstrating a significant downward trend that contrasts with the recent weekly upswing. The price action reflects a period of fluctuation as market forces have pulled the coin between lower support and the beginning of an upward push, with the broader trend over half a year appearing bearish despite an occasional bounce in the shorter timeframe. Currently, the coin trades within a range of $0.097 to $0.146, with a first resistance at $0.177 and a second at $0.226. The nearest support lies at $0.078 with another deeper support at $0.029, creating clear zones for potential trading plays. Trend indicators show an RSI level at 54.4 and slight momentum of 0.0004, suggesting neither bulls nor bears hold complete control. Traders might look to buy near support and consider short-term selling if the price nears resistance levels, while staying alert to shifts in volume or sentiment that could trigger a breakout. Conclusion AVAX and STRK are poised for a potential rally due to recent technical advancements. Emerging fractal patterns suggest strong upward momentum. Both AVAX and STRK show promising signals indicating possible significant growth. Investors might find these coins positioned well for future gains.

50593299,564153,1756033080,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50593299.jpeg,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Ethereum to $20,000 This Cycle, Fueling the Best Altcoins of 2025",https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-gain-as-arthur-hayes-predicts-20000-ethereum/,"Arthur Hayes believes that Ethereum will push to $10,000 or even $20,000 this cycle, fueled by Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies. Hayes’ prediction came during an interview with Crypto Banter where he said that Ethereum breaking through its previous ATH could push it to $20,000 before the end of the cycle. Once it’s broken through, you have a massive gap of air to the upside. — Arthur Hayes, Crypto Banter interview As Hayes explained, two major factors will fuel Ethereum’s next bull cycle: Trump’s pro-crypto legislation and the increase in institutional adoption. The first signs of a bull move should become obvious this fall, as the GENIUS Act takes effect, which could push the best altcoins in frenzy mode. Ethereum’s Marathon Fueled By Institutional Adoption Craze and Favorable Legislation Trump’s GENIUS Act is the main catalyst behind Ethereum’s 2025 ATH of $4,880 reached yesterday, which may signal the beginning of the alt season. The GENIUS Act seeks to bring clarity, security, and transparency into the cryptosphere by forcing stablecoin issuers to back their tokens with liquid assets like dollars and governmental bonds. The Act also protects crypto enthusiasts against illicit activities and scams. This is what drove the Department of Treasury to issue a Request for Comment on August 18, asking for the public’s opinion on how to tackle illicit activity in the crypto sphere. This endeavor is part of the implementation process of the GENIUS Act and the comment section will remain open until October 17. Institutional adoption is another strong case for Ethereum’s next bull cycle, given the accelerated rate at which public companies buy $ETH. According to CoinGecko , almost 2.8M $ETH are already in public treasuries, making up for 2.31% of the total Ethereum supply. BitMine is the primary investor, with over 1.5M Ethereum, worth over $7.2B. These factors potentially lay the foundation for a $20,000 Ethereum this cycle, which would kickstart the next alt season. If that happens, the best altcoins of 2025 might see massive gains. Here are three that you should keep on your radar. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Promising Faster and Cheaper Transactions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 upgrade that promises to change Bitcoin’s network performance. Hyper’s Canonical Bridge is the link between Layer 2 and Bitcoin’s Layer 1 and is responsible for minting the users’ Bitcoins into the Hyper layer. The Bitcoins are then accessible for use on Layer 2 or can be withdrawn back to Layer 1 whenever necessary. The Canonical Bridge’s role is to decongest Bitcoin’s native network, circumvent the 7-TPS native cap, and deliver near-instant finality. Together with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which enables the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts, the Canonical Bridge brings Bitcoin’s performance to modern standards, with high throughput and Solana-level scalability. If you want to invest in the $HYPER presale, now’s the perfect time. The presale has raised almost $11.8M so far and it promises to push $HYPER into wealth-building territory. Based on the project’s utility, our analysts’s price prediction for $HYPER considers a price point of $1.50 by 2030 which translates to a growth of 11,623% based on today’s price of $0.012795. Check how to buy $HYPER right now and buy your tokens while Bitcoin Hyper is still in the presale phase. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – The Telegram Bot That Turns Coin Hunting Profitable Snorter Token ($SNORT) fuels the Snorter Bot, the ravenous Aardvark whose sole mission is to detect and snipe hot tokens on the blockchain. The Bot finally turns coin hunting profitable thanks to its accuracy and timing, being able to snipe the target tokens in milliseconds after liquidity becomes available. This makes Snorter Bot more effective and reliable even than standard pro UIs like Raydium and Jupiter. You also no longer need to juggle multiple wallets and browser extensions, because Snorter Bot does it all from its Telegram chat. And no more watching over your shoulder for scams like honeypots or rug pulls, as the Aardvark’s native scam detectors highlight any suspicious project. Snorter Token is the $3.3M presale that’s pushing $SNORT into mainstream adoption. Given Snorter Token’s utility, our analysts price prediction for $SNORT is $0.94 by the end of 2025. This is an 818% return rate based on the token’s current presale price of $0.1023. If you want to invest, read our ‘ How to buy $SNORT ’ guide and secure your place at the table before the project goes public. 3. Altura ($ALU) – The Perfect Toolset for Game Devs Altura ($ALU) is one of the most comprehensive toolsets for game developers, offering a multitude of end-to-end solutions designed to streamline the development process. Aside from tools like Java, Typescript, and Unity SDK, Altura also offers Altura API, which allows you to ‘manage all user, item, token, and collection data, including the developer wallet, and even Smart NFTs’. The platform also offers you the opportunity to launch your own marketplace on any chain in minutes via Altura’s native dashboard. $ALU went public in 2021 and went through two peaks so far, with the first one pumping the token by up to 4,839%. $ALU is now trading at $0.06669 and it’s pumping again, currently up 87% over the last 24 hours and a 24-hour trading volume 160% into the green. Given the 93% positive community sentiment, this may be your buy signal. Go to your favorite exchange and buy your $ALU while it’s hot. However, don’t forget to visit the official website first to learn more about the project before investing. Will Ethereum Reach $20,000? Based on the current legislative support and the growing institutional interest, it’s not impossible that Ethereum could reach $20,000 by the end of the cycle? Will it? Nobody can tell for sure. What we can tell for sure is that the next alt season is upon us, at which point we’ll see Ethereum enter a sustained bull phase, once it pushes through its past ATH. When that happens, projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) will see a massive influx of investors as well. Don’t take this as financial advice.

Christopher Flinos was banned in the Cayman Islands and Abu Dhabi after his crypto company Hayvn collapsed amid fraud allegations back in Melbourne. According to reports, Christopher Flinos ran the company, which paraded itself as a regulated and compliant payment solution for the authorization, clearing, and settlement of cryptocurrency payments. The company also earned a license to operate in the Cayman Islands. However, his company’s license was canceled by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) in June, banning Flinos from being a company director in the country. Australian businessman accused of misleading investors Reports claim that before the ban in the Cayman Islands, regulators in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates capital, had made allegations of fraud against him, alleging that his company, Hayvn, failed to follow anti-money laundering rules . Flinos acted as the chief executive officer of the company, with an official notice issued by the Abu Dhabi Global Market Registration Authority on March 30 showing that he owned a third of the business. According to the Hayvn website, Flinos was CEO of the company from 2019 and had worked as an investment banker before that. In 2014, he assisted in setting up CH Stirling, a boutique investment bank in Dubai, which, according to Bloomberg, had a full-sized table in its reception. In addition, he also worked at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Merrill Lynch. Hayvn said it agreed with local firm, Venue Smart, which allowed the company to expand its presence into Australia. The business provided payment terminals to pubs, clubs, and other businesses in the hospitality industry. This way, thousands of merchants could offer their clients seamless crypto payment solutions, according to a press release issued by Flinos at the time. In another interview in 2023, Flinos also drummed up the safety of Hayvn following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX . “People are now worried about where their coins are kept, and the ability to provide custody services to our clients within a regulated environment is becoming more and more important,” he said. He added that Hayvn will focus primarily on business clients, and this will enable it to fly a little under the radar. “We’ve quietly gone about building probably the Middle East’s biggest business when it comes to virtual assets, but we stay well out of a lot of the press,” he added. Cayman Islands and Abu Dhabi authorities sanction Flinos In a 39-page notice issued in March, the Abu Dhabi authority said Flinos misled it and banks about another company he held called AC Holding, which gained a license to act as a passive investment company. Authorities noted that instead of acting as what it was licensed for, the Australian used the company as a payment process for Hayvn and its crypto users. The agency said Flinos engaged in fraud by “facilitating the falsification of hundreds of company documents”, including bank account applications, invoices, and AC Holding’s company accounts. In another notice released in April, the authority mentioned that one of the Hayvn companies failed to comply with AML rules because it lacked evidence of carrying out risk assessments on six customers. When the company eventually did due diligence, the authority said it failed to assess what businesses the clients were into and where their money came from. It also added that it failed to identify one of its clients as a “politically exposed person”. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Meme coins are once again at the center of the market as crypto momentum builds, but not every project can deliver the kind of life changing returns investors are chasing. Three names are fighting for attention: Pepe , Little Pepe, and Pepeto . They may share the same cultural roots, but only one has the right mix of community strength, real tools, and strong fundamentals to take the spotlight this cycle. The question now is simple: which frog will be the one to explode in value and redefine portfolios in 2025? Pepe: Yesterday’s Story Without Progress Pepe had its moment in 2023, rewarding early buyers with huge gains. But that moment is gone. Today Pepe stands as an old token, already too large in market cap to repeat another 100x. More importantly, it offers nothing new. There is no platform, no ecosystem, no tools, only the meme that carried it in the past. Investors who study it closely can see the growth potential has already been drained. Pepe will remain a known name, but popularity does not equal profit. Without fresh innovation or value, it cannot lead the next bull run, and those expecting it to rise again may be left behind. Little Pepe: Presale Hype Without Real Backing Little Pepe is still running its presale, but the model is clear. The setup rewards quick flips, creating the illusion of growth as each round pushes prices higher. Beyond this, there is nothing solid, no utilities, no platform, no roadmap that can hold demand after the hype fades. For serious investors, this is a warning sign. Once the presale is over and the selling pressure begins, there is nothing in place to support long term value. With no unique idea besides copying the frog trend, Little Pepe risks being just another temporary play. When the dust clears, capital will move toward projects that bring real utility and staying power. Pepeto: The Frog With Real Strength and Explosive Potential This is where the opportunity becomes clear. Pepeto is not built on hype alone. It is designed on Ethereum and comes with real products that traders can use now. PepetoSwap is a zero fee exchange where trades happen instantly without extra costs. PepetoBridge connects chains safely, removing the need for risky third parties. Beyond that, Pepeto is building an entire exchange hub where hundreds of meme coins will be listed and traded using the Pepeto token itself. This creates continuous demand and sets Pepeto apart from all other frog coins. Staking gives holders another powerful incentive, with returns up to 240% APY and more than 42 trillion tokens already locked. This shows that the community believes in long term value. On top of that, Pepeto’s contracts have been audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, giving investors security and peace of mind. The tokenomics are clear and fair: no trading tax, no team wallets, and a model built to protect holders while driving growth. For investors looking for the next life changing opportunity, Pepeto delivers a complete package of culture, tools, and trust. Presale Momentum and Early Investor Excitement Pepeto’s presale is priced at $0.000000148 and has already raised over $6 million before even touching a major exchange. This level of participation proves real demand while still early. Compare that to Pepe, which has already peaked, and Little Pepe, which depends only on presale mechanics. Pepeto is showing genuine strength. As stages advance, supply becomes smaller, while demand grows bigger, giving early investors one of the best chances in the market right now. Why Pepeto Leaves Pepe and Little Pepe Behind The key difference is in the fundamentals. Pepe is overvalued and offers nothing new. Little Pepe relies only on hype and cannot sustain growth beyond its presale. Pepeto is still at the beginning, cheap, and backed by real infrastructure that drives ongoing demand. Investors who study the market know that real tools and transparent tokenomics are what separate projects that last from those that collapse. Pepeto is the only frog coin that offers both today. Conclusion: The Smart Bet for 2025 Pepe is a fading name. Little Pepe is a short term flip. Pepeto is the project with real utility, audited contracts, fair tokenomics, and a rapidly growing community. With staking at 240% APY, a presale price of only $0.000000148, and working products like PepetoSwap and PepetoBridge already building its ecosystem, Pepeto has all the pieces needed to lead the bull run ahead. For investors who missed out on Shiba Inu’s early days, Pepeto represents a second chance. In the race of the frog coins, Pepe has no future and Little Pepe has no foundation. Pepeto is the only one with the tools, the hype, and the fundamentals to turn small entries into life changing gains. That makes it not just another memecoin, but the smartest crypto to buy on the 2025 bull run. Disclaimer: To buy PEPETO, use only the official website: https://pepeto.io .

Chart patterns hint at exciting potential for these digital currencies. Recent fractal setups suggest upcoming breakout opportunities. This article delves into the technical signals that are catching the crypto community's attention and explores the possible next steps for these intriguing assets. Shiba Inu: Range Trading Potential Amid Mixed Short and Long-Term Trends Price performance over the past month and six months showed an overall dip despite a modest one-week uptick. SHIB recorded a one-month loss of around 14% and a six-month drop close to 15%, indicating downward pressure on its value. A minor rebound over the last week, with a gain of approximately 3%, hints at short-term optimism, though the longer-term picture remains subdued. During these periods, prices have mostly lingered near the lower end of their range. Technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and momentum readings have turned negative, implying that sustained upward movements have yet to take shape. Current price activity finds Shiba Inu oscillating between a support level of about $0.00001 and a resistance level of $0.00002. The coin trades in a narrow band, where bulls have managed a brief lift evident from the weekly gain, yet bears appear to dominate given the recent month’s decline. No clear trend emerges as price action remains confined within set boundaries. Traders may consider range-bound strategies by seeking buying opportunities near support and potential exits at resistance. The relative strength index hovers slightly above 50, signaling balanced sentiment, while moving averages lean towards a mild bullish outlook. Caution is advised, with positions adjusted based on short-term fluctuations and additional indicators for confirmation. Algorand Market Review: Past Behavior and Current Trading Levels Over the last month, Algorand fluctuated within a lower price range, experiencing a 5.10% gain during one week while the monthly change decreased by 10.13%. The past six months showed a nearly stable price with a minor shift of -0.08%, indicating low volatility coupled with brief moments of upward and downward movement. Price action during this time illustrated modest increases countered by short declines. The market has displayed range-bound behavior, highlighting cautious adjustments instead of significant changes. This performance suggests a coin that has navigated minor fluctuations without establishing pronounced trends, characterized by temporary recoveries and declines. Current price remains steady within a defined range, crucial for traders to consider. The coin trades between $0.16 and $0.33, facing resistance at $0.42 and another barrier at $0.58, while the nearest support is observed at $0.08. The Relative Strength Index at 53.63 indicates a balanced market, lacking strong favor for either bulls or bears. The Awesome Oscillator is at -0.009, and the momentum indicator reads -0.005, hinting at slight downward pressure. Recommendation indicators vary with the summary at $0.42 and oscillators at -0.09. Short-term buying during dips near support is advisable, with profit-taking near $0.42 or $0.58. Breaking above resistance or dropping below support could indicate a shift in market trends. Conclusion Both SHIB and ALGO show potential for significant growth. Fractal setups indicate strong upcoming movements for both coins. Technical patterns suggest promising trends.

Recent harmonic patterns reveal a promising outlook for these digital assets. Curious to find out which coins could be on the brink of a surge? This article delves into the bullish momentum building around these intriguing tokens. XRP Price Analysis: Past Trends and Current Market Dynamics XRP dropped around 13% in the past month while showing a recovery of nearly 20% over the last six months. Price swings have been evident as the coin faced a significant short-term pullback before gaining ground in the longer term. Movements during the last month hint at volatility, whereas the half-year performance indicates a gradual recovery after recent losses. The price action highlights fluctuations typical of altcoins on the brink of a broader market shift. XRP currently trades between a price range of $2.23 and $3.74. The nearest resistance is around $4.46 with further barriers near $5.97, while support is found near $1.43. Market signals show an RSI at 51.387 along with slight negative readings on the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator, indicating no clear dominance by bulls or bears. Price movement within these levels suggests buyers may step in near support, while approaching resistance could lead to upward trends. Trading in this range may offer opportunities but requires close monitoring of momentum shifts and key levels to inform decisions. Chainlink Price Rally Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Chainlink showed a solid upward move in recent weeks with a weekly increase of about 20.6%. Over the past month, gains reached nearly 38%, and over the last six months the coin climbed roughly 53%, highlighting growing market interest. Price actions over these periods indicate a steady recovery that has boosted investor confidence and reinforced Chainlink’s position among altcoins. Recent price behavior reflects notable rallies and consolidation phases, driven by persistent buying activity and renewed optimism in the market. Chainlink currently trades in a defined range with an actual price band from $13 to $20.56. The nearest resistance sits at $24.18, while the nearest support is around $9.12. Strong momentum is underscored by a weekly growth of 20.58%, and a relatively high RSI of 66.12 indicates that buyers are active, although the coin is nearing overbought conditions. Trading ideas in this range include waiting for a move above $24.18 to target $31.71, or buying on dips toward $9.12. The market shows no clear trend, allowing traders to exploit breakout moves and retracements. Conclusion XRP and LINK are showing strong signs of bullish momentum. Harmonic patterns suggest positive price movement for both. The market seems to support further growth. Investors may find these coins appealing. Both have unique strengths, enhancing their growth potential. This phase might be an opportunity for traders. The patterns indicate a likely upward trend.

In his remarks, Rietveld discussed a new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. He explained that under the deal, the United States will impose 50 percent tariffs on automobiles, which marks a substantial increase from the previous 25 percent rate. Alongside the higher tariffs, the agreement includes a $750 billion investment deal directed toward the United States. Rietveld described the development as a major victory for the United States, though he acknowledged that its implications may vary depending on perspective. U.S. Tariffs and #XRP ! pic.twitter.com/qgHSmUkTdJ — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 23, 2025 Tariffs and Investment Balance In his video commentary, Rietveld highlighted the long-term impact of raising tariffs on European automobiles. He noted that while the United States is doubling tariffs from 25 percent to 50 percent, this may eventually result in reduced revenue inflows compared to the previous arrangement. However, he emphasized that the $750 billion investment commitment serves as an important counterbalance. This upfront financial injection is designed to offset potential declines in tariff revenues and strengthen U.S. economic positioning . Rietveld pointed out that this structure effectively shifts the balance of immediate benefit toward the United States. Economic Pressure on the European Union Rietveld further explained that the new terms alter the distribution of financial responsibility within Europe. Instead of placing the full weight of adjustment on automobile manufacturers and auto builders, the pressure is now also directed toward the European Union government. According to his analysis, this change forces EU policymakers to mobilize additional resources, sharing the burden with private industry. He described this outcome as a redistribution of economic strain, with both governments and businesses in Europe needing to respond to the revised trade environment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While Rietveld primarily outlined the economic details of the agreement, his framing suggested that the development carries broader implications for global trade relations and capital flows. By securing a large-scale investment package alongside higher tariffs, the United States has strengthened its negotiating position while compelling European stakeholders to adapt to new financial pressures. His reference to XRP in the tweet caption also suggests that he sees a potential connection between macroeconomic trade policies and developments within digital asset markets, though his video remarks focused on the trade agreement itself.

This comes at a critical October window when the SEC is expected to decide on multiple applications for the product. To this end, the regulator is reviewing filings from several leading issuers, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares. Deadlines for these applications fall between October 18 and October 25, 2025, making the week a decisive moment for XRP’s market trajectory. In the meantime, XRP continues to trade in line with the broader cryptocurrency market , with the $3 level acting as a key support zone. At press time, the asset was valued at $3.02, down about 0.5% in the last 24 hours, and more than 3% lower on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price prediction Regarding the price impact of an ETF decision, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT-5 , which stressed that approval could propel the cryptocurrency into a significant rally by year-end. ChatGPT-5’s outlook places XRP in a $7 to $10 range by December 2025 if at least one fund is approved. A more aggressive inflow scenario, fueled by institutional demand and a broader altcoin rally, could push the price higher, with a potential peak between $12 and $15 before year-end. However, the model also highlighted the risk of a post-ETF “sell the news” effect, similar to what followed other landmark crypto product launches. Under that scenario, XRP could briefly spike above $10 in November before retracing to around $6 and $8 by December. If the ETF is delayed or rejected, XRP’s trajectory would likely remain muted, tracking the broader crypto market with year-end prices closer to $4.50 and $5. XRP end-of-year price prediction.

While Dogecoin continues to show momentum, other tokens like PEPE, PENGU, and the utility-focused Remittix (RTX) are emerging as potential outperformers in 2025. With whale accumulation, ETF speculation, and practical adoption shaping market sentiment, traders are now evaluating which tokens offer the best blend of upside potential and real-world utility. Dogecoin Price Prediction Strengthened by Whale Activity Dogecoin price prediction is turning bullish after a sharp 11% surge in the last 24 hours. DOGE is currently trading around $0.23648, consolidating near $0.24. Trading volume spiked alongside whale accumulation, suggesting institutional interest. The $0.23–$0.24 zone has held as strong support, and if momentum continues, this band could become the launching point for further upward movement. Analysts are eyeing $0.41 and even $0.95 in longer-term scenarios, provided bullish trends persist. August has been notable for large-scale DOGE accumulation, with whales adding roughly 680 million DOGE, about $150 million in value. This isn’t casual retail buying; these moves often precede broader market rallies. Open interest in DOGE futures sits near $3 billion, indicating leverage is healthy and not overstretched. Institutional developments also added weight to Dogecoin price prediction. The Trump-linked $50 million mining operation and Wyoming-backed stablecoin launches provide regulatory and infrastructural confidence. ETF filing speculation continues to stir interest, with markets anticipating an SEC review in 2025. On-chain metrics, including 8 million holder addresses and a stable NVT ratio of 1.5, reinforce the picture of sustained accumulation without excessive froth. Remittix Offers Alternative Opportunities While DOGE sees strong momentum, emerging tokens like PEPE, PENGU, and Remittix (RTX) are attracting attention for potential upside. Remittix, in particular, stands out as a PayFi utility token designed for real-world cross-border payments. Its infrastructure supports crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, 40+ cryptocurrencies, and 30 fiat currencies, giving it adoption potential beyond speculative hype. Key Remittix highlights: Wallet Beta Q3 2025: Instant FX conversion, low fees Real-World Utility: Ideal for freelancers, remitters, and businesses Security: Audited by CertiK for transparency Global Payments: Seamless crypto-to-bank transfers Remittix has sold over 616 million tokens, raised more than $21 million, and trades at $0.0969. With its practical use cases, RTX could outperform meme tokens in 2025 as adoption accelerates. Comparing Dogecoin Price Prediction with Emerging Tokens Dogecoin price prediction depends heavily on whale accumulation, institutional moves, and potential ETF filings. However, speculative tokens like PEPE and PENGU, alongside utility-focused projects like Remittix, show that real-world applications can rival hype-driven growth. DOGE could continue higher if $0.24 is secured as support, but investors may diversify into these emerging coins to capture potential early-stage gains. Whales, retail traders, and crypto enthusiasts are closely watching these dynamics, as each token offers a unique blend of speculative momentum and functional adoption.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $114,530 (-0.8%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $114,899 24-hour low $114,400 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 133,640 (+35.66%) Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.54% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 111,818 200-Day SMA $ 91,276 14-Day RSI 42.21 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin declines below $115K Resistance for BTC is at $117,842 Support for BTC/USD is at $111,644 The BTC price analysis for 24 August confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price declines toward $114.5K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces bearish pressure toward $114K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced selling pressure as it declined toward $114.5K. Currently, sellers are triggering bearish rally, resulting in a retest of immediate Fib levels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.26 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $114,530, declining by over 0.84% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades at 46, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $115K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.55, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $117,842, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,926. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $111,644, beginning a bearish trend to $105,331. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as sellers pushed the price toward $114.5K. The recent highs triggered selling demand. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Strategy bought an additional 430 Bitcoin between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. The purchase cost was $51.4 million, or an average $119,666 per Bitcoin. Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-24 11:15:00

The ECB announced that different technologies are being evaluated, but a final decision has not yet been made on this matter. Following the adoption of the stablecoin law in the US last month, European Union (EU) officials have decided to accelerate their plans for a digital euro. The new regulation adds a $288 billion regulatory framework to the stablecoin market and has raised concerns in Europe that dollar-based tokens will become increasingly dominant in the global financial system. European authorities, previously considering private blockchains for the digital euro solely for privacy reasons, have now considered public blockchains. A source familiar with the matter said, “Everyone was surprised by how quickly the US passed the law. Now they're saying, 'We need to move faster.'” Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Charles Hoskinson Predicts a “Gigachad Bull Run” in the Market - “Two Things Are Needed” The ECB's digital euro project, which has been developing for years, has gained new momentum with the US's swift legal action. Officials are concerned that US regulations will further increase the use of dollar-denominated stablecoins. This could lead to a shift of euro deposits to the US and a further strengthening of the dollar's role in cross-border payments. ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone warned in April that “Europe cannot be overly dependent on foreign payment solutions,” and said that dollar-based stablecoins posed a serious threat to Europe’s financial stability and strategic autonomy. Prior to the US law, the digital euro wasn't expected to reside on a public blockchain. While public blockchains could facilitate the circulation of the digital euro, their transparent ledger structure raises privacy concerns. “The use of public blockchains is something EU officials are now considering more seriously,” one source said. In its latest statement, the ECB stated that different options, including centralized and decentralized solutions and distributed ledger technology, were being evaluated in the digital euro development process, and that no final decision had been made yet. *This is not investment advice.

Stage 4 was sold out quickly at $0.005 per token and raised more than $2 million. It has sold over 807 million tokens starting the presale at $0.001, which represented a 400% price increase by the close of Stage 4. The presale is in Stage 5 and the tokens are priced at $0.01. Investors are reacting to the forecast that Ozak AI would be valued at $1 after launch. The prediction on this target would bring a 200x and 300x gain. According to analysts following the project’s trajectory, a $500 investment could yield $75,000. Technology at the Core Ozak AI combines predictive analytics and decentralized infrastructure. The meme coin's Prediction Agents provide real-time financial intelligence to both traders and businesses. The Ozak Stream Network (OSN) is based on DePIN architecture to process and secure live market information. The system offers reliability and scalability and eliminates single points of failure by distributing the infrastructure across multiple locations. Ozak AI has a total token supply of 10 billion with 30% allocated to the presale. Early-stage buyers stand to benefit most if post-launch prices approach the $1 mark. The Ozak AI cross-chain functionality is compatible with multiple blockchains which increases its functionality and adoption. The benefits available to token holders are staking, governance and expansion of features to the ecosystem.

Futures sentiment index flips positive after five bearish days, easing short-term pressure on Bitcoin markets. Price consolidates between $112K–$124K, while technical patterns suggest scope for another upward breakout. Double-Bottom Structures in Play Bitcoin has printed another double-bottom pattern, according to ZYN. Similar setups earlier this year were followed by sharp rallies. In April, BTC rose by more than 50%, moving from about $86,000 to over $125,000. A second pattern in June triggered a 25% climb, lifting the price from near $100,000 back to $125,000. $BTC double-bottom just printed. April: +50% pump. June: +25% rally. Even half that move now sends Bitcoin above $127K before Q3 ends. This isn’t a chart pattern, it’s a launchpad. pic.twitter.com/rOMGmrYhyd — ZYN (@Zynweb3) August 22, 2025 Notably, the latest structure is forming near $112,000, as BTC slipped to that level on Friday before it bounced off to over $117,000. So far, the asset’s price action is holding within a $112,000 to $124,000 range, reflecting consolidation after recent swings. Inverse Head and Shoulders Formation A chart shared by Merlijn The Trader shows Bitcoin completing an inverse head-and-shoulders. The left shoulder was formed in December 2024, the head in April 2025, near $70,000, and the right one in June 2025. The neckline, which slopes upward, has now been broken and retested near $113,000. Holding above this zone is marked as confirmation of the breakout. Based on the scale of the setup, the pattern points toward higher levels if momentum continues. Source: X Futures Market Sentiment Turns Positive Data from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shows BTC futures sentiment has moved back into positive territory after five days of negative readings. The sentiment index, which combines net taker flows, open interest, and long/short volumes, reflects short-term positioning in the derivatives market. In early August, sentiment followed a similar path when the ratio dropped below -1 before recovering into positive territory. That shift coincided with a price rebound—the current bounce from -0.7 signals that bearish pressure has eased in recent sessions.

As it consolidates, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector with its innovative lending protocols and strong buy activity coming into focus. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6. Investors of the project are looking at a minimum return on investment of 400% when MUTM is launched in the market. Mutuum Finance has reached $14.8 million raised and more than 15600 token buyers. As Bitcoin stabilizes, is grinding through their own technical patterns, but the growing hype around Mutuum Finance is driving speculation about potential capital flows and market direction in the weeks ahead. Bitcoin Steadies Around Mid-$112K as Market Waits for Jackson Hole Cues Bitcoin is currently trading at approximately $112,071, down from recent high, but overall pointing to signs of stabilization amid broader market restraint. This price reflects a subdued tone in crypto markets as investors await directional impetus from the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where interest rate guidance could move sentiment. Despite pressures from inflation data and prospective volatility down the line, Bitcoin is standing firm at this level while other digital assets move in tandem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 2025 presale has been extremely successful. The project is currently valued at $0.035 in Phase 6. Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi future with a platform containing world real-use cases. Presale has been able to attract over 15600 token holders and over $14.8 million in funds. $100K Worth of Tokens to Be Won Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also in the process of a $100,000 giveaway . There will be 10 winners of a Mutuum Finance gift worth $10,000 each. The giveaway is an indication that the project really cares about having a loyal and a long-term community. And another step towards transparency and safety, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. The project team is incentivizing the participants with up to $50,000 USDT for discovering bugs in the project. The objective of the Bounty program is to identify the possible vulnerabilities of the project. Four vulnerability categories are considered in the program for rating based on their severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance is based on a two-lending system in which customers enjoy unparalleled flexibility as Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, lending pools can make use of smart contracts, which can determine if they are to change interest rates based on how the market condition turns out. Lenders offer fixed incomes, with borrowers protected while borrowing. P2P model bypasses intermediaries to connect lending parties and borrowing parties directly. Any price-risky asset needs such completely decentralized model with maximum user control. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $14.8M from 15,600+ investors, building momentum while Bitcoin is below $115,000. The token, priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, is poised for a 14.29% rise to $0.04 and is providing early purchasers potential 400%+ ROI at launch. Additionally, with a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, as well as a groundbreaking dual lending model, MUTM is quickly emerging as a top DeFi coin.

Speaking with CNBC on Friday at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025, Long emphasized that while Wall Street’s increasing involvement has fueled the current market cycle, its legacy systems and risk models may prove inadequate when the inevitable bear market returns. Wall Street Titans May Not Be Ready For A Crypto Market Downturn – Custodia Boss In answering a question on the significance of institutional involvement in the crypto market, Long contrasted the early days of crypto, when retail investors and grassroots participants worked to expand decentralization and secure networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with today’s landscape dominated by institutional finance. According to the Custodia founder, the cycle is now largely driven by Wall Street titans who are building financial wrappers, derivatives, and corporate treasuries around digital assets. Notably, institutional participation in crypto has hit record highs in recent years. The Spot Bitcoin ETFs , which launched early last year, have been TradFi’s biggest digital asset success, boasting $53.80 billion in cumulative inflows. Meanwhile, Spot Ethereum ETFs are beginning to gather momentum, registering $8.20 billion since the beginning of July alone. While this influx has undoubtedly brought credibility and capital to the sector, Long warned that the traditional playbooks of these institutions are not suited to assets with finite supply, e.g, Bitcoin. The former Morgan Stanley executive and Custodia CEO said: ….They (TradFi) are perfectly comfortable taking more leverage than you would take with an asset of finite supply because they have all these mechanisms to bail them out in the event that supply for an asset becomes too tight. They have discount window. They have fault tolerances built into the securities system so that if the books don’t balance, it’s okay. They can always go the next day and get the shares from the market the next day. By contrast, crypto operates in real time with no external buffers. Caitlin Long explains that this structural difference could leave TradFi firms exposed if they attempt to apply conventional leverage and hedging strategies to a market that behaves rather differently. Having witnessed multiple boom-and-bust cycles since 2012, the Custodia boss expressed certainty that another downturn will come despite the remarkable market growth in the present cycle, and questions whether traditional players will be able to withstand its impact.

The platform released a report, noting the effects it could pose to digital assets. This report comes as the crypto market saw a rally on Friday, and sentiment shifted to greed after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium. At the event, the Fed boss made remarks that may have hinted that the first rate cut of 2025 could happen in September. “Historically, such a massive spike in discussion around a single bullish narrative can indicate that euphoria is getting too high and may signal a local top,” Santiment said. Santiment calls for caution amid the Fed interest rate decision According to Santiment, the social media mentions of keywords tied to the Federal Reserve and interest rate cuts have jumped to their highest in the past 11 months. However, it warned that the market needs to be cautious. “While optimism about a rate cut is fueling the market, social data suggests caution is warranted,” Santiment said. In his speech, Powell mentioned that the current conditions in inflation and the labor market “may warrant adjusting” the Fed’s stance when it comes to monetary policy. In addition, the CME FedWatch Tool has shown that about 75% of market participants are expecting the Fed to cut rates when it convenes in September. Many crypto analysts have based their market predictions on the Fed’s decision since the beginning of the year. However, analysts are presently divided on the outcome of a potential rate cut, with some thinking it could serve as a potential bullish catalyst while others are not sold on that outcome. Meanwhile, others are not that sold on the idea, with most of them noting that the crypto market may not immediately see the impact of a Fed rate cut. In April, Markus Thielen, the Research head of 10x, said that expecting a bullish impulse is too early. He added that credit spreads could continue to widen, which means that “recessionary concerns may be seeping deeper into the economy.” Thielen noted that while the long-term effects of a recession could be bullish for Bitcoin, the asset may face headwinds before gaining bullish momentum. “Normally, Bitcoin first sells off when China devalues or the Fed cuts, as the first cut might not be so impactful and also confirms economic weakness,” he said. In the same vein, some analysts feel that if the Fed refuses to take action this year, it could lead to headwinds for the crypto market. In March, economist Timothy Peterson warned that if the Fed refuses to cut rates in 2025, the market may experience a heavy downturn. He noted at the time that it could potentially drag Bitcoin down to under $100,000. “What it needs is a trigger. I think that trigger may be as simple as the Fed not cutting rates at all this year,” Peterson said. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This wasn’t about trade, NATO, or diplomacy. No, the POTUS wanted to know how he could get nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. The call, confirmed by Norway’s biggest business paper Dagens Naeringsliv , caught Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg while walking the streets of Oslo earlier this month. This wasn’t some quiet outreach through staff or back channels. Trump personally picked up the phone and cold-called Stoltenberg. The only reason? He wanted a path to that prize. He’s made it clear for years now that he wants to be handed a Nobel. According to people around him, this obsession is what’s behind his recent attempts to broker peace deals in Ukraine and Russia , and between Israel and Gaza. Nobel economists attack Trump’s economic legacy Trump even ranted about the whole thing on Truth Social back in June. He wrote, “No, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be, but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!” But this week, the focus won’t be on peace talks. It’ll be about the economy. And the ones doing the talking are the same Nobel Laureates he wants to stand beside. They’re gathering in Lindau, Germany, for their annual meeting. And what they’re saying about Trump isn’t good. Joseph Stiglitz, one of the world’s most recognized economists and a previous Nobel winner, told The Guardian the U.S. under Trump had become “a scary place to invest.” He pointed to the president’s tariff policies as the problem, warning that they could lead to stagflation, a toxic combo of high inflation and no growth. He said the Federal Reserve is “clearly worried” about this. Roger Myerson, another Laureate attending the Lindau event, focused on Trump’s political behavior. In The Hill , he wrote that “when large groups of voters have become convinced that only one party really cares about them, then they may feel no stake in democracy itself… and support their leader in shaking off its inconvenient constitutional restraints.” And then there’s Simon Johnson, another voice in the Nobel circle. He joined the criticism too, speaking on the Nobel Prize Conversations podcast. He said Trump’s push for American isolationism is “destroying human capital” and giving “a massive advantage to geopolitical competitors.” He called the policy “a self-defeating foolish action by the Trump administration.” Despite all this backlash, Trump has at least one unexpected voice offering him a slim chance. Hillary Clinton, his former rival and ex-First Lady, said something most didn’t expect. In a recent interview, she said that if Trump could end the Ukraine-Russia war “without putting Ukraine in a position where it must concede its territory to the aggressor… I’d nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.” But good luck with that.

ETH also filled a weekly CME gap, as analysts speculate that the altseason is just getting started. 200K ETH Out of Exchanges It was less than five months ago when the second-largest cryptocurrency plunged to $1,400, erasing years of gains. The overall market situation was grim due to Trump’s tariff policy, but ETH seemed to be taking the correction the worst. However, the landscape changed big time in the following months, as ether skyrocketed to almost $4,900 last Friday to mark a new all-time high – nearly four years after its previous peak. Different types of investors continue to accumulate the token, ranging from smaller and retail to institutions, corporations , and whales . The ETFs are back in the green after a brief four-day hiatus, while even this Bitcoin OG swapped a big portion of their BTC holdings for spot and long ETH positions. Ali Martinez provided more promising data for Ethereum’s short-term future, as investors using centralized crypto exchanges had pulled 200,000 ETH out of those platforms within just two days. Such withdrawals reduce the immediate selling pressure, which should, in theory, be bullish for the underlying asset if demand increases or even stays the same. 200,000 Ethereum $ETH withdrawn from exchanges in just 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/XJ3EQuLxEd — Ali (@ali_charts) August 24, 2025 From a USD perspective, this amount is worth close to $1 billion, given ETH’s current price tag of almost $4,800. CME Gap Filled, Altseason to Begin? The crypto market, being open 24/7, often performs faster than the traditional financial industry, and this leaves some weekend (or holiday) gaps for digital assets that trade on legacy platforms. Due to ETH’s surge in the past few weekends, it left a gap on the CME futures, and many analysts believe it had to be closed before the asset could resume its rally. According to Rekt Capital, the weekly CME gap (in the green) has been filled and ETH has “reversed to the upside from it.” $ETH Ethereum has successfully filled its Weekly CME Gap (green) and reversed to the upside from it #ETH #Crypto #Ethereum https://t.co/VuKCZhPPbI pic.twitter.com/qnaNWGbbrW — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) August 22, 2025 Satoshi Flipper also weighed in on ETH’s recent performance, especially against the market leader.

Slowing demand has also contributed to the cool down, with current figures about two-thirds less than last month’s records. According to the weekly report from CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin market has moved from an extra bullish to a bullish cooldown phase. Bitcoin Momentum is Cooling Down During this cool-down phase, Bitcoin’s apparent demand has fallen from a July peak of 174,000 BTC to 59,000 BTC today. Institutional BTC buyers have slowed down in their accumulation – they are still buying, but not as much as before. The business intelligence firm, Strategy, which is the lead BTC buyer, has seen its purchases tumble from a November 2024 high of 171,000 to 27,000 over the past 30 days. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also seeing their lowest inflows in four months. Their 30-day net purchases currently hover around 11,000 BTC, a level not seen since late April. “This broad-based decline in demand growth suggests fading momentum, which likely contributed to the recent price correction. Continued softness in demand could keep Bitcoin in a consolidation phase,” CryptoQuant stated. Moreover, on-chain indicators are flashing weaker signals, which reveal that the market remains constructive, but with fading bullish momentum. The CryptoQuant Bull Score Index moved from the “Extra Bullish” to “Bullish Cooldown” phase after BTC rallied past $120,000. Current market conditions tally with the ongoing price decline. “The transition to a bullish cooldown typically precedes sideways movement or mild corrections. Without a return to strong demand signals, further upward momentum may remain limited in the near term,” the analytics firm added. Support at $110K? Furthermore, new whale investors have been taking profits. This cohort of investors has led a spree that has realized at least $74 billion in profits since July 4. Notably, the market recorded its largest daily profit so far this year ($9 billion) on that same day. Since then, the investors have not relented in taking profits – August 16 saw new whale investors realize up to $2 billion in gains. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price hovered around $116,000 at the time of writing, but with reduced downside risk. CryptoQuant analysts believe the leading digital asset may find support near $110,000, which is the Trader On-chain Realized Price. This level often acts as support during bull cycles, and traders’ unrealized profit margin goes to zero, discouraging more selling.

Stargate Finance DAO approved the deal with an overwhelming majority. The acquisition will see LayerZero and Stargate merge under one project, with ZRO becoming the official token for the two cross-chain protocols. 94% of Stargate Finance DAO approved the deal. The merger between marks a reunion of the two projects. Stargate Finance was created by the LayerZero team in 2021 but eventually spun out as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The majority of Stargate DAO supported the LayerZero acquisition. Source: Stargate DAO Since then, Stargate has become one of the biggest multichain bridges in the crypto ecosystem, connecting around 50 blockchain networks and powering more than $70 billion in transactions. Per the press release, the deal represents a milestone as this is one of the first times that a DAO has been acquired at over $100 million. The deal almost did not happen with cross-chain bridge Wormhole making a late effort to hijack the acquisition. Wormhole Foundation claimed that the LayerZero offer for Stargate Finance was not compelling and undervalued the protocol business, adding that it was willing to submit a higher bid than the initial $110 million from LayerZero. The challenge led to LayerZero revising its offer, while Wormhole also asked for a vote pause of five business days to finalize its offer and get more insight into Stargate’s financials. There were further rumors that Across Protocol and Axelar showed interest in Stargate. However, most Stargate DAO members supported the LayerZero revised bid, which not only increased the bid’s value but also offered other incentives, including a revenue-sharing period for those who staked Stargate STG tokens. Deal to strengthen LayerZero dominance in the cross-chain ecosystem Meanwhile, the deal will further cement LayerZero’s position in the blockchain interoperability ecosystem. Data from Token Terminal shows that it has already controlled around 85% of the market share over the past 12 months, and several companies, including PayPal , BitGo, and Paxos, are using its services. With the deal, which will unite Stargate DAO and LayerZero under one umbrella, the cross-chain protocol now looks to expand further and strengthen its ecosystem. This move will further bring more value to the LayerZero community. Speaking on the deal, LayerZero Labs CEO Bryan Pellegrino stated that the team has been working on the infrastructure to enable cross-chain interoperability for years and Stargate’s return to help improve its services. He said: “Stargate’s return gives the LayerZero ecosystem a clear access point to the end-consumer, an immediate revenue-generating asset, and a clear focus on accelerating the velocity of value transfer.” Meanwhile, the deal now means Stargate DAO will be dissolved with STG tokens swapped for ZRO at a ratio of 1 STG to 0.08634 ZRO. The revenue generated from Stargate will also go towards the ZRO buyback. ZRO token down despite positive news Despite the positive development many in the LayerZero and Stargate community have welcomed, the ZRO token is down slightly in the last 24 hours. Its decline appears to be part of the broader drop across the crypto market, with major cap tokens such as Bitcoin and XRP also declining. However, ZRO’s decline is more pronounced given how it has struggled this year in general. It has been down 7.52% in the last seven days while it has lost 26% in three months. At $2.032, the token has already lost more than 61% of its value this year. Interestingly, STG is not doing much better. The token, which is trading at $0.1769, is down by 2% in the past seven days while losing more than 50% of its value year-to-date. Holders of both tokens will be hoping to see a resurgence in value for ZRO now that they are united under one ecosystem. Get seen where it counts.

Starting September 1, early investors will be eligible to unlock 20% of their token allocations, with the remaining 80% to be released later via a community vote. The launch introduces a novel “Lockbox” mechanism, designed to ensure secure, transparent token distribution. “WLFI token is becoming tradable & transferable. This thread is your exact guide: what’s happening, when it happens, and what to do—no guesswork,” the project team said. What Is the Lockbox & How Does It Work? Before receiving any WLFI tokens, users must activate the Lockbox, an on-chain smart contract that controls token unlocks. Once activated, the user’s WLFI tokens are moved from their wallet to the Lockbox, and the balance in the wallet shows zero—this is expected and intentional. Token Unlock Timeline : Before September 1 : Activate Lockbox on the official WLFI website. Starting September 1 : Claim 20% of your WLFI tokens. Remaining 80% : Unlocked gradually, based on a community governance vote. The Lockbox opens August 25, giving investors a week to activate and prepare for trading. This contract has been fully audited by Cyfrin, a well-known Web3 security firm. Who Gets WLFI Tokens? Early investors from the $0.015 and $0.05 rounds can unlock 20% starting September 1. Founders, team, advisors, and partners currently have no access to any tokens. New investors can buy WLFI via DeFi platforms (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). Exchange partnerships will be announced in the coming days. With backing from a high-profile political family and a launch strategy centered around transparency and community governance, WLFI is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about DeFi token rollouts of the year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-24 11:56:45

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were the early stars that turned small bets into big money. First buyers made millions fast, proving that a strong crowd can move price in days. But that time has passed. Another 100x for DOGE or SHIB is almost impossible. Shiba Inu sits near a $7.2B market cap, and 100x would force $724B. Dogecoin near $2B would need $202B. These targets are not realistic, so the old coins cannot repeat those wild gains. This is why smart money is moving to new plays with cheap entry price and much larger room to grow. It points to a 2025 meme coin that many of the same whales are buying now. It has raised millions in presale. It ships real tools like a zero fee DEX, cross chain moves, and staking over 240 percent, tools the old names never had. Many call it the next shot at life changing wealth with a stronger base. Could it be the best crypto to buy in 2025, and where do Shiba and Doge stand now? Shiba Inu, SHIB, The Falling Star Shiba Inu trades close to $0.0000123, with a market cap near $7.3 billion. Price has stayed in a narrow band for months and has not broken out with force. If it slips below support from $0.0000123 to $0.0000125, deeper losses can follow. Supply is the main drag. For a 100x, SHIB would need a market cap above $700 billion, which is not realistic. That is near Apple’s value in 2019 or the whole crypto market in 2020. That much new cash is not likely for one meme coin, and SHIB already has 589 trillion tokens out. Even with burns, the pool stays huge. This is why Shiba Inu cannot offer the same massive wins as before. Dogecoin, DOGE, outlook Dogecoin trades near $0.21, with a market cap in the tens of billions. The crowd is loyal and some charts turn bullish at times, but price stalls near $0.24 to $0.25. Even a 30 to 40 percent rise is nowhere near the old moon runs. Dogecoin also lacks a clear plan or rich use beyond tips and basic payments. Without new products and real use, it cannot pull the billions needed for giant moves. DOGE might still reach 5x, but the life changing phase has ended, which brings us to PEPETO, the 2025 leader. Pepeto, PEPETO, the meme coin with real build Pepeto is an Ethereum meme coin with culture and tools. The name is a plan, P for Power, E for Energy, P for Precision, E for Efficiency, T for Technology, O for Optimization. This plan is live. PepetoSwap is a zero fee DEX. The native bridge moves tokens across chains. Staking is near 240 percent APY. Smart contracts passed SolidProof and Coinsult. With a 420 trillion supply, like Pepe, it keeps the meme link and adds a real build. On Ethereum mainnet, it wants to be the home for meme coins in 2025. The presale price is $0.000000148, with more than $6 million raised, which shows demand and depth. The story pulls you in, but the tools make the case. Now, growth and Tier 1 talk, the arguments making innvestors expect the life-changing returns. Growth, trust and Binance listings next Pepeto’s presale has raised more than $6 million and a community above 100,000, with early whales moving from old coins into this one. The price is $0.000000148 at this stage, still very cheap, and each round lifts price and sells out faster than the last. Team notes point to Tier 1 exchange plans, with Binance named in talk. The team is putting real blocks in place, building trust, and mapping a clear road for big growth, with tools that can change lives, which one of the main goals of the team behind the project. What if Pepeto hits DOGE or SHIB levels In May 2021, Dogecoin hit an $88.7 billion market cap and turned small buys into big wins. If Pepeto reached that size, its 420 trillion supply would price near $0.000211, about 1,465 times above today’s presale. Even if it only matched Shiba Inu’s top near $41 billion, the math is near $0.0000976, a 673 times move. The point is simple, Pepeto is not just hype. It launches with tools that fix real problems, and more than 850 tokens have applied to list on the swap. Every trade on that exchange will use Pepeto, creating steady demand and helping price rise over time. With this design, plus strong demand and rising use, Pepeto has the base and the power to deliver huge potential returns. Final word Meme coins are changing, and Pepeto (PEPETO) looks ready for what comes next: The next altcoin season. It doesn’t rely on empty hype, it brings real tools and solutions to the market, fixing the weak spots old memes left behind. Dogecoin and Shiba made early millionaires, but those doors are shut and upside is very small, on the other hand Pepeto looks like the one to make new millionaires, we all heard someone who made millions and escaped the rat race in one smart move, Pepeto appears to be that smart move we are talking about. At $0.000000148, it gives culture and build, a rare setup that can turn small investments into life-changing wealth. Tools and listings are near, and this window will not wait, join the presale now before it gets too late at https://pepeto.io/ For more information about PEPETO: Website: https://pepeto.io Whitepaper: https://pepeto.io/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf?v2=true Telegram: https://t.me/pepeto_channel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pepetocoin/ Twitter/X: https://x.com/Pepetocoin",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|DOGE|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-24 12:00:00

Three key themes are drawing attention and sparking debate: new asset tokens, viral digital jokes, and powerful digital infrastructure. Each has unique drivers and fast-growing communities. The story behind these trends goes deeper than meets the eye, hinting at dramatic changes ahead. TAO: The Coin That Pays Machines to Think Together TAO powers Bittensor, a public network where many small brains work as one big brain. Each model shares its best ideas, learns from others, and earns TAO when its answers help the group. People outside the network can ask questions, guide tasks, and pay in the same coin. Because the code is open and the rules live on a blockchain, anyone, anywhere, can join, build, and own a piece of the growing mind. AI coins are hot this cycle, yet many just chase buzz words. TAO stands apart because it already links real work to real pay. Bitcoin secures money, Ethereum runs apps, but TAO rewards thought. Its fixed supply and steady demand for learning may support price even in storms. Big firms now spend fortunes on data and chips; Bittensor taps global hobby rigs for the same goal and shares the gains. If the market keeps favoring useful networks over hype, TAO could move from niche idea to core holding. HBAR: The Fast, Green Token Challenging Blockchain Giants Hedera Hashgraph does not use a classic blockchain. It runs on a “hashgraph,” where computers share tiny pieces of data instead of bulky blocks. This design needs no mining, so it saves energy and lowers fees. Each HBAR pays for actions on the network and helps guard it through Proof of Stake. The result is quick, cheap moves for payments, games, and even stock trades. Big names—like Google and IBM—sit on its council, adding trust and money to the project. Today’s market rewards coins that cut costs and waste. Bitcoin is strong but slow. Ethereum is busy and pricey when traffic spikes. New rivals such as Solana promise speed but battle outages. HBAR reaches high numbers of deals per second without sweating and keeps fees under a penny. Its code is patented, which may slow open-source fans, yet it also sets Hedera apart in a crowded field. With eco talk rising and firms seeking stable rails, HBAR looks well placed for the next upswing. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Ondo Finance: Turning Safe Bonds into Smart Money Ondo Finance mixes the trust of old finance with the speed of blockchain . It turns safe assets like US Treasury bills into digital tokens that anyone can hold. Two teams drive this plan. One builds the products, the other codes the tech that lets them move with ease. Strong names back the project. BlackRock handles the bonds, and Coinbase keeps the crypto keys safe. Clear reports and strict rules add another layer of calm. The flagship token, USDY, acts like a stable coin but also pays yield from the bonds behind it. In the current market, many coins chase hype yet swing wildly. ONDO offers a different story. Its value leans on real income from government bonds, not just code promises. As rates stay high, those bonds pay solid interest, and holders see that flow in tokens. Few other crypto projects can say the same. Rival stable coins often sit idle, and pure DeFi coins still face hacks and heavy swings. For investors seeking steadier growth while waiting for the next bull run, ONDO looks like a calm port in a rough sea. Conclusion TAO, HBAR, and ONDO are good RWA and DePIN plays, yet attention turns to XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin uniting global fans and targeting 20,000% growth via community-driven GameFi.

This was reported by The Telegraph , citing senior Iranian officials close to the ongoing discussions. Tehran wants to avoid another round of military action from Israel or the United States and hold off a new wave of economic pressure that could collapse its already fragile economy. Ali Larijani, the 68-year-old security chief just reappointed by President Masoud Pezeshkian, is leading the charge to convince Iran’s top power players that it’s time to de-escalate. The proposed rollback to 20% enrichment is still way above the 3.67% limit that was set under the 2015 nuclear agreement. But it’s lower than where things stand now, and it’s designed to keep the door open for talks, not slam it shut with another war. Larijani is walking into the same political fire he dealt with in 2005, when the International Atomic Energy Agency referred Iran’s file to the UN just months after he took this exact same job. Larijani faces IRGC resistance amid snapback deadline The plan isn’t guaranteed. Larijani wants the rollback done before the snapback clause expires in October 2025. Once it does, France, the UK, and Germany won’t be able to act without a full vote at the UN. That means Russia or China could step in and block sanctions . Right now, though, they can unilaterally accuse Iran of violating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and restart the sanctions that were lifted ten years ago. A senior official close to the talks told The Telegraph , “Larijani is trying to convince the system to reduce the level of enrichment to avoid another war.” He added, “He’s concerned that without lowering it or meeting some of the West’s demands, the system will face another major challenge.” But Larijani is running into major resistance from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which still wants to keep enrichment high and sees any rollback as giving in to the West. Still, leadership under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appears to be leaning toward cooperation, at least temporarily. Pezeshkian brought Larijani back into the same national security post he held between 2005 and 2007, hoping he can negotiate with Western powers again. But even with Larijani’s return, the same three European countries are now threatening to return Iran’s nuclear file to the UN Security Council if progress stalls. The entire process feels like a tightrope walk, and Larijani is being pulled from both sides. Khamenei stays quiet as pressure builds and military drills begin The political split inside Iran is obvious. Reformists are pushing to suspend enrichment completely in exchange for lifting U.S. sanctions and changing domestic policies. Hardliners are calling them traitors. They’ve accused the reformists of siding with enemies of the Islamic Republic. One of the loudest criticisms came from inside Iran’s security structure. Aziz Ghazanfari, the IRGC’s deputy political chief, wrote on the Bassirat website that “foreign policy is not a place to state every reality” and warned that “the dangers of careless remarks by senior officials fall first on their own governments.” Khamenei has made only two appearances since Israeli forces hit Iranian targets in June, and now hasn’t been seen in weeks, which is only fueling more anxiety about what direction the leadership is leaning toward, and whether they’ll support Larijani or give in to the IRGC’s hardline position. At the same time, Iran’s defense ministry has launched a new round of ballistic missile drills. The nuclear deal in 2015 gave Iran access to global trade again after years of isolation. That came with a promise to cap enrichment levels far below what’s needed for weapons. Now, Iran’s pushing back toward those red lines, and Europe is out of patience.

And they got them — for a second. YZY blasted up to a $410 million market cap in under an hour, only to collapse nearly 70%—back down to ~$140 million, on the same day. The coin launched with the typical influencer-megaphone fanfare: celebrity name, viral memes, fast listings. But within hours, the reality set in. YZY followed the same tragicomic arc as dozens of “influencer coins” before it — moon, collapse, cope. That violent cliff-dive wasn’t the only eyebrow-raiser. On-chain data reveals a staggering concentration of power: just four wallets control about 80% of the YZY supply. What is more, the entire episode stinks of a setup. Crypto sleuths flagged the launch as potentially a scam, pointing to leftover tweets (since deleted) where Ye rejected a $2 million offer to promote a fake token. Suddenly, the narrative flipped: was this a controlled flip of sentiment, or a deepfake hijack of Ye’s digital persona? In short: YZY didn’t just crash, it imploded under suspicion, proving a headline and a hype tweet can launch memecoins, but can also crater them before most people even realize what hit them. The token surged to a sky-high market cap, and then crashed just as quickly as whales and insiders cashed out on day one, leaving retail bag-holders stunned and angry. The irony? A coin with billions of attention couldn’t sustain even a full week of interest. No roadmap. No structure. No trust. LIBRA, MELANIA, TRUMP — Same Stuff, Different Coin YZY wasn’t the first one. The $LIBRA token was once touted as a political power move in Argentina. It ended as a scandal, with millions lost and angry holders left in the dust. There were rumors of inside jobs, botched launches, and maybe even government connections. And just like YZY, the token pumped on a name and crashed on the lack of substance. Turns out, it was just the latest in a string of political meme coin rugs orchestrated by the same guy: Hayden Mark Davis. Before $LIBRA, he dropped $TRUMP, then $MELANIA — coins that fooled thousands into thinking they had official backing. But it was all smoke. The tokens pumped fast, dumped faster, and left retail bleeding. If you look closer, it almost feels like these projects are run by the same crew recycling the same playbook. The playbook is simple: Attach to a big name Drop on a meme narrative Hide tokenomics Let early wallets win Vanish by the weekend Crypto isn’t falling for it anymore. The crowd is too sharp, too burned, too degen-smart to ape into ""celebrity rug 15.0"". Why political meme coins are especially toxic These are much more than celebrity clichés. Political tokens often ride waves of false legitimacy promoted by supposed political insiders, sometimes via actual officeholders. That creates a dangerous illusion of authenticity, even while the underlying mechanics are pure rug-pull. The “trusted” illusion When a president or first lady seems to endorse a coin—or there’s that photo op with some tech influencer—retail investors get fooled into trusting the project. But that trust is usually a façade, floating over pump-and-dump rails. The insider advantage These coins are pre-loaded with opaque structures: a handful of wallets or insiders control the supply, dump it at the peak, and blow out — while the crowd gets left holding the bag. Fractions of seconds from “price pump” to “trust dump” These launches are hyper‑compressed: explosive spikes, instant dumps. Political memecoins potentiate this volatility because they can claim “establishment backing”—only to bite investors when the insiders exit. This isn’t just speculation. For $LIBRA, investors lost hundreds of millions after Mania‑style hype and rapid collapse. The Meme Coin Game Is Changing We’ve hit rug fatigue. The dopamine high of a Twitter-powered launch doesn’t last. People want something older, a tried-and-true format — like an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Why? Because structured presales and ICO-style launches still carry something hype coins don’t: a path to trust. A way to grow holders organically. A plan. It’s not 2017 anymore — but ironically, it’s that same ICO structure that might be the last reliable way for meme coins to reach 10x or 100x in this cycle. ICOs Still Work When Done Right Let’s break it down. What does an ICO meme coin offer that celebrity-driven tokens don’t? Structured Presale Phases – Instead of launching at peak FOMO, ICOs offer tiers where early believers buy in cheap — incentivizing community, not just whales. Transparent Tokenomics – ICOs usually share public vesting schedules and allocations. No “oops all insiders” nonsense. Locked Liquidity – No rug pulls. Funds and LPs are locked or multisigged. You know where the money is. Community-Driven Growth – ICOs build armies. Meme coins with ICOs onboard early holders who stick, not tourists who flip. Roadmaps & Delivery – Even basic. Even memes. But they give something to hold onto beyond a celebrity tweet. It’s when old-school structure meets new-school degen energy. And that’s the formula that still has room to run. XYZVerse: Start With Structure, Not Celebrity The “celebrity coin → instant moonshot” days are over. The market is too informed, too skeptical, too fast. But that doesn’t mean 1000x plays are dead — they’ve just shifted to a different model. Unlike hype-driven, instant-launch coins, XYZVerse.io ($XYZ) is taking the structured ICO route — and it’s working. The project is still in presale mode, and has already raised over $15 million from a growing base of early believers. Here’s what makes it different: Clear tokenomics — Transparent allocation, structured vesting, and no shadow bags. Roadmap with delivery milestones — From gamified staking and utility integrations to listings and burn mechanics. Community traction — Organic growth, holders accumulating, and a rising presence across crypto socials. Locked liquidity — XYZVerse allocates 15% of its total supply to liquidity, explicitly reserved to ensure smooth trading and a stable foundation post-launch The Only Meme Coins That Can 1000x Now Are ICO Memes like $XYZ XYZVerse ($XYZ) is already proving that structured meme coin launches can still capture serious upside. Starting at just $0.0001, the token has surged through multiple presale stages to reach $0.0053 — marking an impressive 53× return for early participants. To date, over $15 million has been raised — a clear signal of growing investor demand and market belief in the project's long-term vision. And the momentum continues: with each new stage, the price climbs. It’s currently approaching $0.0054, with the roadmap eyeing $0.01 soon, and ultimately targeting $0.10 at launch That $0.10 listing price is more than just a round number — it represents a nearly 1,000× gain from the original presale price of $0.0001. This kind of upside doesn’t happen by accident — it comes from strategy, structure, and serious backing. Even conservative analysts estimate the token could spike to $0.15–$0.25 shortly after listing, depending on how exchange support and post-launch utility unfold. How $XYZ Can Actually Get There Phase Mechanism & Milestones Presale Momentum Tiered price model pushes the price higher as capital pours in. Roadmap Execution Active delivery: community engagement, ecosystem partnerships (e.g., bookmaker.XYZ) Built-In Scarcity 17.13% of supply permanently burned—deflationary pressure for long-term holders Upcoming Liquidity Events Listing on major CEXes and DEXes; discussions underway with KuCoin, Binance, and OKX Community Activation Aggressive airdrops (10%) and strong social media growth are building hype and loyalty Final Verdict: Structure Wins, and $XYZ Is Proof Celebrity coins are collapsing under their own hype. Today’s market demands structure, not noise — and only well-built meme coins have any shot at real returns. $XYZ is leading that shift. It’s already delivered 50x+ in presale, with a clear path to launch at $0.10, strong tokenomics, and actual utility. Forget rugs and fame-fueled flops. If you want 100x potential, structured ICOs like $XYZ are the last real play left.

This blockchain platform uses a proof-of-stake system which is more energy-efficient than Bitcoin's mining method. Cardano seeks to improve scalability and sustainability for cryptocurrencies. Despite the recent market dump, this coin shows strong potential like in early 2021. Advances such as smart contracts and a strong community make it a strong contender for the next altcoin season. With its focus on research and security, many see ADA poised for growth. This could make Cardano an attractive option in today's market cycle, especially for those who believe in a bright future for altcoins.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffarth, these updates show that the SEC is in direct communication with applicants—a strong indicator that the approval process is advancing. “Amendments like these suggest that the dialogue with the SEC is ongoing, which is generally a positive sign,” Seyffarth said. Who Filed? The updated applications, submitted on August 22, 2025, came from: Grayscale Bitwise Canary CoinShares Franklin Templeton 21Shares WisdomTree These firms are looking to gain early positioning in the growing crypto ETF market, this time with a focus on XRP. What’s in the Filings? One key update came from Bitwise. According to its S-1 filing, the SEC requested clarity around the mechanics of issuing and redeeming trust shares. The new filing includes an option to redeem in cash, not just in kind—a topic that was also contentious during the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. What’s Next? The SEC has set a mid-October 2025 deadline for most spot XRP ETF applications and other altcoin-related products. This timing matches Seyffarth’s earlier prediction that approvals won’t come before Q4. Experts believe this wave of amendments is a natural step forward. Analysts at Kaiko Research suggest the XRP ETF may be first in line for approval, beating out other altcoin proposals. Nate Geraci, CEO of The ETF Store, predicts that the SEC will approve spot altcoin ETFs “within a couple of months.” He also expects staking to be permitted in existing Ethereum ETFs soon, further expanding the crypto ETF landscape.

Political memecoins potentiate this volatility because they can claim “establishment backing”—only to bite investors when the insiders exit. This isn’t just speculation. For $LIBRA, investors lost hundreds of millions after Mania‑style hype and rapid collapse. The Meme Coin Game Is Changing We’ve hit rug fatigue. The dopamine high of a Twitter-powered launch doesn’t last. People want something older, a tried-and-true format — like an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Why? Because structured presales and ICO-style launches still carry something hype coins don’t: a path to trust. A way to grow holders organically. A plan. It’s not 2017 anymore — but ironically, it’s that same ICO structure that might be the last reliable way for meme coins to reach 10x or 100x in this cycle. ICOs Still Work When Done Right Let’s break it down. What does an ICO meme coin offer that celebrity-driven tokens don’t? Structured Presale Phases – Instead of launching at peak FOMO, ICOs offer tiers where early believers buy in cheap — incentivizing community, not just whales. Transparent Tokenomics – ICOs usually share public vesting schedules and allocations. No “oops all insiders” nonsense. Locked Liquidity – No rug pulls. Funds and LPs are locked or multisigged. You know where the money is. Community-Driven Growth – ICOs build armies. Meme coins with ICOs onboard early holders who stick, not tourists who flip. Roadmaps & Delivery – Even basic. Even memes. But they give something to hold onto beyond a celebrity tweet. It’s when old-school structure meets new-school degen energy. And that’s the formula that still has room to run. XYZVerse: Start With Structure, Not Celebrity The “celebrity coin → instant moonshot” days are over. The market is too informed, too skeptical, too fast. But that doesn’t mean 1000x plays are dead — they’ve just shifted to a different model. Unlike hype-driven, instant-launch coins, XYZVerse.io ($XYZ) is taking the structured ICO route — and it’s working. The project is still in presale mode, and has already raised over $15 million from a growing base of early believers. Here’s what makes it different: Clear tokenomics — Transparent allocation, structured vesting, and no shadow bags. Roadmap with delivery milestones — From gamified staking and utility integrations to listings and burn mechanics. Community traction — Organic growth, holders accumulating, and a rising presence across crypto socials. Locked liquidity — XYZVerse allocates 15% of its total supply to liquidity, explicitly reserved to ensure smooth trading and a stable foundation post-launch The Only Meme Coins That Can 1000x Now Are ICO Memes like $XYZ XYZVerse ($XYZ) is already proving that structured meme coin launches can still capture serious upside. Starting at just $0.0001, the token has surged through multiple presale stages to reach $0.0053 — marking an impressive 53× return for early participants. To date, over $15 million has been raised — a clear signal of growing investor demand and market belief in the project's long-term vision. And the momentum continues: with each new stage, the price climbs. It’s currently approaching $0.0054, with the roadmap eyeing $0.01 soon, and ultimately targeting $0.10 at launch That $0.10 listing price is more than just a round number — it represents a nearly 1,000× gain from the original presale price of $0.0001. This kind of upside doesn’t happen by accident — it comes from strategy, structure, and serious backing. Even conservative analysts estimate the token could spike to $0.15–$0.25 shortly after listing, depending on how exchange support and post-launch utility unfold. How $XYZ Can Actually Get There Phase Mechanism & Milestones Presale Momentum Tiered price model pushes the price higher as capital pours in. Roadmap Execution Active delivery: community engagement, ecosystem partnerships (e.g., bookmaker.XYZ) Built-In Scarcity 17.13% of supply permanently burned—deflationary pressure for long-term holders Upcoming Liquidity Events Listing on major CEXes and DEXes; discussions underway with KuCoin, Binance, and OKX Community Activation Aggressive airdrops (10%) and strong social media growth are building hype and loyalty Final Verdict: Structure Wins, and $XYZ Is Proof Celebrity coins are collapsing under their own hype. Today’s market demands structure, not noise — and only well-built meme coins have any shot at real returns. $XYZ is leading that shift. It’s already delivered 50x+ in presale, with a clear path to launch at $0.10, strong tokenomics, and actual utility. Forget rugs and fame-fueled flops. If you want 100x potential, structured ICOs like $XYZ are the last real play left.

Rate cuts are typically regarded as bullish for riskier assets, such as crypto, and here’s what ChatGPT thinks about the potential impact on XRP. Fed Rate Cuts to Pump XRP? The Jackson Hole speech took place on Friday as the crypto market had braced for impact with a week-long correction that drove BTC from over $118,000 to under $112,000, ETH from above $4,800 to $4,100, and XRP dumped below $2.8 to market a multi-week low. Although Powell failed to specify whether the Fed will indeed cut rates at its next FOMC meeting in September, his words were perceived as promising by investors, who poured billions of dollars into the ever-volatile, risky crypto market. BTC jumped beyond $117,000, albeit briefly, while ETH rocketed to a new all-time high of almost $4,900. Another sign that the market will now anticipate a rate reduction in September came from Polymarket as the odds for such a Fed move went from under 60% to almost 80% within hours. Consequently, CryptoPotato explored the potential effects on the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, more on which can be found here , and we have now shifted our focus to the third-biggest . We asked ChatGPT about its take on the matter, and the AI solution explained that lower rates mean that borrowing becomes cheaper and money flows more easily into risk assets, at least in theory. History shows that rate cuts have boosted stocks, gold, and cryptocurrencies, as investors seek higher returns. For XRP in particular, this could mean more speculative inflows from traders reallocating from bitcoin or even other traditional assets into well-known and established altcoins, such as the second-largest. It also explained that lower rates weaken the US dollar, which often strengthens bitcoin first but “altcoins like XRP typically follow with a lag – sometimes explosively once capital rotates.” ETF Exposure and Potential Risks With roughly ten filings made by different companies to launch their own spot XRP ETFs, Ripple’s community is frequently speculating when such financial vehicles will finally be approved in the US, following those for BTC and ETH. ChatGPT believes the right timing of potential approvals of Ripple ETFs could be massive for the underlying asset. “A lower interest rate environment makes yield-bearing Treasuries less attractive. Institutions may look harder at crypto ETFs (including pending XRP ETF filings) as a way to diversify. If an XRP ETF is approved around the same time, rate cuts could supercharge inflows.” However, the AI chatbot also outlined potential short-term risks. If rate cuts occur due to recession fears, risk appetite will initially decline, which includes bitcoin and the altcoins. As such, it warned that investors might “exit risk assets (including XRP) until confidence in economic recovery returns.” Overall, though, ChatGPT was bullish on XRP if the US Federal Reserve indeed cuts the rates. It outlined a positive medium-term path for the asset, and a highly bullish run if the ETF stars align. “ Bullish Medium-Term : Fed rate cuts are generally positive for XRP because they boost liquidity, weaken the dollar, and increase demand for alternative assets. Catalyst Combo : If rate cuts coincide with an XRP ETF approval or favorable legal clarity, XRP’s upside could accelerate toward — or beyond — its all-time high.” The post XRP and the US Fed: How Rate Cuts Could Impact Ripple’s Price (ChatGPT Breaks it Down) appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Federal Reserve|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|XRP|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-24 12:35:36

According to reports, the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) in Gurugram Zonal Office apprehended a group of youngsters when it busted the center. In the report, the Indian authorities mentioned that these scammers are responsible for cheating residents in the United States and other countries out of more than Rs. 130 crore (approximately $15 million) in the past two years. The operation was carried out at seven different centers in locations between Gurugram and New Delhi, under provisions enshrined in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002, pursuant to an ongoing probe into other illegal scam call centers. Indian authorities nab scammers posing as support technicians The suspects are accused of running illegal call centers in Noida and Gurugram, pretending to be technical support personnel to deceive their victims, the ED said in its statement. The Indian authorities added that the suspects used devious means to gain access to their victims’ bank accounts, transferring funds to multiple foreign accounts before routing them back into India. Police mentioned that the criminals have several methods of moving funds, with their operation owning more than 200 bank accounts dedicated to moving money. In addition, they move some of these funds into digital assets to conceal the trail before they are later sold via peer-to-peer transactions, with the funds subsequently deposited into Indian bank accounts in their control. Investigations have shown that the criminals were able to defraud their victims of more than $15 million from their operations between November 2022 and April 2024. During the search operations, the Indian authorities stumbled on several incriminating documents and digital records, providing crucial information on the modus operandi of the group. The authorities have confiscated the documents and other materials discovered during the search. In addition, authorities have also taken statements from key individuals involved in the crime, with an additional 30 bank accounts linked to the criminal enterprise already frozen. Eight luxury cars and numerous luxury watches were also seized from the criminals. The accused also reportedly lived in mansions in high-brow areas, which they purchased with proceeds from their illegal activities. Most of them also acquired assets worth more than Rs. 100 crore ($11.4 million). Busts were in connection to ongoing investigation The investigation into the group was initiated after an FIR was filed and registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), IOD, Delhi, under different sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Information Technology Act, 2000. The FIR mentioned that unknown accused persons, in criminal conspiracy with others, had been operating illegal scam centers in New Delhi and connected areas with the intention of defrauding their victims. The FIR mentioned that the accused persons claimed to be technology support staff, pulling off their scams between 2022 and April 2024. Cases like this have been rampant over the last few years, with residents in the United States and other countries falling prey. Sometimes, it could be via a malicious ads on the internet, where these bad actors will ask their victims to contact them to repair faulty computers remotely. Other times, it occurs via phishing links , which opens up victims to being hacked. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Bitcoin Bounce Back: Why the Crypto King Still Thrills Investors Source: tradingview Bitcoin is the first and biggest cryptocurrency. It’s like digital gold.

The coin's groundwork is strong, making it an attractive choice for those ready for the ride.

XRP Shines Bright: Altcoin Season Beckons Despite Market Dips Source: tradingview XRP is the digital currency that powers Ripple's payment network. It's designed for fast and low-cost international transfers, standing out in the crypto space. While the market has seen some downturns, XRP's past patterns show resilience and potential for growth. Like in 2021, positive cycles are forming again, making XRP look attractive. Its ability to facilitate quick cross-border transactions positions it well for future gains. With increasing adoption from financial institutions, XRP is poised to lead in this altcoin season, offering a promising outlook for investors seeking opportunities in the current market cycle. Why Cardano (ADA) Could Soar in the Next Altcoin Season Source: tradingview Cardano, known by its ticker ADA, is grabbing attention again. This blockchain platform uses a proof-of-stake system which is more energy-efficient than Bitcoin's mining method. Cardano seeks to improve scalability and sustainability for cryptocurrencies. Despite the recent market dump, this coin shows strong potential like in early 2021. Advances such as smart contracts and a strong community make it a strong contender for the next altcoin season. With its focus on research and security, many see ADA poised for growth. This could make Cardano an attractive option in today's market cycle, especially for those who believe in a bright future for altcoins. Conclusion With Bitcoin showing resilience, XRP poised for adoption-driven gains, and ADA reinforcing its long-term promise, the current market setup presents multiple opportunities. Each of these coins brings unique fundamentals and market narratives, giving investors reasons to stay alert.

The legal battle highlights rising tensions as Musk’s company expands into gaming, a domain long occupied by Xai. The conflict escalated after Musk announced in November 2024 that xAI would launch a gaming studio — prompting confusion between the two similarly named entities. The Lawsuit: Brand Confusion & Backlash The complaint, filed by Ex Populus, states that xAI has caused significant marketplace confusion, misleading users and damaging the Xai brand. According to the filing, users and developers have mistakenly associated xAI and even its chatbot Grok with the Xai blockchain. Ex Populus further claims that the Xai team has faced “significant backlash” due to public perception of Musk’s actions and reputation, stating that the damage extends beyond brand confusion and into reputational harm. Trademark Disputes & Government Intervention The lawsuit also alleges that xAI’s lawyers pressured the Xai team to abandon their trademark rights. Meanwhile, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has reportedly suspended several of xAI’s trademark applications due to the potential for confusion.

The halving of Bitcoin and the entry of ETFs, coupled with Powell’s hint of a September interest rate cut, will drive global funds to flow into digital assets. However, while most people are keeping their eyes on price increases, truly visionary investors have quietly turned to another track: the Find Mining platform – a digital asset value-added platform that is rapidly attracting “smart money”. Among the many ways to participate, Find Mining is becoming a high-frequency keyword in this round of market with its stable returns, principal protection and multi-currency support. What is Find Mining? Founded in 2018 and headquartered in London, Find Mining is a leading global renewable energy cloud mining platform regulated by the UK. With over 9.4 million registered users, it has a particularly strong presence among users in the US. It operates 135 large-scale mining farms in 175 countries and regions, primarily in Canada, Australia, and Russia. With transparency, safety, and efficiency at its core, the company is committed to promoting sustainable mining using renewable energy and currently has over $830 million in liquid assets. When “holding coins and watching” is not as good as “structural participation”: Why does Find Mining attract smart investors? Rather than trying to pinpoint the right timeframe, it’s better to build a stable, predictable, and exitable asset allocation path. More and more investors are realizing that instead of blindly chasing high prices, it’s better to establish a long-term, low-risk digital asset cash flow. Find Mining is a platform that offers a variety of yield plans. Users simply deposit supported currencies (BTC, XRP, DOGE, etc.) and select the appropriate contract to earn stable daily returns. Furthermore, upon contract expiration, all principal and earnings are fully refunded. The platform’s three major advantages precisely address the three core needs of current market users: A quasi-“stable return” mechanism in a highly volatile market A low-entry, maintenance-free way to participate in digital assets Visualize and fully control your earnings process at any time Find Mining: Not just a “computing power platform,” but also a structured entry point for digital asset participation Different from traditional cloud mining platforms, Find Mining is a “structured income platform” designed around asset security and risk management. All products are based on the following three core concepts: 1⃣ Flexible, Multi-Period Contracts Users can choose from 2-day, 6-day, 30-day, or longer contracts to meet diverse strategic needs. Profits are settled daily during the contract period, and principal is fully returned upon contract expiration. 2⃣ Principal Protection Mechanism Find Mining features an “asset protection pool” to ensure that users’ principal will be returned on time and in full upon contract expiration, regardless of market fluctuations. This offers a highly attractive safeguard for conservative investors. 3⃣ Multi-Currency Participation The platform currently supports 12 major cryptocurrencies, including BTC (Bitcoin), XRP (Ripple), and DOGE (Dogecoin). Users can flexibly configure their investment based on their personal preferences and market trends, without being tied to a single currency. How to get started quickly? First, visit the official website and register an account with one click. Select a contract plan that suits you. Deposit your preferred cryptocurrency and purchase a contract. Patiently wait for the contract to expire. Upon expiration, the principal and earnings will be automatically deposited into your account. You can withdraw or continue investing at any time. Why is now a critical window period? Currently, Bitcoin is in a post-halving upward trend, with on-chain activity and institutional investment rising simultaneously. The global macroeconomic environment (expectations of interest rate cuts and declining inflation) is creating upside potential for risky assets. At the same time, mining difficulty has yet to fully reflect price growth, meaning that the current return on digital assets may be in a “sweet spot” for the next 12 months. For Find Mining users, this presents an opportunity to participate in the new cycle with a relatively stable structure. Who is suitable for Find Mining? Find Mining’s platform logic is not for high-risk speculation, but is designed for users who “want to participate but don’t want to bear the extreme volatility.” It is particularly suitable for: Those who are optimistic about BTC and other mainstream currencies in the long term but are unwilling to hold them directly Users who want to obtain stable digital income every month and build crypto cash flow Investors or institutions who hold cryptocurrencies but wish to increase their returns through a lock-in value-added plan The platform’s daily data, revenue records, and contract progress can all be viewed in real time. Deposit and withdrawal operations are convenient, and multi-currency transfers and withdrawals are supported. Find Mining’s security and compliance performance The platform has established asset isolation mechanisms, hot and cold wallet storage strategies, and a multi-factor authentication system to ensure the security of account funds. It has also achieved preliminary compliance registration in some friendly jurisdictions and plans to expand its compliance partnerships. Unlike typical high-risk, high-volatility platforms, Find Mining does not engage in leveraged trading or promise high returns. Instead, it earns user trust through its “principal protection + transparent settlement” approach. Conclusion: The market remains turbulent, and rational choices are scarce The crypto market of 2025 is no longer a game for speculators, but is entering a new era centered on compliance, robustness, and structured investment. Find Mining uses a simple yet reliable logic to provide users with a path to participate in crypto dividends without having to chase rising and falling prices: Safe and controllable Clear benefits The principal is refundable Easy to operate If you are waiting for an opportunity to participate in cryptocurrencies that “doesn’t rely on luck but on structure to make money”, perhaps now is the most suitable time window.

Dashboard shows dominance easing near the high-50s while majors rebound, a setup analysts say often precedes broader alt runs. That’s why lists of the best altcoins to buy now keep featuring Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, and utility plays like Remittix (rtx) . Bitcoin: dominance easing, room for rotation Bitcoin is holding near the $115k area, and that keeps liquidity strong even on choppy days. Source: Tradingview At the same time, bitcoin dominance has hovered in the high-50s and has been slipping on some sessions, an early sign that money can drift from BTC into alts when risk appetite improves. Analysts also note macro tailwinds after recent Fed commentary helped spark a broad crypto bounce. If BTC stays firm while dominance cools, flows often widen to leaders like Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot, plus utility names such as Remittix. In short, a steady Bitcoin near $115k with softer dominance is the kind of backdrop that has historically supported alt rotations. Solana: speed, users, and a clean technical ladder Solana trades around $203 today with heavy daily volume, keeping it near the top of momentum screens. Price acceptance above the $200 area has bulls watching for a steady push toward prior highs if flows stay friendly. What makes Solana one of the best altcoins to buy now is the user flywheel: fast settlement, low fees, and constant builder activity. Coverage this week also tied a stronger alt appetite to a softer macro tone, which tends to boost high-beta leaders like SOL when bitcoin dominance cools. Cardano: base first, breakout second Cardano changes hands near $0.91 . Traders say the path of least resistance is higher if ADA can keep holding above recent supports and then challenge the $1 handle with real volume. Analyst notes remain patient: Cardano often lags at the start of rotations, then catches up as liquidity spreads from the top names. With bitcoin dominance easing, desks are watching whether a close over $1 can unlock a more durable trend. Polkadot: value play if momentum widens Polkadot sits near $4.15 , building a tight range that appeals to mean-reversion traders. A push above the recent band would set sights on incremental targets, especially if the market’s risk tone stays green. CMC’s analyst brief frames the consolidation between about $3.75–$4.20 as investors weigh upcoming tech milestones with the broader ETF narrative. In plain words, DOT looks like a steady pick if alt flows broaden beyond the first movers. Remittix (rtx): the payfi alt with real-world pull Remittix focuses on payouts you can actually use. You send crypto; the other person receives money in a bank account with low fees. That clear job is why Ethereum and Polkadot holders are adding a small RTX sleeve while majors grind. Confirmed venue: the first centralized exchange listing at BitMart is official. Next headline queued: the homepage banner shows “Next CEX reveal at $22M” raised. Built for real users: coverage highlights crypto-to-bank payouts across 30+ countries, useful for freelancers and small teams. On familiar rails: wallet beta scheduled September 15, 2025 with Ethereum + Solana support. Easy to size: $0.0969 per RTX today, with about 615M tokens sold per recent roundups tracking the live counter. How to lean into a weaker dominance tape When bitcoin dominance slides, leaders like Solana often move first, followed by rotation into names with clear roadmaps such as Cardano and Polkadot. For a utility kicker, remittix pairs an under-$1 entry with a confirmed exchange, dated wallet beta, and a visible path to the next listing at $22M raised. If rotation continues, that blend of liquidity, momentum, and real-world use is why these four keep topping the best altcoins to buy now lists.

Speaking at the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole gathering in Wyoming, the three central bank governors (Kazuo Ueda, Christine Lagarde, and Andrew Bailey) delivered back-to-back warnings that aging populations and low birth rates are wrecking labor markets in Japan, Europe, and the UK. According to remarks reported by the Financial Times , the problem is not looming anymore. It’s already here. Kazuo Ueda told the conference that Japan’s labor shortage is no longer just a red flag, calling it “one of the country’s most pressing” economic threats. With over 28% of Japan’s population already aged 65 or older, the country is facing a severe productivity drain. Ueda pointed out that foreign workers currently make up only 3% of the country’s labor force, but astonishingly, “they have been responsible for half of the recent rise in labor force growth.” He admitted that expanding immigration further would “surely require a broader discussion,” but didn’t deny it’s the only solution Japan has left. Lagarde links foreign workers to eurozone’s labor recovery Christine Lagarde made clear that Europe is headed for a people problem. By 2040, she said, the eurozone could lose 3.4 million working-age residents if current population trends continue. Europe’s birth rates remain historically low, while life expectancy keeps rising. That has pushed up the dependency ratio, meaning fewer people are working while more are aging out of the system. Lagarde credited foreign workers for helping stabilize the eurozone labor market post-pandemic. She explained that while older workers helped, “even more” of the recovery came from immigration. In 2022, foreign workers made up just 9% of the euro area’s labor force, but again, they drove 50% of labor force growth over the past three years. “Without this contribution,” she said , “labor market conditions could be tighter and output lower.” She didn’t mention any direct migration policy moves, but the point was clear: growth depends on foreign labor. Bailey calls UK’s workforce crisis ‘acute’ and worsening Andrew Bailey called out the UK’s problem with blunt numbers. He said that by 2040, 40% of the UK’s population will be older than the standard working age range of 16 to 64. Bailey also flagged another layer of crisis; workforce participation. He pointed to a sharp drop in the number of young people working and a significant rise in those classified as “long-term sick.” He suggested those two trends “might be intertwined.” Bailey said the Bank of England is now more focused on tracking inactivity rather than just unemployment. He said labor participation data is “harder to measure” but matters more now than ever. “Mental health,” he added, “was the most common reason” behind this new wave of workforce dropouts. He described that as “a very concerning development.” Bailey also pointed out that while more older women are staying in the workforce longer, older men are not showing the same trend. Despite rising political pushback and growing populist backlash in all three regions, the central banks made no attempt to tiptoe around the issue. Without a major increase in immigration, all three countries face shrinking labor pools, rising wages, and higher inflation. Central bankers argued that wage pressures from widespread labor shortages will make it harder to bring inflation down, regardless of interest rate levels. Each speaker focused on the same cold reality: the labor shortage is structural.

The ETF provides strong liquidity and security, storing bitcoin in cold storage with a qualified custodian, and has $1.9B in AUM. With minimal differentiation among bitcoin ETFs, low fees and high liquidity are key advantages, positioning HODL favorably versus competitors. I recommend HODL with a buy rating due to its current fee waiver, robust structure, and positive long-term outlook for bitcoin. The VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) is a strategy designed to provide investors with exposure to the performance of the price of bitcoin. The strategy directly holds bitcoin, providing investors with exposure to the cryptocurrency spot price through an exchange-traded fund wrapper. About the Fund HODL was launched on January 4, 2024, as a bitcoin spot ETF. The strategy directly holds bitcoin in order to provide investors with direct exposure to the cryptocurrency, allowing the strategy to track the spot price. HODL is indexed to the MarketVector Bitcoin Benchmark Rate [BBR]. HODL has $1.9b in assets under management [AUM] with an average of 850k shares changing hands on a daily basis, providing investors and traders with substantial liquidity with minimal spread risk, or cost-in/cost-out at 0.04%. HODL has 17mm bitcoin within the trust, equating to 283 bitcoin per 1,000 shares. The ETF sponsor has waived all fees from November 2024 through January 10, 2026, for assets upwards of $2.5b in the trust. Beyond the target assets or following the term date, HODL will charge a 20bps sponsor fee on assets under management. HODL takes a unique approach to holding bitcoin, storing the assets in cold storage with a qualified custodian. Cold storage is the act of storing bitcoin on physical hardware that is not connected to the Internet in order to ensure the security of the bitcoin. Other bitcoin ETFs that undergo this methodology of storage include CoinShare Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ). By comparison, HODL may be appealing for investors seeking bitcoin exposure as the sponsor fees are currently being waived. Net of fees, each of these strategies is expected to perform in tandem as the only assets being invested in are bitcoin. With no differentiation across strategies, the best next thing would be to target the lowest fee strategy. Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Aside from fees, a major differentiator may be assets under management and fund flows . Many of the bitcoin ETFs have remained relatively stagnant since launching at the beginning of 2024 in terms of net asset growth, while BlackRock ( IBIT ) has consistently grown above all others. Given that bitcoin ETFs may be used for liquidity in the market, ETF liquidity may be just as important as investing in a low-fee strategy. Bitcoin ETF Fund Flows From a tactical perspective, HODL is directionally correlated with the S&P 500 ( SPX ) to a certain degree. Some estimate that bitcoin has an 83% correlation to the SPX. Given the institutionalization of bitcoin, I believe that the cryptocurrency should be expected to move similarly to the broader equity index, particularly when considering the broad adoption of bitcoin ETFs across retirement portfolios. Given that bitcoin can be utilized as a liquid asset for trading & cash raises, I suspect that the security and related ETFs may continue to directionally move with the broader equity index. TradingView Interestingly enough, bitcoin faced some selling pressure following recent news of Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack not supporting an interest rate cut. Though I believe it may be far-reaching correlating the two events, the relationship between US rate policy and the price of bitcoin may suggest that bitcoin isn’t as decentralized as one may suspect given the relative pricing in relation to the US Dollar. The bitcoin strategy also exhibits some correlation to the 10-year treasury rate, suggesting that the price of bitcoin may be more tied to US rates than one may have expected. TradingView In terms of the growth trajectory for bitcoin, Bernstein analysts expect bitcoin’s rally to continue into 2026 and potentially into 2027, expecting bitcoin to run up to $200,000/BTC. Part of the optimism is in relation to the Trump administration’s general support for the market with the passage of the GENIUS Act as well as the establishment of the Federal Bitcoin Reserve. Risks Related to Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are single-asset investment strategies that hold no diversification or differentiation net of fees and liquidity. Given the popularity of the investment, bitcoin ETFs may pose an investment concentration risk in which the asset is so widely and heavily invested in that it could potentially pose certain risks if a sell-off were to occur. The establishment of a Federal Bitcoin Reserve could potentially lead to substantially more government control over the cryptocurrency and may lead to monetary policy directed at bitcoin. Though this would be a far-reaching presumption, I believe that there could be the possibility of this occurring when considering the potential for bitcoin to be bought and sold to cover the national debt level. There have been recent discussions of BitBond issuances , or bitcoin-linked Treasury bonds, to help alleviate the debt burden of the US Federal Government. The premise of these BitBonds is to guarantee a 1% annual coupon in USD with a bitcoin-linked payout at maturity. Final Thoughts HODL may be an appealing bitcoin ETF given the fee waiver through January 2026, providing investors with a bitcoin exposure without the management fee. I am recommending HODL with a buy rating.",BRRR|ARKB|HODL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-24 13:45:00

XRP and HYPE are strong candidates for future support in the program. USDe's market cap has reached nearly $12B, securing its position. Ethena Labs Launches Asset Framework for USDe Stablecoin Backing The Ethena Labs Protocol Risk Committee has unveiled a new “Acceptable Asset Framework” designed to back the USDe synthetic stablecoin. BNB has been approved as the first token under this framework. According to the committee's statement, XRP and HYPE have also met the criteria and are now candidates for future support in the near future. Delta-Neutral Strategy and Collateral Requirements for USDe Ethena uses USDe, a popular stablecoin, to ensure stability through a delta-neutral trading strategy. Collateral assets, like BNB, are used to open equivalent short positions on perpetual contracts, providing a way to manage price fluctuation risks. This approach is commonly employed by options traders to protect against shifts in the value of the underlying asset. The protocol has set specific minimum requirements for cryptocurrencies to be collateralized, including: Daily total open interest in perpetual contracts Spot and derivatives trading volumes Depth of order books in both markets ”The committee will regularly update the list of assets that meet these risk parameters. Approval doesn’t guarantee immediate usage,” clarified Ethena representatives. USDe's Rising Market Capitalization According to CoinGecko, USDe’s market capitalization is currently approaching $12 billion, positioning it as the third-largest stablecoin by market cap.

The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $114,890. Analysts had hinted that BTC could retrace following Friday’s pump, when it had surged past $116,000 to $116,908 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. VanEck Doubles Down On Bitcoin (BTC) Prediction Asset management firm VanEck has doubled down on its $180,000 prediction in its mid-August 2025 Bitcoin Chaincheck. The report was authored by Patrick Bush, senior investment analyst for digital assets, and Mathew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck. The update highlighted BTC’s rise to a new all-time high and its subsequent dip to $112,000. It also discussed the impact of the derivatives market, stating, “CME basis funding rates surged to 9%, the highest since February 2025, reflecting renewed speculative appetite. We stick with our $180K BTC price target by year-end.” VanEck analysts highlighted that BTC’s market share fell from 64% to 59.7%, losing some ground to altcoins like Ethereum (ETH). However, network fundamentals registered an improvement, with monthly transactions rising 26% to 12.9 million, the highest since November 2024. Median fees dropped 13%, indicating a decline in ordinal inscription activity. However, investors remained bullish in the derivatives market, as the call/put ratio reached 3.21X. Fed Rate Cut Chatter A Potential Red Flag The jump in social media chatter around a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September could be a warning sign for the cryptocurrency market, according to analysts from Santiment. The warning comes after the market rally on Friday following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium. Powell hinted that the first rate cut of 2025 could happen in September. Santiment stated in a report on Saturday, “Historically, such a massive spike in discussion around a single bullish narrative can indicate that euphoria is getting too high and may signal a local top. While optimism about a rate cut is fueling the market, social data suggests caution is warranted.” Powell stated during his speech that current conditions in inflation and the labor market “may warrant adjusting” the Fed’s monetary policy. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a significant rally on Friday as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole symposium speech breathed new life into the market. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency surged nearly 4%, reaching an intraday high of $117,416 before settling at $116,908. However, it was back in the red on Saturday as buyers lost momentum, dropping 1.30% to $115,383. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $114,956. BTC’s Friday rally led to several liquidations as short positions were taken out. According to data from CoinGlass, $379 million in short positions was liquidated. Ethereum accounted for $193 million of this figure, while Bitcoin made up $54 million. The crypto market registered $629 million in liquidations as prices rallied. Following BTC’s rally, MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe stated that the market uptrend was back. However, another analyst predicted the price could retrace following Friday’s uptrend, a prediction that has held so far. BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline to $116,492. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the positive start, it lost momentum and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $123,000 and settle at $123,365. Despite the positive sentiment, the price tanked on Thursday, dropping over 4% to a low of $117,208 before settling at $118,389.

Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell almost 3% and settled at $112,856. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.26% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,276.

Ethereum DBS, Singapore’s largest bank, has advanced its blockchain adoption by issuing tokenized structured notes on the Ethereum public blockchain as a part of the bank’s digital asset strategy to move beyond its own private clients, giving accredited and institutional investors broader access to sophisticated financial instruments. SharpLink Gaming has significantly boosted its Ethereum holdings with a $667 million acquisition, strengthening its position as one of the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency. DeFi PulseChain , the scalable Layer 1 blockchain solution, has garnered significant traction among developers and users seeking relief from Ethereum's constraints, primarily because of its proven ability to offer faster transactions and minimal fees. Technology Thailand has launched an 18-month pilot program that will allow international tourists to convert cryptocurrencies into the local currency, part of a broader push to revitalize its tourism sector. Business Prosecutors in Taiwan brought charges against 14 individuals in connection with the $41 million BitShine crypto fraud that allegedly defrauded over 1,500 victims of over NT$1.27 billion ($41 million). MicroStrategy has reversed recent guidance on stock issuance, signaling more flexibility in shareholder dilution while continuing to expand its Bitcoin reserves. Web3 BTCC, the world’s longest-operating cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a major $500,000 USDT trading competition , following the announcement earlier this month that NBA All-Star Jaren Jackson Jr. has joined the platform as its new global brand ambassador.

Wilder World has announced the Super Early Access launch of its first-person shooter (FPS) mode, marking a significant milestone in the project’s evolution. Regulation The European Union (EU) is accelerating efforts to introduce a digital euro , spurred by recent regulatory moves in the United States that have strengthened the position of dollar-pegged stablecoins. The US Department of Justice has clarified it will no longer pursue charges against developers for the unintended misuse of decentralized protocols, following the Tornado Cash verdict that convicted co-founder Roman Storm on a money transmission charge. The Federal Reserve has shut down its crypto-focused oversight program , which monitors crypto dealings by major banks. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller signaled strong support for digital assets, calling stablecoins a vital tool for sustaining the dollar’s international dominance. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has signaled a decisive shift in the regulator’s approach to cryptocurrencies, pledging a clear framework for digital asset oversight and distancing the agency from its earlier reliance on enforcement actions.

Coinbase hacker’s crypto purchases. Source: Arkham This follows earlier activity on July 20, when the same wallet added 649.62 ETH valued at $2.31 million at $3,561 each. The transactions suggest a strategy of diversifying into major blockchain ecosystems while moving funds through decentralized exchanges and aggregators. Coinbase hacker’s crypto purchases. Source: Arkham Coinbase’s notable security incident The purchases trace back to one of Coinbase’s notable security incidents in early 2025, when cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to access internal systems. Insights into the breach indicate that the incident exposed sensitive customer data, though not passwords or private keys, and was later exploited for fraud and extortion attempts. On May 11, the hackers demanded $20 million to keep the stolen data private. Notably, Coinbase refused, instead tightening security, terminating compromised staff, and offering a $20 million bounty for leads. The exchange also pledged to reimburse victims, with total costs expected between $180 million and $400 million. Despite the ongoing investigation, the hacker has continued to move and accumulate assets. Earlier this year, they swapped $42.5 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) into Ethereum ( ETH ) via Thorchain, even taunting investigators with on-chain messages.

Related Reading: Why August Could Be Remembered As A Major Trap For Bitcoin And Crypto Market This initiative comes on the heels of new regulatory guidance from the SEC regarding liquid staking activities. Under the administration of President Donald Trump, there has been a concerted effort to position the United States as the global leader in cryptocurrency. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent shift in approach reflects this vision, as it aims to clarify the regulatory landscape for the broader digital asset market, a significant departure under former Chair Gary Gensler. Nine Solana ETF Applications Await SEC Green Light In August of this year, a coalition of influential organizations, including Jito Labs, VanEck, Bitwise, the Solana Policy Institute, and Multicoin Capital Management, submitted a joint request to the SEC seeking approval for liquid staking in Solana ETF applications. The letter emphasized the operational advantages that liquid staking can offer for potential Solana ETF issuers, such as enhanced network security through increased staking participation, a wider array of investment options for market participants, and potential new revenue streams for ETF providers. With at least nine Solana ETF filings currently awaiting SEC approval, it’s clear that interest in this area is on the rise. Significant progress toward approval was signaled two months ago when VanEck’s first spot Solana ETF appeared on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s website under the ticker VSOL.

Analyst Gives Candid Outlook Importantly, the SEC has also signaled that, under specific conditions, activities related to liquid staking may not fall under the definition of securities as outlined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Paul S. Atkins, the newly appointed SEC Chairman, underscored the agency’s commitment to providing clear regulatory guidance for innovative financial practices. He described the staff statement on liquid staking as a crucial measure for defining which crypto asset activities lie outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. On Friday, VanEck’s new spot Solana ETF application caused SOL’s price to surge by double digits, recording a 10% increase in the 24-hour period that brought the cryptocurrency close to the $200 threshold.

Bitcoin rebounded to $124,000 on August 13 after sliding to $112,000 in early August, setting a new all-time high above July’s $123,838. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at close to $115K, 8% down from its ATH. Institutional Demand Powers Recovery Despite Volatility Compression VanEck’s latest research indicates institutional demand remains robust, with exchange-traded products purchasing 54,000 BTC and Digital Asset Treasuries adding 72,000 BTC in July alone. The firm maintains its bullish outlook established initially in November 2024, when Bitcoin traded around $88,000. Source: VanEck CME basis rates reaching 9% particularly indicate renewed speculative appetite among derivatives traders, matching levels last seen during February’s market peak. Notably, options markets also show strong bullish positioning with call/put ratios rising to 3.21x – the highest since June 2024 – as investors spent $792 million on call premiums. However, implied volatility compressed to just 32%, well below the 50% one-year average, making options cheaper for potential buyers. Source: VanEck A 25% out-of-the-money one-year call now costs approximately 6% of the spot price, compared to 18% in late 2024. Similarly, the report showed that the mining sector posted mixed results despite Bitcoin’s gains, with the 13-miner equity index declining 4% excluding Applied Digital’s 54% surge. U.S.-listed miners now command 31.5% of global Bitcoin hashrate, up from 29% earlier this year, marking a record high for American mining operations. Industry Leaders Split on Million-Dollar Bitcoin Timeline Earlier this month, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined the growing chorus of executives predicting Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 , aligning with previous forecasts from Jack Dorsey and ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood. Armstrong cited regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key drivers for the ambitious target. Similarly, SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald offered a more conservative near-term outlook, projecting Bitcoin could climb to $175,000 by year-end . Wald described her forecast as modest compared to other institutional projections, noting major investors like Cathie Wood and Larry Fink have endorsed “astronomically high” targets based on sophisticated models. While everyone is bullish, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz pushed back against near-term million-dollar predictions , warning such levels would likely reflect U.S. economic collapse rather than crypto success. Novogratz argued he would prefer lower Bitcoin prices in a stable economy over extreme valuations driven by a currency crisis. Similarly, in July, Copper’s head of research, Fadi Aboualfa, suggested Bitcoin appears “primed for another significant leg upward” but cautioned that institutional-driven markets may follow a “more tempered path” compared to previous retail-fueled cycles. "" Bitcoin appears primed for another significant leg upward,"" a top analyst tells Cryptonews #ATH #Altcoins #XRP https://t.co/fjgsked2GV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 Aboualfa projected Bitcoin could breach $140,000 in September and reach $150,000 by early October. However, seeing this growing institutionally-driven bull market, Preston Pysh of Ego Death Capital has expressed skepticism about Wall Street’s growing Bitcoin influence , noting early adopters fear institutional derivatives trading could undermine Bitcoin’s safe-haven characteristics. Pysh warned that traditional financial players might use Bitcoin differently than the self-custodying individuals who built the network. Market Dynamics Suggest Traditional Cycles Remain Intact Amid this mixed market speculation, new Glassnode analysis challenges widespread claims that institutional adoption has broken Bitcoin’s traditional four-year cycles. The analytics firm found current cycle duration and long-term holder profit-taking levels closely mirror previous patterns, contradicting “cycle death” narratives from industry figures. Glassnode data shows Bitcoin’s current cycle has maintained supply above profitable levels for 273 days, making it the second-longest duration on record behind the 2015-2018 cycle’s 335 days. Source: Glassnode Long-term holders have realized cumulative profits exceeding all previous cycles except 2016-2017. Moreover, derivatives markets continue exhibiting elevated risk appetite characteristic of mature bull phases, with Bitcoin futures open interest maintaining $67 billion levels. The recent unwinding of $2.3 billion in open interest during corrections ranks among the largest 23 trading days recorded. Ethereum’s derivatives dominance reached critical levels, with perpetual futures volume hitting an all-time high of 67% versus Bitcoin markets. However, combined altcoin liquidations peaked at $303 million daily, experiencing twice the volume compared to Bitcoin futures markets. Market analysts view Bitcoin’s recent pullback as strategic repositioning rather than fundamental weakness, with NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef noting the correction followed overextended leverage after reaching new highs above $124,000. The technical outlook hinges on Bitcoin holding psychological support between $100,000-$110,000, with structural buying interest intact above this range. A decisive break below $112,000 could trigger a deeper retracement toward $110,000 and potentially $105,000. However, recovery in risk appetite, especially as ETH and BTC reached new ATH, could reignite momentum toward previous ATH and beyond, given continued institutional demand outpacing supply.

As of August 24, 2025 , the platform Crypto 30x .com is generating significant discussion among cryptocurrency investors and traders. This analysis is for individuals exploring high-growth crypto opportunities who want to understand what Crypto 30x .com offers, the viability of achieving 30x returns, and the associated risks. The platform’s name taps into the aspirational goal of multiplying an investment thirtyfold, a powerful narrative in the digital asset market. This breakdown examines the concept of 30x growth, the potential functions of the platform, the strategies involved, and the essential risk management principles every investor must consider. What Does “30x” Mean in Cryptocurrency Investing? In investment terminology, a “30x” return means multiplying an initial investment by a factor of thirty. This financial outcome transforms a modest investment into a substantial sum. Practical Example: A $100 investment that achieves 30x growth becomes $3,000 . Historical Precedent: Such exponential gains, while rare, are not unheard of in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC): Very early investors who purchased Bitcoin for single-digit prices experienced returns far greater than 30x . Ethereum (ETH): In its initial phase, ETH was available for under $1 per coin and eventually peaked at several thousand dollars. Altcoins and Memecoins: Numerous smaller tokens, including Dogecoin and Shiba Inu , have delivered returns well beyond 30x for early adopters during bull cycles. What is Crypto 30x .com? Crypto 30x .com is a digital platform focused on providing crypto education, market analysis, and investment strategies designed to help users identify opportunities for exponential portfolio growth. The platform’s core value proposition is built around the aspirational goal of achieving 30x returns. Key services likely offered by the platform include: Crypto Market Analysis: In-depth research on emerging altcoins, new blockchain projects, and potentially undervalued “hidden gems” that are not yet on the mainstream radar. Actionable Trading Strategies: Guidance on various trading methods, including spot trading, futures trading, and techniques for leveraging Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols for yield generation. Educational Resources: A library of content aimed at helping beginner investors understand market fundamentals while offering advanced traders tools to refine their skills. Community Building: A potential network or forum where investors can share market insights, discuss trends, and collaborate on identifying new opportunities. What Strategies Could Lead to 30x Returns? Achieving a 30x return typically requires a combination of strategic foresight, timing, and risk tolerance. Platforms like Crypto 30x .com would likely focus on the following high-growth strategies: Early-Stage Investing: Participating in project presales, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) , or Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) before a token is widely available on major exchanges. Identifying Undervalued Altcoins: Researching and investing in low-market-cap cryptocurrencies that have strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and significant growth potential. DeFi and Yield Farming: Utilizing decentralized finance protocols to earn high annual percentage yields (APYs) through staking, liquidity provision, or lending crypto assets. NFTs and GameFi: Investing in promising projects within the non-fungible token (NFT) and blockchain-based gaming sectors, which have historically produced exponential returns. Long-Term Holding (HODLing): A disciplined strategy of buying and holding high-quality digital assets through volatile market cycles with the expectation of significant long-term appreciation. What Are the Risks of Targeting 30x Crypto Gains? The pursuit of high returns is inherently linked to high risk. Investors must understand and manage these dangers effectively. High Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for extreme price swings. A token that appears poised for a major rally could instead be a “bull trap,” leading to significant losses. Fraud and Rug Pulls: The crypto space contains malicious actors who create pump-and-dump schemes or “rug pulls,” where developers abandon a project after investors have provided capital, causing the token’s value to crash to zero. Regulatory Uncertainty: Abrupt changes in government regulations or outright bans in key markets can instantly erode the value of a cryptocurrency project. Emotional Trading: Chasing exponential gains can lead to poor decision-making driven by the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) , causing investors to buy at market peaks or panic-sell at market bottoms. How to Safely Approach High-Growth Crypto Platforms To navigate platforms like Crypto 30x .com and the broader crypto market safely, investors should adhere to several fundamental rules. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely on a single source of information. Independently verify all claims, analyze the project’s whitepaper, and assess the development team’s credibility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid concentrating all your funds into a single cryptocurrency or strategy. Spreading investments across different assets helps mitigate risk. Invest Only Risk Capital: Only allocate funds that you can afford to lose completely without impacting your financial stability. Stay Informed on Market Trends: The digital asset landscape evolves rapidly. Continuous learning is essential to distinguish between legitimate opportunities and speculative hype. Be Skeptical of Guarantees: Any platform or project that guarantees extraordinary returns is a significant red flag. In investing, high potential reward always comes with high risk. Conclusion: A Strategic Approach to High-Growth Opportunities Crypto 30x .com embodies the high-risk, high-reward spirit of the cryptocurrency market. The promise of 30x returns is a powerful motivator, but investors must recognize that such outcomes are exceptional and never guaranteed. Successfully navigating this landscape requires a strategic mindset that balances the pursuit of opportunity with disciplined risk management. Ultimately, the strategic significance of platforms like Crypto 30x .com lies in their potential to serve as a resource for education and market analysis. For investors, the most critical action is to use these tools to inform their own research, not to replace it. Making timely, well-researched decisions remains the cornerstone of success in the volatile and complex world of digital assets.

The post was presented as breaking news and underscored the significance of both assets being specifically mentioned in an official central bank document. Xaif highlighted this reference as noteworthy because it placed XRP and Bitcoin together in the context of possible future roles as payment instruments outside of traditional banking structures. BREAKING: The Central Bank of Malaysia just named #XRP alongside #Bitcoin as a potential replacement for cash & bank deposits! pic.twitter.com/fJLBBuaiGb — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 23, 2025 Details from the Attached Document The image accompanying the tweet features an excerpt from a Bank Negara Malaysia document, which contains a diagram titled “Illustration of Public and Private Monies.” The diagram categorizes public money, such as central bank reserves, currency, and potential central bank digital currencies, alongside private money, which includes bank deposits and other institutional deposits. It further links these to monetary aggregates such as M1, M2, and M3, while illustrating debtor-creditor relationships between the central bank, banks, non-banks, and other institutions. The document also mentions Project Mawar, a proof-of-concept initiative through which the bank is currently exploring the potential use cases of central bank digital currency. Beneath the diagram, a passage directly addresses the emergence of new private digital assets. These are described as decentralized tokens or cryptocurrencies that could serve as alternatives to current monetary and payment instruments. In this context, the document explicitly names Bitcoin and XRP , stating that such private tokens may in the future be widely used as a means of payment outside the banking system. It adds that they could replace cash in circulation or bank deposits if adopted at scale. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Importance of XRP and Bitcoin Reference Xaif’s tweet draws attention to the fact that the Malaysian central bank explicitly lists XRP and Bitcoin in this context. The mention places both assets in the same category of potential alternatives to traditional money. By highlighting this, Xaif interprets the document as recognition of their possible future role in payments and settlement, separate from the framework of central bank-issued or bank-issued money. The inclusion of XRP, in particular, underscores its ongoing relevance in institutional and regulatory discussions about digital assets. Broader Context and Limitations While the document names XRP and Bitcoin as possible replacements for cash and deposits, it also outlines challenges for such a scenario to materialize. It states that private decentralized tokens must overcome significant barriers to complement or substitute the current payment system. Without centralized intermediaries, these platforms would require large liquidity balances to enable efficient settlement across different cryptocurrencies. The text makes it clear that decentralization introduces obstacles that do not exist in systems managed by central banks or regulated financial institutions.

50600337,https://cryptonews.com/?p=413007,1756043795,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50600337.jpeg,"Rising Fed Rate Cut Chatter May Be Risky for Crypto, Santiment Warns",https://cryptonews.com/news/rising-fed-rate-cut-chatter-may-be-risky-for-crypto-santiment-warns/,"The optimism surrounding the potential Federal Reserve (FED) rate cut and its anticipated ability to spark a massive crypto rally has dominated market sentiment recently. However, crypto intelligence platform Santiment has cautioned that this “buy the rumor, sell the news” mentality could present significant risks for investors. During the latest edition of “ This Week in Crypto Market Analysis ,” Santiment analyst Brian highlighted how the crypto market demonstrated remarkable resilience. Social Sentiment Around Fed Rate Cut Raises Red Flags Following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks at Jackson Hole, where he suggested the possibility of rate reductions, Ethereum emerged as the standout performer, leading this market surge. Brian observed that ETH achieved a new all-time high, placing the entire crypto ecosystem on edge for what could be a historic breakout moment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues its consolidation phase, maintaining levels around $117,000 as it attempts to recapture the crucial $120,000 threshold. Although these developments suggest the market is positioned for a significant upward breakthrough, social sentiment data from Santiment indicates that caution may be necessary. Discussion around terms such as “Fed,” “rate,” and “cut” across social media platforms has reached an 11-month peak. Source: Santiment Historical patterns show that such dramatic increases in conversation around a single bullish theme often suggest euphoria levels are becoming excessive and could indicate a local market top. The analyst presented a distinctive sentiment indicator that monitors the balance between comments anticipating “higher” prices versus those expecting “lower” movements. Bitcoin’s blockchain metrics present a neutral-to-cautious outlook. Essential utility indicators , including daily active addresses and transaction volumes, have declined from previous levels. The long-term Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which gauges holder profitability, currently stands at +18.5%, placing it within a moderately risky territory for fresh long-term positions. Source: Santiment Furthermore, positive funding rates show that traders are increasingly wagering on price appreciation. Among the most troubling on-chain developments Santiment highlighted for Bitcoin is the growing supply accumulation on exchanges. Since early June, exchange-held BTC has risen by approximately 70,000 coins, a significant departure from the sustained pattern of assets moving into cold storage, potentially indicating that more holders are preparing to liquidate positions. Ethereum Shows Promise but Carries Risks While Ethereum’s price performance appears encouraging, its MVRV metrics suggest exercising caution is advisable. The short-term (30-day) MVRV is nearing +15%, a threshold recognized as a “danger zone” where altcoins frequently experience retracements. More concerning is the long-term MVRV reading of +58.5%, which substantially elevates the probability of profit-taking activities. In his concluding remarks, Brian indicated that Ethereum maintains strong prospects for surpassing its all-time high and advancing toward $5,000, particularly since widespread fear of missing out (FOMO) has not yet materialized. Nevertheless, the primary threat to market stability remains the Federal Reserve narrative. Should any developments emerge that contradict rate cut expectations, the market could experience rapid corrections. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Risks Correction to $104,000 Bitcoin’s daily chart reveals evident weakness following its failure to sustain levels above the critical resistance zone near $120,000. The analysis shows a breakdown from the ascending trendline, confirming a momentum shift, with price now retesting the broken support area that has transformed into resistance. Fibonacci retracement levels have been mapped, with the 0.382 level at $114,355 already under pressure, while deeper downside objectives around $108,200 and $103,800 become viable if selling intensifies. The rejection from the supply zone, combined with the trendline support breach, suggests Bitcoin is more likely to trend downward in the near term. Bearish targets remain on the $108,000–$104,000 range unless buyers can decisively reclaim $120,000. Ethereum Chart Analysis: $4600 Support Crucial for $5,000 Breakout Ethereum is consolidating within a wedge formation on the 4-hour timeframe following a substantial upward move, with price currently positioned near $4,740. The technical structure points to a potential short-term decline toward $4,600, which corresponds to a constructive retest zone for establishing new long positions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 63, indicating strength without reaching overbought conditions, leaving scope for additional upward momentum once the anticipated pullback concludes. If support is maintained at $4,600, subsequent targets are projected at $5,006 and $5,210, levels identified as significant resistance overhead.

Transaction-based revenue is highly cyclical, and past declines suggest future growth rates may disappoint despite recent momentum. At 25x sales, Robinhood trades at a massive premium to Schwab and Interactive Brokers, making downside likely as multiples compress. Despite product innovation and user engagement, I am downgrading HOOD to a sell, expecting valuation to revert closer to industry norms. The bubble—and the memes—are officially back. It feels like we have come full circle when we see Robinhood ( HOOD ) leading the way as one of the more popular retail stocks. The company indeed has done an incredible job of sustaining rapid growth rates and capitalizing on a booming bull market. The stock’s valuation indicates that investors expect the good times to continue, but I expect cyclicality to negatively impact growth rates in a big way. With the stock trading at an unjustifiably large premium to peers, I am downgrading the stock to a sell rating. HOOD Stock Price I last covered HOOD in June , where I downgraded the stock due to valuation. The stock has soared 40% since then. Data by YCharts I view the current market as being one in which “the fear of missing out” runs rampant. This rally upwards is cause for another downgrade. HOOD Stock Key Metrics HOOD is a popular brokerage firm largely catering to retail investors. The company briefly saw a reputational hit from the initial meme stock craze but appears to have since revitalized its image through product innovations, promotions, and perhaps the gift of time. HOOD has seen rapid growth in its premium Gold membership and appears to be benefiting from a more engaged user base. 2025 Q2 Presentation The company saw net revenues jump 45% YoY in the second quarter to $989 million, powered mainly by continued growth in transaction-based revenues. It is worth noting that HOOD had seen a near-term transaction revenue peak at $451 million in the second quarter of 2021. If you wondered if we will ever get back to the mania of 2021, there’s no use wondering any longer. Of course not all of the gains are strictly cyclical, and many may be due to a larger user base and more products, but one mustn’t forget the inherent cyclicality in transaction-based revenues—the company had seen transaction-based revenues decline viciously in 2022 with a slow recovery into 2023. 2025 Q2 Presentation HOOD has also seen profitability shift into hyperdrive, with adjusted EBITDA jumping 82% YoY to a 56% margin. 2025 Q2 Presentation HOOD ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash versus no corporate debt. Their cash balance has been steadily declining in recent quarters due in large part to both their share repurchase program as well as M&A. 2025 Q2 Presentation Regarding that first point, the company repurchased $124 million of stock in the quarter, bringing their trailing twelve-month total to $700 million. 2025 Q2 Presentation On the conference call , management discussed their controversial stock tokens, which made a big splash in Europe in early summer . Management stated that they believe that these tokens are “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade” with the potential to do “for stocks, what stablecoins did for fiat currencies.” Management noted continued optimism for growing their famous gold card while also hinting at a private banking product in the future, which has already been released internally. Is HOOD Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold? HOOD might seem buyable here as the torrid growth may appear to offset the lofty valuation. The stock recently traded hands at an incredible 23x sales. For reference, Charles Schwab ( SCHW ) recently traded hands at around 8x sales. Interactive Brokers ( IBKR ) traded hands even lower at around 5x sales. Seeking Alpha Here’s the problem: the company has been posting very strong growth for quite some time and is well past due to meeting the headwinds from tough comparables. Seeking Alpha Some might think that consensus estimates for 19% growth in 2026 look too conservative, as they might think that growth can even continue to accelerate. I think differently: that projected growth rate might even prove too optimistic, as headwinds from tough comparables might simply be too much to overcome. I again point to the potential cyclicality in transaction-based revenues as being another headwind. Even if HOOD hits consensus estimates for the next 2 years, it still would be trading at around a 140% premium to SCHW (but for the latter based on 2025 numbers). In this case, HOOD’s appeal might end up working against it, as the brokerage was formerly known as being one of the few to have commission-free trades. The brokerage industry has long been working towards reducing expenses and fees for customers and instead focusing on increasing assets on the platform. If you’d allow my digression, I view HOOD as being similar to what iRobot ( IRBT ) and its Roombas are to the robotic vacuum industry. Sure, they tend to come first with product ideas and innovations, but those measures tend to be easily and quickly replicated by competition over time. Perhaps one might point to popularity as being a sustainable advantage, but even then I doubt that it will help the company to exceed the double-digit growth rate projected for SCHW for long enough to justify the rich premium. Over time, I expect HOOD to see its premium compress all the way down to SCHW levels, implying considerable downside even as the company continues growing rapidly over the coming years. HOOD Stock Conclusion HOOD has proven the doubters wrong as it has made a splashy return to explosive top-line growth and GAAP profitability. The company appears to be establishing itself as a leading brokerage firm for years to come. But with the stock trading at such an aggressive valuation, I expect the stock to come under great pressure as it inevitably falls to trade in-line with peers. In spite of the strong fundamental momentum, I am downgrading the stock to a sell rating.",HOOD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-24 14:47:12

While Ethereum and Solana remain central to institutional portfolios, a new name is now capturing attention. Analysts are projecting MAGACOIN FINANCE to deliver up to substantial returns, and its presale momentum has made it one of the most talked-about tokens heading into the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGACOIN) — Forecasted 44x ROI Investors scanning the top altcoins for long-term positioning keep coming back to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is increasingly being ranked alongside Ethereum and Solana as a 2025 standout. With forecasts calling for a 44x move, it is drawing the strongest inflows among current crypto presales and establishing itself as the year’s leading altcoin opportunity. Momentum around MAGACOIN FINANCE has accelerated as traders shift capital from established names into higher-upside plays. The presale has already generated significant attention across retail and whale communities, signaling broad conviction in its growth potential. Analysts emphasize that what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is not just early hype, but the level of sustained engagement around the project. Its rise is being compared to the breakout trajectories of past cycle winners, where community momentum and early positioning proved decisive. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a chance to capture exponential returns in a way that established assets can no longer offer. That is why it continues to lead discussions of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 . Solana (SOL) — ETF Momentum and Ecosystem Growth Solana remains a top pick among institutional investors after the launch of a dedicated ETF in mid-2025. The network processes over 65 million transactions daily with near-zero fees, making it one of the most efficient blockchains at scale. Developer activity has continued to expand, with DeFi and gaming leading adoption. More than $9 billion in value is now locked in Solana’s ecosystem, underscoring its staying power. Analysts see Solana as a growth-focused asset for those seeking scalability and ecosystem depth, even if it does not promise the same multiples as smaller presale tokens. Ethereum (ETH) — The Smart Contract Foundation Ethereum continues to anchor the market as the dominant smart contract platform. The recent “Pectra” upgrade reduced fees and improved throughput, strengthening its appeal for both DeFi and enterprise adoption. Institutional demand has also grown, with spot ETH ETFs fueling billions in inflows this year. Price forecasts for Ethereum range from $5,000 to $7,000 by late 2025, reflecting steady growth potential. While Ethereum is unlikely to match the explosive upside of emerging tokens, it remains the most reliable long-term holding for investors seeking stability in volatile markets. Conclusion — MAGACOIN FINANCE Takes the Lead Ethereum and Solana continue to offer strong foundations for portfolio growth in 2025. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading the conversation, with forecasted returns of up to 44x and presale momentum that rivals some of the most successful altcoin launches of past cycles. For investors positioning ahead of the next rally, it has become the clear high-upside bet to watch.

Its market capitalization stands at $7.73 billion, and its daily trading volume also dropped to $346.06 million, down by 34.24%. In this slowdown, investors seek alternative opportunities elsewhere, such as Remittix (RTX), which is traded at $0.0969 per token. Over $21 million raised and its maiden CEX listing in the pipeline, Remittix sets its sights on its Q3 beta wallet launch, with a utility-focused route to crypto adoption. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Flatlines Shiba Inu price prediction flatlines according to prevailing trading trends, as the euphoria around the market subsides and investors consider their options. SHIB's slight price gains are part of a larger trend where speculative altcoins fail to sustain gains. This has come together with a growing interest in utility-based projects like Remittix. Contrasting meme coins, Remittix is a low-gas fee cross-chain DeFi project that enables instant real-world transactions. Investors seeking crypto with genuine utility and early-stage crypto investment opportunities are turning more to projects offering tangible adoption and measurable results. Remittix Presale Surpasses $20 Million, Prepares For Wallet Launch Remittix recently hit a milestone, raising well over $21 million in its presale, with well over 617 million tokens sold for $0.0969 per token.Its first CEX listing on BitMart was made possible by this milestone, increasing access and liquidity for early backers. In Q3 2025, a beta wallet that makes cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions simple will be launched. Important features are: ● $250,000 Remittix Giveaway luring early adopters● Live FX conversion with open rates● Instant crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries● Audited by CertiK for the highest level of security This release makes Remittix one of the low gas fee crypto projects with cross-border use case, positioning it ahead of speculative meme coins such as SHIB. Inside the Rise of Remittix With stagnation expected by Shiba Inu price prediction, investors are eyeing the next big altcoin 2025 opportunities. Remittix offers real-world solutions for global payments, with deflationary tokenomics and early-access benefits. The Strategic Edge Driving Remittix Adoption: ● Utility-driven token with real transaction volume● Mobile-first beta wallet to enable smooth crypto-to-fiat transactions● Designed for freelancers, remitters, and international workers● Positioned as high-growth cross-chain cryptocurrency and DeFi solution With these foundations, Remittix will appeal to those seeking top crypto presale 2025 prospects and crypto that tackles real-world problems, moving beyond speculation.

The recent golden cross, where the 50-day moving average moves above the 200-day, combined with a breakout from a bullish wedge, signals that buyers may be regaining control. Analysts are watching the $0.85–$0.90 zone closely, as holding this level could increase ADA’s chances of reclaiming $1.00 and potentially climbing toward $2.00. However, despite this positive momentum, many investors are turning away from Cardano, seeking real utility and high-growth opportunities in tokens like Remittix . Cardano Consolidates Ahead of Key Resistance ADA’s price remains inside a symmetrical triangle, with rising support holding buyers, while sellers defend the ceiling near $0.98. Trading volume has tapered, hinting that a breakout decision is imminent. Technical experts observe that a spot clearance above the $0.98 level can pave way to the $1.05-1.10 levels. The on-chain activity and futures positioning continue to point to the bullish situation, with the open interest sitting above the $1.0B mark and the combined spot volume on the major exchanges reaching the level of the $1.7B mark. Remittix Captures Investor Attention as Cardano Faces Resistance At the current price of $0.0969, Remittix has already sold more than 617 million tokens and raised 21 million, which is a record in its development. In contrast to most speculative altcoins, Remittix is a cross-border payments solution and PayFi system, which appeals to investors interested in a practical and scalable blockchain use case. What Makes Remittix Stand Out ● Global Payment Utility: Enables fast, cross-border crypto-to-bank transfers● Wallet Beta Launch: Scheduled for September 15, providing early access to key features● CEX Exposure: BitMart listing confirmed, with a second exchange set for $22M raise● Real Adoption: Supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies at launch● Community Momentum: Rapid growth with active investors accumulating RTX This combination of utility, infrastructure, and growing community has positioned Remittix as the altcoin of choice for investors who are seeking long-term upside beyond the volatility seen in Cardano and other top-tier altcoins. Investor Shift Highlights Market Trends As Cardano consolidates near its $1 resistance, capital is increasingly flowing into Remittix. This shift demonstrates a broader trend of moving from technical opportunities toward real-world utility assets. With its upcoming exchange listings and functional wallet features, Remittix is attracting investors looking for sustainable growth rather than short-term speculation. The momentum surrounding Remittix suggests it may well emerge as one of the top 100x potential altcoins in 2025, especially as traders search for projects that combine practical use cases with a growing community of active participants.

Pepe (PEPE) is forming a symmetrical triangle, hinting at a breakout toward $0.00001800-$0.00002000. Both tokens show strong accumulation, with SHIB's burn activity and PEPE's liquidity boosting rally expectations. Calm Before the Storm? SHIB Targets $0.00003296, PEPE Eyes $0.00002000 Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) are capturing the spotlight again, with analysts pointing to tightening consolidation patterns that often precede explosive breakouts. Investors who have been waiting through weeks of sideways trading are now asking whether these popular meme coins are preparing for their next big move. Market data and technical setups suggest that both tokens are at critical levels where accumulation zones and chart structures could trigger sharp rallies. Shiba Inu’s Accumulation Heating Up According to Bitcoinsensus , SHIB remains locked inside a defined accumulation range, with strong support between $0.00001000 and $0.00001250. Historically, Shiba Inu has demonstrated a tendency to rally sharply after prolonged consolidation phases. Analysts highlight that the first major resistance sits near $0.00003296, marking Take Profit 1 (TP1). A successful breakout at this level could extend momentum toward $0.00005589, aligned with Take Profit 2 (TP2). Recent trading has reflected renewed interest in the token. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001316, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours and nearly 2%. With a market cap of $7.78 billion and a circulating supply of over 584 trillion SHIB, the token shows resilience in maintaining its long-term support zones. Furthermore, burn activity remains active, with more than 79,000 tokens destroyed in the past 24 hours. This consistent reduction of supply, though small relative to the massive circulation, adds an incremental bullish factor for long-term holders. Pepe’s Symmetrical Triangle Points to a Breakout Meanwhile, Pepe (PEPE) is also giving indications of an impending rally. CryptoJack notes that PEPE/USDT is contracting within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, and the price is moving smaller and smaller between the $0.00001000 support and the $0.00001450 resistance. The pattern tends to precede breakouts, and any momentum could drive PEPE to a range of $0.00001800-$0.00002000 in case of resistance breakdown. AltCryptoGems further points out that PEPE has supported a broad trading range since March, between $0.00000070 and $0.00000170. Now consolidating around the middle of the range at $0.00000110, the token is squashing down into a flag pattern. The way this flag resolves will potentially determine the future of the token in its next few weeks, whether it will test the price range highs or risk falling back to the lows. According to data on Coingecko, PEPE is trading at $0.00001128, with a daily gain of 10.91% and weekly growth of 4.51%. Its $4.76 billion market cap and daily trading volume above $1.45 billion underscore substantial liquidity that is driving speculation.",News|Memecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-24 14:59:24

Of those names that come to mind is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . MUTM is currently in stage 6 presale at $0.035 after a growth of 16.17% in the previous stage. Early investors are prepared for over 300% returns when it lists. Mutuum Finance presale has already passed over $14.8 million and has been bought by over 15600 holders. While established players continue to weather market downturns, attention gravitates more and more toward ascendant platforms like MUTM that could redefine the future of the next generation of blockchain adoption. Ethereum Inches Near $4,225 Amid Market Flux Even as sentiment is wavering and recording small daily declines, Ethereum (ETH) is at around $4,225, showing resilience at key technical levels as investors weigh broader macroeconomic signals like Fed comments and ETF updates. The trading activity reflects a hedging but receptive tone: whales are strategically adding up, while levered positions aim for reversals in the $4,300-$4,360 area.

A renowned figure in computer science, Herlihy is widely recognized as one of the leading authorities in distributed systems, the very field that powers blockchain’s scalability and security. His position as Blockchain Advisor provides BlockDAG with more than credibility, it integrates decades of research with practical deployment, reinforcing its vision of building a durable and scalable Layer 1 network. Academic Foundations that Shaped a Career Herlihy’s academic journey highlights why his input carries weight. He earned his A.B. in Mathematics at Harvard University, then completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT. From there, his career included teaching at Carnegie Mellon University and research at the DEC Cambridge Research Lab, where he advanced pioneering concepts in distributed computing. For a blockchain network reliant on decentralized coordination, this knowledge is essential. It ensures that BlockDAG’s design is tested not only by developers but also by a scholar whose work has defined distributed computing itself. Recognition That Validates His Authority The influence of Herlihy’s work is reflected in the awards he has received over decades: 2003 Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing 2004 Gödel Prize in Theoretical Computer Science 2008 ISCA Influential Paper Award 2012 Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize (second award) 2013 Wallace McDowell Award These are not honorary distinctions. They represent global acknowledgment of his contributions to efficiency, reliability, and fault tolerance in distributed systems, principles that lie at the core of blockchain’s long-term success. How BlockDAG Gains From His Expertise BlockDAG is aiming to become a next-generation Layer 1 platform by integrating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures with Proof-of-Work, offering both scalability and security. Herlihy’s research directly aligns with this mission. His work on consensus mechanisms, fault tolerance, and distributed coordination ensures that BlockDAG’s architecture is not just ambitious but theoretically sound. At a time when many blockchain projects struggle with untested scaling methods, Herlihy’s advisory role signals confidence for participants. It shows that decisions are not being made for short-term hype but rooted in tested academic insight. Beyond the technical side, his perspective also strengthens BlockDAG’s approach to governance and consensus protocols. As ecosystems expand, challenges like fairness, user trust, and resistance to exploitation grow more critical. With Herlihy’s influence, BlockDAG can design governance structures built for resilience and sustainable adoption. This guidance matters even more as BlockDAG pushes toward its $600M presale target, with $381M already secured and Batch 29 priced at $0.0276. Both institutions and retail participants view the involvement of someone like Herlihy as evidence that BlockDAG is building on solid intellectual and structural foundations. Where Academic Insight Meets Market Strategy Herlihy’s involvement highlights what makes BlockDAG distinctive in a crowded Layer 1 field. While some projects lean on celebrity promotions or rapid exchange listings, BlockDAG is relying on one of the most respected voices in distributed computing. This signals a long-term commitment, a plan to design a blockchain that can scale, adapt, and withstand market cycles.

According to data from CoinGecko, ETH climbed as high as $4,837, just a touch below its 2021 peak of $4,878. The surge came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, where he hinted that long-awaited rate cuts might be coming soon. Interestingly, Ethereum is not only performing well against the dollar but also against Bitcoin, where technical analysis shows a long-awaited structural trendline appears to be breaking in Ethereum’s favor. Related Reading: Crypto Strategist Sounds The Alarm: Bitcoin Surge Could Clash With Fed Reserve Goals Analyst Calls Out ETH/BTC Breakout According to a recent technical analysis, which was first revealed on the social media platform X by crypto analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum is about to go on a massive performance against Bitcoin. Ted Pillows noted that the ETH/BTC breakout has finally happened after nearly eight years of repeated resistance rejections. The analysis, which is based on the 2-week (2W) timeframe of the ETH/BTC pair, shows Ethereum’s price action breaking decisively above a long-term descending trendline that has held since 2017. At the time of the analysis, the ETH/BTC pair was trading around 0.04077 after a 7% price gain for Ethereum. Interestingly, the chart shows how the ETH/BTC pair has been trying multiple times to break above this descending trendline with no success. The latest attempt, which has seen it approach the trendline again, kicked off in July 2025, and has been playing out for the past few weeks. The most recent 2-week candlestick has now seen the ETH/BTC peeking above the trendline. Chart Image From X: Ted Pillows However, Pillows tempered his optimism with a caveat: “I just want a 2W confirmation above this level, and you’ll be surprised to see the Ethereum rally,” he said. This means confirmation is important in order for Ethereum to continue outperforming Bitcoin. The breakout will be validated once the 2-week candle closes above resistance, and this might then turn the former downtrend into a base of support on the ETH/BTC pair. $5,400 Bull Flag Target Another analyst, Titan of Crypto, noted a bullish setup on the shorter-term 4-hour ETH/USD chart. Technical analysis of the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows Ethereum is currently breaking out of a well-defined bull flag formation, which is a continuation pattern that typically appears in the middle of a trend. The breakout, already underway, kicked off when Ethereum broke above $4,200 in August. The analyst predicted a price target around $5,400 to $5,477, which means Ethereum could not only retest but also break above its all-time high and enter into new price territories above $5,000.

Solana still trades heavy volume, yet many desks say its strongest bursts have lined up with memecoin seasons. At the same time, remittix (RTX) keeps gaining traction because it solves a clear payments job and has near-term milestones investors can track. Solana: great tech, meme-driven bursts Solana is around $200–$202 today, with double-digit daily billions in turnover and a market cap north of $100B. Liquidity is not the issue. Source: Tradingview Analysts argue a big slice of 2025’s upside came from memecoin trading on Solana rails. Some tied SOL pullbacks to waning memecoin activity, while Bloomberg’s coverage of Pump.funshowed how meme launches have dominated volumes and attention. Even recent features highlight new Solana launchpads built to feed price-chasing microcaps. The takeaway: when meme flow is hot, SOL strength often follows; when it cools, price momentum fades. That doesn’t mean solana lacks fundamentals—throughput and fees remain strong—but near-term tape has felt hostage to meme cycles. Some traders now want confirmation above key round numbers before calling the next leg, while others rotate part of their stack into names with tangible utility and upcoming catalysts. Remittix (RTX): payments first, charts second Remittix is a PayFi network on Ethereum built for everyday payouts. You send crypto; the recipient gets money in a bank account with low fees. That simple promise is pulling in users that speculation alone can’t keep. The first centralized exchange is confirmed at BitMart , the wallet beta is scheduled for September 15, 2025 with Ethereum + Solana support, and the official site shows a clear next milestone: “Next CEX reveal at $22M.” Price and traction are easy to see on the live panel, at $0.0969 per RTX, with ~617M tokens sold so far. That gives traders a clean entry under a dollar and visible demand ahead of broader venue access. Coverage also notes the cross-border angle—crypto-to-fiat payouts across 30+ countries—which is why some desks rank RTX above meme-led bets for 2025. Why investors are rotating to RTX while solana chops ● Real use case: crypto-to-bank payouts for freelancers, remote teams, and small businesses. ● Exchange access: BitMart listing confirmed, so price discovery won’t rely only on DEX depth.● Multi-chain rails: beta ships with ETH + SOL support, matching where users already hold assets.● Trackable next step: on-site banner shows next CEX reveal at $22M raised. What likely leads into year-end If memecoin flow heats up again, solana can run—history says so. But for steadier conviction, more traders prefer a utility name with near-term headlines. Remittix pairs an under-$1 entry and growing holder base with a confirmed BitMart listing, a dated wallet beta, and a public path to its next listing. In a market learning to reward real-world problems, that mix is why RTX keeps climbing top-gainer boards while meme-led bursts on solana come and go.

The chart, published on August 23, 2025, emphasizes price structure rather than speculation, showing the areas where XRP has consistently encountered buying and selling pressure. At the time of the snapshot, XRP was trading at approximately $3.05, positioned around the middle of the depicted range. $XRP is in the middle of a rebound to $3.60! pic.twitter.com/OhOLwmoWkd — Ali (@ali_charts) August 23, 2025 Key Levels on the Chart Ali’s chart identifies a range spanning from a lower support zone near $2.76 to an upper resistance area around $3.65 to $3.70. These levels are marked with arrows, highlighting previous reaction points where XRP has reversed direction. Within this broader range, Ali also points to important intermediate zones. A central pivot is drawn around $3.10 to $3.15, where the price has repeatedly consolidated or reversed. Additional guide levels appear around $2.98 below and $3.35 above, both of which have served as checkpoints during past moves. Together, these levels provide a structured roadmap of how XRP has traded over recent weeks, showing a recurring pattern of rotation between the boundaries. Implications of the Levels By presenting the chart in this format, Ali provides a clear framework for how XRP’s next moves may develop. A confirmed break above the mid-range pivot would shift focus to the $3.35 level, and if momentum continues, toward the upper boundary around $3.65 to $3.70. On the other hand, if XRP fails to hold above the mid-range and slips back under $2.98, attention would likely turn back to the $2.76 support.

In this backdrop, Shiba Inu Price Prediction debates now sit beside a harder question: do you chase a meme rally, or front-run an early-stage crypto investment with real users? Here are all the talking points and why Remittix is popping up in all of them. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can SHIB Break Its Ceiling Or Stall Again? The Shiba Inu Price Prediction base case points to range trading until a clean break of near-term resistance. On-chain metrics indicate that Shiba Inu is accumulating a lot of strength, and the Alpha Price indicator shows that the currency can surge by more than 125%. This is an indication that Shiba Inu may be on its way to the next big rise in prices as traders and investors watch increasing positive indications amidst volatility in the market. Analysts note that their bullish Shiba Inu Price Prediction hinges on volume expanding above recent highs and Shibarium usage growing faster than fees. A cautious Shiba Inu Price Prediction keeps targets modest unless the market broadens. Bottom line: this Shiba Inu Price Prediction still depends on heavy liquidity hitting centralized exchanges, not just headlines. Remittix (RTX): The Payments Rail Stealing Attention From SHIB Investors comparing narratives are noticing how a live payments stack can outshine a meme rally. RTX is building bank-grade, crypto-to-fiat rails that speak to real users, remitters, freelancers, and merchants, making it a credible next big altcoin in 2025 candidate and a standout top crypto under $1. With the Q3 wallet reveal and launch locked in, plus a confirmed BitMart listing, this isn’t theory; it’s go-to-market. Why Analysts Rate RTX Beyond Hype Global Reach: Send crypto straight to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real-time FX conversion: Transparent rates for predictable transfers Business API: Plug-in rails for companies to accept and settle crypto Security First: CertiK-audited contracts for institution-grade confidence Community traction plus product milestones is why analysts frame Remittix as the best long-term play compared to meme-driven bursts. The Clock Is Ticking: $250,000 Community Push + Next Listing RTX’s community drive has already pulled in over 25,000 holders and 290,000 entries to its $250,000 giveaway serious reach for a payments coin with a product about to ship. Funding has sailed past $21 Million, BitMart is locked as the first listing, and the team has flagged the next centralized exchanges announcement at the $22 Million mark. Here’s the play: if you’re scanning for high-growth crypto with near-term catalysts, the combo of a Q3 wallet launch and a second exchange reveal is a rare setup. Get in now.

Shiba Inu DAO approved the upgrade through community voting. Upgrade welcomed by the community as a trust-restoring move. Shiba Inu Unveils LEASH v2 to Resolve Supply Concerns The Shiba Inu developers have officially announced LEASH v2. The redesigned token aims at resolving a significant supply increase controversy that shook community confidence. The new token implementation focuses on enhanced security measures and transparent governance practices under the oversight of the Shiba Inu DAO. The developments come after the original LEASH token experienced an unexpected 10% supply surge, creating widespread concern among holders and community members. This upgrade focuses on providing a more secure and auditable design. Kaal Dhairya, the lead developer for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, was a key player in the technical development of LEASH v2. The project received crucial support from the Shiba Inu DAO, which voted to approve the migration process through established community governance channels. The chosen migration decision reflects the project's preference for decentralized decision-making. Community members were actively involved in the discussion of governance within the DAO , leading to its conclusive decision on the token upgrade. Enhanced Security and Governance Framework LEASH v2 has enhancements both in token architecture and security protocols. The new design has more in-depth audit controls that can prevent unauthorized changes in supply. These actions address the root causes that led to the original controversy. The token's supply will remain frozen at a pre-rebase snapshot, providing stability and predictability for holders. This strategy will wipe out the technical weaknesses under which the earlier supply growth was developed. The Shiba Inu DAO now maintains direct oversight of the LEASH v2 contract. This governance framework allows that in the future, any changes will require the community's consent, which is to be obtained through an established voting mechanism. Security audits have been conducted by independent developers within the community. These reviews endorse the contract's integrity and assure that proper safeguards are in place. Community Response According to the announcement, the upgrade affects only the LEASH token within the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem. Other tokens, including SHIB and BONE , continue to operate under their existing parameters without any changes. The launch has received a positive reception from community members who appreciate the transparent approach to resolving the controversy. Many holders view the upgrade as necessary to rebuild trust and confidence. The LEASH v2 launch establishes important precedents for how decentralized projects can address technical controversies. The governance model employed may influence similar projects facing comparable challenges.",News|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-24 15:10:29

Right from its early days, when BTC traded at about 11 cents per coin, many people and institutions have written Bitcoin off, declaring it as “dead.” Peter Schiff, Warren Buffett Among Bitcoin’s Harshest Critics According to ‘Bitcoin is Dead’ data , the crypto asset has been declared dead 431 times. In 2010, when it was going for around 11 cents, the Underground Economist labeled Bitcoin a dead asset that was only still in existence due to its newness. Despite recording gains as the years progressed, BTC has continued to attract naysayers who critiqued its performance. These include Peter Schiff , the gold advocate, Warren Buffett, a prolific investor, and Nouriel Roubini, the economist. Notably, Schiff has pronounced Bitcoin dead 18 different times, but the asset is still thriving. In his latest attack on BTC, Schiff stated that Bitcoin was a product of the financial crisis in 2008, and it will be killed by the 2025 financial crisis. Schiff ranks as Bitcoin’s greatest critic. Bitcoin Faces Intense Scrutiny Since 2010 Buffett once described Bitcoin as a “gambling token” that lacks any value. Although he has been less vocal in recent years, Buffet has also declared Bitcoin a dead asset. In 2023, the investor called for the death of BTC. Other critics even predicted a huge crash for Bitcoin, noting that it is more likely to plunge to around $100 than rise to $100,000. This group of critics considers the digital asset as a mere volatile asset that depletes energy and is used by criminals to move funds. They have conveniently ignored that the asset is gaining traction among institutional players and its use in daily payment transactions . BTC’s Resilience Defies Repeated Death Predictions In spite of the different doomsday predictions trailing the flagship crypto asset, the coin remains resilient with a market capitalization of over $2.27 trillion. The asset recently hit an all-time high (ATH) of $124,457.12 on August 13. As of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $114,376.97, representing a 0.44% decline in the last 24 hours. The asset’s downward movement is a result of broader crypto market volatility. Its trading volume has also recorded a steep decline by 32.58% at $51.57 billion.

But while decentralized exchanges have successfully captured a significant slice of spot volume from CEXs, futures trading has been slower to migrate due to technical challenges – but in 2025 that’s finally begun to change. Perpetual futures – contracts without expiration dates that allow traders to speculate on assets like BTC with leverage – have long been the crown jewel of centralized exchanges. Dominated by giants like Binance and Bybit, these instruments accounted for the lion’s share of crypto derivatives, capturing more than 90% of total futures volume. However, 2025 has marked a pivotal shift as PerpDEXs have come of age. A new wave of onchain exchanges has overcome the technical challenges to making perps work at scale, ingeniously combining deep liquidity with intent-based architecture and ever-improving UI. As a result, traders can now experience CEX-like perpetual futures on the decentralized platform and network of their choice. Not only has this made perps easier to access onchain, but it’s taken a serious chunk out of CEX volumes. For so long the kings of crypto futures trading, centralized exchanges are now anxiously eyeing what their decentralized counterparts are up to – and for good reason. DEXs Make Their Move In a pincer movement, decentralized exchanges have attacked their centralized rivals from multiple angles. In doing so, they’ve demonstrated that there’s more than one way to deliver onchain perps. Because as an analysis of the leading PerpDEXs shows, onchain futures can be served up a dozen different ways to suit the needs of distinct trader types and blockchain ecosystems. Many of these implementations look and feel very much like trading on a centralized exchange – they’re fast, feature-rich, and intuitive – but underneath the hood their architecture is very different. Let’s take a closer look, starting with dYdX. dYdX’s appchain migration has unlocked greater performance in an increasingly modular DeFi world. One of the pioneers in decentralized perpetuals, dYdX has exemplified the evolution of blockchain architecture through its migration to a dedicated Cosmos appchain after initially launching on Ethereum. This shift to the Cosmos SDK has granted dYdX full control over its blockchain environment, enabling optimizations in performance, governance, and transaction costs that were previously constrained by shared infra. This has driven significant performance gains, including sub-second transaction finality and reduced latency – both of which are critical for high-frequency perps trading where milliseconds can determine profit or loss. Post-migration, dYdX’s volume has grown significantly. This year, it’s averaged around $200 million in daily volume and open interest, hitting $500M at its peak. This growth has been supported by dYdX expanding the number of markets it supports, which now exceed 200, and seeing its MegaVault – which allows users to deposit USDC into a pool and earn trading fees – reach $12 million in TVL for liquidity. It’s taken time for dYdX to build out its perps infra, but it now has a platform that enables virtually any market to be created and traded with seamless access and no custodial risk. dYdX is a benchmark for how appchains can elevate DEX performance, drawing traders seeking CeFi-like speed without the centralization. Depth and Diversity in Synthetics While dYdX bets on modularity, GMX has maintained its stronghold on Arbitrum, leveraging the Layer-2’s low fees and high throughput to dominate in liquidity depth and synthetic asset expansion. GMX’s model, centered on the GLP liquidity pool, allows traders to access perpetuals backed by a diversified basket of assets, mitigating impermanent loss and ensuring deep liquidity even for exotic pairs. In 2025, GMX has expanded its synthetic offerings, adding markets for top-100 altcoins like KAS, OKB , and CVX, while venturing into real-world asset tokenization – a burgeoning $23 billion market. This strategic diversification has sustained GMX’s lead, with features like gasless trading and multichain expansions to Solana in March 2025 enhancing accessibility. Thanks to these innovations, total volume has been trending upwards: amid a broader DeFi resurgence, GMX’s ecosystem has gained a new lease of life, supported by permissionless listings that require robust liquidity thresholds to prevent manipulation. GMX’s edge lies in its zero-slippage trades for large positions, a feature that appeals to institutional players migrating onchain. Compared to CeFi, where funding rates can be opaque, GMX’s transparent oracle pricing and community governance foster trust. So far, GMX’s expansion into synthetic assets appears to be bearing fruit, solidifying its position as a user-friendly platform supplying EVM-based perps that work seamlessly. Orbs’ Perpetual Hub Ultra Supercharges DEXs Infrastructure provider Orbs , meanwhile, has been democratizing perpetuals through Perpetual Hub Ultra, its Layer-3 solution that plugs into existing DEXs like SpookySwap on Sonic and THENA on BNB Chain. This enables leverage of up to 60x on over 300 pairs, bringing CeFi-level execution to spot DEXs and saving them from the cost and security challenges of building out their own perps product from scratch; Orbs does it all for them. The logic is compelling: mid-tier DEXs often lack the resources for advanced derivatives, but Orbs’ plug-and-play hub provides deep liquidity, aggregated order books, and intent-based trading, leveling the playing field. For SpookySwap and THENA – already Orbs partners having previously integrated solutions such as its dLIMIT protocol – this upgrade has introduced high-leverage trading on diverse assets, bringing futures markets to DEXs across the omnichain landscape. Elsewhere, newcomers like ApeX Pro are carving out their own niche through differentiation, particularly with customizable leverage options that allow traders to tailor risk levels beyond standard caps. Operating on an orderbook model across multiple chains via its Omni platform, ApeX Pro offers up to 50x leverage with user-defined parameters, blending the precision of CeFi with DeFi’s renowned transparency and permissionless access. In 2025, ApeX has evolved into a leading PerpDEX, with features like resellable markets from trusted sources and low-fee executions. ApeX’s real strength, though, is in user empowerment: customizable leverage reduces overexposure risks, incentivizing long-term participation. As a newer entrant, it faces liquidity bootstrapping challenges, though it’s been addressing these through partnerships and incentives. ApeX Pro has been a breath of fresh air for the onchain perps sector, proving that traders value variety and the freedom to do their thing on the network and platform that talks their language. Onchain Perps as the New Standard The progress made by PerpDEXs like dYdX, GMX, Orbs-integrated platforms, and ApeX Pro illustrates a maturing ecosystem where perpetual trading is no longer confined to CeFi majors. With DeFi perps volumes soaring, onchain exchanges are setting a new standard, offering transparency and non-custody that CeFi can’t match, aided by infrastructure players like Orbs making perps accessible to mid-tier DEXs. Enhanced blockchain scalability through Layer-2 solutions, improved user interfaces mimicking CeFi, and a growing distrust of centralized custodians following high-profile failures have all accelerated this transition. As traders prioritize sovereignty over their assets, DEXs are innovating aggressively to seize this opportunity. Everyone wants to beat the market, which for many crypto traders means opening leveraged positions that have the potential to deliver tidy profits should things play out as envisaged. While CEXs will dominate total perps volume for the foreseeable future, their market share has been significantly eroded this year. For a growing band of perps traders, DeFi is the new CeFi.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-24 15:16:18

The surge came as ETH broke free from a multi-week descending channel, reclaiming critical trendline support near $4,400. Now, the market is at a key decision point: whether ETH can sustain momentum toward the psychological $5,000 level or face near-term consolidation. What’s Happening With Ethereum’s Price? ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum reversed sharply from $4,200, breaking out of a falling channel and reclaiming the rising trendline from early August. The recovery lifted ETH into the $4,750–$4,800 resistance zone, which has acted as both a liquidity cluster and a key rejection level in past cycles. ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The weekly chart shows ETH testing the same supply zone that capped rallies in late 2021. A decisive close above $4,900 would confirm a structural breakout, potentially opening the path toward $5,200 and even $5,500. Until then, ETH faces overhead supply pressure that could keep price action choppy.

Yet, while Solana draws attention, Unilabs Finance is capturing growing interest as the next big crypto. With its presale raising millions and trading tools designed to maximize investor gains, experts are projecting potential returns of up to 2,200%. This makes this DeFi asset manager impossible to ignore. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Builds Momentum with $220 Target in Sight The latest Solana price prediction points to possible gains as momentum builds across the crypto market. The Solana token recently crossed $180 and is now trading around $202 , with its price charts printing green. Source: TradingView In recent crypto news, Solana has reclaimed the #2 position in the decentralized exchange (DEX) race. The asset records over $107.9 billion in 30-day trading volume. This puts SOL ahead of BSC and Base, showing its growing strength in the Web3 space. Technical indicators, alongside Solana price prediction, hint that Solana could push higher in the near term. Forecast models show that the cryptocurrency may break above $220 by September if bullish sentiment continues. Despite the bullish Solana price prediction, attention is also shifting toward new projects. An emerging DeFi asset manager, Unilabs Finance, is being highlighted by experts as a crypto set to explode, with projections of potential gains reaching up to 2,200%. Unilabs Presale Gains Momentum as Analysts Eye 2,200% Potential Although the Solana price prediction looks bullish, Unilabs Finance is stealing attention as many analysts highlight it as the best crypto to buy. The project has been performing strongly in its presale, with experts suggesting it could deliver gains of up to 2,200%. So far, Unilabs Finance has raised over $15.6 million in its ongoing ICO. Each UNIL token is priced at $0.0108, and if experts’ predictions hold, UNIL could hit $0.2484. Traders looking to boost their holdings can also use the code “UNIL40” to receive a 40% bonus. Beyond presale performance, Unilabs offers advanced AI-powered tools that make professional-grade trading accessible to everyday investors. Unilabs’ AI Market Pulse scans the market to identify high performing crypto projects. The AI Portfolio Management tool automatically adjusts user portfolios to maximize returns and reduce risks. Investors can use this tool to potentially capture significant gains, especially if the Solana price surges. The Early Access Scoring System (EASS) ranks upcoming projects, allowing investors to discover promising assets without needing to manually research every project. With these features and its presale performance, any traders now view Unilabs as a high potential crypto that could ride the same bullish wave as the latest Solana price prediction.

They base that call on the prospect of easier Federal Reserve policy, investors rotating away from US holdings, stricter budgeting across many emerging economies, and milder inflation that supports growth without overheating prices. Fidelity International, T. Rowe Price and Ninety One Plc point to these forces as reasons for stronger relative gains in developing markets. They argue that softer inflation, alongside tighter fiscal management, leaves room for interest-rate cuts and bank lending that can spur activity. Analysts see bigger upside in EM stocks Forecasts back the view. Analysts project the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to climb about 15% over the next year, versus roughly 10% for the developed-market benchmark. As per Bloomberg , flows are lining up with that narrative too, as equity money is moving into EM faster than into developed peers , judging by some of the world’s largest exchange-traded funds. “EM equities are likely to outperform as they enjoy the tailwinds of easing local monetary policy across most markets, boosting domestic lending and consumption but also a weaker dollar,” said George Efstathopoulos, a fund manager at Fidelity in Singapore. “It’s also important to remember that the Fed as the most significant central bank will most likely be resuming easing in coming quarters.” Activity since Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2 shows the shift. Around $5.8 billion has gone into the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, the biggest EM tracker, equal to about 5.8% of its assets. The Vanguard FTSE Developed Market ETF drew $5.6 billion over the same period, which is roughly 3.3% of that fund’s holdings. Rate cut bets strengthen after Fed remarks A fresh signal from the Fed added momentum on Friday. Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank is likely on a path to cut rates in September. After his Jackson Hole remarks covered by Cryptopolitan, traders increased wagers on an easing move at the Sept. 16–17 meeting. Since April 2, both the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and its developed-market counterpart have advanced about 14%, helped by hopes that Trump’s tariff threats were largely bargaining chips. Bond markets showed a similar pattern. A Bloomberg index of EM debt returned 4%, while a comparable developed-market gauge gained 3%. Another advantage for EM assets is policy discipline, said Archie Hart, who oversees emerging-market equities at Ninety One in London. “If we look at policymakers in emerging markets, they’re conservative, they’re disciplined by the market, they’re pragmatic, so we don’t see these huge unsustainable fiscal deficits that you see in developed markets,” he said. Valuations also tilt toward the developing world, according to T. Rowe Price. “We have an overweight stance on emerging-market equities in our multi-asset portfolios” as valuations remain more reasonable than those in developed markets, coupled with higher earnings growth prospects, said Thomas Poullaouec, a portfolio manager in Singapore. Currency markets offer select opportunities Currencies play a role as well. Poullaouec still sees room in select developing-nation FX, while cautioning on positioning risks. “Much of the upside in EM currencies has already been priced in, particularly given the crowded US dollar short positioning,” he said. “That said, we maintain positive exposure to Latin American currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, supported by elevated carry and improving fiscal sentiment.” Local-currency debt is part of the upbeat case. Inflation surprises have cooled sharply in emerging economies. The Citi Inflation Surprise Index for EM has averaged minus 19 this year, down from peaks above 40 in 2022. A similar gauge for the Group-of-10 economies was minus 12 in July. Negative readings mean inflation came in below forecasts. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

A colossal USDT transferred from HTX to Aave has been reported, involving an astonishing 300,000,001 USDT, valued at approximately $300 million. This monumental whale activity, initially flagged by Whale Alert, signifies a substantial shift in digital assets, prompting questions about its potential impact on both the centralized exchange HTX and the decentralized lending protocol Aave. What Does This Massive USDT Transferred from HTX to Aave Mean? When such a significant amount of USDT transferred from HTX to Aave occurs, it’s natural for the crypto community to seek understanding. This particular transfer represents a substantial movement of Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, from a major centralized exchange (CEX), HTX (formerly Huobi), to a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Aave. Aave operates as a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies. The sheer scale of this transaction—over $300 million—places it firmly in the category of “whale” activity. Whales are large holders of cryptocurrency whose actions can sometimes influence market sentiment or indicate broader trends. Moreover, such a large USDT transferred from HTX to Aave could have several underlying motivations, ranging from strategic financial maneuvers to liquidity management. Decoding the Implications of Large HTX to Aave USDT Transfers Understanding the implications of a massive HTX to Aave USDT transfer requires looking at both the sender and receiver. For HTX, a significant outflow like this might be part of routine liquidity rebalancing or a large client moving funds for specific DeFi opportunities. Centralized exchanges often manage vast pools of assets, and movements of this size are not always indicative of negative sentiment, but rather sophisticated operational strategies. On the Aave side, receiving such a substantial amount of USDT could significantly boost its liquidity pools. Enhanced liquidity on Aave means more funds are available for lending, potentially increasing borrowing opportunities and even affecting interest rates. This influx could strengthen Aave’s position as a robust DeFi platform, attracting more users and further solidifying its ecosystem. The movement of USDT transferred from HTX to Aave highlights the growing bridge between CEX and DeFi platforms. Increased Liquidity: Aave’s USDT lending pools could see a substantial boost. Potential for Yield: The whale likely seeks higher yields or specific lending/borrowing strategies available on Aave. Market Signal: Such a move could be interpreted as a bullish signal for DeFi, indicating confidence in decentralized protocols. Operational Maneuver: It could also be a large institutional player or a high-net-worth individual reallocating capital. Is Your Crypto Safe? Understanding USDT Transferred from HTX to Aave Security The security aspect of large transactions, including the USDT transferred from HTX to Aave , is paramount. Blockchain transactions, by their nature, are transparent and immutable. Whale Alert, a reputable blockchain tracker, provides real-time updates on significant movements, allowing the community to monitor such events. This transparency is a cornerstone of the crypto world, offering a level of insight not always present in traditional finance. Both HTX and Aave employ robust security measures. HTX, as a centralized exchange, utilizes cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and other protocols to protect user assets. Aave, being a decentralized protocol, relies on audited smart contracts and a decentralized governance model. While no system is entirely risk-free, the movement of USDT transferred from HTX to Aave showcases the operational integrity of both platforms in handling large volumes of assets securely. For users, understanding the difference between CEX and DeFi is crucial. Centralized exchanges offer ease of use and customer support but require trust in a third party. DeFi protocols, conversely, offer greater autonomy and transparency through smart contracts but demand a higher level of user responsibility and technical understanding. This particular transaction illustrates how large players navigate both environments to optimize their strategies. In conclusion, the colossal USDT transferred from HTX to Aave is more than just a large number; it’s a compelling snapshot of the dynamic interplay between centralized and decentralized finance. This $300 million movement underscores the growing sophistication of crypto market participants and the continuous evolution of digital asset management. Whether for yield farming, strategic rebalancing, or other financial endeavors, such transfers reinforce the liquidity and potential within the DeFi ecosystem, particularly for platforms like Aave. It serves as a powerful reminder of the transparency and scale that blockchain technology brings to global finance. Frequently Asked Questions About Large Crypto Transfers What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar. It aims to maintain a stable value, making it a popular choice for traders and investors looking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies while remaining within the crypto ecosystem. What is HTX? HTX, formerly known as Huobi Global, is a prominent centralized cryptocurrency exchange. It offers a wide range of trading services, including spot trading, derivatives, and various crypto assets, serving a global user base. What is Aave? Aave is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. It operates on smart contracts, enabling transparent and permissionless financial services. Why would someone transfer such a large amount of USDT from HTX to Aave? There are several reasons for such a significant transfer. It could be a large investor (whale) looking to engage in yield farming, provide liquidity to Aave’s pools for interest, borrow other assets, or simply rebalance their portfolio to take advantage of specific DeFi opportunities or interest rates that may be more attractive than those offered by centralized exchanges. How does this transfer impact the crypto market? While a single large transaction like this might not immediately cause drastic market shifts, it can signal growing confidence in DeFi protocols and their ability to handle substantial liquidity. It could also influence liquidity levels on Aave, potentially affecting lending and borrowing rates for USDT. Did you find this analysis insightful?

It is thought that this development could pave the way for cryptocurrency ETFs in the country. According to Nikkei, this change is envisaged for fiscal year 2026 and aims to tax crypto earnings at a flat 20% rate, placing them in a separate tax category. Currently, crypto income is classified as “other income” and subject to progressive tax rates of up to 55%, excluding local taxes. With the new regulation, industry representatives are also requesting a three-year loss carryforward. Related News: Analytics Firm Changes Strategy: Sells Large Amount of Ethereum and Makes Another Trade The FSA's plans also include regulations that would make it easier for Japanese companies to launch local crypto ETFs. The agency is working on a draft law that would include crypto assets under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act in 2026, defining them as “financial products” rather than “payment instruments.” These changes align with the FSA's plans to approve JPYC, Japan's first regulated yen-denominated stablecoin. The stablecoin, issued by Tokyo-based JPYC, aims to launch 1 trillion yen (about $6.78 billion) within three years. *This is not investment advice.

A massive USDT transfer , totaling 199,999,998 Tether (USDT), has been reported moving from the HTX exchange to Binance. This transaction, valued at approximately $200 million, instantly caught the attention of market observers and sparked discussions about its potential implications. What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive USDT Transfer According to blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, this significant USDT transfer occurred recently, moving a colossal sum of nearly 200 million stablecoins between two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Such large-scale movements, often referred to as ‘whale transactions,’ are closely monitored by investors and analysts alike. For context, USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1.00. Therefore, a transfer of 199,999,998 USDT is essentially a $200 million movement in digital cash. This particular USDT transfer from HTX to Binance represents a substantial shift in liquidity. Why Does This USDT Transfer Matter? Implications for the Market A USDT transfer of this magnitude between major exchanges can signal several things. Firstly, it often indicates a significant rebalancing of funds by a large investor or institution. They might be preparing for substantial trades, consolidating assets, or seeking different trading opportunities on Binance. Moreover, large transfers like this can sometimes precede major market movements, though this is not always the case. Investors frequently interpret such activity as a sign of potential shifts in market sentiment or liquidity. For instance, an influx of stablecoins onto an exchange could suggest an intent to buy other cryptocurrencies, while an outflow might imply profit-taking. Liquidity Shift: This USDT transfer adds considerable liquidity to Binance’s order books. Market Sentiment: It can influence how traders perceive the market’s immediate future. Exchange Health: Such movements are generally routine for active exchanges, reflecting dynamic trading environments. Understanding Crypto Whale Behavior and USDT Transfer Trends Who are these ‘whales’ responsible for such colossal transactions? Generally, a crypto whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency. Their movements, like this recent USDT transfer , are often tracked because their actions can significantly impact market prices due to the sheer volume of their holdings. Tracking these large transactions provides valuable insights into market dynamics. Tools like Whale Alert help the community stay informed about where significant capital is flowing. While a single large USDT transfer might not dictate market direction, a pattern of such transfers can reveal underlying trends. It is crucial to remember that not all large transfers are bearish or bullish. They are simply movements of capital, and their true intent can only be speculated upon without further information. However, staying informed about these movements is a key part of understanding the broader crypto landscape. What Can Investors Learn from this USDT Transfer? Actionable Insights For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, monitoring significant events like this USDT transfer offers valuable lessons. It highlights the transparency of blockchain technology, where every transaction is recorded and publicly verifiable, albeit pseudonymously. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable blockchain analytics services to understand large movements. Avoid Panic: A single large USDT transfer doesn’t necessarily predict a market crash or boom. Look for broader trends. Diversify: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Large movements can create volatility, and diversification helps mitigate risk. Research: Understand the fundamentals of the assets you hold and the exchanges you use. This particular USDT transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the substantial capital flows within the digital asset ecosystem. The transfer of nearly 200 million USDT from HTX to Binance is a testament to the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency markets. While the exact motives behind this colossal USDT transfer remain speculative, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data for insights into whale activity and potential market shifts. Investors are encouraged to observe such events with a discerning eye, using them as opportunities to learn more about the intricate dance of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin designed to maintain a value equivalent to one U.S. dollar. It is the most widely used stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, facilitating trading and providing a stable store of value. What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions, such as a large USDT transfer . Why would a large USDT transfer occur between exchanges? Large USDT transfers can occur for various reasons, including rebalancing funds, preparing for significant trades, taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities, consolidating assets, or moving funds for over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Does this USDT transfer impact USDT’s stability? No, a large USDT transfer between exchanges does not typically impact USDT’s stability. USDT’s stability is maintained by its peg to the U.S. dollar, backed by reserves, rather than the movement of tokens between wallets or exchanges. How can I track large crypto transactions like this USDT transfer? You can track large crypto transactions using blockchain explorers and services like Whale Alert, which monitor significant movements of various cryptocurrencies across different networks and exchanges.

Mutuum Finance is currently in presale phase 6 at $0.035. It will be worth 14.29% higher at $0.04 when it’s in presale stage 7. Those who invest now will have a minimum of 400% when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance has raised over $14.8 million and gained over 15600 investors already. Mutuum Finance’s expanding ecosystem and rising on-chain activity are backing its position as one of the few DeFi projects to maintain positive momentum in a slowing crypto market. Solana’s Path Forward: Discovering Resistance and Support Solana (SOL) is approximately $183.10, ranging closely between $179 and $185 with neutral technical indicators. Retaking the $190–$200 level would pave the way for more ambitious targets of $210–$220 in the near future, whereas failing to maintain above $176 could open the doorway for further declines to $160–$168. This conservative view underscores Solana’s current balance of upside potential against important resistance levels, as attention increasingly shifts towards prospects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Success Mutuum Finance is doing exceptionally well in the DeFi sector. It has a 95.0/100 trust score at present, which has been certified and audited using Certik. The organization is giving a secure platform to make DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is integrating tried-and-tested lending features with the security of a fresh ecosystem from another DeFi mandate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing an Ethereum, overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin. It will give long-term liquidity, trust, and stability to any client. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum with presale rounds selling out fast. Presale is in level 6 at $0.035. When the price goes up to the next level, it will be by 14.29% to $0.04. Investment hunger is increasing with the project already having amassed more than $14.8 million and currently having more than 15600 token holders. Enhancing DeFi Security with Giveaway and $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now launched $100,000 giveaway . 10 users will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The team has also launched a top 50 token holder leaderboard that rewards bonus tokens to large holders. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK.

50606852,564090,1756051215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50606852.jpeg,Tom Lee Buys $45M In Ethereum As Bitmine Expands Treasury To $7B ETH,https://bitcoinist.com/tom-lee-buys-45m-ethereum-bitmine-expands-treasury/,"Ethereum is once again in the spotlight after smashing through its previous all-time high, reaching $4,886 on Friday with an explosive 14% daily surge. This breakout underscores the strength of ETH’s ongoing bullish trend and highlights its growing dominance in the crypto market. While Bitcoin has been consolidating around familiar levels, Ethereum has become the focal point of institutional interest, with large players increasingly allocating capital to the asset. Fundamentals remain robust, as both on-chain and market data confirm that Ethereum demand is accelerating. Institutions, funds, and whales are not only holding but also aggressively adding to their positions, signaling conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. According to Arkham Intelligence, Tom Lee’s Bitmine has just bought $45 million worth of ETH, further cementing the narrative of large-scale accumulation. This move aligns with a broader trend of influential investors and organizations betting on Ethereum as the backbone of decentralized finance and the leading smart contract platform. The combination of new highs, institutional adoption, and growing market confidence places Ethereum at the center of attention heading into the next phase of the cycle. Bulls now expect price discovery to unfold, potentially pushing ETH toward uncharted territory. Institutional Accumulation Signals Bullish Upside Ethereum’s rally is increasingly being fueled by deep-pocketed institutional players, with Arkham reporting that BitMine now holds $7 billion worth of ETH. This staggering position makes BitMine the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, with 1.518 million ETH under its control—equivalent to roughly 1.3% of the total supply. Far from slowing down, BitMine continues to accumulate, reinforcing the narrative that institutions see Ethereum as a cornerstone asset for the future of digital finance. Close behind is SharpLink Gaming, the second-largest corporate holder, which has amassed 729,000 ETH valued at approximately $3.2 billion. Together, these two players represent a significant concentration of Ethereum in corporate treasuries, underscoring the scale of institutional conviction. Analysts point out that such accumulation not only locks away massive amounts of ETH from circulation but also shifts market dynamics by tightening available supply. When large entities consistently buy and hold, it often signals confidence in both the asset’s utility and long-term price appreciation. Many market participants view Ethereum’s latest breakout above its 2021 all-time high as only the beginning, with corporate demand providing a strong foundation for further gains. If this pace of accumulation continues, Ethereum could be entering the kind of supercycle many investors have long anticipated. Weekly Outlook: Key Resistance In Play Ethereum’s weekly chart shows a powerful rebound that has carried the asset to new highs not seen since late 2021. After finding strong support near the $2,400 region earlier this year, ETH has staged a decisive rally, surging past its long-term moving averages (50, 100, and 200-week SMAs) and breaking through resistance levels that previously capped momentum. This breakout has culminated in a fresh push toward $4,779, putting Ethereum firmly back into price discovery territory. The structure of the chart highlights how bulls have regained control. ETH has posted consecutive bullish candles, with strong buying momentum following institutional accumulation trends reported on-chain. The alignment of the moving averages — with the 50-week SMA turning upward above the 100 and 200-week SMAs — signals a strengthening long-term bullish trend. However, the rapid pace of this climb also raises the risk of short-term exhaustion. ETH is now trading near historically significant resistance levels that align with prior cycle peaks, which could spark profit-taking among traders. If a retracement occurs, $4,300 and $3,800 emerge as key support zones to watch.

50605300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79955,1756051216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,BlockDAG Presale Hits $381M While BlockchainFX Relies on Speculative Buzz,https://timestabloid.com/blockdag-presale-hits-381m-while-blockchainfx-relies-on-speculative/,"Two trending presales are moving in opposite directions. BlockchainFX is making noise through bold forecasts of 500x growth, yet its plans lack substance. Its appeal comes from strong branding, but what lies behind the branding is still unclear. By contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is proving itself through actual delivery. With over $381 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, and miner sales surpassing $7.8 million from more than 19,350 units, BlockDAG’s traction is real. Its Dashboard V4 is already live, giving presale buyers a working platform to explore. This isn’t just a static page; it’s an experience that feels close to live trading. Users can see real-time activity, track balances, and engage with gamified features. BlockchainFX leans heavily on AI-focused marketing and the promise of possible gains. BlockDAG is already building confidence by allowing participants to interact with trading tools and transparent dashboards before the coin even goes public. BlockchainFX Presale Gains Momentum but Lacks Depth The BlockchainFX presale has gained traction thanks to eye-catching forecasts. Hype around a 500x BlockchainFX price prediction has attracted attention from those chasing early stage growth. The project has crafted a clean visual brand and tied itself to AI messaging, which adds to its appeal. Still, the actual platform remains vague. There are limited details about its real usage. The presale mostly revolves around price talk and how high the coin might climb once it launches. Confirmed features are scarce, demos are missing, and tokenomics remain cloudy. Development milestones are also not transparent. This leaves questions about what BlockchainFX can actually offer at launch beyond coin access. While the project has been heavily discussed in recent weeks, much of its momentum feels based on speculation. Without clarity around utility, the BlockchainFX price prediction reads more like an optimistic hope than a practical forecast. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 Turns Presale Into a Live Exchange Experience BlockDAG has shifted what people expect from a presale. Its latest Dashboard V4 doesn’t look like a simple buy page. Instead, it feels like a trading platform, offering features usually seen only after launch. Users can view BDAG’s live price, track wallet balances, check purchase history, and interact with a working order book that provides instant confirmations. This dashboard also includes gamified features. Referral bonuses, leaderboard rankings, and wallet insights make participation more engaging. It’s not just about buying coins; it’s about staying involved. The system creates transparency and interaction that builds long-term confidence. This approach is paying off. BlockDAG has already raised over $381 million, sold 25.3 billion coins, and surpassed $7.8 million in miner sales from more than 19,350 units. Since its first batch, the ROI has climbed to 2,660%, making it one of the strongest presale performers this year. The coin is currently priced at $0.0276 in batch 29, showing more room before the $0.05 launch price. Dashboard V4 helps users become familiar with trading features before launch. By linking presale participation to real usage, BlockDAG reduces onboarding friction and builds a seamless bridge to its live phase. Few projects manage to keep participants this engaged before launch, and BlockDAG’s model is setting a new standard. Utility vs Speculation: A Clear Divide BlockchainFX is still leaning on hype-heavy narratives, but without a clear structure, its presale remains uncertain. The price buzz may catch attention, but the lack of real features or visibility makes it hard to gauge its actual potential. BlockDAG, however, is building trust step by step. Its Dashboard V4 offers tools like real-time trading simulation, wallet tracking, and interactive referrals. These features provide substance during the presale rather than promises of future delivery. The difference is clear. BlockchainFX relies on speculative growth stories, while BlockDAG shows real numbers: $381 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, and an ROI of 2,660%. It’s a contrast between hype and hands-on access. Wrapping Up BlockchainFX may keep drawing attention through bold predictions, but without real products, its future depends on unproven promises. Its presale is active, yet the absence of tools or ecosystem features keeps its value uncertain. BlockDAG’s strategy is different. By rolling out Dashboard V4 before launch, it has already delivered utility and engagement. The $381 million raised, 2,660% ROI, and ongoing presale activity confirm that buyers are responding to what’s already in place. For those looking at usability instead of hype, BlockDAG sets itself apart by offering a working platform before trading even begins.

In 2025, investors are paying close attention to projects that combine growth potential, real-world utility, and active ecosystems. Cold Wallet, ETH, SOL, and SHIB are four cryptocurrencies that have captured attention for different reasons, from presale advantages to established blockchain networks with strong communities. Each project has unique features that appeal to both short-term traders and long-term holders. Choosing the right combination of these coins could enhance portfolio performance while minimizing risk exposure. This article highlights why these four are considered the top crypto to buy right now, and what makes them worth watching in the months ahead. 1. Cold Wallet – The Presale Opportunity You Can’t Miss Cold Wallet is currently in Stage 17 of a 150-stage presale, priced at $0.00998 per CWT token. With over 703 million tokens sold and $6.4 million raised so far, the platform is gearing up for a fixed launch price of $0.3517. That represents a potential 37× gain from the current stage, while early investors from Stage 1 could see returns up to 50×. Some projections even suggest long-term upside reaching 100× as the ecosystem grows and the token sees broader adoption. This presale phase offers a rare chance to get in early on a project that is already functional and user-ready. Anyone aiming for the top crypto to buy right now should seriously consider this presale for maximum potential returns. Cold Wallet’s ecosystem flips the traditional fee model by offering cashback in CWT for gas fees, swaps, on/off ramps, and more, without requiring staking or lockups. Its apps are live on Android and iOS, fully functional. The project also benefited from the $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, instantly adding 2 million active users and strengthening its ecosystem. The platform’s incentives include referral programs that pay in USDT and future CWT tokens, creating multiple ways to gain from the network. Featured on CoinMarketCap with live updates, Cold Wallet combines transparency, adoption, and presale advantages. For those looking for the top crypto to buy right now, this is a project that combines hype, usability, and real growth potential in a way few others currently match. 2. Ethereum (ETH) – The Layer 1 Giant Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $1,875, with a market cap nearing $225 billion. ETH remains the backbone of smart contracts and DeFi, powering thousands of dApps across finance, gaming, and NFTs. Its transition to proof-of-stake has reduced energy consumption while keeping security strong, making it appealing to environmentally conscious investors. The ecosystem continues to expand with Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, which provide faster transaction speeds and lower fees, attracting more users and developers. ETH also benefits from strong adoption in enterprise solutions and NFT marketplaces, maintaining a large, active community of developers and users. The combination of staking rewards, ongoing network upgrades, and consistent usage ensures long-term potential for price appreciation. Investors seeking the top crypto to buy right now can view ETH as a relatively stable yet growth-oriented option that balances high upside with established market credibility. Its strong liquidity and developer ecosystem make it a consistent choice for both new and experienced crypto investors. 3. Solana (SOL) – Fast, Low-Cost Blockchain Solana (SOL) is currently trading at around $24, with a market cap of approximately $10 billion. Its network is known for extremely fast transaction speeds and very low fees, making it an attractive platform for developers building DeFi applications, NFT projects, and blockchain-based games. Solana’s unique Proof-of-History protocol allows thousands of transactions per second, which gives it a clear advantage over slower blockchains when handling high-demand applications. The ecosystem continues to expand as new projects, decentralized exchanges, and NFT marketplaces launch on the network. SOL holders can also stake their tokens for additional rewards, providing an opportunity to earn passive income. With active developer support and ongoing partnerships in gaming and finance, Solana maintains a strong position in the crypto market. For investors looking for the top crypto to buy right now, SOL represents a high-potential asset with solid technical infrastructure, growing adoption, and multiple avenues for future gains. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Community Power in Action Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at around $0.000011, with a market cap near $7 billion. While it started as a meme coin, SHIB has built a stronger presence through real-world utility, including its ShibaSwap platform for staking and decentralized trading. The token has introduced burning mechanisms to reduce supply over time, which can increase scarcity and potentially support future price gains. The Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to expand into NFTs, gaming, and community-driven projects, keeping the token in the spotlight. Its large, loyal community actively promotes adoption and participation, making SHIB more than just a speculative asset. The combination of staking rewards, deflationary measures, and ongoing ecosystem growth positions it as a notable choice for investors.

Both have earned reputations as low-fee, fast-settlement tokens that enable global transfers. In 2025, both assets are again making headlines: Litecoin for its struggle to maintain bullish momentum after a retreat, and Dogecoin for the renewed whale activity pushing it toward fresh levels. Yet while traders weigh near-term price moves, a different type of opportunity is emerging. Cold Walle t, a presale project built on self-custody principles and real-world payment utility, is offering investors a chance to secure tokens early with a projected 50x potential. This mix of technical adoption and long-term tokenomics sets it apart from the short-term swings of payment coins like LTC and DOGE. Litecoin Bullish Analysis Suggests ETF Optimism May Fuel a Rebound Litecoin has long been considered a leader in the payment-focused crypto category, often referred to as “digital silver.” Recently, Litecoin has been under pressure, retreating around 4.5% despite optimism surrounding a possible U.S. ETF approval. This pullback highlights both the resilience and the volatility of the coin, leaving traders divided over its near-term trajectory. The Litecoin bullish analysis suggests that if momentum returns, traders could again eye levels closer to $175–$180 by August. Market structure supports this cautiously positive outlook. Despite the pullback, on-chain data points to growing user activity and consistent miner participation. Analysts see the $150 zone as a key support, with a strong bounce from there reigniting bullish conviction. A confirmed breakout above resistance could serve as a catalyst for the next leg higher. For investors seeking the best crypto for payments, Litecoin still holds appeal. Its low fees, widespread exchange availability, and long history make it a dependable asset. However, its gains may remain closely tied to ETF news and overall market momentum, which creates uncertainty compared to projects positioning for utility-driven growth. Dogecoin Bullish Signal Backed by Whale Accumulation Dogecoin, the original meme coin turned payment token, is showing signs of strength again. The latest Dogecoin bullish signal comes as whales have been accumulating heavily, with analysts pointing to $0.25 as the next breakout level. This bullish momentum, if sustained, could transform Dogecoin’s outlook, reinforcing its place as a popular transactional coin among retail holders. Technically, Dogecoin’s chart reflects tightening consolidation, which often precedes large price swings. If resistance levels are breached, upside could be significant. However, like Litecoin, Dogecoin’s reliance on hype cycles and community-driven demand leaves it vulnerable to sharp reversals once enthusiasm fades. Traders who entered early in accumulation phases stand to benefit the most. From a practical standpoint, Dogecoin continues to attract attention as one of the bullish crypto coins in 2025, particularly because of its simplicity as a payment medium. Yet, its long-term sustainability is often questioned due to its lack of structured utility compared to newer projects. For investors considering the best crypto for payments, this creates both opportunity and risk, depending on timing and entry point. Cold Wallet: The Self-Custody Solution With 50x Potential Cold Wallet is not just another presale project, but a full-scale attempt to solve one of crypto’s long-standing challenges: combining self-custody with usability and rewards. Built as a non-custodial wallet, it ensures users maintain control of their private keys while introducing a reward-driven token model. This allows individuals to transact securely while earning from routine blockchain actions, such as gas payments and swaps. Currently priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, Cold Wallet has already sold over 726.17 million tokens, raising more than $6.4 million in total sales. Its 150-stage presale design creates an escalating price model, rewarding those who secure tokens early. With each stage, the cost per token rises, setting up conditions for significant appreciation once Cold Wallet goes live on exchanges. The project’s utility goes beyond speculation. $CWT tokens integrate directly into the wallet, granting holders cashback rewards, governance participation, and referral bonuses. These features make Cold Wallet not only a token but also an ecosystem where activity directly benefits users. Importantly, this creates demand tied to functionality, rather than hype alone, offering durability in market cycles. What sets Cold Wallet apart is its projected 50x potential, which positions it as more than just another presale bet. By linking real payment utility with a high ROI opportunity, Cold Wallet makes a strong case as the best crypto for payments and long-term investment. While Litecoin and Dogecoin chase momentum with traders, Cold Wallet is laying infrastructure designed to grow steadily with adoption, making it one of the most compelling opportunities of 2025. Last Say Litecoin’s bullish outlook is tied to ETF speculation, while Dogecoin’s signals hinge on whale activity and community hype. Both remain relevant in the payment sector, but their growth paths depend heavily on external catalysts. For investors looking at bullish crypto coins in 2025, they still provide familiar, liquid options. Cold Wallet, however, introduces something new. With its 50x potential, presale traction, and utility-focused design, it presents a strong argument as the best crypto for payments in today’s market. Unlike the cyclical momentum of LTC and DOGE, Cold Wallet offers structural growth tied to user participation and token utility. For investors weighing payment coins this year, Cold Wallet may be the project that redefines what sustainable returns look like.

In a video attached to the post, he began by emphasizing the complexity of current global and domestic factors shaping financial markets. He cited the Russia-Ukraine war, newly imposed tariffs, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly its handling of interest rates, as important considerations. According to him, these overlapping developments create difficulties for analysts and investors in predicting the exact trajectory of the ongoing cryptocurrency bull run. Rietveld noted that the uncertainty tied to geopolitics and macroeconomic policy decisions continues to challenge projections, making it harder to anticipate when upward momentum in the markets might stall. He stressed that the wide range of moving parts currently influencing global finance should not be overlooked, as they directly affect investor sentiment and capital flows across both traditional and digital assets. HUGE #XRP DIP Don’t Miss! pic.twitter.com/EMgNUobwhp — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 22, 2025 Technical Indicators Pointing to Upside Potential While acknowledging the macroeconomic pressures at play, Rietveld shifted his focus to technical analysis of XRP’s price chart. He explained that the stochastic relative strength index (RSI) was currently in oversold territory. Drawing on historical patterns, he said that a similar technical setup previously led to a rally in XRP. Rietveld reviewed past price movements, stating that when XRP entered oversold conditions, investors who purchased during that time frame and later sold as the RSI reached overbought levels would have seen substantial returns. He underscored that this cyclical pattern has provided multiple opportunities for strategic entries and exits. Historical Comparisons and Recent Market Activity In his analysis, Rietveld referenced XRP’s activity between July 26 and August 4, a period in which the asset remained in oversold conditions. He argued that during that window, investors had multiple opportunities to buy at lower levels, setting themselves up for significant profits once prices recovered. According to him, this historical example serves as a guide for the present, as the current technical setup closely mirrors that earlier phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By making this comparison, Rietveld suggested that XRP is once again well-positioned for a potential upward movement. He reinforced the idea that oversold conditions should not be dismissed as warning signs but instead seen as possible entry points for disciplined investors who understand technical signals. View on XRP’s Price Movement Concluding his video, Rietveld reiterated that despite the uncertainty created by geopolitical tensions, trade policies, and Federal Reserve actions, XRP’s technical indicators present a compelling case for an upcoming rally. He maintained that the current oversold environment is highly favorable for buyers who are prepared to act strategically. According to his perspective, while predicting the exact end of the bull run remains highly challenging due to external factors, the technical backdrop suggests that XRP could soon recover from its present dip. For Rietveld, this alignment of conditions marks a significant moment for those closely monitoring the asset’s performance in both the short and medium term .

A potential correction toward $4.1K should not be ruled out unless buyers manage to defend $4.4K and push the price above the $4.8K ATH with convincing momentum. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Ethereum has formed a slightly higher high at $4,884 compared to its previous peak. However, RSI has failed to make a corresponding higher high, forming a bearish divergence, a classic warning of potential exhaustion in the trend. The price is currently consolidating just below the new ATH, within the upper boundary of the ascending channel. Immediate support lies at $4,400–$4,450, followed by the Fib retracement cluster at $4,070–$3,900, which aligns with the channel’s midline and remains a high-probability demand zone if a correction deepens. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights a sharp liquidity sweep toward $4,884, followed by consolidation. Similar to the daily chart, RSI is showing bearish divergence as the price pushed higher while momentum faded. This indicates that buyers are losing strength despite achieving higher highs. Key short-term supports sit at $4,477 (0.5 Fib) and $4,380–$4,311 (0.618–0.702 retracements). A breakdown below these levels could accelerate selling toward $4K, confirming a short-term market structure shift. On the upside, ETH needs to reclaim the $4.8K with strong momentum to invalidate the divergence and extend the bullish leg. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum has recently revisited its all-time high levels near $4,800–$4,900, with futures trading activity surging in parallel. The Futures Volume Bubble Map provides insight into how derivatives markets are behaving, offering a valuable gauge of whether speculative activity is cooling or overheating. This tool is crucial for assessing market risk and identifying potential reversal or continuation points. The latest data shows that as ETH rallied toward its highs, futures volume expanded sharply, with multiple red bubbles (overheating) appearing on the map. Historically, such conditions have often coincided with local tops or periods of heavy volatility, as rising leverage increases the risk of liquidation cascades. Looking back, similar overheating phases in early and late 2021 preceded significant corrections after Ethereum topped. By contrast, green phases (cooling) have typically marked accumulation zones, where leverage resets and ETH is prepared for a fresh leg higher. At present, ETH futures suggest a stretched derivatives market, with speculative activity reaching overheated levels near ATH. This aligns with the bearish RSI divergences observed on the spot charts, which point to weakening momentum despite higher prices. While an unexpected surge toward a new ATH remains possible under these conditions, the setup signals increased short-term risk of volatility and corrective moves.

It is worth noting that she assumed the position only three months ago. This comes at a time when the IRS is working on establishing a regulatory framework for crypto taxation. Another Leadership Overhaul in the IRS On Friday, Turner announced her exit from the agency through LinkedIn , the professional social media platform. While the executive had resumed the role three months ago, she has been with the IRS for almost 20 years. In other words, resigning from the position of head of IRS’s digital asset division marks the end of two decades of work with the tax office. She was an integral part of the development of the IRS’s digital asset strategy. This was at the time when cryptocurrencies transitioned from being specialized investments to becoming mainstream financial tools. Noteworthy, Turner took over from Sulolit “Raj” Mukherjee and Seth Wilks, two private-sector experts who served the IRS digital asset division for one year before their departure. Turner Moves to Crypto Tax Girl as Director According to Bloomberg Tax, Turner is moving to cryptocurrency tax firm Crypto Tax Girl, where she will serve as tax director. Turner will remain in the crypto tax space, only that she will be more focused on the private sector. This time around, she is looking to build connections between industry participants and regulators. This is necessary to ensure that both parties are catered to. For a while, quite a few U.S. crypto investors have been receiving tax letters from the IRS. In fact, leading crypto tax software company CoinLedger reported a 750% increase in users getting these notifications. This appears to be a larger IRS push to enforce crypto tax rules. More Crypto Tax Rules Are Coming in 2026 Meanwhile, the crypto industry is gradually moving into a season of more tax rules. By next year, crypto brokers will need to report both the total amount and the original cost of digital asset sales to the IRS. They will carry out this action using a new form called 1099-DA. With this initiative, the IRS aims to minimize errors and enhance accuracy in tax reporting. Interestingly, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms will not be affected by this upcoming rule.

Given its current position, the market still appears poised for at least one more rally before a potential reversal takes shape. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair On the USDT chart, Ripple’s token has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, positioned just beneath the upper boundary of the broader ascending channel that has guided the price action in recent months. Since symmetrical triangles can resolve in either direction, the next decisive breakout will determine the market’s trajectory. Currently, XRP is trading above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which have recently shown a bullish crossover. This setup favors a breakout to the upside, potentially carrying the price beyond both the triangle and the larger channel. However, if XRP falls back below these moving averages, the outlook would turn bearish, opening the door for a decline toward the $2.10 support zone. The BTC Pair On the XRP/BTC chart, the price has also been consolidating, mirroring the USDT pair’s behavior after breaking out of a descending channel and moving above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. The key difference here is that these moving averages have not yet formed a bullish crossover, suggesting the market may not be ready for a decisive breakout just yet. Still, with the asset holding above both moving averages and the critical 2,400 SAT support area, the outlook remains constructive. If momentum builds, a rally toward the 3,000 SAT level seems likely, with even a potential retest of the 3,400 SAT resistance zone on the table.

Over the past week, the flagship cryptocurrency fell below the $112,000 mark before experiencing some resurgence on the back of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell’s speech. However, the price of BTC appears to have returned to its sluggish pattern of action over the weekend, dropping to around $115,000 on Saturday, August 23. According to the latest on-chain data, the BTC price might be stuck in this phase of muted action in preparation for its next move. BTC Market Activity Wanes — What’s Next For Price? In a new post on social media platform X, Alphractal revealed that the Bitcoin market seems to be shaping up for the next big move in the coming weeks. This projection is based on the 30-Day Active Supply metric, which measures the number of unique coins that moved at least once over the past month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price In A Trend Shift? Here’s Why $118K Might Be Vital For A Bullish Return The 30-Day Active Supply metric functions as a thermometer of the market interest in BTC, indicating both overheated and cool market conditions. When the metric rises, it suggests the inflow of fresh capital circulating and stronger investor activity. Historically, increases in the Bitcoin 30-Day Active Supply have often coincided with price tops and bottoms, especially as investors are inclined to move their coins around during times of extreme greed or fear. Hence, a rise in the metric can be associated with a potential market reversal. Meanwhile, a drop in the Bitcoin 30-Day Active Supply metric signals calmer market conditions with hesitation among investors, typically after periods of high stress or enthusiasm. When fewer coins are on the move and supply is relatively stable, a tightening effect takes place in the market. According to data from Alphractal, the Active Supply indicator shows that the Bitcoin market has witnessed a cooldown in activity in recent weeks. The on-chain analytics firm added that the slowdown in the market activity could mean that the BTC price is preparing for the next big move. With an improving macroeconomic environment, the Bitcoin price appears to be consolidating within a narrow range beneath its all-time high. Hence, a sudden spike in activity could see the market leader enter a new expansion phase, with the potential to hit new highs. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above the $115,000 mark, reflecting an almost 2% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is down by more than 2% in the last seven days.

Is Layer Brett’s presale the next big thing in crypto? It might give you a 200x profit. How a Solana Trader Perfected Timing Profits A trader who correctly timed the Solana (SOL) and XRP rallies in 2024 has made a lot of money. Solana’s price went up from $18 to more than $252 because it can handle a lot of transactions at once and doesn’t charge any fees. This makes it one of the best blockchain for decentralized apps and NFTs. XRP’s value also went up, from $0.51 to $2.71, thanks to good court decisions and more people using it for cross-border payments. This trader took advantage of these changes and made a lot of money. But as of August 2025, both cryptocurrencies are having problems. The price of Solana has dropped to around $204, while XRP is having trouble getting above the $3 barrier. This is because people are taking profits, which is affecting their present performance. Even if these problems happened, the trader’s performance shows how important it is to know when to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Layer Brett: Why This Trader Sees Potential Layer Brett is designed for scalability right from the start. Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2, it delivers near-instant transaction speeds, incredibly low gas fees, and the robust security of Ethereum’s smart contract framework. This sets $LBRETT apart from meme coins that rely purely on hype, providing genuine utility, performance, and 200x returns. Currently in presale, the project offers early investors the highest staking annual percentage yields (APYs) on the market, with rates reaching tens of thousands of percent that decrease as more tokens are staked. Investors can begin staking immediately via MetaMask or Trust Wallet, starting to earn rewards right from the purchase. With a capped supply of just 10 billion tokens, scarcity is inherent from the outset. When combined with NFT integration, gamified staking features, and a $1 million community giveaway, $LBRETT is emerging as more than just a meme token but it’s developing into a scalable Layer 2 ecosystem. It’s not about disregarding Solana and XRP; it’s about diversification. The savvy trader understands that while they offer stability and utility, they’re unlikely to produce massive short-term returns. Early-stage tokens like Layer Brett, with low market caps and high staking rewards, provide the potential for substantial gains during a bull run. As the presale gains traction, more investors are securing early rates before demand spikes. $LBRETT offers a unique opportunity to benefit from both meme-driven hype and Ethereum’s growth. Conclusion The trader who invested in Solana and XRP last year proves that astute investors may profit in crypto. Layer Brett’s current presale offers a rare early-entry opportunity with the scale, community excitement, and yield potential to challenge crypto giants. Before the project enters exchanges, early buyers get the highest APYs and lowest entry price of $0.0047. The trader thinks $LBRETT might quadruple Solana and XRP’s returns and show you how to catch the next breakout before it happens. don’t miss your shot at the next 100x crypto!

But its latest 16% rally in just three days is especially noteworthy, as it marks $SOL’s third recent attempt to break firmly above $200, after failing twice before (once in July, and again in August). This surge comes on the heels of Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinting at a September rate cut , which is likely to fuel risk-on sentiment across markets and pump optimism into crypto as a whole. Here’s the kicker : with $SOL testing the $200 level multiple times, analysts now believe this rally could finally be the one that sparks a massive breakout. Keep reading to discover where $SOL could head next, the key factors driving its momentum, and how you can ride this wave by investing in Snorter Token ($SNORT) – a Solana-based altcoin currently in presale. Top Analyst Predicts $360 Year-End Target for Solana Based on technical analysis, @ali_charts, a crypto investor with more than 152K followers on X, has predicted that $SOL could hit $360 by the end of 2025 . He highlighted Solana’s prolonged consolidation phase and applied Fibonacci levels to support this lofty price target. And just as institutional accumulation is helping drive Bitcoin’s price higher, the same dynamic is playing out with Solana. For example, Sol Strategies recently disclosed their Solana treasury, revealing that the firm holds 420,706 $SOL worth roughly $87M . This underscores how large institutions are backing Solana with serious capital. Adding even more fuel to the fire is the growing likelihood of a SOL ETF approval in 2025. According to prediction platform Polymarket, the odds of the SEC greenlighting a Solana ETF this year stand at over 99% . Such an approval would be a game-changer, as it would open the floodgates for mainstream institutional money and significantly boost demand for $SOL. Even if you take the loftiest $SOL price prediction ($360), that’s only about a 75% bounce from current levels. Sure, those are gains a stock market investor would probably give a kidney for, but let’s be real: in crypto, 10x, 100x, or even 1000x returns are on the table if you pick the right tokens. One such 1000x crypto that could help you squeeze maximum upside from the upcoming Solana rally is Snorter Token ($SNORT) . What Is Snorter Token? $SNORT is the horsepower behind Snorter Bot, a new Telegram trading tool designed to help retail investors snipe liquidity in freshly listed meme coins on Solana. The Problem : Typically, big-money crypto players eat up all the liquidity in new tokens, whose initial pumps often give the biggest gains, leaving little to nothing for the average Joe. The Solution : Snorter allows you to set buy/sell limit and stop orders in advance. Then, as soon as liquidity opens, the bot automatically executes your trades, helping you front-run institutional players and ride meme coin pumps. Even better? Because it’s based on Telegram, Snorter is incredibly easy to use, making it perfect for those new to the meme coin space. All you have to do to place your trades is simply send commands in Telegram chat, which, by the way, is almost exactly how you send a regular text on the app. Top-Tier Security & Usability Features Just because Snorter keeps things simple doesn’t mean it’s a stripped-down version of the more sophisticated trading bots out there. In fact, Snorter comes packed with a full suite of features designed to make your on-chain trading as safe as possible. These include protections against rug pulls, honeypots, front-running, and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks. Beyond industry-leading security, the bot also offers copy trading, which, just as the name suggests, lets you mirror the trades of professional Solana meme coin traders. For newcomers, this is a game-changer: it not only provides the chance to profit from live price action but also serves as a hands-on way to learn trading strategies by watching the pros call their shots in real time. Understanding $SNORT’s Explode-Worthy Potential & Presale Hype Now in presale, Snorter Token ($SNORT) has already raised over $3.38M from early investors, which is clear evidence of strong institutional interest in what could be the next crypto to explode. Why? Because it’s perfectly positioned to ride the broader meme coin market’s explosive growth. For context, the meme coin segment has expanded more than 61% in the past year alone . And all signs, both fundamental and technical, suggest this number will keep climbing as a full-fledged altcoin boom takes shape. According to our Snorter Token price prediction , the crypto could surge nearly 800% in the months ahead, potentially hitting $0.94 by year-end. The best part? You can still join $SNORT’s presale at just $0.1023 per token. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Snorter Token . Moreover, holding $SNORT also unlocks an entirely new set of exclusive benefits, including: No daily sniping limits Advanced analytics Industry-lowest trading fees of just 0.85% Staking rewards, currently yielding 131% For more details, check out $SNORT’s official website.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is the latest project to attract attention with a meme-powered campaign. Yet its pitch feels more like slogans than substance. BlockDAG (BDAG), in contrast, is showing what a presale can look like when real tools come first. Its Dashboard V4 gives users live trading simulations, wallet tracking, and a platform that feels like a functioning exchange. This sets a higher bar, proving presales can offer more than empty promises. With over $381 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, and miner sales passing $7.8 million from more than 19,350 units, BlockDAG ’s traction is solid. The presale price in batch 29 is $0.0276, delivering a 2,660% ROI since the very first batch. In a market turning toward utility, BlockDAG makes it clear that functionality can begin even before a coin lists publicly. MAGACOIN FINANCE Buzz Raises Questions MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention with bold forecasts of 33x growth and a presale campaign built on meme culture and financial reform slogans. The timing aligns with broader altcoin activity, creating momentum and drawing supporters who connect with its messaging. The presale is thriving on its viral branding and narrative-driven approach. Backers often point to its tokenomics model and energetic marketing push as key reasons for excitement. Yet when it comes to usability, details remain vague. So far, no clear roadmap has been shared, and there are no live demos to show progress. The emphasis is still on cultural branding rather than transparent development. That raises doubts about how the project will perform once trading begins. Some analysts note that the project’s future depends on whether it can shift from meme-driven enthusiasm to practical use cases. Without this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE could struggle to sustain growth beyond the early hype. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 Turns Presale Into Live Trading BlockDAG has changed expectations for presales with its Dashboard V4. Instead of a static purchase page, the dashboard acts like a live trading platform. Users can view real-time BDAG prices, track wallet balances, check purchase history, and interact with an order book that shows instant buy and sell confirmations. The system also includes gamified features. Referral rewards, ranking boards, and wallet statistics keep users engaged long after their initial purchase. The design ensures ongoing interaction while providing full transparency. This approach gives BlockDAG a strong advantage. It creates familiarity with the ecosystem before launch and builds confidence by offering tools that mimic post-launch activity. Few presales give this level of access. The numbers reinforce its success. Over $381 million has been raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, and more than $7.8 million earned from 19,350+ miner sales. Early participants have already seen a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. The coin is priced at $0.0276 in batch 29, with further growth projected ahead of its $0.05 launch price. By connecting presale engagement to real product use, Dashboard V4 is proving that utility can be delivered from the very start. This model is setting a new expectation for how presales should operate. Utility vs Virality: The Defining Factor Presale hype often spreads fast, but long-term results depend on whether a project can back it with tools and usability. MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on cultural virality, yet its lack of visible products or features limits confidence in its lasting impact. BlockDAG takes a different path. Instead of promises, it offers a working system that lets participants simulate trades, analyze wallets, and track referral rewards before launch. This creates value today, not just in theory. With $381 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI, BlockDAG shows momentum based on real interaction. The contrast highlights the difference between speculation and genuine utility. Wrapping Up MAGACOIN FINANCE may continue drawing attention with its bold projections, but without real tools its future remains uncertain. Hype can attract early buyers, but long-term growth requires usable platforms and transparent systems. BlockDAG has already proven its ability to deliver. Dashboard V4 creates a live exchange experience during the presale, eliminating barriers between buying and using. With over $381 million raised and early ROI reaching 2,660%, the numbers speak for themselves. For anyone comparing presales, the choice is clear. One relies on slogans, while the other is already building a complete ecosystem before launch.

Not every project with a familiar name is showing growth, while some new ones are breaking records before hitting major exchanges. People are focusing on clear signals such as strong fundraising, active user bases, developer activity, or ties with global firms. These are the signs that separate hype from genuine strength. The market is shifting quickly, and projects with constant updates are catching more attention every day. This list looks at four names moving ahead this year. BlockDAG is leading with its presale momentum and listing strategy, while Polkadot, VeChain, and Litecoin each bring unique qualities that keep them relevant in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Giant with Exchange Ambitions BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about top altcoins in 2025. Its presale has already raised more than $381 million, with over 25.3 billion coins sold across 29 batches. The current price sits at $0.0276, while early Batch 1 buyers have already seen returns of around 2,660%. Even current participants could see an 81% gain if BDAG lists at $0.05. Analysts suggest that with major exchange support, the price might even reach $1, which has created a strong sense of urgency in the market. But BlockDAG ’s story goes beyond presale figures. The project uses a hybrid Layer-1 setup that merges DAG technology with Proof-of-Work to deliver scalability and security. It is also fully EVM compatible, making it easy for developers to build. Its X1 Mobile Miner App now has more than 2.5 million active users, while over 4,500 developers are working on 300+ decentralized applications. More than 200,000 holders are already part of the network, and sales of over 19,350 mining units have added more than $7.8 million. The most exciting part of its roadmap is the exchange rollout. Confirmed listings include 20 names such as MEXC, BitMart, and LBank. What many are watching closely is the push toward Coinbase and Gemini. A listing on these U.S. platforms would bring instant liquidity and visibility. Among the top altcoins in 2025, BlockDAG shows both massive presale results and a growing ecosystem ready for launch. 2. Polkadot: Governance Shifts and Institutional Focus Polkadot continues to make its mark with both technology and community backing. DOT is trading at about $3.91, moving between $3.84 and $4.01 in daily action. The coin has shown resilience with a 4% rebound from key support levels. While the reveal of Polkadot 2.0 and Gavin Wood’s return sparked mixed opinions, it confirmed strong leadership and vision. Governance changes are another highlight. Proposal 1711, called “Growth Pressure,” includes a hard cap of 2.1 billion DOT, inflation cuts of 33%, and staking reward reductions every two years. These adjustments aim to strengthen long-term stability. Alongside this, Polkadot’s role in cross-chain development continues to support its place as one of the top altcoins in 2025, with both scalability and governance working together. 3. VeChain: Tokenization Deals and Enterprise Adoption VeChain has kept its focus on solving real-world challenges, and 2025 has proven that approach again. VET trades around $0.0243, giving it a lower entry point compared to larger projects. Forecasts show possible movement between $0.0204 and $0.0499, showing a defined range of risk and reward. The biggest highlight is its deal with Franklin Templeton, where VeChain helped tokenize a $780 million fund using the BENJI platform. This is a rare example of blockchain in action with one of the largest asset managers in the world. It shows staying power while many projects fade. VeChain is also listed in several rankings of top altcoins in 2025, thanks to its strong record in supply chain and enterprise tools. This mix of partnerships and practical use gives it a unique appeal in today’s market. 4. Litecoin: Institutional Buzz and ETF Speculation Litecoin has been active for more than a decade, yet 2025 has given it new attention. LTC is trading around $117.61 after reaching highs above $121 and even hitting $129 earlier this month during a 25% surge. This jump was supported by a $100 million buy from MEI Pharma, proving its ongoing relevance. With strong momentum above $110 support, Litecoin shows signs of larger moves ahead. The network has also processed more than 300 million transactions, showing its lasting reliability. Futures open interest is at a record $1.26 billion, and rumors of a Litecoin ETF continue to circulate. If approved, that could draw even more money into LTC. For those tracking the top altcoins in 2025, Litecoin offers both stability and the excitement of fresh speculation. Final Words Choosing the top altcoins in 2025 means weighing fast-moving presales with long-term adoption stories. BlockDAG is already a presale record breaker with millions of users and strong U.S. listing targets. Polkadot shows how governance reforms can support growth, VeChain proves enterprise blockchain adoption with large-scale deals, and Litecoin combines history with new speculation around ETFs. Together, these four coins show how different paths can create value in today’s market. They are not just stories of hype, but examples of real traction that make them some of the most interesting projects to follow this year.

50607677,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79966,1756054904,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Google Gemini Predicts XRP Price if XRPL Secures 20% of Tokenized RWA by 2026,https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-xrp-price-if-xrpl-secures-20-of-tokenized-rwa-by-2026/,"Crypto proponent John Squire has shared Google Gemini’s detailed hypothetical model for XRP’s potential valuation if the XRP Ledger (XRPL) secures a significant share of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) market by 2026. The analysis, supported by figures and projections, focuses on the potential outcomes should XRPL capture 20 percent of the projected RWA on-chain market. Breakdown of the Scenario As shared by Squire, the model begins with an assumption that the total tokenized RWA on-chain market could reach $70 billion by 2026. If the XRPL captures 20 percent of this market, it would control approximately $14 billion worth of tokenized real-world assets. This projection represents a substantial increase from the current RWA value linked to XRPL, which stands at $302.4 million. Google Gemini Projection #XRP Price Could Reach $134.5 if #XRPL Secures 20% of Tokenized RWA by 2026. 1⃣ XRPL RWA Value: $14B (20% of $70B market) 2⃣ Market Cap Projection: $7.99T 3⃣ Price Projection: $134.5 per $XRP This isn’t hype — it’s math. #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/wlQboUqhFO — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 24, 2025 Based on this framework, the market capitalization of XRP is calculated under the assumption that the ratio between RWA value and XRP’s market cap remains consistent. Currently, XRP has a market cap of $172.6 billion alongside $302.4 million in RWA. This equates to a market cap-to-RWA ratio of approximately 570.8. Market Capitalization and Price Calculation Using this ratio, Squire applies the projected $14 billion in XRPL-based RWAs to determine a potential new market capitalization. Multiplying the $14 billion RWA value by the ratio of 570.8 yields an estimated market cap of around $7.99 trillion. This figure represents the projected scale of XRP’s market capitalization should the XRPL achieve the assumed level of adoption in the RWA sector. The next step in the projection involves calculating the potential price of XRP based on the circulating supply. With the supply currently at 59.41 billion XRP, dividing the projected market capitalization of $7.99 trillion by this figure produces an estimated price of approximately $134.50 per XRP token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Data-Driven Projection Squire underscored that the analysis is not rooted in speculative enthusiasm but in mathematical extrapolation of current ratios and market conditions. The projection is built on maintaining the same proportional relationship between XRP’s market capitalization and RWA value as exists today. The post attracted further comments from community members. One response from the X user DaMeta1 noted that “real adoption metrics and on-chain activity often precede price surges,” highlighting that monitoring XRPL’s actual utilization patterns will be critical in assessing whether such a trajectory could materialize. The hypothetical model presented by John Squire offers a framework for considering XRP’s potential price if the XRPL plays a major role in tokenized real-world assets by 2026. While the projection of $134.50 per XRP relies on specific assumptions regarding market size and adoption, it emphasizes the importance of the growing RWA sector and the potential role of blockchain platforms in capturing that value.

Its founder, Eddy Alexandre, is now facing more than $228 million in restitution payments, in addition to $15 million in disgorgement, following a judgment secured by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Church Ties and Crypto Lies The order, issued by US District Judge Valerie Caproni, comes more than three years after Alexandre was first charged and follows his guilty plea in a separate criminal case. Alexandre is already serving a nine-year prison sentence after admitting to commodities fraud in 2023 and swindling almost $250 million from over 25,000 investors. EminiFX was launched in 2021. Many of Alexandre’s investors came from his own circles, as he used his influence in the church and Haitian community to win trust and even enlisted fellow members to recruit participants. The platform promised steady weekly profits ranging between 5% and 9.99% and promoted what it described as a “Robo-Advisor Assisted Account,” which was allegedly capable of generating consistent returns in cryptocurrency and foreign exchange markets through automated trading. Within just eight months, the platform raised about $262 million. Court filings show, however, that the promised technology never existed. Eddy Alexandre’s Fall Investigators found that the company suffered losses of at least $49 million and operated by recycling new investor funds to pay existing participants. Alexandre also withdrew at least $15 million for personal expenses, which included luxury cars, credit card payments, and cash withdrawals. Regulatory action intensified in May 2022, when prosecutors and the CFTC filed parallel cases against Alexandre. The criminal proceeding concluded with a prison term and a $213 million restitution order. The latest civil ruling adds further financial penalties but clarifies that any restitution payments made will offset his disgorgement obligation. A receiver appointed by the court has been working since 2022 to trace and recover funds linked to EminiFX. Earlier this year, the first round of recovered money was returned to investors after a distribution plan received judicial approval. The conclusion of the civil case brings additional clarity to one of the most prominent crypto frauds of the past three years, while recovery efforts continue for thousands of investors who lost funds in the scheme.

Amid this frenzy, the fast-growing Remittix (RTX) project is capturing attention with its real-world use cases and a thriving user base.

While Cardano and XRP price predictions struggle with bearish pressure due to delayed upgrades and market volatility, Remittix is delivering its milestones. This makes it a credible contender for the best crypto to buy now.

ADA price currently trades around $0.86, with charts suggesting a dramatic move may be close as the token creates a narrowing triangle structure. Source: TradingView Bulls could reclaim control if the Cardano price sustains its traction above $0.92. However, Cardano still faces stiff competition from utility-focused projects like Remittix (RTX), increasing demand beyond market hype. Is an XRP Price Prediction to $15 Possible? XRP price prediction has left Ripple investors hopeful. However, the token remains under pressure after failing to leverage crucial recovery zones. As the market eyes XRP regulatory clarity and event-driven catalysts, an XRP price prediction of $15 has been considered.

Analysts Warned,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-do-on-chain-data-show-on-ethereum-eth-now-analysts-warned/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm CryptoQuant has released a new analysis of the notable activity in the Ethereum (ETH) market. According to the company's data, the strong upward wave in the price of ETH is being supported by heavy inflows on the Binance exchange. The analysis noted that net inflow data indicates ETH has been sent to the exchange, which could mean two different things: potential selling pressure or use as collateral for margin trading. It was noted that ETH has reached an all-time high (ATH), but the real question is whether this level can be maintained. Meanwhile, Binance ETH open interest data has reached record levels. This indicates intense speculative activity among investors and an increasingly volatile market. While Bitcoin continues its upward trend, warnings have been issued that Ethereum could be subject to sudden and sharp price fluctuations and frequent long-short traps. Related News: Ethereum Bull Tom Lee Speaks About ETH: Says It's Chance to Surpass Bitcoin CryptoQuant also argued that funding rates remain neutral, creating an uncertain picture. While speculative volumes are peaking, funding remaining neutral means even small price fluctuations can lead to large short or long liquidations. Finally, the analysis noted that the large trading volume on Binance suggests that market sentiment is currently stuck in neutral territory. While the balance between bulls and bears persists, long-short traps are becoming increasingly dangerous. CryptoQuant noted that inflow data should be closely monitored, as continued inflows could lead to a pause in ETH and trigger a new correction wave. *This is not investment advice.

History shows that the most significant moves often come from coins priced under a dollar, where early accumulation can turn modest entries into life-changing gains. With Ethereum still commanding attention at a premium, a wave of smaller, faster, and more agile tokens is poised to steal the spotlight in 2025. This week, whale activity has revealed three clear frontrunners: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), the meme-powered micro-cap with a Layer-2 backbone; Cardano (ADA), rebounding with technical strength; and Hyperliquid (HYPE), breaking records with institutional backing. Together, they represent the cheaper, high-reward alternatives traders can’t afford to ignore. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Micro-Cap Gem Turning Presale Into Power Whales don’t just chase the prominent big names; they hunt value where the crowd hasn’t arrived yet. That’s exactly why Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is becoming a magnet for early-stage accumulation. In Stage 11 of its presale, the project has already raised over $20.89 million, selling more than 13.53 billion tokens, almost double its Stage 1 entry price. This steady climb signals strong demand and sets the stage for a launch with built-in momentum. But LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin running on vibes. It is on an Ethereum Layer-2 structure made to be fast, cheap, and accessible. This approach works well for decentralized apps, games, NFT marketplaces, and trading environments that move quickly. More significantly, it drives the Pepe Launchpad, a one-of-a-kind place where new meme coins can start in the LILPEPE ecosystem. That means continuous liquidity, fresh community inflows, and relevance long after the presale closes. Investors also like what’s under the hood: Zero transaction taxes, keeping trading friction-free. Anti-sniper bot protection, ensuring fairer entry points on launch. The CertiK audit is completed, boosting trust and security. CoinMarketCap listing secured, improving visibility and accessibility. And then there’s the $777,000 giveaway campaign, where 10 winners walk away with $77,000 each in tokens. While this viral push brings in thousands of new supporters daily, whales have quietly filled their bags, anticipating a supply crunch once exchange listings begin. For those looking for a micro-cap with whale energy and meme coin momentum, Little Pepe is a frontrunner. Cardano (ADA): Eyeing a Technical Breakout Toward $1.50 In recent weeks, Iardano has been very strong, with ADA climbing 13% to 16% to get back into the $0.88–$0.98 region. This rally happens simultaneously with a bigger shift in the market toward altcoins, putting ADA close to a key breakthrough level. The $0.88–$0.90 resistance zone is a stubborn ceiling. According to analyst Ali Martinez, a confirmed breach could unlock targets of $1.20 and eventually $1.50. Chart patterns also reveal a series of higher lows since mid-July, a signal of increasing buying pressure. With ADA aligning along its upper channel trendline, sentiment is swinging bullish. Traders now consider the upcoming resistance test at $0.94 critical; break it, and ADA could accelerate toward new mid-range highs. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Setting Records in Whale-Backed Rallies Hyperliquid is dominating the conversation with record-breaking activity. Its native token HYPE trades around $46, just shy of its all-time high of $49.75. Recent whale action underscores the momentum: one transaction converted $23.5 million USDC into $21.45 million worth of HYPE. What’s fueling this? Integrations with Circle’s USDC and custody support from Anchorage Digital are two moves that bolster institutional confidence and liquidity depth. With trading volumes surging into the billions, HYPE is establishing itself as one of the most talked-about tokens of the season. Conclusion: The Cheaper Plays Are Where the Action Is Ethereum may still command headlines, but whale wallets are already signaling where the subsequent major waves are forming. Little Pepe is rising as the early-stage micro-cap has an explosive upside, Cardano is shaping up for a technical breakout, and Hyperliquid is showing what whale-driven momentum looks like in real time. For retail traders, the lesson is simple: whales don’t wait. They position early. With Stage 11 of the LILPEPE presale already 94% sold out, this may be the last window to secure tokens before the next price jump.

Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale is already selling the token for $0.035 today. Investors who purchase the token today have a reasonable possibility of seeing their investment grow by a minimum of 500% within a time frame of a couple of months. Mutuum Finance presale has already raised more than $14.8 million in capital and onboarded over 15600 token holders since inception. While Cardano (ADA) is still a flagship of blockchain infrastructure, news on Mutuum Finance suggest it could be one of the most performing coins in sub-$1 category, generating fresh buzz among traders and analysts. Cardano (ADA): Current Outlook Cardano (ADA) currently trades at $0.85, having seen only mild 24h activity, with an intraday high slightly short of $0.89 and an intraday low at approximating $0.848. As a proof-of-stake, peer-reviewed, research-driven smart contract platform, Cardano continues to evolve in epochs such as Basho and Voltaire, with the goals of scalability and on-chain voting. Its price has recently ping-ponged but remains supported by long-term foundation value and network maturity, offering steady presence within altcoins without yet waiting for stronger catalysts to drive long-term upward movement. Cardano has fallen behind top rivals in its sector like Solana and Ethereum. In addition, the layer 1 chain is now facing increased rivalry in DeFi from newcomers like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The ETH-based token has quickly become one of the most talked about cryptos in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance has managed to list more than 15,600 investors whose total presale raise totals over $14.8 million. The project is now in presale stage 6 at $0.035. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. It is a four-tiered reward i.e., critical, major, minor and low in which each category of risk is being rewarded. It is another feature which gives Mutuum the position of a trendsetter as far as trust generation is concerned both from the perspective of good infrastructure and good security. Mutuum Finance Giveaway: $100K Reward Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 individuals will get $10,000 MUTM. It’s their live giveaway to investors of their new project, and also the project’s way of building a long-term and committed community. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance takes a two-model approach to attaining ultimate flexibility and effectiveness with Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models of lending. Peer-to-Contract is implementing self-execute smart contracts that will loan without any kind of human intervention. They have been designed to act based on changing market prices with an interest rate from then-available demand and supply. Middleman does not exist for Peer-to-Peer model and the borrowers are talking directly to the lenders. Peer-to-Peer model is well liked among meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the top cryptos under $1, raising over $14.8M from 15,600+ holders. Priced at $0.035 during Stage 6, it will rise 14.29% to $0.04 in the next phase, with early buyers in line for 500%+ potential ROI upon release. Backed by a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and twin lending models, MUTM combines security, innovation, and high-growth.

In a post on X, Ex Populus, the parent company behind Xai, noted that the legal action has become necessary as xAI has infringed on its trademark. Xai Claims Brand Confusion Between Gaming and AI Entities Notably, Xai is claiming that there is brand confusion between the two entities in the market and this has led to losses. Although Xai is a blockchain gaming entity while xAI is focused on artificial intelligence , the similarity in names is a source of concern. According to Ex Populus, the court needs to step in as they owe it as a responsibility to the Xai community to protect their brand. They believe that people could mistake the two and rather than connect to the gaming platform, land on Musk’s AI company. For clarity, the Xai space is a blockchain powered network not just for video games but includes digital transactions. It also offers infrastructure to support game logic, reward systems and data management. Given that players, partners and investors alike are familiar with Xai, Ex Populus does not want any traffic shifting from it to Musk’s AI setup, xAI. Ex Populus Highlight Rising Confusion After xAI Gaming Plans Although Musk launched xAI in July 2023, Ex Populus alleged that the confusion of the brand identity reached a peak in November 2024 after xAI revealed it planned to launch a gaming studio. As per the filing, Ex Populus maintains that Xai is losing goodwill in its trademark as a result of the confusion. It also claimed that the legal team of Musk is trying to arm twist it into surrendering its rights by using threats. The gaming entity wants the court to block any attempt by Musk’s company from using the name in gaming or blockchain related manner. Community Reactions Split Over Xai’s Legal Action The lawsuit has sparked mixed reactions among users in the space. Xai community members have hailed the action of protecting the brand and keeping them informed. A user noted that clarity in the Web3 realm remains vital for trust. However, a few others consider it an attention seeking move by Xai to its platform. Regardless of their views, it is worth mentioning that trademark registration is taken seriously. JPMorgan Chase recently filed an application in this regard.

50609466,564190,1756056640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50609466.jpeg,Analysts Sound The Alarm: Fed Rate Cut Hopes May Backfire On Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/analysts-sound-the-alarm-fed-rate-cut-hopes-may-backfire-on-crypto/,"Market confidence over a possible Federal Reserve rate cut has pushed crypto prices higher in recent days, but analysts warn that the mood could flip quickly. According to Santiment, social chatter around the words “Fed,” “rate,” and “cut” has hit an 11-month high, a surge that has historically signaled overly bullish crowd behavior and increased the risk of a sharp pullback. Social Euphoria Raises Red Flags Santiment analyst Brian pointed to a classic market pattern: buy the rumor, sell the news. He noted that while ether led recent gains and bitcoin showed strength, the spike in mentions tied to Fed policy may have pushed sentiment toward euphoria. Positive funding rates and rising chatter can lift prices, yet they also make markets more fragile. When a single theme dominates conversations, history shows that tops can form faster than many expect. On-chain data add fuel to the Fed caution. Reports show that exchange-held bitcoin has climbed by roughly 70,000 coins since early June, reversing a long-term trend of withdrawals to cold storage. According to Santiment, that shift could leave more supply ready to hit the market if sentiment turns. At the same time, daily active addresses and transaction volumes have slipped from prior levels, which leaves some core utility indicators looking muted rather than robust. Bitcoin Technicals Suggest Short-Term Risk Technically, bitcoin traded around $117,000 as it tried to reclaim the $120,000 mark. Fibonacci analysis places the 0.382 retracement at $114,355, a level already under pressure. If selling intensifies, downside targets near $108,200 and $103,800 become plausible. The daily chart shows a breach of an ascending trendline and a failed attempt to stay above the supply zone near $120,000, which means risk management is prudent for anyone carrying large positions. Ethereum Faces Profit-Taking Risk Despite Momentum Funding rates and MVRV readings add to the careful tone. Based on reports, bitcoin’s long-term MVRV stands at +18.5%, a level that suggests moderate risk for new long-term buys. Positive funding rates indicate that traders are leaning long, so that needle could swing quickly when a catalyst reverses. Ethereum’s price action looks healthier, trading near $4,755 with a crucial support zone around $4,550. Santiment flagged the short-term MVRV at roughly +15%, a level often seen as a danger zone for altcoin retracements, while the long-term MVRV at +58% points to elevated potential for profit taking.

Investors are moving funds from Bitcoin to Ethereum , sparking curiosity among traders. This transition hints at growing confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. Find out which coins could be poised for growth and why this trend is gaining traction. Bitcoin Market Update: Mixed Signals and Cautious Trading Bitcoin posted a 3.42% drop over the past month while recording a 24.84% gain over the last six months. The weekly decline of 2.79% underscores recent short-term pullbacks amid overall medium-term strength. Price movements highlight modest near-term setbacks, with resilience in the market reflected in the half-year gains. The current price situation for Bitcoin shows a cautious market environment. Trading within a range of approximately $106,632 to $123,514, the coin faces resistance near $131,225 and support at around $97,462. Additional resistance at $148,107 and support near $80,580 provide trading points. Recent technical indicators suggest bearish short-term signals, while the RSI hovers near 46. Bulls and bears are in close contest, with prices fluctuating in this range. Some traders may look to buy near support and sell at resistance, while others prefer waiting for a clear breakout. Ethereum Price Trends Indicate Strong Growth and Current Market Dynamics Ethereum experienced significant price increases over the last month and six-month period, with gains of 29.18% and 89.92%, respectively. A recent increase of 8.26% over the past week confirmed short-term strength. Price action has shown steady movement within defined ranges, balancing bullish enthusiasm with natural volatility. Historical behavior indicates a consistent recovery and upward movement during these periods, with momentum sustained despite occasional consolidations. This growth pattern highlights an environment that rewards strategic entry points, fostering optimism in both medium and long-term views. Current trading levels show prices moving between $2736.67 and $4301.41, with immediate resistance at $4903.83 and support near $1774.34. A secondary layer of resistance and support is at $6468.57 and $209.61, respectively. Bulls appear to have control within these levels, although key indicators present mixed signals. The relative strength index stands at 65.46, reflecting active buyers, but caution is advised as prices approach resistance zones. Traders might consider long positions near the support area if upward momentum continues, while a breakout above resistance could confirm rising bullish sentiment. Conversely, failure to breach resistance levels may lead to profit-taking and a pullback. Monitoring indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at 471.08 can aid in managing trading decisions.

This article reveals three standout cryptocurrencies that are gaining traction, thanks to increasing institutional interest. Discover the coins poised for remarkable growth and what makes them favorites among serious investors. Mantle (MNT): Strong Monthly Rally and Critical Price Levels for Traders Over the last month, MNT registered an impressive gain of 68.76%, while the six-month period delivered a solid increase of 56.34%. A short-term pullback of 7.65% over the past week highlights a recent dip in an otherwise upward move. These figures underline significant upward momentum in its price trend during the past month and half-year. With a current trading range between $0.58 and $0.88, the key support stands at $0.42 and nearby resistance at $1.01, with secondary levels noted at $0.12 and $1.31. The prevailing market situation shows some bullish energy indicated by the upward monthly surge, but the short-term dip leaves room for a cautious approach. The RSI reading of 61.89 supports a moderately overbought condition, while momentum indicators suggest a measured pace. Traders might focus on trading within the established range, watching for a breakthrough above $1.01 or a fall below $0.42 signaling potential downside. Avalanche Price Momentum and Key Levels Over the last month, Avalanche showed an encouraging gain of around 9.36%, moving within a range from roughly $17.19 to $27.59. The coin's price performance improved over the past six months with a climb of approximately 17.52%, reflecting a gradual upward shift despite intermittent fluctuations. Technical measures, including a rising Awesome Oscillator and moderate momentum, indicate that historical behavior has supported gradual gains while maintaining price variability. Current conditions present a trading range from support near $11.89 to resistance at $32.69. The coin currently hovers within a range around $17.19 to $27.59, setting a boundary for traders. Indicators such as a 58.20 RSI and a 2.19 Momentum Indicator lean toward bullish sentiment, though a balanced summary recommendation around 0.51 suggests neither bulls nor bears dominate. The price has yet to break out into a strong trend, indicating an ongoing contest between buying and selling forces. Traders could consider short-term opportunities with a move above $32.69 or a fallback below $11.89. Chainlink Sees Strong Bullish Movement with Key Support and Resistance Levels Chainlink 's price surged by 44.32% over the past month and nearly 70% in the last six months, indicating robust upward momentum. The coin has traded within a daily range from $13.02 to $20.55, reflecting increased demand. A significant one-week gain of 14.13% contributed to its positive trajectory. Recent price actions demonstrate a steady accumulation of gains, suggesting underlying market strength and rising investor interest. Chainlink is currently near crucial technical levels. The nearest resistance is at $24.18, while support is established at $9.12, indicating potential buying activity if prices maintain above support, with dips providing entry opportunities. Bulls maintain control with recent price movements within the $13.02 to $20.55 range; however, the lack of a clear long-term trend warrants caution. Traders should consider positions above $24.18, aiming for a second resistance at $31.71, while monitoring dips towards $9.12 that could signal risk. A balanced approach with tight stops is advisable amidst recent gains and potential market volatility. Conclusion As the market cap targets $5 trillion, MNT , AVAX , and LINK are emerging as key players. Institutional investors are increasingly turning to these cryptocurrencies. Their adoption can drive growth significantly. MNT shows strong potential in financial services. AVAX offers speed and efficiency for transaction processing. LINK excels in connecting blockchain networks with real-world data. These cryptos are well-positioned for future success. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Exploring the top coins poised to benefit from real-world asset tokenization unveils a promising $1 trillion market opportunity. Discover which cryptocurrencies stand ready to surge as this integration transforms the financial landscape. Avalanche Price Momentum and Key Levels Over the last month, Avalanche showed an encouraging gain of around 9.36%, moving within a range from roughly $17.19 to $27.59. The coin's price performance improved over the past six months with a climb of approximately 17.52%, reflecting a gradual upward shift despite intermittent fluctuations. Technical measures, including a rising Awesome Oscillator and moderate momentum, indicate that historical behavior has supported gradual gains while maintaining price variability. Current conditions present a trading range from support near $11.89 to resistance at $32.69. The coin currently hovers within a range around $17.19 to $27.59, setting a boundary for traders. Indicators such as a 58.20 RSI and a 2.19 Momentum Indicator lean toward bullish sentiment, though a balanced summary recommendation around 0.51 suggests neither bulls nor bears dominate. The price has yet to break out into a strong trend, indicating an ongoing contest between buying and selling forces. Traders could consider short-term opportunities with a move above $32.69 or a fallback below $11.89. Pendle Surges as Bulls Dominate in Altcoin Market Pendle recorded a 10.60% gain in one week and a robust 40.94% rise over the past month, with its six-month performance surging by 104.80%. Price moves between $3.17 and $4.96 reflect dynamic market activity and strong momentum. Historical growth shows steady upward movement with significant gains over both short- and long-term periods, highlighting broad market participation and investor interest. The gradual progression indicates that Pendle has built a solid foundation, marked by consistent recovery within volatile market swings. Current prices are sitting in a range of $3.17 to $4.96, with the nearest resistance at $5.88 and support around $2.30. A second resistance level appears at $7.68, while a lower support level is noted at $0.52. RSI at 65.18 suggests a bullish tilt despite signals hinting at nearing overbought conditions. Bulls are largely in control, driving prices upward, yet the absence of a clear trend calls for measured optimism. Traders may consider entering positions on slight pullbacks near support while watching price actions as they test resistance levels. IOTA Market Overview: Steady Past with Cautious Near-Term Signals IOTA price showed modest rises over the past month and half-year with a 2.05% gain in one month and nearly 2.92% growth in six months. Week-over-week, a slight dip of about 1.87% marked short-term pressure. The coin traded within a range from roughly $0.1391 to $0.2475, reflecting a stable yet restrained upward movement. Indicators over these periods have hinted at a generally improving sentiment with occasional pullbacks. The overall price behavior suggests a slow recovery with gains gradually building momentum against intermittent declines. Current trading sees IOTA fluctuating between clear support at $0.09 and a primary resistance at $0.31 while eyeing a secondary hurdle near $0.41 if demand intensifies. The coin’s price remains within a defined channel, and technical markers present a mixed picture. The Awesome Oscillator sits slightly in the negative while the Momentum Indicator offers a weak positive hint. The RSI holds near the neutral 51 mark, indicating balance between bulls and bears. Trading strategies could involve watching for a steady build-up toward resistance, with buyers looking at support areas for entry, while sellers could target $0.31 for short-term profits. Conclusion AVAX , PENDLE , and IOTA represent strong options in the evolving space of real-world asset tokenization. They offer unique features and use cases that align with traditional finance integration. By leveraging innovative blockchain technology, these coins can potentially transform how assets are managed and traded. These projects could play a significant role in the next wave of financial evolution. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Solana’s incredible journey from $0.04 to over $260 serves as a reminder that life-changing opportunities do exist, for those smart enough to recognize them early. Now, as Ruvi AI (RUVI) approaches a critical milestone with over 90% of Phase 2 sold following its strategic CoinMarketCap listing, analysts are drawing compelling parallels to SOL’s early explosive phases. CoinMarketCap Listing Accelerates Phase 2 Sellout The partnership with CoinMarketCap was the catalyst that transformed Ruvi AI from a promising presale into the crypto community’s most sought-after opportunity. This strategic placement immediately captured institutional attention, triggering a buying surge that has pushed Phase 2 completion past the 90% mark in record time. The numbers tell a compelling story of rapid adoption: $3.1M raised across all presale phases 240M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding community Holder base exceeding 3,000 members and growing daily Phase 2 now over 90% complete with price surge imminent Major trading firms and institutional investors rely on CoinMarketCap for project discovery, and RUVI’s prominent positioning has unlocked access to capital that was previously out of reach. This visibility boost has created the perfect storm for explosive growth potential. Revolutionary Super App Transforming the Creator Economy Unlike speculative tokens that rely purely on hype, Ruvi AI’s value proposition centers on solving real problems within the $104 billion creator economy . The project’s super app represents a comprehensive ecosystem designed to empower content creators with professional-grade tools. Advanced Trend Research : Sophisticated analytics identify viral topics and high-engagement opportunities across multiple platforms, helping creators stay ahead of market demand and maximize their content’s impact. AI-Powered Script Generation : The platform creates compelling, platform-specific scripts optimized for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Shorts, and other formats while maintaining authentic voice and maximizing viral potential. Native Media Creation : Built-in image and video generation tools eliminate expensive third-party software subscriptions, allowing creators to produce professional-quality visuals directly within the ecosystem. Streamlined Workflows : Centralized planning, editing, scheduling, and publishing capabilities create efficient production pipelines that scale with growing content demands. This comprehensive utility attracts YouTubers, TikTokers, marketing agencies, and brands seeking competitive advantages in the rapidly expanding digital content landscape. Clear Price Trajectory Creates Urgency Ruvi AI offers complete transparency in its presale structure, creating natural urgency as key milestones approach: Current price : $0.015 (Phase 2 over 90% complete) Phase 3 launch : $0.020 ( 33% guaranteed increase ) Final presale price : $0.070 The structured approach eliminates guesswork while building investor confidence. The 33% price jump becomes inevitable once Phase 2 concludes , rewarding early participants and setting the stage for continued momentum toward higher valuations. VIP Tiers Unlock Exceptional ROI Potential RUVI’s VIP program rewards significant investments with substantial token bonuses, creating clear pathways to extraordinary returns: VIP 2 ($750 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI . VIP 3 ($1,500 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI . VIP 5 ($7,500 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI . The active leaderboard giveaway adds competitive elements that drive participation and reward top contributors with additional tokens. Institutional-Grade Infrastructure Supports Growth Smart money demands verification and reliable market access. RUVI delivers both through professional partnerships: CyberScope Audit : The completed third-party security audit provides institutional-level assurance that smart contracts are secure and tokenomics are sound. This verification eliminates uncertainty that often prevents major investors from participating in early-stage projects. WEEX Exchange Partnership : The strategic alliance with a major cryptocurrency exchange ensures seamless market access and enhanced liquidity once the presale concludes. This partnership guarantees token holders have clear, reliable trading pathways from launch day. The Solana Window Is Closing With Phase 2 over 90% sold and the CoinMarketCap listing driving unprecedented interest, the opportunity for ground-floor entry is disappearing by the hour. The convergence of institutional visibility, audit credibility, exchange backing, and genuine utility creates perfect conditions for the kind of explosive growth that made Solana legendary. For crypto enthusiasts seeking exposure to the next generational wealth opportunity, the 33% price surge awaits the moment Phase 2 sells out. The real question isn’t whether RUVI can achieve Solana-level success, it’s whether investors will secure their stake before the broader market recognizes this opportunity.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss Ether climbed about 20% since the start of August, trading at $4,745 at the time of publication. Prices even pierced $4,860 after dovish remarks from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium, a move that many in crypto see as a possible spark for more gains. Historic September Pullbacks According to CoinGlass, history offers a cautionary note: there have been only three cases since 2016 where Ether rose in August and then slid in September. In 2017, Ether jumped 92% in August and then dropped 20% the following month. In 2020, August gains of 25% were followed by a 17% pullback in September. And in 2021, a 35% climb in August gave way to a 12% slip in September. CryptoGoos, a trader on X, summed it up bluntly: seasonality in September during post-halving years tends to be negative. $ETH seasonality in September during post-halving years is typically negative. Will this time be different? pic.twitter.com/h9hJ40V3np — CryptoGoos (@crypto_goos) August 22, 2025 That pattern does not mean a repeat is guaranteed. Reports have disclosed that both market structure and investor profiles are different now than in those earlier years. In 2016 and 2020, short-term losses in September were followed by multi-month recoveries, with Ether posting upside in the final three months of those years. So while history matters, it does not decide outcomes on its own. New Money, New Dynamics Flows into spot Ether ETFs this month have been large enough to grab attention. Based on reports from Farside, spot Ether ETFs saw roughly $2.70 billion net inflows in August, while spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced about $1.2 billion in net outflows over the same period. At the same time, companies that hold crypto on their balance sheets now control a sizable chunk of Ether. Reports show total Ether held by treasury companies topped $13 billion in value on Aug. 11. Arkham reported that BitMine chairman Tom Lee bought another $45 million of Ether, lifting BitMine’s stack to $7 billion. Those numbers change the math. Big institutional stacks and ETF demand can make sharp, short-term moves more persistent than in prior cycles. Capital appears to be rotating; Bitcoin dominance has fallen 5% over the past 30 days to 55%, which market participants mostly attribute to funds moving into assets beyond Bitcoin.

Should We Worry?",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-historically-the-xrp-bull-market-is-over-should-we-worry/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-respected crypto analyst on X, has shared a monthly chart showing that XRP may have exhausted its bullish momentum. The analyst wrote, “Timewise, the #XRP bull market is over,” asking, “Should we worry?” XRP’s Bull Market Timeline The chart compares the current cycle with two previous bull runs, highlighting a crucial similarity between all three. The labels show each advancement lasting one year. The first spanned 12 bars (365 days), and ran from early 2017 to early 2018, sending XRP to its previous all-time high of $3.36. The second bull run lasted 13 bars (396 days), culminating in 2021 with a peak of $1.96, a crucial level for the asset until late 2024. The latest window on his graphic runs a similar length from 2024 to 2025. The chart shows that the bull cycle has run for another 13 bars. In this cycle, XRP hit a new all-time high of $3.65 . However, it failed to reach the double-digit targets many analysts had predicted. However, Steph’s point is that the market has likely consumed the typical time allocation for an XRP bull phase, even if price targets remain debated. While Steph does not explicitly claim that the next move must be lower, it suggests that another attempt to climb may face tougher conditions unless new catalysts extend the timeline . He leaves open the question of risk management, asking if concern is warranted rather than declaring a price top. Timewise, the #XRP bull market is over. Should we worry? pic.twitter.com/wmLrJVtOrr — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 24, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Army Weighs In One user predicted a turn in October, implying a near-term pivot that challenges the idea that the window has already closed. Many others shared this view, with one commenter suggesting that Steph move the current timeline 3 bars to the right, extending the bull cycle by 3 months. The current chart suggests that XRP began its bull run in August 2024, around the time of Judge Torres’ ruling that Ripple pay $125 million to the SEC . However, the digital asset did not show sustained momentum until November, and starting the timeline from that point suggests the asset can still surprise investors before the year ends. Others also urged flexibility. One commenter noted that cycles can shift and argued that resilience matters more than rigid timelines. While XRP has repeated this cycle twice, the crypto market moves fast, and while its momentum has stalled recently, the asset may change direction before anyone realizes.

If completed, the purchase would add to two smaller transactions already made this month, marking a rare departure from the company’s history of large-scale acquisitions. The most recent buy took place on August 18, when Strategy purchased 430 BTC for roughly $51.4 million. That brought its total holdings to 629,376 BTC, worth over $72 billion at current market prices. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Surge in Value According to monitoring site SaylorTracker, Strategy’s Bitcoin investment has generated an unrealized gain of more than 56%, equating to $25.8 billion at present valuations. Despite scaling back the size of recent purchases, Strategy continues to dwarf all other corporate Bitcoin holders, maintaining its status as the largest treasury by a wide margin. So far in August, the company has added only 585 BTC, far below the thousands or even tens of thousands it typically acquires in single transactions. Advocating Bitcoin to Institutions Michael Saylor has become one of the most prominent advocates of Bitcoin in the corporate world. His push to “orange-pill” both institutional and retail investors has helped shift attitudes in finance, positioning Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. Strategy’s ongoing purchases reinforce its commitment to that narrative, even as broader equity markets face challenges. Purchases Do Not Move Markets One common question is whether Strategy’s large-scale buying activity impacts Bitcoin’s market price. Shirish Jajodia, the company’s corporate treasurer, recently addressed the issue in a podcast interview with Natalie Brunell. He explained that Strategy uses over-the-counter (OTC) channels and private deals rather than buying on open spot exchanges. This method avoids sudden price spikes and prevents significant disruption to Bitcoin’s liquidity. “Bitcoin’s trading volume is over $50 billion in any 24 hours — that’s huge volume,” Jajodia said. “So, if you are buying $1 billion over a couple of days, it’s not actually moving the market that much.” Stock Performance Faces Pressure While the company’s Bitcoin position continues to grow in value, Strategy’s stock has struggled in recent months. Shares fell to around $325 on Wednesday, the lowest in nearly four months, before recovering to $358 by Friday. The decline reflects wider challenges facing Bitcoin-related equities, as treasury-focused firms see their share prices closely tied to crypto sentiment. Still, the company has signaled it will continue adding to its Bitcoin reserves regardless of stock performance, maintaining its conviction that BTC represents the strongest long-term store of value. Long-Term Commitment Remains Clear Despite volatility in both crypto and equity markets, Strategy’s stance on Bitcoin remains unwavering. The company’s purchases this month may be smaller, but they underline a strategy of consistent accumulation that has made it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder worldwide. As Saylor signals yet another buy, Strategy is reaffirming its role at the forefront of Bitcoin adoption among institutions, even as the market weighs short-term risks.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-24 18:27:04

By 2028, IOTA may achieve a peak price of $0.927051 with an average price of $0.86911. In 2031, the target price for IOTA is between $1.39 and $1.51, with an average price of $1.45. There are many speculations and predictions about the IOTA Price Prediction trend, which is involved by the growing use cases of IOTA. For one, the design of the network eliminates all transaction fees. Additionally, the network is high-speed. Combined, IOTA has near-unlimited scalability. It’s also far more energy-efficient than blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Investors expressed concerns about MIOTA’s prospects and whether it has the potential to compete with others in the cryptocurrency market. Iota uses a distributed ledger different from others called Tangle. Tangle technology is blockless, using ledger and IoT applications. It doesn’t require mining or other energy-consuming equipment. The tangle technology is a Directed Acrylic Graph. As the blockchain grows, the assets needed to maintain it reduce. This trend is different from what is obtainable for most cryptocurrencies. As the network grows to accommodate more end-users, Tangle transactions become faster and safer. There has never been anything like IOTA; so much interest is in IOTA price prediction and forecast. Many crypto giants are interested in how MIOTA grows, with several predictions for its future.

IOTA is a good investment, as many market analysts predict a price hike in the coming years. The adoption of IOTA will increase in the coming years as it has many potential use cases. Coupled with your research you can invest in IOTA; the predictions are not investment advice. Governmental bodies worldwide increasingly explore decentralized identity (DID) solutions to bolster security measures and safeguard citizens’ interests. The thriving semiconductor hub of Taiwan has taken a significant step in this direction, engaging in discussions with IOTA, a leading player in the field of decentralized technology, to explore the integration of decentralized ID solutions. It is expected that IOTA/USD will reach a maximum value of $0.54078 by the end of 2026. Why is IOTA down? The IOTA/USD crypto pair price dropped following a small correction. The overall downtrend is intact, and IOTA is shedding moderately. However, we expect the IOTA price to improve over the next week. Will IOTA recover? IOTA has been dipping since December; nevertheless, the decrease in price levels is gradual, with bullish periods in between. Overall, most altcoins are on a downtrend if observed over the larger picture in the crypto market, and there are equal chances of a price reversal in the upward direction as the coin has been recovering for the past week. Will IOTA reach $0.50? Reaching $0.500 is not impossible, but it may take some time. IOTA will have to surpass several crucial resistance levels to reach this level. Considering IOTA’s current price action and market conditions, the token may reclaim the $0.500 mark by the end of 2026. Will IOTA reach $1? Per analysts’ price predictions, IOTA is likely to reach $1 in the next 3 years, and it is expected to reach $1 by the start of 2029. Will IOTA reach $10? The market expects a lower chance of reaching this level within the next five years. If market sentiment remains positive, the maximum IOTA can reach is a little above $1.51 by 2031. Does IOTA have a good long-term future? IOTA is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years. Currently, the coin is trading in its lower price envelope. However, the token is expected to reach $1.31 by 2030 and $1.51 by 2031, which makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains.

IOTA historic price sentiment IOTA price history Established in 2015, the project initiated an ICO in the same year to secure funding for its development. This ICO raised around $590K by selling 1,000,000,000 IOTA coins at $0.00059 per coin. The earliest available IOTA price data on CoinMarketCap dates back to 18 June 2017, when it was recorded at $0.5923. During this period, the market capitalization reached approximately $1.17 billion. Subsequently, IOTA entered a rapid growth phase, surging to an all-time high of $5.69 and a market capitalization of $14.12 billion on 19 December 2017. However, this upward momentum was short-lived, and the price experienced a notable decline, reaching a low of $0.2131 by December 2018. In 2019, IOTA did not make a stride and traded between $0.250 and $0.577. In 2020, IOTA hit its lowest price at $0.07962. Its value remained below $0.5 until the onset of the most recent bullish crypto market in the first quarter of 2021. In February 2021, IOTA witnessed a significant price spike, although it fell short of reaching its all-time high. The ascent halted at $2.5142 due to resistance, disappointing numerous investors. Subsequently, the price declined, briefly recovering to $1.8 before further descending. In 2023, the token’s price remained low, with a few small bumps seen in January and late November. The token closed the year trading at $0.302. IOTA started 2024 with a subsiding bullish wave, as its value fell from $0.288 to $0.218 in January. Around mid-February, the token again started a bullish round and recovered back to the $0.250 range while spiking to $0.313 till the start of March. IOTA recorded the highest price of $0.414 on March 11, 2024, which was the highest for the year till now in a bull market. • The IOTA token fell to the $0.222 range by mid-April and traded near this value for May 2024. At the start of June 2024, IOTA started another bearish cycle and slipped to $0.152 at the start of July. The token traded near this range till the start of November, when it touched a low of $0.101 before starting a recovery phase. By analyzing the past performance, the recovery that started in November saw a peak price when IOTA increased to $0.493 on December 4, 2024. In January 2025, IOTA traded at $0.278 after strong corrections. In April, IOTA sank to its lowest price of $0.130, but it spiked to $0.256 in the months of May and July.

Bitcoin is stablizing after making new cycle highs while liquidity rotates into the leading altcoins. Investors are taking a fresh look at the potential performance of top-layer networks and settlement tokens heading towards 2026. As macro conditions change, the focus is on a select few names for potential momentum. While legacy tokens are gaining traction, attention is also shifting towards new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts point out that the project will ride the 2025 wave and has strong upside potential. XRP price predictions into 2030 Ripple’s XRP is one of the most contentious cryptocurrencies, with many in the crypto community debating which side is in the right. Even after all these years and all the regulatory issues, you can expect steady rise across the second half of this decade. As per long-term estimate by CoinCodex, XRP may jump to $3.47 by 2025. After gaining momentum gradually, it may also peak at $10.12 by 2030. It will translate into a 251% gain from the current level. XRP is appealing due to its established use case for cross-border settlement and financial infrastructure. Nevertheless, even with bullish momentum, the analysts frame XRP as offering a moderate upside of 2-3x in the medium term. This steady movement attracts institutions but has retail traders wondering if more profit lies elsewhere. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart In light of these tempered forecasts, more and more analysts are picking MAGACOIN FINANCE as the surprise story in 2025. Independent forecasts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE will provide exposure to as much as 40x gains, which is in stark contrast to the 2–3x upside of established tokens. The project uses scarcity-driven tokenomics with strong compliance credentials built on Ethereum. Momentum is building rapidly as allocation rounds close at record speed. Strategists see its early-stage trajectory similar to Solana and XRP’s in their breakout cycles but, this time, the ecosystem is getting launched directly into an era of institutional demand. Confidence has further been boosted by the capped supply and external audit backing, with many viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a once-in-cycle opportunity timing the market rotation perfectly. Solana price outlook for 2025–2030 As one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems in the market, Solana has continued to perform well thanks to its throughput capacity and developer community. By the end of 2025, Solana price forecast models suggest that the price of Solana could be around $213, only translating to an 18% ROI from current levels. By 2030, Solana may indeed rise to $439, representing an increase of 142% from where it is priced today. Solana is credible. Its growth trajectory now levels compared to its breakout cycle in 2021. Thus, most analysts forecast Solana to give returns but not replicate the parabolic moves of its early adoption phase. Polkadot predictions into 2030 Polkadot has established itself as a cross-chain interoperability solution. However, it isn’t as popular as Solana or XRP. According to forecast models, DOT price is expected to hit $4.00 to $4.50 by 2025. It would then gradually increase to $5.35 by 2030. This only offers a 39% ROI over the next five years. Hence, DOT is expected to grow slower than its peers. Despite the fact that technology is still respected, the general feeling of the market indicates that Polkadot is overhyped. The muted upside predictions reveal this reality, with DOT being perceived as a long-tail infrastructure asset rather than a market leader. Comparing legacy upside with new momentum When stacked side by side, the difference becomes clear. XRP may rise due to demand for its utilities, Solana may retain its spot as the developer’s favourite, and Polkadot may remain a low-key infrastructure play. None of them are ready to offer exponential returns. The new narrative is increasingly being allocated to MAGACOIN FINANCE, where forecasts undoubtedly outstrip those of bigger-cap peers. It is this contrast, modest, predictable gains from the majors versus high-multiple potential from new entrants, that is driving portfolio allocation strategies in Q4. Many traders are balancing the risk of security against the upside – for an increasing number of them, the balance is tilting towards emerging names with branding power and scarcity models. Closing thoughts Through the fourth quarter of 2025, XRP, Solana, and Polkadot are likely to continue a steady upward trajectory, although their growth will remain limited due to size and maturity. When it comes to MAGACOIN FINANCE things are looking really good as analyst predict a 40x return on momentum here. If you’re looking for an alternative to the standard 2–3x gains of the established majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the project to watch as the market approaches 2026.

XRP Price Overview and Outlook XRP is currently trading at around $2.85, showing a moderate daily decline with intraday volatilities between $2.84 and $2.95. The price is hovering below the crucial $3 psychological barrier, as recent sell-outs from whales and uncertainty surrounding pending regulatory decisions keep its upsurge in check. But analysts point to technical indicators such as chart fractals, and whale activity on-chain suggesting sell-pressure could be easing, setting the stage for a run to the $4+ zone if resistance is overcome Investors FOMO into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6. More than $14.8 million has been raised and more than 15600 early investors are buying tokens. Token value at Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, up by 14.3% from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently announced its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Its users are expected to receive a share of the program’s reward of $50,000 USDT in case they manage to find potential bugs on the project. The bounty program is intended to provide equal safety to all types of vulnerabilities. The program consists of four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Announces Huge Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also unveiled a $100,000 giveaway where the players will be rewarded in the form of $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. The project is also audited and verified by CertiK. The Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance’s non-custodial lending protocol enables decentralized lending with which the users have complete ownership of their assets while lending. After lending, lenders earn passive returns and borrrowers obtain funds automatically by collateralizing diversified assets during the lending. Systematic rate adjustment by the system maximizes capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a double-lending scenario with best-in-class flexibility to users in the form of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is driven by smart contracts to handle lending pools that dynamically adjust levels of interest in perfect synchronization with the market. Lenders receive secured returns, and the borrowers have secure options on borrowing capital on loan. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) eliminates intermediaries through direct interaction between lending parties and borrowing agents. Risky assets like meme coins require such a totally decentralized system that provides users with maximum autonomy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has secured over $14.8M from 15,600+ investors and is priced at $0.035 in Stage 6, which will grow 14.29% to $0.04. Early backers will have 400%+ ROI upon listing, supported by a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK bug bounty, and a robust dual lending system. Grab your MUTM tokens today before the next stage comes.

50611739,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791076,1756060260,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50611739.jpeg,Ethereum L2 Layer Brett Can Flip Cardano And XRP This Season As Analysts Say The Meme Coin Will 250x,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-l2-layer-brett-can-flip-cardano-and-xrp-this-season-as-analysts-say-the-meme-coin-will-250x/,"An air of quiet turbulence now envelops long-standing altcoins. Cardano stalls in tight ranges while XRP struggles to reclaim momentum in the rested shadows of its legal vindication. But it’s a different story for the new utility-driven L2 meme solution, Layer Brett. Far from the carbon-copy explosion of prior meme moves, Layer Brett ‘s Ethereum-based DeFi primitives and blazing staking yields are rewriting expectations. Its golden leap from the old guard has quickly earned it a million-dollar raise in ongoing presale, and analysts say it is the next 250x meme coin. Cardano : Trapped Between Support and Resistance Cardano price analysis. Source: MiTrade Cardano’s latest price action reflects a choppy equilibrium. ADA completed a bearish AB=CD harmonic at around $0.95, triggering rejection and signaling potential fatigue at recent highs. Currently trading just under the 9-day EMA of $0.88, momentum looks fragile, suggesting that bulls are struggling to break free of the short-term downtrend. Support lies in the $0.74–$0.77 zone. A breach there would expose deeper losses, potentially dragging ADA into the mid-$0.70s. Still, analysts note that if ADA can reclaim $0.90, it might revive bullish conviction and aim for retracement targets around $1.06, a move anchored in the 38.2% Fibonacci level. Until then, the Cardano price prediction for the season remains a cautious stalemate, balancing on a knife-edge between breakout and retrace. XRP : Weakening Confidence Amid Legal Afterglow XRP 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite its regulatory victory, XRP’s short-term trajectory feels strained. Recent trading patterns show whales dumping 460 million XRP, primarily from the 10–100 million holder tier, pushing price down into the $2.80–$2.85 support area. Meanwhile, mid-tier wallets absorbed 130 million tokens , indicating some accumulation. Technically, XRP has broken below its 50-day SMA (~$2.95) and slipped out of a symmetrical triangle pattern , signaling tactical weakness. The formation of a descending triangle on the 4-hour chart further reinforces downside risk. A breach of the flat support could propel XRP toward $2.60 or lower, where past volume clusters provide a plausible cushion. Despite these headwinds, XRP’s long-term uptrend remains intact. Layer Brett: Where Utility Meets Meme Culture Dogecoin rode viral waves, while Pepe and others fizzled as hype outpaced utility. Layer Brett emerges with a different blueprint: meme identity fueled by structured functionality. Built on Ethereum Layer-2, Layer Brett benefits from low friction and high throughput, delivering the speed and scalability missing in earlier meme plays. The token embeds staking, governance, and gamified NFT layers into its DNA, transforming meme culture into an ecosystem. By capping supply and allocating a significant slice to community rewards, the coin aligns investor incentives with network strength, not speculation cycles. Its presale has already exceeded $1 million in contributions, with token price climbing from $0.004 to $0.0047, and holder count expanding steadily. This growth isn’t just trend chasing—it’s being driven by staking mechanics crafted to reward early adopters with astronomical yields. Analysts now voice bold projections of 250x upside potential on the premise that Layer Brett is not simply another meme token, but a juggernaut built on infrastructure and narrative. As sources of capital grow wary of the stagnation in projects like Cardano and XRP, LBRETT’s utility and engagement model may be cementing its place as the meme coin of this cycle. Conclusion Cardano remains range-bound, teetering between breakdown risk and hesitant recovery. XRP, while structurally sound in the long run, finds its short-term trend tested by profit-taking and technical fragility. In contrast, Layer Brett fulfills multiple roles: it offers meme-coin energy, Ethereum-level scalability, and a novel staking economy to back hype with mechanics. That’s exactly what had analysts tipping it to grow 250x from its current presale price at $0.0047. Layer Brett is still in presale, but it won’t be forever. Get in now before prices rise and rewards drop.

With a successful CyberScope audit completed and a strategic CoinMarketCap listing driving unprecedented demand, this audited AI token is positioning itself as the breakout investment opportunity of 2025. Smart money is taking notice, and the numbers speak volumes about RUVI’s potential to replicate BNB’s extraordinary performance. CoinMarketCap Listing Triggers Institutional Frenzy The strategic partnership with CoinMarketCap has catapulted Ruvi AI from a promising presale into the spotlight of serious institutional attention. Just as Binance Coin gained credibility through strategic platform partnerships, RUVI’s premium CMC placement has immediately captured the interest of sophisticated investors who recognize the early signs of explosive growth potential. The market response has been nothing short of remarkable: $3.1M raised with institutional-grade velocity 240M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global community Holder base exceeding 3,000 members and growing exponentially Phase 2 now over 90% complete with imminent price surge This isn’t speculative retail buying, it’s the kind of strategic accumulation that preceded BNB’s legendary ascent from modest beginnings to crypto stardom. CyberScope Audit Provides BNB-Level Security Foundation The successful completion of a comprehensive CyberScope audit establishes the institutional-grade credibility that separated Binance Coin from countless other exchange tokens. This rigorous third-party verification confirms that smart contracts meet the highest security standards, providing the same foundation of trust that sophisticated investors demanded before committing to BNB’s early growth phases. This proactive approach to security removes the primary barrier preventing major capital from entering early-stage opportunities, creating perfect conditions for the sustained institutional participation that fueled BNB’s remarkable journey to 100x returns. Creator Economy Super App Powers Real-World Utility While BNB built its utility through exchange ecosystem integration, Ruvi AI targets immediate value creation within the massive $104 billion creator economy . The project’s comprehensive super app provides content creators with professional-grade tools that generate instant utility and sustainable demand. Advanced Trend Research : Sophisticated analytics identify viral topics and high-engagement opportunities across multiple platforms, helping creators maximize reach and monetization potential while staying ahead of algorithm changes. AI-Powered Script Generation : The platform creates compelling, platform-specific scripts optimized for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Shorts, and other formats while maintaining authentic voice and maximizing viral potential. Native Media Creation : Built-in image and video generation capabilities eliminate expensive third-party software subscriptions, allowing creators to produce professional-quality visuals directly within the ecosystem. Streamlined Workflows : Centralized planning, editing, scheduling, and publishing tools create efficient production pipelines that scale with growing content demands. This comprehensive utility creates sustainable demand from YouTubers, TikTokers, marketing agencies, and brands, the type of organic adoption that supported BNB’s transition to extraordinary valuations. Clear Path to BNB-Style Returns Ruvi AI offers complete transparency in its presale structure, creating natural urgency while providing clear milestones toward extraordinary returns: Current price : $0.015 (Phase 2 over 90% complete) Phase 3 launch : $0.020 ( 33% guaranteed increase ) Final presale price : $0.070 The 33% price jump becomes inevitable once Phase 2 concludes , providing immediate validation of the investment thesis while building momentum toward higher valuations. This structured approach mirrors the disciplined tokenomics that supported BNB’s sustainable growth trajectory to 100x returns. VIP Tiers Enable BNB-Level Wealth Creation RUVI’s VIP program rewards significant investments with substantial token bonuses, creating pathways to the extraordinary returns that made early BNB holders wealthy: VIP 2 ($750 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI . VIP 3 ($1,500 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI . VIP 5 ($7,500 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI . The active leaderboard giveaway adds competitive elements that drive participation and reward top contributors with additional tokens. WEEX Partnership Ensures Market Infrastructure The strategic alliance with WEEX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, guarantees seamless market access and enhanced liquidity once the presale concludes. This partnership mirrors the exchange relationships that supported BNB’s successful market debut, ensuring token holders have reliable trading pathways for efficient price discovery throughout the journey to potential 100x returns. The BNB 100x Opportunity Returns With Phase 2 over 90% complete and the CoinMarketCap listing driving institutional demand, all conditions align for the explosive growth that made BNB legendary. The convergence of audit credibility, genuine utility, strategic partnerships, and guaranteed price appreciation creates perfect conditions for RUVI to deliver the transformative 100x returns that early BNB investors enjoyed. The 33% price surge awaits the moment Phase 2 sells out, but analysts recognize this as just the beginning of a journey designed to mirror BNB’s legendary 100x performance.

It turns out that the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) controls almost 80% of the entire decentralized perpetual futures market. Such a massive growth is a reflection of the rapidly growing dominance of Hyperliquid over its rival. Hyperliquid Outperforms dYdX With 11 Team Members In just one year, Hyperliquid has successfully risen to become the leading decentralized perpetual futures platform. It handles as much as $30 billion in daily trades, which represents almost 80% of the perp futures market’s trading volume, according to Redstone . This is a feat that not many DEXes have been able to achieve, even though it has only 11 people on the team. For instance, dYdX recorded 30% trading volume across DEXes in early 2024. Unfortunately, the share fell to around 7% by the end of that year, coinciding with the period when Hyperliquid’s share stabilized above 65%, per CoinGecko’s data. Hyperliquid’s Features Stands Out Among DEXes Hyperliquid stood out from the beginning due to its decision to start avoiding venture capital. Combined with timing, this decision gave the DEX an opening it exploited faster than most of its counterparts. Features like one-click trading, zero gas fees, and sub-second order finalization all make Hyperliquid feel closer to a centralized exchange than most DEXs. This has been instrumental in attracting both retail and professional traders to the platform. Even with the public criticism from high-stake crypto trader James Wynn, Hyperliquid has excelled. While all these feats are worthy of applause, its trading volume concentration raises concerns. The concerned parties are worried about how sustainable such growth is as well as the potential risks if trading volumes decline. Hyperliquid Liquidations Triggers Loss For Ethereum Trader A few days ago, Hyperliquid faced massive liquidations , erasing millions of fortunes built up over months of trading. Remarkably, a particular trader turned an initial $125,000 investment into more than $43 million at its peak. This trader ended up with almost $7 million in profits. With a market pullback, the trader’s long position on Ethereum (ETH) was liquidated, as reported by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain. Unfortunately, the trader recorded a $6.22 million loss, with only about $771,000 left. As a result of the losses, nearly four months of gains were erased in two days.

The daily chart from Bitstamp shows XRP consolidating between $2.50 and $3.50 after a period of strong upward movement earlier in July. The pattern, formed by converging trendlines, indicates that the price is nearing a point where a decisive breakout could occur. As of the time of the post, XRP was trading around $3.04 with moderate trading volume. The chart highlights how XRP has been testing both the upper and lower boundaries of this formation throughout August. A breakout above the resistance could potentially validate JackTheRippler’s forecast of a strong upward move, while a breakdown would challenge this outlook. The image he shared reinforces the idea of XRP being at a decisive moment in its current trajectory. Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you. #XRP is on the brink of reaching $8-$10! Never forget when I told you to buy XRP at 10 cents. pic.twitter.com/rxi339eXnW — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 24, 2025 Price Prediction and Historical Reference Alongside the chart, JackTheRippler made a bold prediction, stating, “Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you. XRP is on the brink of reaching $8-$10!” His statement connects the current technical setup with his long-standing bullish stance on XRP. He also reminded his followers of his earlier call when XRP was trading near $0.10, suggesting that those who acted at that time have already seen substantial gains and may witness further price appreciation. This reference to XRP’s historical price level underlines the scale of his forecast. From $0.10 to his new target of $8–$10 represents an enormous projected return. At the present price of approximately $3.04, the move to $8–$10 would still mean more than doubling in value from current levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses The post attracted responses from other members of the XRP community . A commenter under the name TreDot64 said , “I just wish I knew at 10 cents… I’ve only learned about XRP 6 months ago…” This sentiment reflects a common feeling among newer market participants who only became aware of the asset after it had already risen significantly. Another reply from Maven emphasized JackTheRippler’s history of consistent optimism toward XRP, saying , “You’ve been calling it from the start those who listened at 10 cents are smiling big right now! And there’s a lot more to come.” This response underscores the continued confidence among some XRP supporters who view the recent consolidation as a precursor to further gains. JackTheRippler’s prediction relies heavily on the idea that XRP is consolidating before its next major price move. Whether or not this projection comes to pass will depend on several factors, including market sentiment, broader cryptocurrency trends, and continued adoption of XRP in financial applications . However, his tweet highlights the level of optimism within the XRP community and the attention traders are giving to the current chart structure.

Analysts suggest that while DOGE may reach $0.75 in the next 90 days, some $0.10 altcoins could surpass $1 first, driven by real utility and market adoption. Dogecoin Price Eyes $0.75 With Technical Momentum Dogecoin has consistently printed higher lows over recent months, showing that buyers are defending key support zones. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, “Holding the $0.21–$0.22 base is critical for DOGE to maintain its recovery trajectory.” The coin is consolidating in bullish patterns such as a converging triangle and cup-and-handle, signaling potential upward moves. Short-term indicators are pointing positively, with the RSI climbing from oversold territory. Analyst Zeinab adds, “The major resistance near $0.29 will be pivotal. Breaking above this could mirror previous rallies, potentially pushing DOGE toward $0.80 by Q4 2025.” Kaspa Price Steady, Eyes Short-Term Rally Kaspa price has also started to capture investor attention as it trades at $0.09048 with daily volumes approaching $99.6 million, reflecting steadily growing liquidity. Momentum has been building quietly, and with trading volumes on the rise, the Kaspa price may see short-term breakouts if interest continues to expand across exchanges. With the Kraken listing stabilizing liquidity and trading activity showing upward trends, Kaspa price could be poised for significant gains ahead of more widespread adoption, potentially crossing key price thresholds before some of the more established $0.10-level competitors. Why Remittix Might Outpace DOGE and Kaspa Remittix (RTX) is currently priced at $0.0969, with over 616 million tokens sold and more than $21 million raised, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing altcoins of 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is designed for cross-border payments and real crypto-to-fiat transactions, giving it utility beyond speculation.

50613427,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791322,1756063048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50613427.jpeg,"Powell signals rate cuts as soon as next month, causing government bonds to rally",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bond-market-runs-on-fed-cut-bets/,"U.S. government bonds went up Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank might cut interest rates as soon as next month. But with important inflation and jobs data still to come, markets could shift again before the Fed’s September 17 meeting. Powell pointed to ending the eight-month pause in easing, saying labor-market risks may “warrant adjusting our policy stance.” Treasuries rallied, and the gap between short and long maturities widened by the most in four years. Markets stopped short of calling a cut a certainty. Futures put the odds of a quarter-point move in September near 80%. Yields, though lower, did not break this month’s lows as traders waited for employment and inflation reports due before the decision. The move showed the Fed weighing a weakening job market against the risk that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push inflation up again. All eyes on inflation gauge and bond auctions The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge may show firm pressures, and Treasury auctions of two-, five-, and seven-year notes will test demand. “Powell solidifies market expectations of a cut in September,” said Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. “It’s less about whether the move comes in September or October. We don’t know what the next six months will look like. It’s still going to be an environment of mixed data, keeping the bond market on edge.” Short-dated yields led Friday’s move, as per Bloomberg . The two-year note fell 10 basis points to 3.7%, near its early-August low after a weak jobs report. In swaps, traders priced two quarter-point reductions by year-end, with a small chance of a third, as reported by Cryptopolitan. That pricing “is the appropriate reaction,” said John Briggs, head of U.S. rates strategy at Nataxis North America, but “anything further than two-and-a-half cuts being priced before we get to payrolls is too aggressive.” The shift fueled curve-steepening wagers that short rates will drop faster than long ones as easier policy supports growth, and pushed the spread between five- and 30-year yields to the widest since 2021. Investors choose short-term bonds over long-term ones Investors remain more comfortable in shorter maturities, which could rally when the Fed starts easing. Longer Treasuries draw less demand because they are more exposed to future inflation and the swelling deficit. The stance has also served as protection against pressure on the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell and threatened to fire Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage-fraud allegations. Cook said she would not bow to pressure to step down. Such attacks on the central bank’s independence unsettle markets. “The front end now has Chair Powell on its side, and yields there should stay down,” said Padhraic Garvey of ING, who oversees research in the Americas. “The long end is not loving this,” he added, saying it “likely reflects a suspicion that the Fed could be taking risks with inflation here.” Another risk is cutting while inflation is sticky — and may rise — which could cap how far 10-year and longer yields fall. Late 2024 offers a reminder: longer yields climbed even as the Fed cut by a full percentage point. Market-based inflation expectations also edged up Friday. “If we do have a Fed that’s cutting in this environment where inflation is still a far cry from their target, we think the market should show more signs of this inflation target moving higher and becoming unanchored,” said Meghan Swiber, a rates strategist at Bank of America. Upside surprises in growth or prices could trigger another selloff before the meeting. “There’s a long way between now and September 17th,” said Michael Arone, who serves as chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management.

Specifically, the asset recorded an inflow of $23.61 billion to its market cap in the past 24 hours, rising from $573.50 billion to $597.11 billion by press time. This growth has also been reflected in price movement, with Ethereum trading at $4,927, nearly 4% higher on the day and up 9% over the past week. ETH one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Why ETH is rallying Several catalysts have driven the rally. For instance, on August 24, entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH purchased $2.5 billion worth of tokens, the largest single-day inflow since 2018. Indeed, such whale accumulation usually points to a possible bullish sentiment. At the same time, developers confirmed that the Fusaka hard fork will activate between November 5 and 12. The upgrade will introduce PeerDAS for scalable data availability and triple gas limits, directly addressing Ethereum’s scalability bottlenecks. Once the upgrade goes live, it’s expected to reduce costs on Layer 2 networks and potentially attract further decentralized application development, echoing the growth seen after the Pectra upgrade in May 2025. ETH’s price path to $10,000 From a technical perspective, analysis by Ted Pillows indicates that Ethereum has broken out of a prolonged consolidation phase, with price action now tracking the upper boundary of a rising channel. ETH price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows In an X post on August 24, Pillows noted that the breakout has already propelled ETH beyond $4,900, with the $5,000 level emerging as the next immediate target. The analysis added that investors should expect a brief pause at this threshold before further continuation, with the broader structure supporting a potential move toward $10,000 later in the cycle.

Roughly $57 million worth of positions vanished in a single hour, with over $53 million of that being short trades that got completely destroyed. The rally first got strong on Friday when Jerome Powell, speaking from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said the Federal Reserve would likely cut interest rates next month. “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said. That one line was all it took. Leverage traders got steamrolled almost instantly. Everyone betting against Ethereum had to buy it back, and fast. Fed comments erase shorts, Ethereum explodes CoinGlass data tracked $120 million in Ethereum short liquidations in just one hour surrounding the speech, as leveraged short positions started collapsing when Ethereum surged too fast. Traders who borrowed to bet against it had to buy ETH quickly to limit their losses, which pushed prices even higher. That panic-buying loop crushed them. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming, two companies holding or accumulating ETH, both rallied hard—12% and 15%, respectively. Bitmine had just posted its first red week in three, falling over 7%, but flipped back green as Ethereum powered upward. On the other hand, ETHzilla, backed by Peter Thiel, collapsed. It nosedived more than 31% at one point during Friday’s session after the firm offered 74.8 million shares for resale. That move spooked traders. ETHzilla ended the day down 31.4%, tanking hard as Ethereum rose and Powell’s speech rattled sentiment. Elsewhere, DeFi Development, a treasury group tied to Solana, spiked 21% on the day. Coinbase and Strategy, often seen as a Bitcoin stock proxy, both tacked on 6%. Ethereum wasn’t the only crypto asset catching a bid, but it was leading the pack by a mile. Over the last eight weeks, Ethereum has become the center of the crypto market’s momentum. That momentum has been powered by institutional hunger for stablecoins. These tokens now account for 40% of all blockchain fees, and more than half of them run on Ethereum’s rails. That demand isn’t slowing. Ethereum’s role in the financial system is expanding fast, and big money knows it. Tom Lee, head of Fundstrat, put it like this on CNBC’s “Worldwide Exchange”: “Ether is the biggest macro trade over the next 10 to 15 years and a lot of it has to do with the fact that stablecoins have become the ChatGPT moment for crypto.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Ethereum|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MACROECONOMICS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-24 19:23:22

The growth is supported by a steady rise in active addresses and its native token, BNB, trading close to its all-time high. BNB Defies Market Crash BNB Chain’s total value locked (TVL) has surged to $13.4 billion. The latest figure represents its highest level since 2022, according to data shared by CryptoRank. The network has also maintained over 14 million active addresses for nine consecutive weeks, as a result of steady user engagement. This strength is mirrored in BNB’s price performance, with the token trading just 3% below its recently established all-time high, even as most top cryptocurrencies retreated significantly from their respective peaks. A crypto analyst stated that BNB is showing resilience despite the recent market downturn, having printed a fresh all-time high and holding above the key $814 support level. The analyst added that if momentum returns, a new ATH could follow, while potential pullbacks to around $806 or $770 may provide ideal long-entry opportunities. From Wall Street to Bhutan Institutional adoption has catalyzed BNB’s growth. An increasing number of publicly listed companies are diversifying cash reserves with digital assets. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead, investors are now eyeing BNB as a strong alternative. For instance, companies like Windtree Therapeutics, Nano Labs, and Liminatus Pharma have added BNB to their treasuries. Meanwhile, BNB Network Company, which happens to be CEA Industries Inc.’s treasury arm, recently purchased 200,000 BNB worth around $160 million. The company previously said that it aims to become the largest publicly traded BNB treasury company in the United States and bring institutional exposure to the asset. Interestingly, institutional interest is not confined to corporates. Bhutan’s sovereign investment fund, Druk Holding & Investments, also disclosed holdings in BNB. These developments briefly pushed the crypto asset near $870. It even outpaced household names like Nike and DoorDash in market value.

This Chart Pattern Suggests So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-set-for-30-surge-chart-pattern/,"The Dogecoin price has been somewhat inconsistent over the past few weeks, mirroring the indecisiveness of investors in the general cryptocurrency market. This instability was on display in the past week when the price of DOGE fell from $0.24 to as low as $0.21 on Friday, August 22. On Friday, the Dogecoin price briefly returned to above $0.24, triggered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. However, the latest price data shows that the meme coin might only be at the beginning of an extended rally over the next few weeks. DOGE Price Set For A Move To $0.3 – Analyst In an August 23 post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward a bullish prediction for the price of Dogecoin in the coming weeks. The online pundit shared that the largest meme coin by market capitalization could be on the verge of a 30% move to the upside. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts What Will Happen When XRP Price Hits $4, $10, $100, And $1,000 This optimistic projection revolves around the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Dogecoin price chart. The symmetrical triangle is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a diagonally falling upper trendline (connecting the swing highs) and a diagonally rising lower trendline (along the swing lows). The token’s price typically constricts and moves toward the apex in a symmetrical triangle pattern. In the end, the price either breaches the upper trendline for a breakout or the lower trendline forming a breakdown. Depending on the direction of the break (breakout or breakdown), the symmetrical triangle formation could be seen as a continuation or reversal pattern. It is worth mentioning that symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation break patterns, as the asset’s price usually breaks in the initial trend direction before falling into the triangle pattern. Going by this logic, Martinez suggested that the Dogecoin price is likely to continue its uptrend after breaking out of the current setup. If the price of DOGE plays out as projected, the crypto analyst expects the meme coin to move toward the $0.3 mark—representing a 30% move from the current price point. The price target is determined by adding the length of the widest point of the triangle (or base) to the breakout point. Nevertheless, investors have to wait for the close of at least two candlesticks above the triangle’s upper boundary to confirm a bullish breakout. Dogecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of DOGE stands at around $0.2366, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

The five-year ETH-USD price chart from TradingView shows a clean, multi-year breakout: ETH has finally vaulted the 2021 high after a long consolidation, leaving no historical overhead levels to lean on. This is what traders call price discovery — the market is printing new highs with only psychology and order flow to guide it rather than prior chart resistance. The 5-day view fills in the tape action. After a fast run from the mid-$4,700s, ETH pushed through $4,900 and reached an intraday high around $4,946.90. At the time of the chart snapshot — 6:48 p.m. UTC — the last price was about $4,941.57. That sequence signals buyers absorbed supply near the old ceiling and then forced a fresh high, a classic breakout pattern. Analyst Miles Deutsher summed up the leadership shift as “BTC is exhausted, ETH isn’t.” In plain English, he is flagging relative momentum: bitcoin’s rallies have stalled near recent highs while ether just broke into price discovery. When a market says one asset is “exhausted,” it usually means upside attempts are fading, follow-through is weak, and sellers keep meeting pushes higher; “isn’t” means the opposite — stronger follow-through, fresh highs, and active dip-buying. Traders often rotate toward the asset showing higher relative strength when the other leader tires. Crypto Rover focused on supply on exchanges. “Exchange reserves” refers to coins held in wallets controlled by centralized trading venues. When those balances trend down, fewer coins are immediately available to sell. If demand rises as liquid supply thins, price can accelerate because buyers must bid higher to coax coins off-exchange back into circulation. That is the mechanic behind his “supply shock” phrasing — not a guarantee of straight-up prices, but a setup where scarcity can magnify moves once momentum starts. Michaël van de Poppe offered a risk check. He highlighted the unusually large weekly candle and cautioned that weekend breakouts often retrace when liquidity normalizes early in the week. The idea is simple: weekend order books can be thinner, so moves extend more easily; when fuller participation returns on Monday, prices sometimes retest the breakout area to confirm it as support before trending again.

The cryptocurrency market just experienced a significant jolt! In a stunning turn of events, a staggering $210 million worth of crypto futures liquidation occurred in just one hour across major exchanges. This rapid unwind was part of an even larger trend, with a total of $455 million in futures positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. Such significant liquidation events often send ripples through the market, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks involved in leveraged trading. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? When we talk about crypto futures liquidation , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below the minimum required level to maintain the position, often due to adverse price movements. Essentially, if the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged bet, the exchange automatically sells off the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange itself. Futures Contracts: These are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Leverage: Traders use borrowed funds to amplify their potential returns. However, leverage also magnifies potential losses. Margin: This is the collateral a trader puts up to open and maintain a leveraged position. Why Did Such a Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Occur? The recent surge in crypto futures liquidation points to a confluence of factors, primarily market volatility. Cryptocurrencies are known for their dramatic price swings, and when these movements are sudden and sharp, they can trigger a cascade of liquidations. Many traders take on high leverage, believing they can accurately predict short-term price action. However, unexpected news, macroeconomic shifts, or even large institutional trades can quickly invalidate these assumptions. Consider this: if a trader opens a 100x leveraged long position on Bitcoin, a mere 1% drop in Bitcoin’s price can wipe out their entire margin. When many traders are in similar positions, a small price dip can lead to a domino effect, triggering one liquidation after another. This creates further selling pressure, accelerating the price drop and leading to even more liquidations – a vicious cycle. What Are the Immediate Impacts on Traders from Crypto Futures Liquidation? For those caught on the wrong side of this crypto futures liquidation wave, the impact is immediate and often devastating. Traders face significant financial losses, sometimes losing their entire investment in a matter of minutes. It’s a stark reminder of the high-stakes nature of futures trading. Financial Loss: Direct loss of invested capital. Margin Calls: Traders might receive calls to deposit more funds to avoid liquidation, often with little time to react. Emotional Toll: The sudden loss can be emotionally taxing, potentially leading to impulsive decisions or ‘revenge trading’. Moreover, these events can shake investor confidence, especially among newer participants who might not fully grasp the risks involved. It underscores the importance of a robust risk management strategy. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Futures Market: Actionable Insights While the allure of high returns in the crypto futures liquidation market is strong, prudence is key. How can traders better protect themselves from such sudden downturns? Here are some actionable insights: Understand Leverage: Use leverage cautiously. Higher leverage means a higher risk of liquidation. Many experts advise against using maximum leverage, especially for beginners. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting potential losses. It’s a fundamental risk management tool. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across different assets can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors that can influence crypto prices. Start Small: Especially when learning, begin with smaller amounts to understand market dynamics without risking significant capital. Education is your best defense. The more you understand the mechanics of futures trading and risk management, the better equipped you will be to navigate its inherent volatility and avoid significant crypto futures liquidation events. The recent $210 million crypto futures liquidation serves as a potent reminder of the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While futures trading offers opportunities for substantial gains, it comes with equally significant risks, especially when leverage is involved. Traders must prioritize risk management, employ sensible strategies, and continuously educate themselves to avoid becoming another statistic in these volatile market movements. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto futures liquidation? A1: Crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin falls below the required level due to adverse price movements. Q2: Why do such large liquidations happen? A2: Large liquidations typically occur due to sudden and sharp market volatility, combined with traders holding highly leveraged positions. This can create a cascading effect. Q3: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? A3: Traders can protect themselves by using leverage cautiously, implementing stop-loss orders, diversifying their portfolios, staying informed about market conditions, and starting with smaller investments.

A4: In the past 24 hours, a total of $455 million worth of futures were liquidated across major exchanges. Q5: Does a crypto futures liquidation only affect individual traders?

Bitcoin’s price had calmed at around $115,000 all day with little to no moves in either direction, but suddenly plunged to its lowest price level since July 10. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Recall that the primary cryptocurrency skyrocketed on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s somewhat optimistic speech about upcoming interest rate cuts. The asset went from under $112,000, which was a local low at the time, to over $117,000 within an hour or so. However, that relief rally was short-lived, and BTC quickly retraced to around $115,000, where it spent most of the weekend. Less than an hour ago, though, the bears unexpectedly reemerged by pushing BTC to a six-week low of $110,600 (on most exchanges). Bitcoin recovered two grand since then, but still trades below $113,000. It took most altcoins south with it, including ETH, which was flying high. In fact, the second-largest cryptocurrency just painted a new all-time high of almost $5,000. As the community was anticipating a breakthrough above that milestone, though, ETH plummeted to nearly $4,700 before recovering to around $4,800 as of press time. Most altcoins charted similar volatile price moves over the past hour, which has harmed over-leveraged traders. Data from CoinGlass shows that the hourly liquidations have shot up to well over $300 million, with longs responsible for roughly 90% of the entire amount. The wrecked positions on a daily scale are almost double that size, with over 130,000 traders liquidated. The single-largest wrecked position took place on OKX and was worth north of $12 million.

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, and not always for reasons of celebration. Recently, the Bitcoin price drop has captured significant attention, with BTC experiencing a notable decline. This movement has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, prompting many to question the immediate future of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Triggered the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop? According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market analysts, BTC has notably fallen below the $114,000 mark. Specifically, it is currently trading at $113,660.72 on the Binance USDT market. This particular instance of Bitcoin price drop reflects a dynamic and often unpredictable market environment. Such rapid fluctuations are common in the crypto space. However, when BTC falls below $114,000, it often signals broader market sentiment shifts. Several factors can contribute to these movements, from macroeconomic indicators to specific market events. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence plays a huge role. Negative news or general risk aversion can quickly lead to sell-offs. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic data, inflation concerns, or interest rate changes can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Technical Indicators: Breaking key support levels, such as when BTC falls below $114,000, often triggers further selling pressure from algorithmic traders and technical analysts. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? For many investors, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can be a cause for concern. It is natural to feel anxious when your portfolio value decreases. However, it is crucial to understand the different perspectives and potential implications. Long-term holders, often referred to as ‘HODLers,’ might view this as a temporary setback or even a buying opportunity. They believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value and its potential for future growth, seeing dips as chances to accumulate more. On the other hand, short-term traders might face immediate losses and could be looking for exit strategies or opportunities to short the market. This market movement highlights the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. While this volatility can lead to significant gains, it also carries substantial risks. Understanding your personal risk tolerance and investment goals becomes paramount during such times. Navigating Volatility: What Are Your Options? When faced with a significant Bitcoin price drop , making informed decisions is key. Panicking often leads to regrettable actions. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Strategy: Review your initial investment thesis. Has anything fundamental changed about Bitcoin or the broader crypto market? Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks during market downturns. Spreading investments across different assets can cushion the impact of a single asset’s decline. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can help average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reliable news sources and market analysis. Understanding the potential reasons behind the Bitcoin price drop can help you make more rational decisions. Remember, market cycles are a normal part of investing. What appears to be a setback, like when BTC falls below $114,000, could also be a phase in a larger market trend. What’s Next for Bitcoin After This Drop? Predicting the exact future of Bitcoin is challenging, even for seasoned experts. However, analyzing current trends and historical data can provide some perspective. Historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience, recovering from numerous significant dips to reach new all-time highs. The current Bitcoin price drop could be a temporary correction before another rally, or it might signal a period of consolidation. Key factors to watch include: Institutional Adoption: Continued interest and investment from large institutions could provide strong support. Regulatory Developments: Clear and favorable regulations could boost investor confidence. Technological Advancements: Improvements to the Bitcoin network or broader crypto ecosystem can drive long-term value. Ultimately, the crypto market remains a fascinating and evolving space. While the immediate news of BTC falls below $114,000 might seem daunting, it is a reminder of the dynamic nature of digital assets. The recent Bitcoin price drop serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While immediate reactions might lean towards concern, understanding the broader context, maintaining a long-term perspective, and employing sound investment strategies are crucial. Whether you are a seasoned investor or new to the space, staying informed and calm during market fluctuations is essential for navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of digital assets. This period could be a test of conviction for many, but also an opportunity for those prepared to act strategically. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused BTC to fall below $114,000? The exact cause of any specific Bitcoin price drop can be multifaceted, often involving a combination of macroeconomic concerns, shifts in market sentiment, technical selling pressure, and potentially large-scale trading activities. Monitoring global economic news and crypto-specific updates helps in understanding these movements. 2. Is this Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? Whether it’s a good time to buy depends entirely on an individual’s investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook. Some investors view dips as buying opportunities (buying the dip), while others prefer to wait for signs of recovery. Dollar-cost averaging can be a strategy to mitigate risk during volatile periods. 3. How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? The duration of a Bitcoin price drop varies significantly. Some corrections are brief, lasting days or weeks, while others can extend for months, leading to a bear market. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has always recovered from past downturns, but past performance does not guarantee future results. 4. What should I do if my crypto portfolio is down? If your portfolio is experiencing a downturn due to a Bitcoin price drop , it’s important to avoid panic selling. Re-evaluate your initial investment goals, consider your long-term strategy, and assess your risk tolerance. Diversification and dollar-cost averaging are strategies that can help manage risk. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance. 5. Where can I find reliable information on Bitcoin market movements? Reliable sources for Bitcoin market movements include reputable crypto news outlets like Bitcoin World, official exchange data (e.g., Binance USDT market), financial news organizations, and reports from established market analysts. Always cross-reference information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy. Did you find this analysis helpful?

BlockDAG changes that equation. Offering full EVM compatibility, it allows developers and users to continue using familiar Ethereum tools without facing the same congestion or unpredictable fees. This dual advantage, keeping the Ethereum ecosystem intact while removing its pain points, sets BlockDAG apart. Add to that a presale raising nearly $377 million, batch 29 pricing at $0.0276, an ROI of 2,660% since batch 1, and over 25 billion coins sold, and it’s clear why BlockDAG is being added to shortlists of crypto coins to buy now. Faster Speeds, Lower Fees, Same Ethereum Tools Ethereum’s scaling challenges are well-known. Even with rollups and upgrades, many users still run into gas spikes and delays. BlockDAG provides a fresh solution by combining Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work consensus, enabling multiple transactions to process at once while preserving decentralization and security. What makes this approach compelling is that developers don’t need to alter their code. Ethereum-based dApps can shift to BlockDAG seamlessly, bringing instant performance upgrades without retraining or redevelopment. For users, this translates into real utility, lower fees for NFTs, affordable microtransactions, and cheaper DeFi execution. These practical improvements open the door for wider adoption, making BDAG a strong candidate among crypto coins to buy now. Security Without Sacrifices One of Ethereum’s strongest advantages has always been security, and BlockDAG ensures that performance gains don’t come at its expense. By leveraging the GhostDAG protocol, supported by rigorous third-party audits, BlockDAG delivers a system where speed and protection work together. A public blockchain explorer further enhances transparency by letting anyone review transactions instantly. The open testnet adds another layer of trust, allowing the community to deploy contracts, stress-test the system, and confirm stability before the full mainnet goes live. This openness has already strengthened presale demand, since participants can see real functionality before broader adoption. Combined with these assurances, BlockDAG has gained recognition as one of the crypto coins to buy now for those who value both speed and security in equal measure. Presale Growth Driving Confidence Beyond technical achievements, BlockDAG’s market traction provides another layer of strength. With nearly $381 million raised, a current presale price of $0.0276, an ROI since batch 1 of 2,660%, and more than 25 billion coins sold, the growth story is undeniable. These milestones reflect not only demand but also trust in the project’s ability to deliver. Unlike projects with vague promises, BlockDAG already has a live testnet, a defined roadmap, and a migration path for Ethereum developers. The presale’s structured batch pricing also incentivizes earlier entry, as each stage increase signals limited availability at current levels. Such measurable progress, both in funding and adoption readiness, places BlockDAG in a strong position among crypto coins to buy now. The Practical Next Step for Ethereum Users Ethereum remains a core part of the blockchain space, but its issues are not easily overlooked. BlockDAG offers a clear upgrade path, faster speeds, lower costs, and seamless compatibility with existing Ethereum smart contracts. Developers don’t need to start over, and users don’t need to give up the apps they already use. With nearly $377 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, batch 29 priced at $0.0276, and ROI already at 2,660% since the first batch, BlockDAG demonstrates more than just potential. It shows execution, adoption readiness, and a vision grounded in real usability. For those considering crypto coins to buy now, BlockDAG represents a rare case where timing, technology, and adoption all converge.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-buy-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has issued a strong endorsement for XRP, sharing his perspective on its potential future value. In a recent post, he wrote “BUY XRP ASAP!!!” and expanded on this statement in a video, where he emphasized the importance of holding the digital asset. Rietveld pointed out that less than 0.1 percent of the world’s population currently holds any amount of XRP. By comparison, Bitcoin ownership is much more widespread, with estimates ranging between 1 and 1.3 percent of the global population. He underlined this difference as a significant factor, suggesting that XRP remains in an early adoption phase compared to Bitcoin. According to him, this low level of global participation in XRP creates a scenario in which its growth potential is still largely untapped. BUY #XRP ASAP!!! pic.twitter.com/dSzK9I3WbX — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 24, 2025 Projections Based on Bitcoin’s Adoption Levels In his analysis, Rietveld outlined a hypothetical scenario projecting XRP’s value if its adoption were to mirror Bitcoin’s current levels. He explained that if XRP were to reach similar global adoption in the next decade, its market capitalization would expand dramatically. With XRP’s market capitalization currently estimated at $179 billion, Rietveld suggested that such a shift in adoption could push this figure into the range of $17.9 trillion. This projection was based on the assumption that XRP could eventually attract the same share of global users that Bitcoin has achieved over a decade. If this were to occur, Rietveld stated that the asset’s price could rise to approximately $300 per coin . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Long-Term Perspective on Value Rietveld’s remarks focused on the long-term possibilities rather than short-term fluctuations. His projection for a $300 valuation per XRP was not presented as an immediate outcome but as a potential result of sustained adoption over the next ten years. By framing his forecast in terms of market penetration, he emphasized the importance of adoption as a key driver of value. He also contrasted XRP’s current position with Bitcoin’s more advanced stage of adoption. While Bitcoin has already established itself among a larger base of global holders, XRP remains relatively underrepresented in terms of ownership. According to Rietveld, this creates a significant opportunity for those who adopt XRP before broader recognition takes place. By projecting XRP’s potential in comparison with Bitcoin, he positioned the asset as one with significant room for growth if adoption increases worldwide.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has fallen below the crucial $113,000 mark. This unexpected dip sees Bitcoin currently trading at $112,784.79 on the Binance USDT market, leaving many investors wondering about the immediate implications. What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Whenever we observe a substantial Bitcoin Price Drop , it is natural to question the underlying causes. Several factors could contribute to such market movements, ranging from macroeconomic shifts to specific crypto-related news. While no single definitive reason has been identified immediately, market analysts often point to a confluence of events. For instance, broader economic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate hikes, can often ripple into risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Moreover, large sell-offs by significant holders, often called ‘whales,’ or unexpected regulatory announcements can also exert downward pressure. Understanding these potential triggers is crucial for any investor. Understanding Market Reactions to a Bitcoin Price Drop How do investors typically react during a significant Bitcoin Price Drop ? Market reactions are often a mix of panic selling and strategic accumulation. Some less experienced investors might sell their holdings to cut losses, contributing to further downward momentum. However, seasoned investors often view these dips as opportunities. During such times, a calm and analytical approach becomes paramount. It is important to avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on fear or excitement. The market’s overall sentiment can quickly shift, and understanding the long-term potential of Bitcoin is key. Navigating Volatility: Strategies for Investors During a Bitcoin Price Drop Volatility is an inherent characteristic of the crypto market, and a Bitcoin Price Drop is a stark reminder of this. Therefore, having a robust strategy is vital. Here are some actionable insights for navigating these challenging times: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the fundamentals of your investments. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, to average out your purchase cost over time. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These can help limit potential losses if the price continues to fall. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading your investments across different assets can mitigate risk. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin has shown resilience over its history, recovering from numerous significant drops. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Stick to your investment plan and avoid reacting impulsively to short-term market fluctuations. The Road Ahead: What Could Influence Bitcoin’s Next Move? Despite the current Bitcoin Price Drop , the future trajectory of the leading cryptocurrency remains a topic of intense discussion. Several factors could influence its next major move. Upcoming Bitcoin halving events, for example, historically tend to precede significant price rallies due to reduced supply. Furthermore, continued institutional adoption, technological advancements within the Bitcoin network, and the broader global economic stability will play crucial roles. Bitcoin has proven its ability to recover and reach new all-time highs after previous downturns, underscoring its long-term potential in the digital asset landscape. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin Price Drop below $113,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such dips can be concerning, they also offer crucial learning opportunities for investors. By staying informed, adopting sound investment strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, participants can better navigate these volatile periods and position themselves for future growth. Remember, every market correction is a test of resilience and a chance to refine your investment approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does a Bitcoin Price Drop mean for my investments? A Bitcoin Price Drop means the value of your Bitcoin holdings has decreased. For long-term investors, it can be a temporary setback or even an opportunity to buy more at a lower price. For short-term traders, it might trigger stop-losses or lead to losses if not managed properly. 2. Is this Bitcoin Price Drop a sign of a bear market? One single price drop does not necessarily indicate a full bear market. Crypto markets are highly volatile, and corrections are common. Analysts look at broader trends, macroeconomic factors, and sustained downward pressure over time to determine a bear market. 3. Should I sell my Bitcoin after a significant price fall? The decision to sell depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Many experts advise against panic selling during a Bitcoin Price Drop , especially if you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Consider consulting a financial advisor. 4. How can I protect my portfolio during a Bitcoin Price Drop? You can protect your portfolio by diversifying your assets, setting stop-loss orders, practicing dollar-cost averaging, and investing only what you can afford to lose. Staying informed and avoiding emotional decisions are also key strategies. 5. What are the common reasons for a Bitcoin Price Drop? Common reasons include macroeconomic factors (inflation, interest rates), regulatory news, large sell-offs by institutional or whale investors, technical chart breakdowns, and negative market sentiment or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).

In a blink, a monumental $320 million worth of futures contracts were wiped out across major exchanges in a single hour. This dramatic figure is part of an even larger trend, with a total of $568 million in futures liquidated over the past 24 hours. These sudden crypto liquidations serve as a stark reminder of the market’s intense volatility and the powerful forces at play in the digital asset space. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? For those new to futures trading, understanding crypto liquidations is essential. When traders use borrowed money, known as leverage, to amplify their positions, they put up a smaller amount of their own capital as ‘margin.’ This leverage can magnify profits, but it also significantly increases risk. If the market moves against a trader’s prediction, their margin balance can fall below a certain threshold. When this happens, the exchange automatically closes their position to prevent further losses for the exchange. This forced closure is precisely what we call a crypto liquidation . It’s a rapid, automatic process that can catch many off guard. The Shocking $320 Million Plunge The recent market movements saw an astonishing $320 million in crypto liquidations occur within just sixty minutes. This rapid unwinding of positions sent immediate ripples across major exchanges, demonstrating how quickly market sentiment and prices can shift. Over a full 24-hour period, the total losses climbed even higher, reaching $568 million. Such large-scale liquidations often have several immediate impacts: Sudden Price Drops: As positions are force-closed, selling pressure increases, leading to rapid price declines. Increased Volatility: The market becomes even more unpredictable, making it challenging for traders. Heightened Fear: A wave of liquidations can trigger panic among traders, leading to further selling. Why Do Massive Crypto Liquidations Happen? Several factors contribute to such significant crypto liquidations . High leverage trading is often a primary culprit. When many traders are highly leveraged in one direction, a small price swing in the opposite direction can trigger a cascade effect. This initial trigger leads to forced selling, which further drives down prices and causes more liquidations, creating a domino effect. Other contributing factors include: Unexpected News Events: Geopolitical news, regulatory announcements, or major economic data can suddenly shift market sentiment. Large ‘Whale’ Movements: A single large investor or institution making a significant trade can impact market liquidity and price. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: When key support levels are breached, it can trigger automated selling and further liquidations. Navigating Volatile Waters: Strategies for Traders Understanding the risks associated with futures trading is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto market. While the allure of amplified returns is strong, the potential for rapid crypto liquidations is equally real. Here are some actionable strategies to help mitigate the impact of sudden market downturns: Practice Prudent Risk Management: Avoid over-leveraging. Only risk capital you can afford to lose. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: These automatic orders close your position if the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into a single asset or highly leveraged positions. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis to make informed decisions. Understand Your Tools: Know how margin calls and liquidation thresholds work on your chosen exchange. The Broader Implications of Crypto Liquidations While painful for individual traders, these events also offer insights into the overall health and maturity of the crypto market. Frequent large crypto liquidations can indicate periods of excessive speculation or underlying market weaknesses. Conversely, they can also ‘cleanse’ the market of over-leveraged positions, potentially paving the way for more stable growth by removing weak hands and speculative froth. These episodes highlight the ongoing need for robust risk management tools and investor education within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the market evolves, we can expect continued discussions around responsible trading practices and regulatory frameworks to protect participants while fostering innovation. In conclusion, the recent $320 million in crypto liquidations in just one hour serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rapid shifts possible in the digital asset world. While the market offers incredible opportunities, it demands respect, careful planning, and a deep understanding of its mechanisms. By prioritizing informed decisions and sound risk management, traders can better navigate these volatile waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin balance has fallen below a required threshold, preventing further losses. Why are liquidations sometimes so high? High liquidations often result from a combination of excessive leverage used by many traders and sudden, significant price movements in the market that go against their leveraged positions, creating a cascade effect. Can I avoid crypto liquidations? You can significantly reduce your risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, managing your risk exposure carefully, and avoiding over-speculation. Does a large liquidation event mean the crypto market is crashing? Not necessarily. While large liquidations indicate significant market volatility and can lead to temporary price drops, they don’t always signal a long-term market crash. They can sometimes even ‘cleanse’ the market of over-leveraged positions, potentially leading to more stable growth. What role do exchanges play in crypto liquidations? Exchanges facilitate futures trading and are responsible for executing liquidations automatically according to their terms to protect both the platform and other market participants from unmanageable losses due to highly leveraged positions.

According to recent market monitoring, BTC is currently trading around $111,088.75 on the Binance USDT market. This movement has certainly captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about what’s next for the digital asset. What Triggered This Latest Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind a market movement is crucial. While specific, immediate catalysts can sometimes be elusive, several factors often contribute to a Bitcoin price drop . These can range from broader macroeconomic trends to shifts in investor sentiment and even technical trading patterns. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, or interest rate hikes can lead investors to de-risk, moving capital from volatile assets like crypto to safer havens. Regulatory Scrutiny: News of potential new regulations or enforcement actions in major markets can introduce fear and uncertainty, influencing sell-offs. Whale Movements: Large holders, often called “whales,” can significantly impact prices with substantial buy or sell orders. A sudden large sale can trigger a cascade effect. Technical Resistance: If BTC struggles to break past a key resistance level, traders might interpret this as a signal for a potential downturn, leading to profit-taking. This recent dip below $112,000 might be a confluence of some of these elements, creating a ripple effect across the market. Navigating Volatility: Investor Sentiment During a Bitcoin Price Drop When a Bitcoin price drop occurs, investor sentiment often swings between fear and opportunity. For some, it signals a time to panic and sell, driven by the fear of further losses. However, experienced traders and long-term holders often view such dips differently. A price correction can be a healthy market mechanism, flushing out over-leveraged positions and creating attractive entry points for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. It’s a moment that truly tests the conviction of market participants. Key Considerations for Investors: Long-Term Vision: Do you believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental technology and its role in the future of finance? Risk Management: Have you invested only what you can afford to lose? Dollar-Cost Averaging: Many use this strategy to mitigate risk during volatile periods, buying fixed amounts regularly regardless of price. What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency space means that its price movements often have a significant impact on altcoins. A substantial Bitcoin price drop can frequently lead to a broader market correction, as altcoins tend to follow BTC’s lead. This correlation is due to several factors, including investor psychology and the fact that many altcoin trading pairs are denominated in BTC or follow its general market sentiment. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin’s performance is essential for understanding the overall health and direction of the crypto market. However, it is also important to remember that some altcoins may show resilience or even inverse movements in specific scenarios, though these are less common during widespread downturns. The current dip serves as a reminder of the interconnected nature of the digital asset ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Investors During a Price Dip When facing a Bitcoin price drop , staying calm and informed is paramount. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information from multiple reputable sources. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on social media hype or fear. Reassess Your Portfolio: Use this time to review your investment strategy. Are your allocations still aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals? Consider DCA: As mentioned, dollar-cost averaging can be an effective strategy to mitigate risk by spreading out your investments over time, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic indicators. Reliable platforms like Bitcoin World’s market insights can provide valuable context. Remember, market cycles are a natural part of investing, and understanding them can help you make more strategic decisions. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $112,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be unsettling, they also present opportunities for informed investors. By understanding the potential causes, managing emotional responses, and employing sound investment strategies, participants can navigate these fluctuations more effectively. Bitcoin continues to evolve, and its journey is often marked by these dynamic price shifts, reinforcing the need for vigilance and a long-term perspective.

We’ve just seen a significant Bitcoin price drop , with BTC falling below the crucial $111,000 mark. This sudden movement sparks immediate questions and concerns across the digital asset landscape. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC has dipped to $110,809.24 on the Binance USDT market. This particular price point represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges, prompting many to analyze the underlying causes. Understanding what drives such market movements is complex; however, several factors often contribute to a rapid Bitcoin price drop : Macroeconomic Influences: Broader economic trends, such as inflation data, interest rate decisions, or global geopolitical events, can significantly impact investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding new cryptocurrency regulations in major economies frequently cause market jitters. Uncertainty can lead to selling pressure. Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement, some large holders (often called “whales”) might sell off portions of their holdings to realize gains, leading to a temporary downward correction. Technical Indicators: Breaking key support levels on price charts can trigger automated sell orders and further accelerate a decline as traders react to technical signals. While the exact catalyst for this specific dip remains under scrutiny, these elements collectively shape the volatile crypto environment. Therefore, staying informed about these broader trends is essential. Navigating Volatility: Investor Strategies Amidst a BTC Price Fall For both seasoned and new investors, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling. However, it also presents an opportunity to re-evaluate strategies and ensure resilience in a volatile market. How can you best navigate these turbulent times? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information from multiple reputable sources before making investment decisions. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Market fluctuations can trigger fear or panic. Sticking to a pre-defined investment plan helps avoid impulsive actions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, spreading investments over time can mitigate the impact of price volatility. This approach means you buy more when prices are low and less when they are high. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a dominant asset, a diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can help spread risk. Set Clear Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and set stop-loss orders or profit targets accordingly. Remember, market downturns are a natural part of any investment cycle. Maintaining a long-term perspective can often prove beneficial. The Broader Market Picture: Beyond the Immediate Bitcoin Price Drop When Bitcoin experiences a significant movement, it often sends ripples throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This recent Bitcoin price drop is no exception, and it’s worth observing how altcoins and overall market sentiment react. Typically, a substantial BTC decline can lead to: Altcoin Corrections: Many altcoins are highly correlated with Bitcoin. When BTC falls, altcoins often follow, sometimes with even greater percentage losses due to their smaller market caps. Shift in Sentiment: A notable price drop can turn market sentiment from bullish to cautious or even bearish, leading to decreased trading volume and investor hesitancy. Increased Speculation: Conversely, some traders view dips as buying opportunities, hoping to acquire assets at a lower price before a potential rebound. Expert analysts often emphasize that short-term fluctuations should be viewed within the context of Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory and its increasing institutional adoption.

The specific trading value of $111,984.01 indicates a momentary but notable shift from previous levels. Many factors often contribute to a sudden BTC price drop . It is crucial for investors to look beyond the immediate numbers and consider the broader context. This helps in making informed decisions rather than reacting impulsively. Key Factors Driving the BTC Price Drop What exactly causes Bitcoin to experience a significant price fall? Several elements frequently influence market movements. Understanding these can provide clarity during turbulent times. Macroeconomic Data: Global economic indicators, such as inflation reports or interest rate changes, can directly impact investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory News: Announcements regarding new cryptocurrency regulations or potential crackdowns in major economies often create uncertainty and selling pressure. Whale Movements: Large transactions by major holders, often called ‘whales,’ can significantly shift market supply and demand dynamics, leading to a noticeable Bitcoin price fall . Technical Analysis: When Bitcoin breaks key support levels identified by technical analysts, it can trigger further sell-offs as automated trading systems and wary investors react. Investor Sentiment Amidst the Bitcoin Price Fall : Panic or Opportunity? During periods of market decline, investor sentiment plays a huge role. Some investors might experience panic and sell their holdings, fearing further losses. However, others view a Bitcoin price fall as an opportunity to acquire more assets at a lower cost. It is vital to manage emotions and stick to a well-researched investment strategy. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has always recovered from previous dips, often reaching new highs. Therefore, a calm and rational approach is always recommended. Navigating Volatility: Strategies After a Bitcoin Price Fall How can investors best navigate the market when Bitcoin experiences a notable price fall? Employing sound strategies can help mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on future growth. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. DCA helps average out the purchase price over time and reduces the impact of volatility. Thorough Research: Always conduct your own research before making investment decisions. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals and its long-term potential. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Setting stop-loss orders or diversifying your portfolio can help protect your capital during a significant BTC price drop .

Stay informed, stay strategic, and remember that patience often yields the best results in the volatile world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did Bitcoin fall below $112,000?

Is this a good time to buy BTC? Whether it’s a good time to buy BTC depends on your individual investment strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors view a price fall as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, while others prefer to wait for signs of recovery. Always conduct your own research. 3. What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?

This method helps to reduce the impact of market volatility and average out your purchase price over time. 4. How can I protect my investments during a BTC price drop?

Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a significant milestone, soaring above the $112,000 mark. This impressive BTC price action, as observed by Bitcoin World market monitoring , sees the digital asset currently trading around $112,108.81 on the Binance USDT market. It is truly an exciting time for enthusiasts and investors alike. What’s Fueling This Phenomenal BTC Price Rally? Several key factors often contribute to such a dramatic increase in the BTC price . Understanding these drivers helps us grasp the market’s current momentum and anticipate future movements. Institutional Adoption: More large corporations and financial institutions are integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. This growing mainstream acceptance significantly increases demand, pushing the price higher. Scarcity and Halving Events: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and periodic halving events, which reduce the rate of new Bitcoin creation, inherently drive its value. Supply constraints meet rising demand, creating upward pressure. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, such as inflation concerns or changes in interest rates, can push investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Understanding the Dynamics Behind the BTC Price While the current surge is exhilarating, Bitcoin is widely known for its price volatility. This means rapid price movements, both up and down, are common in the crypto market. Therefore, investors must remain aware that past performance does not guarantee future results. The market can shift quickly, offering both significant opportunities and considerable risks. Understanding this inherent volatility is crucial for making informed decisions regarding the BTC price . Benefits of Volatility: Potential for significant returns during strong bull runs. High liquidity allows for easy buying and selling. Challenges of Volatility: High risk of capital loss during market downturns. Emotional decision-making can often lead to poor investment outcomes.

Do you have a plan for managing your investments amidst such rapid changes? A clear strategy helps mitigate risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Research Thoroughly: Always conduct your own comprehensive research before making any investment decisions. Rely on multiple credible sources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket; spread investments across different asset classes to reduce overall risk. Set Clear Goals: Define your entry and exit points to avoid impulsive reactions to market swings. This disciplined approach is vital. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and expert market analysis. For example, tracking real-time movements on major exchanges like Binance provides immediate data, but context from expert analysis is equally important for understanding the broader implications of the BTC price . What’s Next for the BTC Price? Exploring Future Scenarios Predicting the exact future of the BTC price is impossible, but market analysts often consider various scenarios. Some experts foresee continued growth driven by increasing mainstream acceptance and technological advancements within the blockchain ecosystem.

50619533,564148,1756067453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50619533.jpeg,Expert Sees 80% Chance Of September Rate Cut—What It Means For Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/expert-puts-probability-of-september-rate-cut-at-80/,"The Bitcoin and the crypto market witnessed significant volatility on Friday, August 22, rallying hard on the back of the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole . Powell suggested a possible shift in the US policy direction, hinting that the interest rates could soon be cut. This speech triggered volatility in the risk assets and the crypto market, with most large-cap cryptocurrencies jumping to new local highs. The price of Ethereum, for instance, briefly ran up to a new all-time high around $4,888 on Friday. Now, optimism seems to be on the rise about the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September and its potential impact on Bitcoin and other risk assets. September Rate Cut Might Be A Done Deal: Expert In a recent post on the X platform, investment research expert Jim Bianco shared insights from Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole on Friday. According to the online pundit, the Fed chair’s speech was open to several interpretations, especially as seen with varying professional opinions since then. Bianco stated that Powell didn’t exactly specify what he plans to do in the coming month, making his Jackson Hole speech a “Rorschach test.” For context, the Rorschach test is a projective test that employs ambiguous stimuli (typically inkblots) to evoke a person’s internal attitude and biases. Bianco highlighted that the probability of a September rate cut was approximately 80% at the start of the week. However, this narrative—a week ago—hinged on a strong August payroll and the hot August CPI (Consumer Price Index) moving higher than July’s 3.1%. Both data are expected to be released before the FOMC meeting on September 18 and are expected to determine whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates . Following Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole and at the end of Friday, the probability of the rate cuts returned at roughly 80%—essentially back to the past week’s narrative. Ultimately, Bianco believes that the situation of the September rate cut never changed and is still dependent on economic data in early September. Bianco concluded: To paraphrase Miracle Max in The Princess Bride, a September rate cut is mostly a done deal, but that means it’s also slightly not a done deal. What This Means For Bitcoin And Crypto Market? Lower interest rates typically make risk assets, like cryptocurrencies and equities, more attractive investment options, as the potential yield on fixed-income assets (like treasury bonds) falls. Historically—and as seen on Friday, Bitcoin and the crypto market tend to surge whenever the Fed cuts interest rates. Hence, a September rate cut by the US Federal Reserve could be generally bullish for Bitcoin and crypto, as investors might rush to these risk assets for higher gains. As of this writing, the entire cryptocurrency market is valued at about $4.07 trillion.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Crypto Market|Fed Reserve Chair|Interest Rate Cut|Jerome|Jim Bianco,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-24 20:30:53

Meanwhile, New Ethereum Layer 2 $LBRETT Poised for 50x Gains",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/does-2025-q3-bode-well-for-cardano-and-chainlink-meanwhile-new-ethereum-layer-2-lbrett-poised-for-50x-gains/,"The third quarter of 2025 is gearing up to be the best for the crypto market. Bitcoin hit a new ATH, and so did the total crypto market cap. But how well will Cardano and Chainlink perform in Q3? ADA traders are banking on whale accumulation and tightening supply to rekindle a rally, while LINK is benefiting from institutional attention and renewed confidence in its tech stack. Yet, behind the headlines, a third player is quietly stirring excitement: Layer Brett (LBRETT) , an Ethereum Layer-2 meme coin offering staking yields and a 50x investment opportunity. Its ongoing presale is seeing serious demand, and analysts believe it could be the top-performing meme token of this quarter. Let’s find out more. Cardano ’s Balancing Act: Bullish Hype Meets Technical Tension Cardano has entered a tentative stage. In the last two weeks, whales have acquired nearly 150 million ADA, a clear sign of top-tier confidence. At the same time, stock-to-flow metrics have climbed above 400, hinting at increasingly constrained supply—a classic precursor to structural rallies. ADA price analysis. Source: AMBCrypto ADA’s price action, however, reflects a cautious stance. It remains trapped within an ascending channel . A breakout above the upper level of the channel at $0.93 could spur moves toward $0.95–$1.02. Retail sentiment offers similar ambivalence. Data shows 77% of traders are long, pushing the long-to-short ratio to 3.40. While that speaks to optimism, it also exposes ADA to risks of rapid deleveraging if momentum breaks. Chainlink ’s Resurgence Held Aloft by Institutional Confidence Chainlink 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Chainlink has made more decisive moves. LINK soared approximately 12% , testing levels near $27.80, its strongest showing since December. The trigger? A wave of institutional enthusiasm followed dovish remarks by the Federal Reserve chair . LINK’s rally was accompanied by a five-fold surge in volume from consolidation levels and systematic breakout through resistance zones from $25 to $26. Also crucial were Chainlink’s security advancements. The protocol earned both ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 1 certifications, raising its credibility with enterprise users and DeFi platforms. To further bolster confidence, Chainlink Reserve added 41,000 LINK (roughly $1 million), solidifying support and reinforcing upward momentum. Layer Brett: Ethereum’s Meme Coin Engineered for Velocity If ADA and LINK provide structural narratives, Layer Brett presents the potential for explosive upside. The new Ethereum-based meme platform has been going viral for its focus on utility and incentivized participation. In fact, its presale has already surpassed $1 million in funding, with holders climbing to 4,000 within weeks of presale. These aren’t random numbers; they reflect a carefully crafted meme coin ecosystem designed to reward early momentum aggressively. Layer Brett isn’t just staking hyperbole. It is built on Ethereum’s Layer-2, meaning smooth finality and minimal fees, making daily interactions seamless. The project layers in gamified elements, NFT integrations, and community incentives, including a million-dollar giveaway, to create virality beyond mere buzz. The best part? Token holders get to stake their tokens for up to 30,000%+ APY. This blend of memetic energy and DeFi architecture positions Layer Brett as a token that is building a new meme trend. If analysts’ predictions are anything to go by, the 120x runs of Shiba Inu or Dogecoin may start to look modest in comparison. Conclusion Q3 2025 may prove to be a turning point for multiple altcoins. Cardano, buoyed by whale accumulation and tightening supply, teeters on the edge of a breakout while Chainlink rides on institutional confidence and improved governance metrics. Then there is Layer Brett , a radical departure from the hype driven meme narratives. It operates on a different axis: volatility married with structure, humor fused with utility. LBRETT’s ongoing presale reflects its massive potential to change the $72 billion meme market forever, and investors aren’t holding back. Right now, LBRETT is priced at just $0.0047 in its opening presale stages. Layer Brett is still in presale, but it won’t be forever. Get in now before prices rise and rewards drop.

In a blink-and-you-miss-it move, Bitcoin experienced a significant Bitcoin price surge , jumping an impressive 1.56% in just five minutes on the Binance USDT market. This rapid ascent pushed BTC’s value to $112,532.57, catching the immediate attention of traders and investors worldwide who constantly monitor market movements. Such sudden upticks are a hallmark of the digital asset space, reflecting both its immense potential and its inherent volatility. What Drives Such a Rapid Bitcoin Price Surge? Such swift movements are not uncommon in the volatile world of digital assets. However, a 1.56% increase in merely five minutes is particularly noteworthy. This specific Bitcoin price surge highlights the intense liquidity and rapid reaction times inherent in the crypto markets. Several factors often contribute to these quick rallies, transforming quiet periods into moments of intense activity: Large Buy Orders: A sudden influx of significant institutional or whale buy orders can quickly absorb available sell liquidity, creating an imbalance that pushes prices higher almost instantly. Positive Market Sentiment: Even minor positive news, perhaps an influential tweet or a regulatory update, can trigger a cascade of buying as traders anticipate further gains and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) sets in. Algorithmic Trading: Automated trading bots, programmed to react to specific market signals like volume spikes or price breakouts, can amplify initial price movements, executing trades at speeds impossible for human traders. Short Squeezes: If a large number of traders are betting against Bitcoin (shorting it), a sudden upward movement can force them to buy back to cover their positions, further fueling the price increase. Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial for navigating the fast-paced crypto landscape. These quick movements are not random; they are often the result of complex interactions between various market participants and external stimuli. Navigating the Dynamics of a Bitcoin Price Surge For many, a sudden Bitcoin price surge like this represents both immense opportunity and significant risk. Short-term traders often look for these moments to capitalize on rapid gains, but quick reversals are equally possible, turning potential profits into losses if not managed carefully. It’s a high-stakes environment where decisions need to be made with precision and speed. Therefore, having a clear, well-defined strategy is paramount for anyone involved in active trading. Set Clear Entry and Exit Points: Always define your profit targets and stop-loss levels before entering a trade. This disciplined approach helps protect capital and lock in gains. Monitor Order Books and Depth Charts: Observing buy and sell walls provides insights into market depth and potential resistance or support levels. A thin order book can mean prices move more dramatically. Stay Informed and Alert: Keep a constant eye on breaking news, macroeconomic indicators, and even social media sentiment. These can be immediate catalysts for a Bitcoin price surge or a sudden downturn. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Utilize tools like leverage cautiously, as it amplifies both gains and losses. Remember, while the potential for profit during such volatility is high, so is the risk of losses if not managed meticulously. Emotional decisions often lead to suboptimal outcomes in such dynamic market conditions. The Broader Implications of Bitcoin’s Volatility This recent Bitcoin price surge serves as a powerful reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility, a characteristic that defines the cryptocurrency market. While some traditional investors view this as a deterrent, many in the digital asset space see it as a key feature that provides ample trading and investment opportunities. Bitcoin’s price action often sets the tone for the wider cryptocurrency market, with altcoins frequently following its lead, sometimes with even greater percentage movements. The current trading price of $112,532.57 is a snapshot in time, reflecting the market’s collective sentiment and demand at that precise moment. Long-term investors, however, often focus less on these minute-by-minute fluctuations and more on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. They consider its role as a decentralized store of value, its increasing institutional adoption, and its potential as a hedge against inflation. This perspective emphasizes the asset’s resilience and adaptability in the evolving global digital economy. In conclusion, the swift 1.56% Bitcoin price surge on Binance underscores the dynamic and exhilarating nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such rapid movements demand vigilance and strategic thinking from short-term traders, they also reinforce Bitcoin’s position as a dominant and influential force in the financial world. Whether you are a seasoned investor tracking every tick or a curious newcomer exploring the space, staying informed and understanding market mechanics is vital to successfully navigate these exciting waves. The journey of digital assets continues to be a captivating one, filled with both challenges and immense potential for innovation and growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused this specific Bitcoin price surge? A1: While a single definitive cause is often hard to pinpoint for such rapid movements, this particular Bitcoin price surge likely resulted from a combination of large buy orders, positive market sentiment, and algorithmic trading activity on the Binance USDT market. Q2: Is a 1.56% rise in 5 minutes significant for Bitcoin? A2: Yes, a 1.56% increase in just five minutes is considered a significant, rapid movement for an asset of Bitcoin’s market capitalization, highlighting its extreme volatility and the potential for quick gains or losses. Q3: How should traders react to such rapid price movements? A3: Traders should always have a pre-defined strategy, including clear entry/exit points and stop-loss orders. It is crucial to avoid emotional decisions and prioritize risk management during highly volatile periods like a Bitcoin price surge . Q4: Does this surge indicate a long-term trend for Bitcoin? A4: A short-term Bitcoin price surge of five minutes typically does not indicate a long-term trend.

This impressive move has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally, signaling a renewed vigor in the digital asset market. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has indeed risen above this key level, officially trading at $113,032.02 on the prominent Binance USDT market. This latest achievement sparks crucial questions about the underlying forces and future implications for the broader crypto ecosystem. What’s Driving This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? Several factors are contributing to this notable Bitcoin price surge . Market analysts point to a confluence of macroeconomic trends, increasing institutional adoption, and evolving investor sentiment. Understanding these drivers is essential for anyone tracking the digital asset space. Institutional Interest: A growing number of large financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This influx of institutional money provides significant buying pressure. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and the recent halving events inherently create scarcity. As demand increases against a limited supply, the price naturally trends upwards. Global Economic Landscape: Uncertainties in traditional markets, coupled with inflationary concerns, often push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Many see it as ‘digital gold.’ Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in the Bitcoin network and the broader crypto infrastructure enhance its utility and accessibility, attracting more users. These elements combine to create a robust environment for BTC’s upward trajectory, cementing its position as a leading digital asset. This momentum fuels optimism across the entire crypto market. Understanding the Impact of BTC’s New Milestone Crossing the $113,000 threshold is more than just a number; it represents a significant psychological and technical milestone for Bitcoin. This Bitcoin price surge can have wide-ranging effects on various aspects of the cryptocurrency market and investor behavior. Firstly, it can bolster investor confidence. When Bitcoin achieves new price highs, it often attracts new capital, as potential investors perceive it as a more stable and profitable asset. Secondly, this milestone can trigger a positive ripple effect across altcoins. Historically, a strong Bitcoin performance often leads to an ‘altcoin season,’ where other cryptocurrencies also experience price appreciation. Furthermore, this upward movement strengthens Bitcoin’s narrative as a legitimate and powerful financial instrument, rather than just a speculative asset. The increasing mainstream acceptance means more businesses and individuals are considering integrating BTC into their financial strategies. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors For both seasoned and new investors, a significant Bitcoin price surge presents opportunities but also requires careful consideration. Making informed decisions is paramount in the volatile crypto market. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Always understand the fundamentals of any asset before investing. Rely on reputable sources like Bitcoin World for market monitoring and analysis. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. The crypto market, while promising, remains highly volatile. Diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risks. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term gains are tempting, many successful crypto investors adopt a long-term ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy, believing in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and technological updates. This helps you react strategically to market changes. This period of growth encourages both caution and optimism. It is crucial to approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Bitcoin? Despite the positive momentum and the current Bitcoin price surge , challenges persist. Regulatory scrutiny remains a key concern, with governments worldwide exploring how to best manage digital assets. Market volatility, while offering opportunities, also carries inherent risks, and sudden price corrections are always a possibility. Geopolitical events can also impact investor sentiment and market stability. However, the resilience of the Bitcoin network and its growing ecosystem suggest that it is well-positioned to navigate these challenges. The community’s continuous efforts in development and advocacy contribute to its long-term viability. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin The recent Bitcoin price surge above $113,000 is a powerful indicator of its enduring strength and growing appeal. It underscores Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital experiment to a significant global financial asset. While the path forward may have its twists and turns, the current momentum suggests a compelling future for BTC as it continues to redefine traditional finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for Bitcoin to rise above $113,000? A: This milestone indicates strong investor confidence and significant buying pressure, pushing Bitcoin’s value to new heights. It often signals a bullish trend in the broader crypto market.

The price is trading around $5.95, just below the upper Bollinger Band at $6.44, indicating possible overextension. RSI at 63.79 suggests moderately strong momentum, though edging close to overbought territory. The MACD remains bullish but is beginning to show slower momentum, signaling a potential consolidation. Key support rests at $5.36, with stronger downside protection around $4.28. If bulls maintain control, a retest of $6.40–$6.50 is possible, but failure to break higher could trigger a pullback toward $5.50, making consolidation the most likely short-term scenario. PENDLE/USD 4-hour chart PENDLEUSD chart by TradingView Pendle’s 4-hour chart shows a pullback after testing resistance near $6.24, now consolidating around $5.94. The upper Bollinger Band rejection suggests short-term exhaustion, while support lies at $5.71 and $5.19. The MACD remains positive but is flattening, signaling slowing bullish momentum. Balance of Power is negative at -0.75, reflecting increased seller control in the short term. Despite this, the broader uptrend structure remains intact as long as price holds above $5.70. A rebound above $6.00 could revive bullish momentum toward $6.40, but failure to hold support risks a drop toward $5.50, indicating cautious consolidation in the near term.

On the 4-hour chart, price rejected resistance at $6.24 and retraced slightly, showing short-term seller pressure with Balance of Power negative at -0.75. MACD remains in bullish territory but is flattening, hinting at consolidation. If Pendle sustains above $5.70, buyers may regain control and push toward $6.40.

Anti-fraud service Scam Sniffer has noted an increase in phishing scams where attackers target addresses upgraded under the new EIP-7702 standard. The EIP-7702 feature, which was introduced as part of the Pectra upgrade from May, is designed to enhance wallet functionality by allowing Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to temporarily behave like smart contracts. This feature encourages optimization by allowing multiple operations to be executed within a single transaction, thereby improving efficiency for legitimate users. However, the feature has reportedly opened them up to new exploitation windows. There have been at least three victims this month The latest unfortunate victim reportedly lost a total of $1.54 million after signing EIP-7702 phishing batch transactions that contained multiple token transfers and NFT approval operations. Part of those funds has reportedly been bridged to Mainnet via Relay Protocol. Exploiters bridged the stolen funds to Mainnet via Relay Protocol. Sourcce: @realScamSniffer (X/Twitter) The case comes two days after Scam Sniffer announced that another investor had lost $1M in tokens and NFTs after signing phishing batch transactions disguised as Uniswap swaps. That exploit came weeks after the anti-fraud service reported that an EIP-7702 upgraded address lost $66k to the same group using the same exploit. These schemes involve a fraudulent DeFi interface that is typically designed to mimic platforms like Uniswap. The victims were prompted to approve transactions that at first glance appeared routine, but in reality, were authorized hidden transfers. Upon approval, attackers would drain the wallet almost instantly, siphoning crypto and NFTs. According to Scam Sniffer, many users are still in the dark about the risks linked to EIP-7702 because it is a recent development. Since the malicious transactions are usually structured to appear normal, unsuspecting users are vulnerable. Security experts have reported EIP-7702 exploits since June Scam Sniffer has confirmed that phishing attacks targeting EIP-7702 upgraded addresses have gone up, indicating a growing trend. However, it is not a new trend, as security experts have been reporting incidents for months now. In June, Wintermute researchers revealed exploiters have targeted several unsuspecting crypto wallets with “automated sweeper” attacks, this time, using “delegate contracts”– a new feature launched as part of the EIP 7702. While EIP-7702 brings new convenience, it also introduces new risks Our Research team found that over 97% of all EIP-7702 delegations were authorized to multiple contracts using the same exact code. These are sweepers, used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised… pic.twitter.com/xHp7zr4hC9 — Wintermute (@wintermute_t) May 30, 2025 In a series of tweets shared via its official X handle, Wintermute claimed its research team had discovered that over 80% of all EIP-7702 delegations were authorized to multiple contracts using the same exact code. They called them sweepers and reported that they are used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised addresses. The malicious attempts by hackers to drain ETH from wallets have continued despite the Ethereum Foundation’s one trillion dollar security program, which it announced on May 14. To be safe, Scam Sniffer has urged users to be cautious and vigilant when approving batch transactions and to verify interfaces carefully before signing anything. Fake DeFi platforms designed to mimic legitimate ones have been tagged as one of the most common attack vectors in the crypto sector, and the introduction of batch transactions, though proven to improve user experience for legitimate applications, has added complexity while increasing the chance of an exploit. The best way to get ahead of the issue is to use only trusted applications and triple-check permissions granted during every transaction, batched or not. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-price-discovery-is-next-heres-why/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent crypto analyst on X, recently shared a monthly chart suggesting a massive rally. The chart spans more than a decade of price history, distinguishing between where XRP has traded heavily and where the market has moved quickly with little volume. Analyzing the Chart On the chart, heavier volume appears across the bands where XRP spent years consolidating, while the region above the current price shows little historical activity. In the chart, Steph marked the upper portion as “Last Resistance.” Several horizontal levels are drawn below the current price. These appear to represent zones that in the past acted as resistance and now function as support. Despite some minor volatility , recent monthly candles are holding above these levels, signaling that the breakout has pushed XRP out of its long-standing range. #XRP PRICE DISCOVERY IS NEXT! pic.twitter.com/a2SYXCmAv4 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 23, 2025 When an asset clears the bulk of its historical resistance on a high timeframe, there are few points of reference until new ones form. The chart suggests that XRP is now in that situation, with Steph predicting a new phase of price discovery for the digital asset. Where Is XRP Going Next? The chart does not contain a specific target level. However, the scale of the vertical axis provides a practical reference. The $5 mark is the next round figure clearly visible on the chart, and it sits above the digital asset’s recent peak of $3.65 , which now serves as the highest resistance level. A move to that level would represent an increase of about 63.9% from the cryptocurrency’s price of $3.05. This target illustrates the type of increase that price discovery often implies, and the openness of Steph’s analysis suggests the asset could climb much higher. What Would Validate the Message For the breakout to remain intact, monthly closes should hold above the horizontal bands that were drawn beneath the current price. These levels now serve as the base of support, and leave considerable room for further movement if XRP can surpass the resistance levels. However, if the price falls back below them, the asset might lose momentum and retest lower levels. Other analysts have highlighted $3.65 as a crucial level to overcome before a rapid ascent, and Steph’s analysis reinforces the idea of a clear upward path once the digital asset can surpass this resistance level.

While major projects like Ethereum and Solana topped the list, relatively lesser-known altcoins like Wayfinder (PROMPT) and Xterio (XTER) also stood out with high volume on Bithumb. According to experts, this increase stems from rising risk appetite in Asian markets and strong demand for transactions in the Korean won. This is particularly evident in the interest observed in AI-focused and gaming-focused altcoins.

Star Xu, the exchange’s CEO, announced the news on X, insinuating that OKX has a better understanding of how the crypto market operates. $100 Ecosystem Fund For Builders on OKX’s X Layer Xu started his post by stating that “true builders know crypto is a marathon, not a sprint.” He further noted that both OKX and X Layer were designed for the long run and on this premise, they are launching a $100 million Ecosystem Fund. This initiative is to provide support to global builders, particularly those busy shaping the next wave of onchain applications. There is an open call for builders who have a long-term vision and are focused on real technology. “But if your goal is just a quick pump-and-dump token, we’re not the place for you,” the OKX CEO explained on X. OKX and Polygon Team Up For X Layer More than a year ago, OKX and Ethereum-based layer-2 protocol Polygon teamed up to officially release the former’s X Layer engine on the mainnet. The goal of the X Layer network is to improve speed and make Ethereum transactions more affordable for its users. Through this network, users were promised easy interaction with Decentralized Applications (dApps). They can also trade digital assets and participate in various blockchain activities. The X Layer is built using the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) and uses Zero Knowledge (ZK) for security. Haider Rafique, the Chief Marketing Officer of OKX, also commented. He noted that the network is designed for forward-thinking creators who are developing applications to onboard millions of people onto the blockchain. OKX Brings Major Upgrade to its X Layer It is worth noting that this announcement about the $100 million fund comes almost two weeks after OKX talked about its major upgrade to its X Layer network. This means that it is transitioning into a public blockchain optimized for payments and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This overhaul involves the optimization of the economic model of its OKB Gas Token. This means that OKX will upgrade the OKB smart contract to remove functions for additional issuance and manual burning. By carrying putting action, the total OKB supply will be permanently fixed at 21 million tokens. In parallel, OKX will also fade out the OKTChain, with OKT trading scheduled to end at 14:10 (UTC+8) on August 13, 2025.

Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) have caught attention with extreme relative price action, but emerging projects like Remittix are quietly building infrastructure for cross-border payments. With its presale success and beta wallet launch, Remittix is heralded as a low gas fee cryptocurrency project with practical utility in the real world, offering an excellent choice for early investors seeking high growth and true adoption opportunities. Solana and Sui Price Performance and Market Highlights Solana is priced at $203.30, up 4.93%, while Sui crypto is priced at $3.69, with a small gain of 0.55%. Solana’s market cap is $109.83 billion, trading volume of $10.87 billion, increasing by 46.73%, indicating high demand by investors. Sui’s crypto market cap stands at $12.98 billion, trading volume of $1.52 billion per day, decreasing by 8.7%, indicating selective buying. These statistics indicate a mixed but upbeat trend in the crypto market since investors are keeping a keen eye on performance trends. Remittix Presale Success and Plans for Wallet Launch While Solana and Sui are taking center stage, Remittix (RTX) goes unnoticed in becoming a cryptocurrency of utility in the real world. The presale has hit over $21 million, with over 616 million RTX tokens sold at the prevailing price of $0.0969 per token. This was an achievement that saw Remittix get its first listing on a central exchange on BitMart, enhancing liquidity and access for investors.

Unlike only speculative projects, RTX aims to address a $19 trillion payments problem by enabling users around the world to send cryptocurrency directly into bank accounts. Its deflationary tokenomics reward long-term holders, and the project’s initial success has positioned it to be one of the leading crypto presales of 2025. For early investors in crypto, Remittix offers real-world utility, strategic exchange listings, and a cross-border payments infrastructure that few altcoins can hope to equal. What’s Building Confidence in Remittix: Global Reach: Instant 30+ country transfers Utility-Driven: Real-world adoption and not speculation Launch of the Wallet Beta: Q3 2025, basic mobile application Benefits of Early Access: Referral bonuses and deflationary tokenomics Why Remittix Could Spearhead the Next Cryptocurrency Adoption Wave Remittix combines real-world utility with investable value in an early stage, setting it apart from typical altcoin noise. While Solana Price and Sui crypto price gains make headlines, RTX is quietly building infrastructure for mass adoption. As growing presale participation, strategic exchange listings, and the beta wallet launch put Remittix in the limelight, it could become one of the best cryptos to invest in now.

In 2025, all eyes are turning toward XYZVerse (XYZ)—a project that blends sports passion with crypto culture and has already sparked strong buzz among retail investors. With its presale raising millions and token prices climbing through multiple stages, XYZVerse is emerging as more than just another short-lived meme play. Instead, it’s building momentum through a dedicated fan-driven ecosystem, promising both cultural relevance and potential financial upside. But what exactly is fueling this surge, and why are so many early adopters betting on XYZVerse’s surge? Why is XYZVerse.io a must-watch token of the year? Let’s dive in and find out. Understanding XYZVerse – the first all-sports meme token Coin name XYZVerse ($XYZ) Contract Address 0xD75Ab4b69F2eDfb072fDFD7e2D15a875f95Ae5ae Funds Raised $15M+ Launch Date Q4 2025 (Listing target: $0.10) Current Price Performance 5,300% (from $0.0001 to current stage price of $0.0054) Community 21K+ X followers, 12K+ Telegram followers Contract Safety Audited by Pessimistic Audit and SolidProof XYZVerse is a meme coin project built on the idea of sports betting, gamified staking, and crypto. It carves out a unique niche as the first all-sports meme coin, a concept that naturally connects with a wide audience of sports fans. XYZ aims to add real-world utility for sports lovers through crypto. One major step forward is its partnership with bookmaker.XYZ , a decentralized sportsbook and casino. Thanks to this, $XYZ holders enjoy exclusive betting perks, rewards, and access to play-to-earn experiences. XYZVerse is building a full-featured ecosystem that will eventually include Telegram-based mini games, airdrop events, and upcoming dApps focused on staking, rewards, and deeper community engagement. How XYZVerse Has Redefined Presale and Reached $15M+ XYZVerse launched its presale with a structure aimed at rewarding early adopters and maintaining long-term growth. Initially, the token price increased with each new stage, and that’s how $XYZ grew from just $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.0054 today, marking a remarkable gain of over 5,000%. Recently, the team upgraded this model to make the process more dynamic. Instead of fixed stages, the price now climbs with every $100,000 raised. This change eliminates delays between stages and adds a real sense of urgency, as every purchase moves the price up. The presale will continue under this structure until the target cap of $30 million is reached, pushing momentum and incentivizing faster participation. As of today, $XYZ has already raised over $15 million, reflecting community confidence in the token. To further boost engagement and trust, XYZVerse has launched a dedicated Telegram channel where users can track live updates on the presale progress. Every new contribution is logged and visible to the community, thus creating a transparent, fast-paced environment where buyers can actually see the total raised amount grow almost in real time. Every second you wait, someone else is buying. Get $XYZ while the presale is live How Secure and Reliable Is XYZVerse? Though XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, it’s already showing strong signs of legitimacy and thoughtful planning. Of course, as with any crypto project, the real test will come after launch when real-world utility and market traction can speak for themselves. But there are already some solid reasons to trust what’s being built. Independent Audit by a Leading Security Firm XYZVerse’s smart contract has undergone a full audit by Pessimistic , a highly regarded name in blockchain security. The results were reassuring: the contract was found to be secure, gas-efficient, and free from critical or high-risk vulnerabilities. The audit report is available to the public, showing a level of transparency rarely seen among meme coin projects. In a space flooded with unaudited, hastily assembled tokens, this gives XYZVerse a major credibility boost. Deflationary Tokenomics and Long-Term Supply Control With a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, XYZVerse incorporates scarcity into its design. But it doesn’t stop there—through an ongoing burn mechanism, tokens are gradually removed from circulation using buybacks. This approach helps reduce inflationary pressure and rewards those who hold for the long term, reinforcing a value-focused rather than hype-only model. A Deeper Look Into XYZVerse Tokenomics Structure XYZ tokenomics reveal a project’s economic structure and are a crucial factor in evaluating its long-term sustainability. XYZVerse adopts a clear and balanced tokenomics model , with a fixed total supply of 100 billion tokens, ensuring the project is non-inflationary and scarcity-driven by design. Total Supply: 100,000,000,000 A combined 30% is allocated to marketing and liquidity—15% each—ensuring early visibility and a seamless launch across centralized and decentralized exchanges. This provides the foundation for broad exposure and trading accessibility. One of the standout features is the 17.13% burn allocation, making XYZVerse one of the few meme coins to integrate a significant deflationary mechanism from day one. This design reduces overall supply over time, increasing scarcity and rewarding long-term holders. To sustain innovation and product development, 10% of the total supply is reserved for ecosystem growth and ongoing development. An additional 10% is allocated for airdrops, rewards, and community incentives, which encourages active participation and decentralized engagement. Unlike many meme projects that over-allocate to internal teams, XYZVerse takes a more disciplined approach with just 10% allocated to the team, aligning with industry best practices and promoting transparency. Most importantly, over 40% of the supply is directed toward community-focused distributions—including presale, key opinion leaders (KOLs), and airdrops—underscoring the project’s grassroots-first philosophy. If executed with consistency and transparency, this allocation model not only builds trust but also provides the necessary infrastructure for XYZVerse to maintain relevance and competitiveness well beyond its initial launch. What Does Community Say? Community sentiment around XYZVerse is overwhelmingly positive, signaling strong confidence in the project’s vision and trajectory. On CoinMarketCap , more than 96% of users have given $XYZ a bullish rating, placing it among the top-ranked meme coins by community approval. This optimism is echoed across the project’s social channels: 21K+ followers on X (formerly Twitter) 12K+ active Telegram members XYZVerse is already building the kind of community most early-stage crypto projects can only dream of. On platforms like X (formerly Twitter), users are actively discussing the project, sharing their excitement, and showing clear confidence in its potential. Many are calling it a “solid project” with real use cases, while others are pointing to the growing number of daily buyers and active presale momentum. The tone is overwhelmingly bullish, with plenty of users going “all in” or expressing that they’re “hyped” for what’s ahead. This kind of organic support speaks volumes. It shows that XYZVerse isn’t just gaining attention—it’s earning trust. When a project generates this much energy before even launching on exchanges, it’s often a strong signal of what’s to come. With community energy continuing to rise and broader market sentiment improving, XYZVerse is shaping up to be one of the most promising meme coin contenders of the next cycle. The community is building fast. If you’re still on the sidelines, this may be your signal to jump in. What’s Ahead for XYZVerse? The outlook for XYZVerse appears increasingly promising as the project cements its position at the intersection of meme culture, gamified crypto experiences, and mainstream sports engagement. Backed by a strong roadmap and early presale momentum, XYZVerse is preparing for a major launch across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. This expansion will not only improve liquidity and visibility but also introduce $XYZ to a broader investor audience beyond presale participants. Several strategic developments are lined up to drive long-term growth: The rollout of staking and reward-based dApps will give holders new ways to earn passively while interacting with the platform. Telegram-based play-to-earn games will evolve, turning everyday engagement into real crypto rewards. Collaborations with influencers and athletes will help bridge the gap between Web3 and traditional sports fans. A robust marketing and sponsorship push is set to extend the brand’s reach well beyond the crypto-native space. Token burns and liquidity initiatives will help sustain price performance and reduce circulating supply. If the roadmap stays on track, XYZVerse has the potential to evolve from a breakout meme coin into a full-fledged Web3 entertainment hub with staying power beyond the next hype cycle. Final Verdict If XYZVerse continues to execute according to its roadmap and maintain its fast-growing community momentum, it has the potential to evolve from a speculative meme coin into one of the breakout crossover stories of the 2025 bull run. Its mix of real-world utility, sports integration, and strong tokenomics positions it well for sustained relevance in the Web3 space.

The new funding authorization, revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, replaces the $500 million program Hut 8 launched late last year. That earlier program had already brought in nearly $300 million before the company pulled the plug. AI megaproject in Louisiana Last week, Hut 8 broke ground on what could become one of the most ambitious AI data center projects in the country: a $2.5 billion campus in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. Set across 611 acres near Entergy’s River Bend substation, the project will eventually feature two 450,000-square-foot buildings packed with computing hardware. The first is expected to be ready by the end of 2025, with the second following within two years. Officials say thousands of construction jobs will be created in the short term, with dozens of high-skilled, long-term roles once the facility is operational. A pivot beyond the mining grind Bitcoin miners have been squeezed by rising network difficulty, volatile BTC prices, and tighter energy markets. Margins are thinner, competition is tougher, and relying solely on mining has become a risky strategy. Hut 8 has responded with a pivot. The company recently went through a corporate rebranding and branded itself as a “power-first, platform-driven business,” a signal that it wants to be seen as more than just a bitcoin miner. Alongside mining, it has been investing heavily in hosting operations, high-density compute, and GPU-as-a-service offerings. In practice, that means Hut 8 is straddling two fast-moving markets: crypto and AI. The $1 billion ATM facility gives the company flexibility to scale on both fronts. It’s a financial cushion that could help fund new ASIC deployments while also financing massive data center projects like Louisiana. What’s at stake for Hut 8? For Hut 8, this is about more than hedging against Bitcoin’s cycles . It’s a long-term bet that AI demand will remain sky-high, and that enterprises will continue paying top dollar for reliable computing power at scale. If Hut 8 delivers on schedule, the Louisiana campus could turn it into a major player in AI infrastructure, alongside its established Bitcoin mining business. With a fresh $1 billion fundraising capacity and one of the largest AI-focused data center projects in the U.S. underway, Hut 8 is making its intentions clear: it wants to be a leader not only in Bitcoin mining but in the world of compute power as well.

Amid market uncertainty, the spotlight is shifting to a select few cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, institutional support, and massive upside potential. At the top of the list? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin (BTC), and NEAR Protocol, each tipped by analysts for potential 40x gains in the next cycle. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to buy, this article breaks down why these three picks stand out right now — and how they’re positioned for serious growth as we head toward Q4 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Explosive Presale Crypto With 40x+ ROI Forecast Of all the best cryptos to buy, there is no one that talks more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rapidly developing altcoin that brings together strong branding, practical use, and viral propagation. Demand is surging as investors scramble to grab tokens before the next pump. The live countdown adds urgency, making now the ideal time to enter. With a limited token supply and deflationary design, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built for long-term appreciation. For investors who missed the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare second chance to get in early on a high-potential project. With strong community backing, limited token supply, and massive growth projections, it could be the next big thing in crypto — before everyone else catches on. If you’re looking for a hidden gem with high upside and low current exposure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is easily one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Bitcoin (BTC) — Still the Market Leader Despite Volatility Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high on August 14, 2025, before retreating to the $113,000–$115,000 range. For the past few days macroeconomic worries and investors’ decision to take profits have been driving a pullback. As a result, the market has opened up a new entry point for long-term investors. Key Reasons Bitcoin Remains One of the Best Cryptos to Buy: The Power of Institutional Support Remains High: In spite of $523 million in ETF withdrawals on August 20, the total ETF inflows in 2025 are still more than $54.85 billion. Broad Use of Institutional Funds: Several top firms like MicroStrategy, Harvard, and Amdax are persistently making BTC acquisitions for their treasuries as a part of their overall strategy. Even with short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin’s long-term story of scarcity, adoption, and global trust makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in any market condition. NEAR Protocol — Institutional Inflows +Cutting-Edge Tech NEAR Protocol has quietly positioned itself as one of the most advanced and promising Layer-1s in the space. With a surge of institutional interest and aggressive technical upgrades, NEAR is emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy for mid-to-long-term growth. Why NEAR Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio Institutional Inflows: NEAR received more than $10.1 million of new capital in mid-August to be more precise, this inflow was mainly driven by regulatory changes and the opening of retirement accounts. Game-Changing Upgrades: Nightshade 2.0 and Stateless Validation have significantly enhanced throughput and decentralization, as well as lowered the users’ hardware requirements by 70%. Cross-Chain Compatibility: The support of Ethereum wallet via MetaMask makes NEAR accessible to 80M+ potential users, thus greatly facilitating the adoption process. Bullish Setup: As the price is around $2.75 at the moment, a breakout above $2.92 could be the beginning of an ascent towards $3.10 and further. NEAR is at the intersection of DeFi, AI, and interoperability — and investors are starting to notice. It’s a clear pick among the best cryptos to buy as technical progress and institutional support accelerate. Final Thoughts: Best Cryptos to Buy This Week With market volatility comes opportunity. While some coins struggle, others are gearing up for massive moves. If you’re wondering where to invest, the best cryptos to buy right now offer a mix of security, growth, and innovation. This Week’s Top Crypto Picks: MAGACOIN FINANCE – Presale sensation with 40x potential Bitcoin (BTC) – Market leader with institutional backbone and bullish long-term outlook NEAR Protocol (NEAR) – Tech powerhouse with fresh inflows and cross-chain adoption If you are either putting together a portfolio for 2025 or searching for the next big things, the top cryptocurrencies to purchase this week are these.

The right PR partner can get your project seen in tier-one outlets, build investor confidence, and keep you credible through bull and bear cycles. This 2025 ranking reviews the 10 best crypto PR agencies, highlights their specialties, and shares case studies of how they’ve delivered results. Why Crypto PR Matters More Than Ever in 2025 Noise levels are higher than ever: Thousands of tokens launch monthly. Standing out requires smart narrative strategy. Reputation equals valuation: With regulatory oversight increasing, trust and credibility weigh as much as community hype. Media is selective: Outlets like CoinTelegraph or Decrypt want real stories, not generic press releases. Momentum is fragile: Missing a timely PR push during market cycles can mean losing traction permanently. That’s why the agencies listed below don’t just push news—they translate complex Web3 products into stories investors, media, and users actually engage with. How to Pick the Right PR Partner Match your milestone: Fundraising, token launch, exchange listing, or community growth all demand different strengths. Ask for case studies: Agencies should prove results in your niche, not just show a client logo wall. Define metrics upfront: Whether it’s backlinks, referral traffic, or investor meetings, PR should be tracked, not guessed. Test adaptability: Markets move fast—your PR team should pivot messaging when sentiment shifts.

What makes a crypto PR agency different from a traditional PR firm?Crypto PR agencies specialize in blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. They understand token launches, exchange listings, regulatory sensitivities, and the fast-moving nature of the market. Traditional agencies may excel in consumer or corporate PR, but often lack the industry-specific media relationships and investor/community connections crypto projects need. 2. How do I know if a PR agency is delivering real results?Look beyond vanity metrics like the number of press releases. Real results include: Backlinks and SEO impact Referral traffic from media placements Share of voice against competitors Investor outreach or meeting requests generated from campaigns. Agencies like Outset PR stand out for explicitly tracking these performance metrics. 3. Do I need PR during a bear market? Yes. In fact, bear markets are when PR matters most. Visibility and credibility built during downturns position projects to accelerate when sentiment improves. Agencies with adaptive strategies—such as Coinbound’s influencer flexibility or Outset PR’s context-aware storytelling—help brands maintain relevance even in quieter cycles. 4. How quickly can I expect results from a crypto PR campaign?Press release distribution can take 24–48 hours, while earned media placements may take weeks of pitching. Building long-term credibility (like thought leadership) takes months. Agencies that track KPIs transparently make it easier to measure short-term wins alongside long-term gains.

According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring, a truly significant event has unfolded: Bitcoin’s Price Surge has pushed BTC astonishingly above the $113,000 mark. This is not just a number; it represents a powerful moment for the digital asset market, capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike. What’s Driving This Phenomenal Bitcoin’s Price Surge? Many factors contribute to such a dramatic upward movement in the market. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone following cryptocurrency trends. This particular Bitcoin’s Price Surge reflects a confluence of various influences. Increased Institutional Adoption: More large financial institutions are showing interest in Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class. This influx of institutional capital provides significant buying pressure. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic uncertainties often drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which some consider a digital safe haven. Halving Event Narrative: While not recent, the impact of previous Bitcoin halving events often fuels long-term bullish sentiment, creating anticipation for future scarcity and value. These elements combine to create a robust environment, encouraging investors to engage with Bitcoin. Moreover, the increasing mainstream acceptance further solidifies its position. The Immediate Impact of BTC Crossing $113,000 When BTC crosses such a significant threshold, the immediate market reaction is palpable. Bitcoin is currently trading at an impressive $113,033.86 on the Binance USDT market, a widely recognized platform for cryptocurrency trading.

This time, it’s dressed up as a “crypto treasury” firm. But just like the last two times, his base is paying the price. The setup is simple: Trump cashes out early. Everyone else eats the loss. According to The Wall Street Journal , the strategy looks eerily familiar to anyone who’s watched his past financial ventures blow up in supporters’ faces. The playbook hasn’t changed. Trump burns backers again with Truth Social collapse When Trump dropped his Truth Social platform through Trump Media & Technology Group, fans jumped in. But those who didn’t get in before it changed its ticker to DJT got crushed. That stock is now down 52% from right before the merger. From the high it reached a week later, it’s dropped 73%. Not learning the lesson, many went straight into $TRUMP, his personal memecoin launched in January. Early buyers flipped profits fast. But anyone who joined after the first 24 hours got wiped out. By the day Trump was sworn in again, it had fallen 90%. That’s still better than $Melania, which did even worse. The only thing that half-worked was the NFT drop. Trump sold $99 digital trading cards of himself posing as everything from a superhero to a space commander. Those NFTs hit a floor price of almost $800 at one point. Today, the cheapest one goes for around $200. But over the last week, individual sales have bounced between $82 and $846. Like always, late buyers lost the most. Now comes a new pitch: a “crypto treasury” company modeled after what Michael Saylor pulled off with MicroStrategy, now renamed Strategy. Saylor’s model is simple: use company cash, debt, and equity to buy bitcoin nonstop. It now holds more than 3% of all bitcoin in circulation, worth $70 billion. Trump’s family saw the hype and copied the structure, but swapped out bitcoin for a token called WLFI. The coin comes from World Liberty Financial, a company co-founded by Trump and his sons. As part of the fundraising, World Liberty took a stake in crypto firm Alt5 Sigma. The campaign is trying to raise $1.5 billion to buy WLFI tokens. Eric Trump, Trump’s son, now sits on Alt5’s board. WLFI is scheduled to go live in September. But it doesn’t offer ownership, profits, or anything concrete. It gives holders just 5% of the vote in the governance of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin controlled by World Liberty. That’s it. Bitcoin has a cap. WLFI doesn’t. It has no track record. The only value? Buying it is a public show of loyalty to Trump. Unless the holdings are massive enough to trigger disclosures, no one would even know you hold any. Meanwhile, Trump holds a mountain of WLFI. And a company tied to him is entitled to take 75% of any WLFI sold by World Liberty. That’s where the money is. Not in the token. In the setup. The profits don’t go to the public. They go straight back to Trump. Owen Lamont, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, said , “This phenomenon violates every principle of finance. Before, people had to do complicated things to bamboozle investors. Now they can just do the simple thing.” And there’s history to back him up. Stocks that trade way above their actual asset value never hold up. The Taiwan Fund, launched in 1986, once had a premium of 300%. Today, it trades below the value of its holdings. Destiny Tech100, which has private equity stakes in SpaceX and OpenAI, soared to 20 times its asset value before falling back. It still trades at a premium, but far from the peak. So when Trump promises infinite upside, remember the cycle: he cashes in first, and everyone else gets left behind. There is no such thing as a perpetual money machine. Not even in crypto.

For some, this downturn sparks fear of further losses. For others, it represents a golden opportunity. Savvy investors know that volatility has always been part of the game – and those who buy during the dips are often the ones who end up with the biggest gains. While established assets like BTC and ETH continue to show resilience, new projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching attention as rare early-entry opportunities during this waiting period before the next altcoin boom. Why Buying the Dip Still Works The idea of “ buying the dip ” is simple but powerful: accumulate assets when prices fall, and profit when they rebound. In crypto, this strategy has proven successful across multiple cycles. Each major crash has historically been followed by fresh all-time highs as adoption grows and new narratives take over. With Bitcoin ETFs now approved and Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades strengthening its fundamentals, the long-term trend remains bullish – even if short-term moves spark fear. Smart Strategies for Investors Jumping into the market without preparation can be risky. That’s why seasoned investors stick to strategies such as: Doing solid research (DYOR): Strong fundamentals and real-world use cases separate lasting projects from short-lived hype. Using dollar-cost averaging (DCA): Spreading investments over time helps smooth out volatility. Following sentiment indexes: Extreme Fear has historically been a strong buy signal, while Extreme Greed often signals overheated conditions. Exploring altcoins cautiously: While Bitcoin and Ethereum form the backbone of most portfolios, carefully selected altcoins often outperform in bull runs. How This New Altcoin Takes the Market by Storm While investors are patiently waiting for the altcoin boom, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a rare opportunity for those who get in early. The project has already raised millions , drawn a fast-growing community, and completed audits, making it one of the few newcomers that is consistently compared to some of the top tokens . Early adopters have seen major returns, and many believe this could just be the beginning as future exchange listings unlock wider access. In a market where timing is everything, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a name that forward-thinking investors don’t want to overlook. The Bigger Picture Despite the short-term volatility, institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, and blockchain technology is embedding itself deeper into global finance. If history is any guide, today’s dip will one day look like a massive discount. The key is patience, strategy, and the courage to act when others hesitate. In summary, while the crypto market may look uncertain now, the current pullback could prove to be one of the most profitable buying opportunities of this cycle. And with emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offering unique early-entry potential, investors who prepare today could be the ones celebrating tomorrow.

Blockchain tracking firm Ember CN reported that the hacker converted 7.957 million DAI to USDC before bridging the funds to Solana and purchasing the tokens at an average price of $208. Blueprint Of Bold Moves This is not the first major transaction tied to the hacker. Back in May, they offloaded 26,347 Ethereum for 68 million DAI at $2,588 per token. Two months later in July, they shifted gears and bought back 5,513 ETH for 14.865 million DAI, paying an average of $2,696 each. These calculated trades suggest the individual or group behind the breach is taking a measured approach rather than making random decisions. [从 Coinbase 用户处窃取资金的黑客] 在过去 1 小时里，把 795.7 万 DAI 换成 USDC 后跨链到 Solana，然后买成了 38,126 枚 SOL，购买价格 $208.7。 https://t.co/TRVVPiWIGS 这个黑客：1⃣5 月，出售 26,347 枚 ETH 换成 6818 万 DAI，出售均价 $2,588。2⃣7 月，1486.5 万 DAI 重新购买 5,513 枚… https://t.co/4HBWNBF738 pic.twitter.com/GIPGqwUJYu — 余烬 (@EmberCN) August 24, 2025 Market conditions may have influenced this latest decision. Solana has gained more than 17% over the past 30 days, even though it remains down about 25% from its all-time high of $295 in January. Analysts believe the token could see more upside if current momentum holds. Technical Outlook Signals Room For Gains Trader Ucan has identified a rising channel in Solana’s price structure following a rounded bottom formation. Key resistance levels include $215 for the first barrier, $227 for a breakout signal, and $242 as an upper target. The channel’s top sits near $251. Another market voice, trader Ali, suggested holding Solana until it approaches $360, a level some expect if bullish sentiment stays strong. The hacker’s purchase price of $208 aligns with those optimistic calls. Whether the market rewards that bet remains to be seen, but the move places the hacker among investors banking on Solana’s rally continuing. Fallout From The Coinbase Breach The initial breach, which took place in May, impacted about 70,000 Coinbase users. The reports indicated that the hackers paid foreign customer-support contractors a bribe to gain access to sensitive user information between December 2024 and May 2025. Sensitive user information exposed consisted of full names, birth dates, addresses, phone numbers, masked bank account data, and scans of government identification. Coinbase made the hack public after being presented with a $20 million ransom payment, which Coinbase declined to make. CEO Brian Armstrong later confirmed the exchange would reimburse affected customers and announced a $20 million bounty for information leading to an arrest. The company estimates remediation costs could reach $400 million as it works to tighten security and restore user confidence. For now, attention remains on the hacker’s latest bet. Whether the Solana purchase proves profitable—or marks the beginning of more high-profile trades—will depend on what happens in the coming weeks as the market reacts to shifting sentiment.

This audited AI token has captured institutional attention following its strategic CoinMarketCap listing, with experts predicting it could deliver the kind of explosive growth that transforms a modest $2,000 investment into six-figure wealth. With demand skyrocketing and fundamentals that outshine many established projects, RUVI is positioning itself as the next major disruptor in the crypto space. CoinMarketCap Listing Ignites Avalanche-Level Momentum The strategic partnership with CoinMarketCap has catapulted Ruvi AI into the institutional spotlight, creating the same type of viral adoption that propelled Avalanche from obscurity to top-tier status. This premium placement has unlocked access to sophisticated trading desks and institutional funds that rely on CMC for project discovery. The market response has been nothing short of remarkable: $3.1M raised with unprecedented institutional velocity 240M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global community Holder base exceeding 3,000 members and growing exponentially Phase 2 now over 90% complete with guaranteed price appreciation This isn’t speculative retail buying, it’s strategic institutional accumulation that mirrors the sophisticated capital flows that elevated Avalanche to multi-billion-dollar status. Why Analysts Favor RUVI Over AVAX While Avalanche focused on blockchain infrastructure and DeFi applications, Ruvi AI targets immediate utility within the explosive $104 billion creator economy . This strategic positioning provides several advantages that analysts believe could drive superior performance: Market Size : The creator economy is growing exponentially, with millions of content creators seeking professional tools to maximize their reach and monetization potential. Immediate Utility : Unlike infrastructure plays that require ecosystem development, RUVI’s super app provides instant value to users through integrated AI-powered tools. Revenue Potential : Direct monetization through software-as-a-service models creates sustainable revenue streams that don’t depend solely on token speculation. CyberScope Audit Validates Outperformance Potential The successful completion of a comprehensive third-party audit by CyberScope provides the institutional-grade credibility that analysts believe positions RUVI for Avalanche-level success. This rigorous verification confirms that smart contracts meet the highest security standards, removing the trust barriers that often prevent major capital from entering early-stage opportunities. Unlike speculative projects that rely purely on market hype, RUVI has proactively established the security foundation that sophisticated investors demand before committing significant capital. Creator Economy Super App Powers Sustainable Growth Ruvi AI’s comprehensive platform empowers content creators with professional-grade tools that generate immediate utility and sustainable demand: Advanced Trend Research : Sophisticated AI-powered analytics identify viral topics and high-engagement opportunities across multiple platforms, helping creators stay ahead of algorithm changes and maximize reach. AI Script Generation : The platform creates compelling, platform-specific scripts optimized for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Shorts, and other formats while maintaining authentic voice and maximizing viral potential. Native Media Creation : Built-in image and video generation capabilities eliminate expensive third-party software subscriptions, allowing creators to produce professional-quality visuals directly within the ecosystem. Streamlined Workflows : Centralized planning, editing, scheduling, and publishing tools create efficient production pipelines that scale with growing content demands. This comprehensive utility creates sustainable demand from YouTubers, TikTokers, marketing agencies, and brands, organic adoption that supports extraordinary valuations. $2,000 Pathway to Six-Figure Wealth Ruvi AI’s transparent presale structure provides clear pathways for a $2,000 investment to potentially outperform established tokens like Avalanche: Current price : $0.015 (Phase 2 over 90% complete) Phase 3 launch : $0.020 ( 33% guaranteed increase ) Final presale price : $0.070 A strategic $2,000 investment at current prices could acquire approximately 133,333 tokens. At the $1 valuation that analysts believe RUVI can achieve, this position would be worth $133,333, representing a 6,566% ROI , without adding any present bonuses, which could significantly outperform AVAX’s historical returns. VIP Program Accelerates Wealth Creation RUVI’s VIP program rewards significant investments with substantial token bonuses, creating even faster pathways to six-figure wealth: VIP 2 ($750 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI . VIP 3 ($1,500 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI . VIP 5 ($7,500 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI . The active leaderboard giveaway adds competitive elements that drive participation and reward top contributors with additional tokens. WEEX Partnership Ensures Market Infrastructure The strategic alliance with WEEX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, guarantees seamless market access and enhanced liquidity once the presale concludes. This partnership provides the robust trading infrastructure needed to support large transactions throughout the journey to extraordinary valuations, ensuring that RUVI can accommodate the institutional interest that drove Avalanche’s success. Outperforming AVAX Becomes Reality With Phase 2 over 90% complete and the CoinMarketCap listing sending demand skyrocketing, all conditions align for RUVI to deliver returns that could outperform established tokens like Avalanche. The convergence of audit credibility, genuine utility, strategic partnerships, and guaranteed price appreciation creates perfect conditions for the kind of wealth transformation that turns $2,000 into six figures. The 33% price surge awaits the moment Phase 2 sells out, marking just the beginning of a journey that analysts believe could outshine even Avalanche’s remarkable performance.
