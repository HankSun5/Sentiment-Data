Qubetics Joins the Ranks of Top Crypto Assets with a Decentralized VPN Solution,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoins-success-story-repeats-qubetics-joins-the-ranks-of-top-crypto-assets-with-a-decentralized-vpn-solution/,"Bitcoin’s early days were marked by skepticism, uncertainty, and unparalleled opportunity. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009, there was no formal initial coin offering (ICO) or structured fundraising. Bitcoin could be mined with basic computer hardware, and early adopters acquired thousands of coins at virtually no cost. Over the years, Bitcoin’s rise has been nothing short of historic, transforming from an obscure digital experiment into a trillion-dollar asset. Those who recognized its potential early on have seen life-changing returns, as Bitcoin solidified its place among the top crypto assets . While Bitcoin’s best accumulation phase has long passed, the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities with strong long-term potential. Qubetics is one such project making strides in blockchain technology, introducing a decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) that enhances security, privacy, and unrestricted access to the internet. As concerns over digital surveillance and centralized control grow, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the top crypto assets to watch. Bitcoin: The Pioneer of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin emerged as a groundbreaking financial innovation, introducing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminated intermediaries. Unlike modern crypto projects that launch through ICOs or private sales, Bitcoin’s distribution was solely through mining. Those who mined or purchased Bitcoin in its earliest years had access to an asset that would later redefine digital finance. Over time, Bitcoin gained mainstream recognition as the most secure and decentralized network, driving its value from fractions of a cent to all-time highs exceeding $60,000. Bitcoin’s appeal has been strengthened by its limited supply of 21 million coins, censorship resistance, and adoption as a store of value. Institutional investors, corporations, and even governments have integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. However, with its current market maturity, Bitcoin has become more of a long-term asset than an emerging opportunity. Investors seeking projects with high upside potential are turning to the next wave of blockchain innovation, looking for the top crypto assets that offer real-world solutions. Qubetics: A New Opportunity in the Crypto Market Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency project. It is addressing a critical challenge that previous blockchain solutions have overlooked—online privacy. Traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have long been the go-to solution for internet users seeking security and anonymity. However, centralized VPN providers control user data, creating vulnerabilities where governments, hackers, or corporations can intercept or restrict access. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing network infrastructure. Instead of relying on central servers, Qubetics distributes traffic across a blockchain-based network of nodes, ensuring that no single authority has control over user data. This enhances privacy, protects against surveillance, and prevents censorship. Users can browse the internet freely without concerns over restricted access or data tracking. In an era where digital privacy is under constant threat, a decentralized approach to VPN technology positions Qubetics as a solution-driven project within the blockchain industry. With Qubetics integrating dVPN technology into its ecosystem, it is setting itself apart as a project with tangible use cases. As global internet restrictions increase and governments tighten control over digital access, demand for decentralized privacy solutions is expected to rise. Investors searching for top crypto assets with real-world applications are recognizing the significance of Qubetics and its potential in reshaping online security. Qubetics Crypto Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity The earliest opportunities to invest in Qubetics have already passed, and the project has gained momentum among investors. The whitelist stage required no upfront investment, allowing early participants exclusive access. The first presale round introduced $TICS at just $0.01, offering an entry point for those who recognized its potential early. Currently, in its 24th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0976, with over $14.5 million raised and more than 495 million tokens sold to 22,000 holders. Projections indicate that by the presale’s conclusion, $TICS could reach $0.25, offering an ROI of 156% at today’s price. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return jumps to 924%, and at $10 following the mainnet launch, early investors could see a staggering 10,137% ROI. Qubetics’ performance in this crypto presale signals strong investor confidence. With demand growing and privacy-focused blockchain applications gaining traction, its potential for long-term success continues to attract attention. As decentralized solutions become a necessity, the adoption of Qubetics’ technology could drive substantial value appreciation. Conclusion Bitcoin revolutionized finance, creating a decentralized digital asset that disrupted traditional financial systems. However, as Bitcoin transitions into a store of value, new blockchain projects are emerging with innovative applications that solve real-world problems. Qubetics is among the top crypto assets introducing meaningful advancements, particularly with its decentralized VPN, which challenges the vulnerabilities of centralized internet security solutions. As blockchain technology evolves, projects that provide practical utility will stand out in the market. Qubetics’ ongoing crypto presale presents an opportunity for early investors to gain exposure to a project that could shape the future of online privacy. With increasing demand for decentralized services, Qubetics is positioning itself as an investment worth serious consideration.

US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has assembled a dream team cutting across several departments and units of the securities watchdog. US SEC Confirms Crypto Task Force Members The SEC’s newly minted Crypto Task Force is raring to go following the confirmation of team members by Pierce. The US SEC Commissioner disclosed the team’s composition in a press release , hinting at a varied selection process. Pierce stated that the team comprises staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and several divisions within the SEC. Led by Pierce, the Commissioner had a free rein to select the task force members. “The Crypto Task Force exhibits deep expertise and an enthusiastic commitment to identifying -with the help of other talented staff across the Commission and interested members of the public – workable solutions to difficult crypto regulatory problems. The 15-man team comprises a Chief of Staff, a Chief Counsel, a Chief Policy Advisor, and a Chief of Operations. The remaining ranks are made up of 10 senior advisors drawn from various units within the US SEC. The Team Will Solve The Hardest Regulatory Issues Within days of assuming office, Acting US SEC Chair Mark Uyeda launched the Crypto Task Force to give the agency new direction. The agency is tasked with establishing the criteria for determining whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. Weeks after the announcement of the task force, the SEC disclosed that memecoins are not securities , urging the public to remain wary of scams. Pierce has hailed the new direction of the task force while criticizing regulation by enforcement during the Gensler era. The task force will be the main advisory body to the SEC on crypto-related matters. As a show of commitment, the Commission has dismissed Kraken’s case , ditching its actions against Coinbase and Gemini as well.

Kraken emphasized the importance of fact-based regulation and expressed optimism about collaborating with policymakers to create clearer rules. Changes in leadership at the SEC and White House appear to be driving a broader policy shift, offering relief to crypto firms previously targeted by enforcement actions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to a statement from the company. The case will be dropped with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Kraken will not admit to any wrongdoing, pay penalties, or change its business operations. SEC Ends Legal Fight Against Kraken, No Fines or Business Changes The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 , alleging it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, clearing agency, and dealer. The regulator also accused the company of commingling customer and corporate funds. Kraken contested the charges, leading a federal judge to rule the case had enough merit to proceed to trial. However, the exchange maintained that the lawsuit misrepresented its business and called the allegations politically motivated. But in a blog post released on March 3 , the company described the regulator’s case as baseless and politically motivated, doubling down on their claim that “Regulatory actions must be based on facts, not political agendas.” Kraken described the lawsuit as a misguided effort that misrepresented its business practices. “The SEC’s lawsuit, which mischaracterized our consistent business model, was always without merit,” the company said. https://t.co/4Ow50mZWhv pic.twitter.com/aURU02ZHU0 — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) March 3, 2025 The SEC’s move to dismiss the case comes amid a broader shift in regulatory attitudes toward the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. Kraken expressed optimism that the decision to drop the lawsuit may signal the end of an era marked by contentious legal battles between federal agencies and digital asset platforms, , pointing to leadership changes in Washington as a key factor. “We appreciate the new leadership both at the White House and the Commission that led to this change,” said a representative from the crypto platform. The company said it remains committed to working with policymakers to develop transparent regulations that support consumer protection while allowing for technological advancement. Now, pending approval from the SEC’s commissioners, Kraken says the charges will be dropped. Trump-Era SEC Policy Shift: Crypto Firms See Legal Relief Kraken’s victory marks a turning point in the SEC’s approach to crypto enforcement. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the agency pursued lawsuits against major crypto firms, arguing that most digital assets were unregistered securities. Critics condemned this “regulation by enforcement” strategy, saying it stifled innovation and pushed businesses offshore while other countries established clearer rules. Now, the SEC is taking a different path. Since the change in leadership, the agency has dropped multiple lawsuits and investigations, including cases against Consensys , Uniswap , Robinhood , and OpenSea. On February 27, it officially dismissed its case against Coinbase , further signaling a retreat from aggressive enforcement. Great news! After years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week)… pic.twitter.com/IlnoBs7N6n — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 21, 2025 This shift aligns with President Donald Trump’s broader regulatory approach. His nominee for SEC chair, Paul Atkins , is known for his pro-crypto stance, suggesting a massive change from Gensler’s approach. While Atkins awaits confirmation, acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has already begun scaling back enforcement efforts. According to a February report, the SEC has created the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) to fight crypto fraud rather than enforcing sweeping industry crackdowns. In a separate but related development, Coinbase is demanding answers from the SEC. The exchange has filed an FOIA request seeking details on the costs of the SEC’s crypto enforcement actions. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wants transparency on the amount of taxpayer money spent on investigations, lawsuits, and third-party contractors. After years of uncertainty under an enforcement-first approach that pushed innovation overseas, the digital assets industry now faces the prospect of a more balanced framework that could allow American crypto businesses to compete globally while still maintaining necessary consumer protections. This pivot raises important questions about how regulatory agencies should approach emerging technologies. As this new chapter unfolds, the challenge will be striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring market integrity; a balance that, if achieved, could position the U.S. well in a novel yet increasingly crucial sector of the global financial system.

Nasdaq Stock Market LLC made the filing on behalf of the firm as the firm pushes to expand its crypto product list. Grayscale Hedera ETF is Not New Per the filing, Grayscale plans to list the ETF product to track the underlying price of HBAR, the native currency of the Hedera blockchain. The 19b-4 is a crucial filing in the approval process for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) product. If approved, qualified investors can gain exposure to HBAR without directly holding the asset. If approved, the Hedera ETF product will trade on the Nasdaq exchange, like other funds from Grayscale investments. Key details tied to the fund, like the chosen custodian, were not disclosed. However, subsequent filings might confirm the custodian as Coinbase Custody, which the firm tapped for its GBTC and ETHE products. The Grayscale push for Hedera ETF has been spotted as early as January. Over the past few weeks, Canary Capital has pioneered the push for an HBAR ETF with the SEC . This implies that the Grayscale Hedera ETF product will not be the first of its kind. Grayscale Taking Frontline ETF Approach Over the past few weeks, Grayscale Investments has kept up with the crypto trust and ETF filings. To take a frontline position in the crypto ETF push, it has filed for the Cardano ETF , Solana ETF, and XRP ETF, amongst others. Meanwhile, the firm’s confidence in securing approvals hinges on its history with the US SEC. Grayscale won the lawsuit that compelled the markets regulator to revise its decision on Bitcoin ETF applications. Following this directive for review, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF products for trading in January 2024. Spot Ethereum ETF products followed shortly. As one of the largest issuers of these products, Grayscale has created a ready market to boost its push for more altcoin ETFs. US SEC and Crypto ETF Growth Beyond Grayscale, other asset managers are also pushing for crypto ETF approvals with the SEC. To stretch the regulator’s potential flexibility, asset managers like Rex-Osprey and Tuttle Capital have filings for Dogecoin ETF. Popular memecoins like TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK have ETF proposals to track prices. While Bloomberg has issued approval odds for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs, the chances of memecoin ETFs remain uncertain. The regulator is generally more open to the crypto market, as shown in the recently closed Kraken lawsuit . Whether this will translate to more crypto ETF approvals remains to be seen.

And some have suggested Moscow’s recent crypto pivot may be behind the Central Bank’s sudden decision. The Central Bank previously said that its nationwide rollout would take place on July 1, 2025. But in its most recent statements, the bank has announced that the launch will no longer take place as scheduled. Why Has Russia ‘Indefinitely Delayed’ Its CBDC Launch? And it has made no mention of a new launch date, leaving media commentators and analysts confused about the bank’s reasoning. Elvira Nabiullina, the Russian Central Bank Governor. (Source: RBC/Screenshot) Elvira Nabiullina, the Central Bank Governor, told Russian media outlets that Moscow will now “move on with the mass implementation of the digital ruble somewhat later than originally planned.” She added that the Central Bank would take a closer look at the results of its ongoing pilot. And she said that the bank wanted to hold new “consultation” sessions with commercial banks. Nabiullina further suggested that further talks were needed on the “economic model” that is “most attractive to banks’ clients, businesses, and people [in general].” These statements appear to suggest that the Central Bank is prepared – at least to some extent – to go back to the drawing board with some aspects of its CBDC. A Russian Central Bank employee. (Source: Telekanal Afontovo/Dzen/Screenshot) The Crypto Factor The Central Bank’s apparent lack of clarity on the matter has left media outlets with no recourse other than to speculate on the reasons for the delay. One of Russia’s top authorities on CBDCs, Insight Advocates, wrote in a social media post : “It is possible that the delay is due to a change in the Central Bank’s position on the use of cryptocurrencies in international settlements. It is possible that the digital ruble project will resume after inflation stabilizes and tests on new cross-border payment technology are complete.” The Central Bank has traditionally been vehemently opposed to crypto adoption. Nabiullina has repeatedly called for a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia . She has been the nation’s most vocal champion of CBDCs. She claims they will let Russia do business with its international partners, unheeded by Western sanctions. However, in recent times her voice has been drowned out by Russian pro-crypto advocates. Many people claim that while CBDC-powered trade is a long way off, crypto provides a powerful anti-sanctions solution that many international partners are ready to use. Reluctantly, Nabiullina has had to soften her stance on crypto, particularly after President Vladimir Putin embraced the crypto mining sector last year. Russia has been able to keep loading crude onto ships, but it’s having greater difficulty getting it off again, writes @JLeeEnergy https://t.co/4LkKCDlnYf — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 3, 2025 Trouble at the Central Bank? In an article from the IT-focused media outlet Comnews , the journalist Ivan Ivanov wrote: “The launch of the digital ruble has been postponed indefinitely. The head of the Central Bank claims that the reason is the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of medium and small banks. But perhaps this is only half of the truth.” He added that it was clear that “something has gone wrong.” Ivanov said the “main reason” was likely “the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of banks and businesses.” The journalist added: “To be honest, commerical banks are not interested in the digital ruble. It requires them – at their own expense – to build and integrate a new system that will not bring them any profits. It […] is profitable and even logical for them to try to delay the process for as long as possible.” Ivanov added that most people are “still unclear as to why exactly the digital ruble is needed.” Some of Russia’s biggest banks have previously dragged their feet on digital ruble pilot work. Most notably, the nation’s main banking association has repeatedly called for a delay . Sberbank, arguably the country’s biggest banking and IT player, was also notable by its absence in the first phase of the pilot, which launched in August 2023. In January this year, the same bank also called for a delay that would see the digital ruble launch in 2026 . Ivanov, meanwhile, noted that “despite denials,” a “persistent rumor that Nabiullina wants to leave her post” continues to circulate. Nabiullina has headed the Russian Central Bank since 2013. Prior too this, she served as the nation’s Minister of Economic Development under both Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev. She is known to be one of Putin’s closest political allies.

Official sources have been cagey about the CBDC delay thus far, suggesting that “feedback from partner banks” has “indicated a need for additional technical improvements.” However, Insight Advocates wrote that the ever-changing “international situation” could be another concern, adding: “In the context of sanctions pressure and the threat of restrictions from the United States against BRICS nations, the Russian authorities could begin testing cross-border settlements in digital national currencies.” Currently, only China has the technical capability to carry out cross-border CBDC transactions, Insight Advocates wrote, and “Russia may need more time to develop these capabilities.” The post Confusion Reigns as Russia CBDC Launch Is ‘Delayed Indefinitely’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|CBDC|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-03 23:30:00

His explanation on X sheds light on the trend that has caught the interest of the cryptocurrency community, especially as memecoins gain more popularity. XRPL Memecoin and XRP Price Schwartz explained that while memecoins do not directly affect XRP’s core utility, they can influence XRP’s price because of speculation in the market. Many investors view memecoins as high-risk, high-reward opportunities, often driven by social media trends and popular influencers. This means that sudden increases in interest or trading for certain memecoins can spark more activity on the XRP Ledger, which may then influence the overall market dynamics. Schwartz also pointed out that XRP’s price matches memecoins because of market feelings and speculation. When XRPL memecoin suddenly rises, it can make traders feel they are missing out, leading investors to pay more attention to XRP. As more people trade XRP, its price can increase. However, this rise doesn’t necessarily reflect XRP’s actual value. Furthermore, the Ripple CTO mentioned that speculative trading can cause short-term price changes for XRP, but this does not show its long-term value. He also explained that if the price of XRP goes up, it can lead to a rise in the memecoin’s price. This rise in the memecoin can generate profits, even if no profits are taken from XRP. Ripple CTO on XRP’s Value In an online exchange, David Schwartz passionately defended XRP Ledger against a critic’s claim that it operates as a “zero-sum game.” Ripple’s CTO actively engaged with the critic, dispelling misconceptions and highlighting XRP’s intrinsic value and utility. He countered the criticism by explaining the fundamental operation of the XRPL, portraying it as a platform facilitating seamless XRP transfers and issued assets. The Ripple executive emphasized that users willingly pay transaction fees for the valuable service, asserting that the benefits outweighed the associated costs. Schwartz affirmed that the XRPL is not solely a tool for transferring value but a sophisticated platform supporting various financial activities. Institutional Confidence Grows With XRP Meanwhile, institutional investors are interested in XRP. Ripple’s 2024 third-quarter market report hints at rising interest and suggests that institutional adoption has risen. Notably, 21Shares, Bitwise Invest, and Canary Funds have all filed for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Grayscale Investments has launched an XRP Trust and wishes to gain the regulatory body’s approval to convert its multi-asset fund into an ETF. These moves show that investors see value in XRP as a critical tool for guaranteeing global liquidity .

Schiff’s demand follows controversial posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, which allegedly contributed to a pump and dump scheme. Schiff is calling for transparency regarding the authorship of these posts, the individuals who had prior knowledge of them, and the financial transactions linked to the incident. Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Blasts Trump Over Alleged Crypto Pump and Dump Peter Schiff has raised concerns about the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices following two posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account. Schiff claims the posts were strategically timed to manipulate the market, benefiting individuals who had advance knowledge of their release. He has called for a full congressional investigation to determine who was involved. The economist has specifically questioned the authorship of the Truth Social posts. Peter Schiff believes certain individuals may have used insider knowledge to invest in cryptos such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) before selling at inflated prices. He urged lawmakers to trace financial transactions linked to the alleged scheme. More so, the Bitcoin critic is demanding access to emails and text messages from Trump’s staff, family, and employees. He aims to investigate any coordination behind the crypto-related posts on Truth Social. Peter Schiff added, “Donald Trump, the first crypto President, just helped pull off the biggest crypto rug pull of all time. A Congressional investigation is now warranted.” Schiff Questions Insider Trading Schiff has urged authorities to examine whether individuals close to Donald Trump benefited financially from the crypto market movements. He is calling for an investigation into who purchased digital assets before the posts were made public. The Bitcoin critic wants investigators to determine how much money was invested by those with prior knowledge of the posts and the exact timing of any subsequent sales. Schiff claims that if insider trading occurred, it would constitute a major financial scandal. The Bitcoin critic said, “We also need all emails or text messages that involve any members of the President’s staff, his or their family or friends, his campaign donors, or Truth Social employees, that relate to either of the two Sunday Truth Social posts.” Bitcoin Critic Rejects Support for BTC Reserve Meanwhile, Peter Schiff recently distanced himself from previous comments that appeared to support a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He now claims that Bitcoin enthusiasts misrepresented his statements to manipulate public perception. The economist has accused Bitcoin promoters of spreading false information to inflate BTC prices. Schiff insists that his remarks were taken out of context and that he never endorsed Bitcoin as a reserve asset. He has criticized what he calls “fraudulent tactics” used by Bitcoin supporters to influence the market. Despite Peter Schiff’s allegations, the Donald Trump administration has continued to push its crypto agenda. In a recent CoinGape report, US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce confirmed the members of the newly formed Crypto Task Force, signaling a shift in regulatory approach. The 15-member team includes staff from various SEC divisions, focusing on developing clear guidelines for the crypto industry.

A powerful directive from Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has ignited the conversation around Vietnam crypto regulation . The nation’s leader has called for the urgent establishment of a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, setting a deadline for the end of this very month. This decisive move signals a potential turning point for digital assets in Vietnam, a country with a rapidly growing tech-savvy population. Why is a Crypto Legal Framework Suddenly a Priority in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s instruction underscores the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies’ influence on the global financial landscape. For Vietnam, establishing a crypto legal framework isn’t just about keeping pace with global trends; it’s about strategically positioning itself in the burgeoning digital economy. Several factors are likely driving this urgency: Preventing Illicit Activities: Without clear regulations, the cryptocurrency space can be vulnerable to money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities. A legal framework aims to mitigate these risks and protect citizens. Harnessing Innovation: Vietnam has a vibrant tech sector and a youthful, digitally engaged population. A well-defined regulatory environment can foster innovation and attract investment in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Economic Growth: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have the potential to unlock new avenues for economic growth, including fintech innovation, cross-border payments, and new business models. Investor Protection: Clear rules provide clarity and protection for individuals and businesses engaging with cryptocurrencies, fostering trust and wider cryptocurrency Vietnam adoption. What Challenges Lie Ahead in Crafting Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations? While the Prime Minister’s directive is a significant step, creating a comprehensive and effective crypto legal framework is a complex undertaking. The Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) face several hurdles: Challenge Description Defining Cryptocurrencies: Classifying cryptocurrencies – are they currencies, commodities, or securities? – is crucial for determining applicable regulations. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulations must be robust enough to mitigate risks without stifling innovation and the growth of the crypto sector. International Best Practices: Learning from and adapting regulatory approaches from other countries while tailoring them to Vietnam’s specific context is essential. Enforcement and Compliance: Establishing mechanisms for effective enforcement and ensuring compliance with the new regulations will be critical for success. Public Awareness and Education: Educating the public about cryptocurrency risks and regulations is vital for responsible adoption and preventing scams. The Role of Pham Minh Chinh in Shaping Vietnam’s Crypto Future Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh crypto initiative demonstrates a proactive approach to embracing emerging technologies. His direct involvement signals the government’s commitment to navigating the complexities of the digital asset space. This top-down approach can accelerate the regulatory process and ensure inter-agency cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). His leadership could be instrumental in shaping a regulatory environment that fosters both innovation and responsible growth within the Vietnamese crypto ecosystem. What Could Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations Look Like? Examples from Around the Globe While the specifics of Vietnam’s regulations remain to be seen, we can look at examples from other countries to get an idea of potential approaches: South Korea: Known for its comprehensive approach, South Korea regulates crypto exchanges, requires KYC/AML compliance, and taxes crypto profits. Singapore: Emphasizes a balanced approach, promoting innovation while implementing AML/CFT regulations and consumer protection measures. United States: Takes a fragmented approach with various agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN) overseeing different aspects of the crypto market. European Union: Developing MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation to create a harmonized framework across member states. Vietnam could potentially draw inspiration from these models, adopting a blend of approaches that best suits its economic and regulatory context. It is likely that the framework will address areas such as: Licensing and registration for crypto exchanges and service providers. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Taxation of cryptocurrency transactions and holdings. Consumer protection measures to safeguard investors. Regulations on stablecoins and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Adoption in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s directive is a bullish signal for crypto adoption Vietnam . A clear legal framework, while potentially introducing stricter rules, will ultimately legitimize the cryptocurrency industry and foster greater trust and participation. Here’s what you should consider: For Crypto Investors in Vietnam: Stay informed about the upcoming regulations. Compliance will be key, so be prepared for potential KYC requirements and tax implications. For Crypto Businesses: Vietnam is becoming an increasingly attractive market. A clear regulatory framework will provide the certainty needed to invest and expand operations in the country. For the Vietnamese Government: A well-designed regulatory framework can position Vietnam as a regional leader in fintech innovation and attract foreign investment. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Vietnam’s Digital Economy Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh’s urgent call for a crypto legal framework marks a pivotal moment for Vietnam’s engagement with the digital asset revolution. While the specifics are yet to unfold, this decisive action signals a proactive and forward-thinking approach. By embracing regulation, Vietnam is not just catching up with global trends but actively shaping its future in the digital economy. The coming month will be crucial in defining the contours of this framework and its long-term impact on Vietnam’s crypto landscape. This bold move has the potential to unlock significant opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and greater financial inclusion in Vietnam, making it a nation to watch in the global crypto space.

41122507,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136357,1741046383,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Power Shift: Trump Aides Join Paradigm’s Policy Council to Revolutionize Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-aides-paradigm-crypto-policy/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, Paradigm, a leading crypto investment firm, has announced the addition of six new members to its Policy Council. What’s truly grabbing headlines is the inclusion of former Trump administration officials, signaling a potential shift in the landscape of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. Are we witnessing a new era of collaboration between traditional political heavyweights and the rapidly evolving digital asset space? Let’s dive into the details. Why is the Paradigm Policy Council attracting such attention? Paradigm is not just any investment firm; it’s a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, known for backing some of the most innovative projects in the space. Their Policy Council is designed to navigate the complex and often murky waters of crypto regulation . By bringing together individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise, Paradigm aims to proactively engage with policymakers and shape the future of digital asset legislation. The recent appointments highlight the growing importance of strategic policy engagement in the crypto industry. The newly inducted members include: Robert O’Brien : Former National Security Advisor during the Trump administration. O’Brien’s experience in national security and international policy brings a significant weight to the council, particularly in discussions around the national security implications of cryptocurrency and its regulation. Van Jones : A well-known CNN host and political commentator. Jones adds a unique perspective, bridging the gap between mainstream media and the crypto world. His understanding of public opinion and communication will be invaluable in shaping the narrative around digital assets. Jen Brown : A Democratic advisor. Brown’s inclusion ensures bipartisan representation and a balanced approach to policy discussions, crucial for navigating the politically charged environment surrounding crypto. And three other unnamed individuals, as reported by The Block. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation? The involvement of former Trump aides , particularly Robert O’Brien, in Paradigm’s Policy Council is noteworthy for several reasons: Legitimacy and Mainstreaming : Having figures from previous administrations on board lends a degree of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency industry. It signals that crypto is no longer a fringe technology but a serious sector engaging with established political players. Policy Influence : These individuals possess deep networks and understanding of Washington D.C.’s policy-making processes. Their involvement could translate to more informed and potentially favorable regulations for the crypto industry. Bipartisan Approach : The inclusion of both Republican and Democratic figures suggests an attempt to build bipartisan consensus around cryptocurrency policy . This is crucial for long-term regulatory stability and industry growth. However, challenges and questions remain: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty Despite these appointments, the overall regulatory landscape for crypto remains unclear in many jurisdictions. The Policy Council will need to navigate diverse and sometimes conflicting regulatory approaches globally. Public Perception Cryptocurrency still faces skepticism from some segments of the public and policymakers. Overcoming negative perceptions and educating stakeholders will be a key task. Balancing Innovation and Regulation The council must strike a delicate balance between advocating for regulations that protect consumers and prevent illicit activities, while also fostering innovation and growth within the crypto space. Robert O’Brien and the Paradigm Vision: A New Direction for Crypto? Robert O’Brien’s background in national security adds a fascinating dimension to the Paradigm Policy Council. His expertise could be particularly valuable in addressing concerns related to: National Security Implications of Crypto : Examining how cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit activities and developing strategies to mitigate these risks while preserving the benefits of the technology. International Crypto Policy Coordination : Navigating the complexities of global crypto regulation and fostering international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. Cybersecurity and Digital Asset Protection : Drawing on his national security experience to enhance cybersecurity measures within the crypto industry and protect digital assets from theft and fraud. The addition of these high-profile individuals to the Paradigm Policy Council underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a clear signal that crypto is moving beyond its early, Wild West days and actively seeking to engage with the established political and regulatory frameworks. This move could pave the way for more constructive dialogue between the crypto industry and policymakers, potentially leading to clearer and more supportive regulations in the future. Actionable Insights: What can we expect next? Here are some actionable insights and things to watch out for: Increased Policy Advocacy : Expect Paradigm and its Policy Council to become more vocal in policy debates and regulatory discussions. Their influence in shaping crypto legislation is likely to grow. Focus on Clear Regulations : The council will likely advocate for clear, consistent, and innovation-friendly regulations that provide businesses with the certainty they need to operate and grow. Bipartisan Engagement : Keep an eye on how effectively the council leverages its bipartisan composition to build consensus and bridge political divides on crypto policy. Global Regulatory Influence : Paradigm’s initiatives could have implications beyond the US, potentially influencing global discussions on crypto regulation . Conclusion: A Powerful Alliance for Crypto’s Future? The formation of a robust Policy Council at Paradigm, bolstered by figures like former Trump aides and prominent political voices, is a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a powerful alliance aimed at shaping the future of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. While challenges undoubtedly remain, this move signals a determined effort to bridge the gap between the crypto world and traditional power structures. The coming months and years will reveal the extent of their impact, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto regulation is becoming more sophisticated and influential, promising a potentially transformative period for the digital asset landscape.

As speculation mounts over its potential to reach $500, investors are tuning in for Litecoin’s next act. Yet, despite being a well-established cryptocurrency, Litecoin’s explosive growth potential is clouded by intense market competition. Conversely, Web3Bay (3BAY) is turning heads for a different reason. This budding decentralized e-commerce platform, still in its presale phase, has not only raised over $1.5 million but also tantalizes with projections of gains surpassing 3,633%. Is Litecoin’s journey to $500 feasible, or does Web3Bay present a more astute investment avenue? Let’s dissect both opportunities to unearth which harbors the greatest growth potential for 2025. Is Litecoin on the Verge of a $500 Breakthrough? The resurgence in Litecoin’s market activity has reignited investor enthusiasm. Recently surging past the critical $100 barrier, LTC’s current trading price of $128 reflects a robust 30% growth in the past fortnight. Technical analysis suggests that breaking the $135 resistance could propel LTC towards ambitious targets of $175 and $240, aligned with key Fibonacci levels, indicating potential for further ascents. Another pivotal development boosting Litecoin’s prospects is the potential U.S. approval of a Litecoin ETF. The SEC’s nod to a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing, coupled with NASDAQ’s proposal to trade ETF shares, could significantly draw institutional investors, potentially catalyzing Litecoin’s value. However, achieving a $500 valuation implies a formidable 290% increase from its present stance—a feat Litecoin has not accomplished in a single cycle since 2017. With the rise of agile and cost-effective blockchains like Solana and Avalanche, sustaining momentum could prove challenging for Litecoin despite a promising setup. Web3Bay’s 3,633% ROI Prospect—Capturing Investor Focus While Litecoin offers modest growth potential, Web3Bay is shaping up as a powerhouse investment with far greater return possibilities. Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce by crafting a decentralized marketplace that omits intermediaries, slashes fees, and grants transactional control to users. This platform stands apart from centralized giants by employing blockchain to foster a transparent, efficient, and community-led shopping environment. With the presale already amassing over $1.5 million, demonstrating robust investor trust, the current presale price of 3BAY at $0.005247 points to an explosive 3,633% ROI, should it hit its projected launch price of $0.1959. What Sets Web3Bay Apart? Real-World Utility: Web3Bay addresses tangible e-commerce pain points, positioning it for sustained adoption and growth. Early Investor Benefits: The ongoing presale offers a prime opportunity to acquire 3BAY at its inception price, ahead of major exchange listings. Vast Market Reach: With the e-commerce market valued at over $6 trillion, Web3Bay’s innovative model stands to capture significant market share by eliminating traditional barriers and costs. Unmatched Growth Potential: Unlike Litecoin’s gradual appreciation path, Web3Bay’s presale stage presents a remarkable opportunity for rapid value increase. Key Insights While Litecoin’s potential climb to $500 is not out of reach, it is fraught with challenges from competitive pressures and the need for sustained, large-scale institutional investment. In contrast, Web3Bay is at a nascent stage where the scope for exponential gains is remarkably higher. As it pioneers a decentralized model in e-commerce and captivates substantial early-stage funding, Web3Bay represents an irresistible prospect. For investors who missed early opportunities in trailblazers like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable foundational investment chance—one that could yield transformative returns for early participants.

SHIB’s Price Prediction Shows Optimism & LTC Could Fall,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-hits-200m-next-target-600m-with-10-upcoming-listings-shibs-price-prediction-shows-optimism-ltc-could-fall/,"Market watchers are keenly observing trends across key cryptocurrencies. The Shiba Inu price prediction is drawing attention after a spike in large-scale purchases suggests a possible price surge. The focus remains on whether these buys will drive substantial price movements or if SHIB will stabilize within its current range. Conversely, the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is causing worry, with forecasts pointing to a potential 25% decline. Reduced trading activity and growing short positions might hinder LTC’s recovery anytime soon. On another note, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making significant strides as it prepares to debut on 10 leading centralized exchanges. With $200 million already raised in its presale and providing a stunning 2,380% ROI to initial supporters, BDAG is positioned as a top crypto to follow as it approaches a whopping $600 million presale target. SHIB Price Prediction: Whale Activity Sparks Hope The Shiba Inu price prediction is once again a hot topic due to an impressive 90% increase in transactions from major holders. This uptick suggests a positive shift, with SHIB’s price prediction potentially turning bullish as large-scale holders continue to buy in. Currently priced near $0.00001424, SHIB faces crucial resistance at $0.00001660. Discussions around the Shiba Inu price prediction suggest breaking this barrier could push prices to $0.00001700 or more, while failure to maintain $0.00001500 could drop SHIB below $0.00001400. The growing whale activity remains a key influence in this Shiba Inu price prediction, with further gains possible if this trend persists. Litecoin (LTC) Bearish Outlook: Is a 25% Drop Looming? The Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is strengthening with evidence pointing to a possible 25% reduction from its current $117 value. Analysts see $141 as a significant hurdle, enhancing discussions that Litecoin’s (LTC) bearish outlook might solidify if LTC cannot surpass this obstacle. A 23% fall in trade volume contributes to the concerns among those betting short-term. While the 200 EMA indicates some resilience, the overall mood remains pessimistic, reinforcing the LTC’s (LTC) bearish outlook. A jump in short bets now surpassing $67 million this week shows an increasing trend of market players anticipating further losses. Nevertheless, some long-term stakeholders continue to amass, showing not all are swayed by the prevailing negative outlook. BlockDAG Sets Sights on 10 Major CEX Listings BlockDAG is preparing for a significant move with upcoming launches on 10 renowned centralized exchanges. Listings on these platforms not only enhance credibility but also significantly boost trading volume. With these exchanges on board, anticipation is building that their users will soon join the presale frenzy. Currently priced at $0.0248, the coin’s value is soaring thanks to a presale that has already gathered over $200 million. To date, 18.6 billion coins have been claimed, and with the 27th batch now available, early participants are enjoying a remarkable 2,380% ROI. Industry experts have dubbed BDAG a top crypto to buy, eyeing a colossal $600 million funding goal. These listings are anticipated to drive wider adoption, setting the stage for more liquidity and robust trading activity. With plans for a mainnet launch in 2025, the future looks promising for significant value appreciation. Expectations of reaching $20 by 2027 are keeping the community engaged, bolstered by BDAG’s growing network of partnerships and a vibrant supporter base. With the momentum from the presale, anticipated exchange listings, and ambitious price targets, BDAG is on a fast track to gaining broad recognition among both new and experienced crypto traders seeking the next lucrative venture. Market Trends: Optimism & Caution in Crypto Trading The cryptocurrency domain is currently a mix of excitement and caution, with the Shiba Inu price prediction indicating a potential surge thanks to increased interest from major buyers, while the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook signals a possible downturn unless it overcomes specific resistance hurdles. In the meantime, BlockDAG is making strides toward becoming a mainstream fixture with 10 significant CEX listings in the pipeline. The crypto presale has been a massive success, securing $200 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. As BDAG moves toward the $600 million mark, its escalating presence in the market positions it as a top crypto to buy, with upcoming listings poised to broaden its trading scope.

California is stepping up its game. Just when you thought the AI safety debate couldn’t get any hotter, the Golden State is back in the ring with a brand-new legislative punch. Senator Scott Wiener, the very lawmaker behind last year’s controversial SB 1047, has just dropped SB 53 – a bill that’s already sending ripples through Silicon Valley and beyond. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals closely watching the intersection of digital innovation and regulation, this is a development you can’t afford to ignore. Let’s dive into what this new California AI Bill means for the future of artificial intelligence and tech innovation. What’s New in California’s AI Regulation Landscape? After the intense discussions surrounding SB 1047, which aimed to put guardrails on potentially dangerous AI systems, Senator Wiener is back with SB 53. This new bill appears to take a more nuanced approach, focusing on two key areas: Tech Whistleblower Protection: Empowering employees at leading AI labs to speak out about potential risks without fear of retaliation. CalCompute Cloud Initiative: Creating a public cloud computing resource to democratize AI development and boost public-interest research. Think of it as a strategic pivot. Instead of directly tackling the ‘existential risk’ aspects that made SB 1047 so contentious, SB 53 carves out specific, arguably less controversial, components. But don’t be fooled – this bill is still packing a punch when it comes to shaping the future of AI regulation in California and potentially setting a precedent for the rest of the nation. Why Whistleblower Protection is a Game-Changer for AI Safety One of the most significant aspects of the California AI Bill , SB 53, is its focus on Tech Whistleblower Protection . Imagine being an engineer at a cutting-edge AI lab and noticing something deeply concerning – a potential flaw that could lead to serious societal harm. Historically, speaking out could mean risking your job and career. SB 53 aims to change that. Key highlights of the whistleblower protection aspect: Protection from Retaliation: AI developers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who report concerns about ‘critical risks’. Clear Definition of ‘Critical Risk’: The bill defines this as a risk of death or serious injury to over 100 people, or damages exceeding $1 billion. Reporting Channels: Whistleblowers can disclose information to the California Attorney General, federal authorities, or even internal colleagues. Follow-up Requirements: Companies must report back to whistleblowers on internal processes related to their concerns. This is a powerful move towards enhancing AI safety . By empowering insiders, SB 53 seeks to create a crucial check-and-balance system within the rapidly evolving AI industry. It acknowledges that those closest to the technology are often best positioned to identify potential dangers. CalCompute Cloud: Democratizing AI Development? Beyond whistleblower protection, SB 53 introduces another intriguing element: the CalCompute Cloud . This initiative proposes creating a public cloud computing cluster to level the playing field in AI development. But what exactly is CalCompute, and why does it matter? Understanding CalCompute Cloud: Public Resource: CalCompute would be a publicly funded cloud computing cluster accessible to researchers and startups. Collaboration Focus: A group consisting of University of California representatives and other experts would guide its development. Boosting Public Interest AI: The goal is to provide resources for developing AI that benefits the public, not just large corporations. Addressing Compute Inequality: It aims to tackle the issue where only a few tech giants have access to massive computing power needed for advanced AI. For startups and researchers, especially those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space exploring AI applications, CalCompute Cloud could be a game-changer. It could lower the barrier to entry, fostering innovation and potentially leading to more diverse and publicly beneficial AI applications. Imagine the possibilities for decentralized AI projects with access to state-of-the-art computing resources! Will SB 53 Face the Same Pushback as SB 1047? Senator Wiener’s previous AI Safety Bill , SB 1047, faced intense opposition, particularly from Silicon Valley. Critics argued it would stifle innovation and put California at a disadvantage in the global AI race. Governor Newsom ultimately vetoed it, citing concerns about its approach. Key Differences and Potential Challenges for SB 53: Feature SB 1047 (Controversial) SB 53 (New Approach) Focus Preventing catastrophic AI risks (existential risk) Whistleblower protection & public computing resources Controversy Level High – sparked accusations of fear-mongering and hindering innovation Potentially lower – focuses on arguably less contentious areas Silicon Valley Reaction (SB 1047) Strong opposition, labeled as harmful to competitiveness TBD – likely to be more receptive to whistleblower protection and CalCompute, but scrutiny expected Political Climate 2024 – heightened AI safety concerns 2025 – potential shift towards prioritizing AI innovation over safety While SB 53 may be seen as less radical than SB 1047, it’s still likely to face scrutiny. The political landscape may also be shifting, with some voices, like Vice President J.D. Vance, suggesting a greater emphasis on AI innovation over stringent AI regulation . The coming months will be crucial in determining SB 53’s fate in the California legislature. The Future of AI Regulation: What to Watch For California’s efforts to shape AI regulation are being closely watched globally. SB 53, regardless of its outcome, will contribute to the ongoing conversation about how to govern this transformative technology. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding these regulatory trends is vital as AI increasingly intersects with decentralized technologies. Key takeaways and what to watch: Silicon Valley’s Response: How will tech giants and startups react to SB 53? Will they see whistleblower protection and CalCompute as constructive or burdensome? Legislative Process: SB 53 still needs to navigate the California legislature. Amendments, debates, and eventual votes will shape its final form. National Impact: California’s actions often influence other states and even federal policy. SB 53 could set a precedent for Tech Whistleblower Protection and public AI infrastructure. Global Dialogue: The debate around AI safety and AI regulation is global. California’s experience will inform international discussions and policy development. In conclusion, SB 53 represents a significant step in California’s ongoing journey to grapple with the complexities of artificial intelligence. By focusing on whistleblower protection and democratizing access to computing resources, it offers a potentially more palatable approach to AI safety than its predecessor, SB 1047. Whether it will successfully navigate the legislative process and ultimately shape the future of AI remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the debate around AI regulation is far from over, and California is determined to remain at the forefront.

41122642,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136399,1741046603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking AI Impact at MWC: Two Visions Divide Tech’s Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-impact-mwc-tech-future/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to be a dominating force in the tech world, sparking both excitement and apprehension. At the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC), this dichotomy was on full display, with two prominent voices presenting radically different perspectives on the AI impact on our lives and society. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-forward individuals, understanding these diverging viewpoints is crucial as AI increasingly intersects with blockchain and the digital economy. Let’s delve into the starkly contrasting visions that emerged from MWC. The Optimistic Vision: AI as Humanity’s Supercharger Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and Google researcher, presented a compelling case for AI’s transformative potential. Speaking virtually, Kurzweil painted a picture of an AI future brimming with unprecedented advancements and benefits for humanity. His core arguments revolved around: Enhanced Longevity and Healthcare: Kurzweil believes AI will revolutionize healthcare, leading to significant extensions in human lifespan. AI-driven diagnostics, personalized medicine, and drug discovery are poised to tackle diseases and improve overall health dramatically. Renewable Energy Revolution: He highlighted AI’s role in optimizing renewable energy technologies. According to Kurzweil, “AI-optimized designs” are making solar and other renewable energy sources increasingly efficient and cost-effective, paving the way for a sustainable energy future. He boldly predicted that renewable energy will “dominate within a decade,” thanks to AI. Ubiquitous Benefits: Kurzweil envisions AI transforming “everything all at once,” showering humanity with benefits across countless domains. From smarter cities to personalized education, he sees AI as a catalyst for progress in virtually every aspect of life. Kurzweil’s presentation was a classic example of technological optimism, emphasizing the immense potential of AI to solve global challenges and elevate the human experience. He urged attendees to pay attention to the “huge gains” already being powered by AI, suggesting we are on the cusp of a technological golden age. The Pessimistic Counterpoint: AI and the Rage Machine In stark contrast to Kurzweil’s utopian vision, Scott Galloway, a tech investor and academic, offered a much more sobering perspective. Galloway’s fireside chat delivered a powerful warning about the darker side of AI, particularly its role in fueling societal division and negativity. His key concerns included: Rage-Fueled Algorithms: Galloway argued that algorithms, particularly those powering social media platforms, have discovered that “rage” is the ultimate engagement driver. These technology platforms, driven by ad revenue, prioritize sensational and divisive content, leading to increased polarization and societal fragmentation. Erosion of Social Cohesion: He painted a grim picture of a nation where AI-driven information sorting amplifies isolation and anti-social attitudes. Galloway pointed to the increasing loneliness and division in the U.S., where neighbors are losing the ability to communicate civilly, attributing this partly to AI’s influence on information consumption. Tech CEO Cowardice and Societal Impact: Galloway went further, criticizing tech billionaires for their silence in the face of democratic backsliding and social issues. He accused them of prioritizing personal gain over speaking out against policies that exacerbate inequality and undermine democratic institutions. He specifically called out CEOs like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook for not challenging what he sees as abuses of power, expressing disappointment at their perceived “cowardice.” Galloway’s message was a stark warning about the unintended consequences of unchecked technological advancement. He argued that while we are stronger technologically than ever, societal bonds are weakening, and AI is playing a significant role in this negative trend. His presentation served as a potent counterpoint to the unbridled optimism surrounding AI, urging for a more critical and responsible approach to its development and deployment. Navigating the AI Divide: Optimism vs. Realism The contrasting viewpoints presented at MWC highlight a crucial debate surrounding AI: Is it a force for unparalleled progress, or does it harbor significant risks that could undermine society? The reality, as with most complex issues, likely lies somewhere in between. Here’s a table summarizing the key differences: Perspective Key Proponent Core Argument Focus Tone Technological Optimism Ray Kurzweil AI will solve major problems, enhance human life, and drive unprecedented progress. Benefits, potential, future possibilities Utopian, enthusiastic, future-oriented Technological Realism/Criticism Scott Galloway AI algorithms can exacerbate societal problems, fuel division, and require careful management. Risks, challenges, current societal impact Sobering, critical, present-focused Actionable Insights and the Path Forward So, what are the key takeaways from these divided views on AI impact , especially for those in the cryptocurrency and tech space? Embrace Innovation with Caution: While the potential of AI and related innovation is undeniable, it’s crucial to approach its development and implementation with a critical eye. We must be mindful of potential downsides and unintended consequences. Ethical Considerations are Paramount: As AI becomes more pervasive, ethical frameworks and responsible AI development practices are essential. This includes addressing algorithmic bias, ensuring data privacy, and mitigating the potential for misuse. Foster Dialogue and Collaboration: Open and honest conversations about the societal implications of AI are crucial. Bringing together diverse perspectives – from technologists to ethicists to social scientists – is vital for navigating the complex challenges and opportunities that AI presents. Demand Accountability from Tech Leaders: Galloway’s critique of tech CEOs raises important questions about responsibility and leadership. As AI’s influence grows, it’s essential to hold tech leaders accountable for the societal impact of their technologies and platforms. Conclusion: A Nuanced Perspective on the AI Future The MWC presentations by Kurzweil and Galloway offer valuable, albeit contrasting, lenses through which to view the AI future . While Kurzweil’s optimism inspires us to imagine the transformative possibilities of AI, Galloway’s realism compels us to confront the potential pitfalls. Ultimately, a balanced and nuanced approach is necessary. We must strive to harness the immense power of AI for good while proactively addressing its risks and ensuring that its development benefits all of humanity, not just a select few. The conversation at MWC underscores that the journey into an AI-driven world requires both visionary enthusiasm and critical foresight.

41122773,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136411,1741046849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Bitwise Files for Spot Dogecoin ETF – A New Era for DOGE?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-files-spot-dogecoin-etf/,"Hold onto your digital wallets, Dogecoin enthusiasts! The crypto world is buzzing with exciting news that could potentially reshape the landscape for everyone’s favorite meme-inspired cryptocurrency. If you’ve been eagerly waiting for more accessible ways to invest in DOGE, you might just be in luck. Let’s dive into the details of this potentially groundbreaking development. What’s the Buzz About a Spot Dogecoin ETF? As reported by Watcher Guru on X, crypto asset manager Bitwise has officially thrown its hat into the ring, filing an application with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch a spot Dogecoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This is a significant step because a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Dogecoin – offering investors exposure to DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. But what does this mean for you, the average crypto enthusiast, and the future of Dogecoin? Why is a Spot Crypto ETF a Big Deal? To understand the excitement, let’s break down why a spot crypto ETF, especially a Spot Dogecoin ETF , is such a noteworthy event: Accessibility for Mainstream Investors: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a vast pool of investors who may be hesitant or unfamiliar with navigating cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. This could open Dogecoin to a significantly larger investment audience. Regulation and Security: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some may find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto space. Investing through a regulated Bitwise ETF could ease concerns about security and compliance. Simplified Investment Process: Buying and selling ETF shares is straightforward, similar to trading stocks. This simplicity removes the technical hurdles associated with buying, storing, and managing Dogecoin directly, making it more appealing to a broader range of investors. Potential for Increased Liquidity: An ETF can boost liquidity for Dogecoin as it creates another avenue for trading and investment, potentially leading to more robust and stable market conditions. Spot vs. Futures: Understanding the Difference in Crypto ETFs You might be wondering, aren’t there already crypto ETFs? Yes, there are, but the key difference lies in the term “spot.” Many existing crypto ETFs are based on futures contracts, not the actual underlying cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot ETF Futures ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds the cryptocurrency (Dogecoin in this case) Holds futures contracts that predict the future price of the cryptocurrency Price Tracking More closely tracks the actual spot price of the cryptocurrency Price can deviate from the spot price due to futures market dynamics Investor Exposure Direct exposure to the price movements of the cryptocurrency Indirect exposure through futures contracts, potentially leading to tracking errors and roll costs A Spot Dogecoin ETF , like the one Bitwise is proposing, is generally considered more desirable by many investors as it offers more direct and transparent exposure to the price of Dogecoin. Why Bitwise for a Dogecoin ETF? Bitwise is a well-known and respected name in the crypto asset management space. They have a track record of launching innovative crypto investment products. Their decision to file for a DOGE ETF signals a growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the broader meme coin sector. Bitwise’s expertise and reputation could lend credibility and attract investors to this new ETF offering. Challenges and Roadblocks for a Spot DOGE ETF While the filing is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the path to launching a Spot Dogecoin ETF isn’t guaranteed to be smooth. There are potential hurdles: Regulatory Approval: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in the United States has been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs. Getting the green light from regulators is the biggest hurdle. The SEC needs to be convinced about market surveillance, investor protection, and the maturity of the Dogecoin market. Market Volatility: Dogecoin, like many cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. Regulators may have concerns about the risks associated with a highly volatile asset within an ETF structure. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC is also concerned about potential market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space. Bitwise will need to demonstrate robust measures to prevent manipulation and ensure fair trading of the ETF. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin’s Price and Future? The potential launch of a Spot Dogecoin ETF could have several implications for Dogecoin: Increased Demand: If the ETF is approved and gains traction, it could create significant new demand for Dogecoin as ETF providers need to acquire DOGE to back the ETF shares. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand could potentially drive up the price of Dogecoin. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and price movements are influenced by many factors. Mainstream Adoption: A successful Crypto ETF for Dogecoin could further legitimize Dogecoin as an asset class and contribute to its broader mainstream adoption. Evolution of Meme Coins: The success of a Dogecoin ETF could pave the way for ETFs based on other meme coins, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the meme-driven crypto world. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? While we wait for updates on Bitwise’s Bitwise ETF application, here are some actionable steps you can consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on cryptocurrency news and regulatory developments. Follow reputable sources like Watcher Guru and Bitwise’s official announcements for updates on the ETF application. Do Your Research: Understand the risks and potential rewards associated with Dogecoin and crypto ETFs before making any investment decisions. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Your Investment Strategy: Think about how a Spot Dogecoin ETF might fit into your overall investment portfolio, if at all. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Engage in the Community: Join discussions and communities around Dogecoin and crypto ETFs to learn from others and stay updated on the latest developments. Conclusion: A Promising Development for Dogecoin? Bitwise filing for a Spot Dogecoin ETF is undoubtedly a significant and exciting development for the Dogecoin community and the broader crypto market. It represents a potential step towards mainstream adoption and greater accessibility for DOGE. While regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain factors to consider, this move signals growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Keep watching this space – the journey of the Spot Dogecoin ETF is just beginning, and it promises to be an interesting one!

NFTs are not securities.” SEC ends Yuga Labs probe into BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin after two years In October 2022, the SEC opened a probe into Yuga Labs to examine its NFT offerings and the distribution of ApeCoin. The SEC aimed to determine whether these digital assets qualified as securities under U.S. law, applying the Howey Test—a legal standard established by a 1946 Supreme Court case. The watchdog’s probe began under former Chair Gary Gensler. It was part of a wider investigation into NFTs, including probes into NFT creators and marketplaces, to determine whether some, such as fractional NFTs, were securities. Founded in 2021, Yuga Labs created some of the most sought-after and expensive NFT collections during the market’s peak, including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club. It also bought the rights to CryptoPunks, an early NFT collection that had historically fetched huge sums. The NFT conglomerate achieved a $4 billion valuation after securing $450 million in funding by 2022. The firm’s BAYC collection has generated billions in trading volume, making it a prominent player in the NFT space. SEC softens crypto stance, drops multiple investigations The SEC’s reported decision to abandon its investigation into Yuga Labs aligns with the regulator’s increasingly lenient stance toward the crypto industry under the Trump administration. Most recently, the regulator has dropped its investigation of several major crypto companies, including Robinhood, Gemini, UniSwap Labs, Consensys-owned MetaMask, and OpenSea. The SEC has also reached settlements with Coinbase and is reportedly on track to settle its case against TRON’s Justin Sun. In its announcement that it is dropping its case against Coinbase, the SEC said its Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit will weed out those that are looking to exploit innovation to harm investors, including through fraud related to blockchain technology and crypto assets. The SEC has been reversing multiple crypto-related enforcement actions taken under former Chair Gensler, such as dropping a years-old lawsuit against Kraken on March 3. However, the SEC’s long-standing lawsuit against Ripple remains in active litigation. President Donald Trump recently named XRP one of the coins included in his proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve, alongside Cardano, Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price of ApeCoin , a token linked to the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, has fallen 16% in the past 24 hours amid a broader market pullback. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Following an initial decline in recent days, BTC surged above $94,000 on Sunday. This increase was fueled by reports of an upcoming US strategic crypto reserve that includes BTC and other major digital assets. However, as of today, BTC is trading just below $93,000, signaling an unstable upward momentum in the crypto market. Amid this price movement, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst KriptoBaykusV2 highlights an evolving pattern in Bitcoin’s net exchange flow, offering insight into investor sentiment. This data suggests that exchange inflows and outflows may play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s short-term price direction. Related Reading: Top Bitcoin Inflows Hit Year-High on Binance – Should You Be Concerned? Bitcoin Exchange Flows and Investor Sentiment According to KriptoBaykusV2, on February 25, Bitcoin saw a significant inflow to exchanges, with approximately 8,400 BTC being deposited. Historically, large inflows suggest increased selling pressure, as traders move assets to exchanges in preparation for liquidation. This was followed by a decline in Bitcoin’s price, aligning with previous market trends where increased supply on exchanges often leads to downward price movements. The following day, February 26, Bitcoin experienced a shift, with a substantial amount of BTC being withdrawn from exchanges. Large-scale outflows typically indicate a preference for holding, reducing the available supply on exchanges and potentially supporting price stability. This shift coincided with Bitcoin’s price finding support and beginning to recover, reflecting investor confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. The analyst noted: In summary, those closely monitoring Bitcoin’s exchange movements should take note: Large inflows into exchanges may indicate heightened selling pressure, requiring caution. On the other hand, significant outflows suggest that investors are opting to hold, which could lead to price appreciation. We will see in the coming days how these trends continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Enough—Coinbase CEO Rejects Altcoins For US Reserves Short-Term Selling and Market Trends Meanwhile, a separate analysis by another CryptoQuant analyst, abramchart, suggests that Bitcoin holders have started selling at a loss. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) index, which measures the profitability of short-term investors, according to the analyst recently recorded a value of 0.95. This level, the lowest since August 2024, suggests that more traders are selling BTC at a loss, an indication of capitulation. Historically, such periods have been followed by market recoveries as selling pressure eases and accumulation phases begin. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: The SOPR measures the proportion of Bitcoin wallets that have held Bitcoin for more than 1 hour and less than 155 days. Values over ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a profit. Values below ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a loss., which is a sign of capitulation and a return to an upward trend.

He tells his 243,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking to see KAITO rally above the $2.50 level, about 20% higher than current prices. “KAITO just longed around this area, targeting $2.50 and higher. will take profits along the way, hope BTC is stable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, KAITO is worth $2.09. Also in the AI sector, Altcoin Sherpa says AI Rig Complex ( ARC ), a Rust-based AI agent framework, is likely sitting at a local bottom and is ready to head higher. “I still have a bag of this and still feel pretty decent about it. It’s shown a lot of strength relative to other AI coins and, although the volatility is high on it, I still think this is the relative bottom. 200 exponential moving average on the four-hour acting as a stopping point and $0.19 still seems like a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, ARC is trading for $0.22. Looking at the mid-term time frame, the trader names three of his top altcoin picks. His watchlist includes the layer-one blockchain Sonic ( S ), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Maker ( MKR ), and a toss-up of intellectual property-focused project Story ( IP ), Ethereum ( ETH ) virtual machine (EVM) chain Berachain ( BERA ) and KAITO. “If I were to choose three coins to hold for the mid-term, they’d probably be: S: good defi activity, strong rebrand, lots of $$ going on there + Andre MKR: insane chart, continually grinding higher, strong og defi prob one of BERA/KAITO/IP, all these new coins are strong.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s the Crypto Promising a 3,633% Surge.",https://thecoinrise.com/will-shiba-inu-and-cardano-reach-new-peaks-in-2025-heres-the-crypto-promising-a-3633-surge/,"Shiba Inu and Cardano have been pivotal players in the cryptocurrency scene, drawing significant attention and fostering robust communities. Both have weathered varied market cycles, yet the possibility of them surpassing their historical peaks remains a topic of hot debate. Amidst this, Shiba Inu capitalizes on its vibrant community and viral appeal, whereas Cardano continues to push the boundaries with its technological enhancements. However, a new challenger, Web3Bay , is starting to eclipse these familiar faces with its groundbreaking potential and enticing promise of a 3,633% return on investment for early investors, having already accrued over $1.6 million in its presale. Analyzing Shiba Inu’s Market Dynamics Shiba Inu, a frontrunner among meme coins, faces a challenging path to reclaim its peak price levels. Despite achieving impressive highs during the 2021 bull market, it now trades at a significantly lower level, with recent months showing a notable decline. This downturn has sparked concerns among investors about its capability to breach and sustain beyond its previous highs. While there is speculative optimism about its future performance, real traction will likely depend on substantial developments within its ecosystem, such as the successful rollout of Shibarium and other strategic enhancements. Cardano’s Prospects for Setting New Records Cardano stands as a beacon of innovation within the smart contract arena but hasn’t been immune to the market’s downturns. Despite the recent advancements and increasing trading volumes, its price has struggled to keep pace. Yet, with developments like the Chang Hard Fork, Cardano is enhancing its network’s decentralization and functionality, potentially setting the stage for increased adoption across DeFi and enterprise solutions. However, the intense competition from other blockchain networks poses significant hurdles, requiring Cardano to not only innovate but also capture substantial market traction to achieve new price records. Web3Bay: A New Frontier for Crypto Returns While Shiba Inu and Cardano work to recapture their former highs, Web3Bay is making a powerful entrance with its innovative and disruptive approach to e-commerce. This decentralized platform is set to transform the online shopping experience by eliminating middlemen, slashing transaction fees, and bolstering security—all through its trustless, peer-to-peer marketplace. By diving into a trillion-dollar industry, Web3Bay is perfectly positioned to leverage blockchain technology for a monumental shift in how digital commerce operates. Already, Web3Bay’s presale has amassed over $1.6 million, signaling strong investor trust and optimism. Priced attractively at just $0.005247 during its presale, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay offers early investors the chance for a staggering 3,633% return on investment. Such a significant growth opportunity is uncommon among more established cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Cardano, positioning Web3Bay as one of the standout investment opportunities for 2025. The true allure of Web3Bay extends beyond just its financial prospects. Unlike many cryptocurrency ventures that are propelled by mere market excitement, Web3Bay serves a tangible, utilitarian purpose that could fundamentally alter the e-commerce landscape. As conventional online marketplaces grapple with issues like excessive fees, concerns over data privacy, and the pitfalls of centralized governance, Web3Bay’s blockchain solution stands out as a superior alternative that delivers real benefits to both merchants and consumers. This not only enhances its appeal as an investment but also underscores its potential to set a new standard in the e-commerce sector. Choosing the Crypto with the Most Upside for 2025 As investors navigate the choices between Shiba Inu, Cardano, and Web3Bay, the latter presents a compelling case with both immediate and long-term benefits. While Shiba Inu and Cardano require broader market rallies and significant ecosystem developments to reach new highs, Web3Bay offers a clear path to substantial returns based on tangible advancements and market penetration. For those looking to maximize their investment impact in 2025, Web3Bay provides an intriguing alternative, promising not only robust returns but also a revolutionary change in how e-commerce operates. As the crypto landscape evolves, aligning with innovative projects like Web3Bay could prove to be a wise strategy for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, aiming to capture significant gains in the rapidly expanding digital economy.

Turbo (TURBO) is a prime example—launched as an experimental meme coin, it shocked everyone by skyrocketing to a market cap that made early buyers filthy rich. If you missed that wave, here’s your redemption shot with the top new meme coin for significant returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is storming through its presale, offering a 3650% ROI potential, and those who recognize this golden window will be sitting on serious wealth. Right now, BTFD Coin is at $0.00016, but it won’t stay this cheap for long. With over $6.25 million raised, 71 billion coins sold, and 11,200+ holders, the 14th presale stage is near its end. Analysts predict a moonshot to $0.006 after launch, and if you invest now, you could see your portfolio multiply 36.5 times. While others sleep on this gem, smart investors are stacking their bags with the top new meme coin for significant returns before it’s too late. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That Could Mint New Millionaires Every once in a while, a presale emerges that screams opportunity. Right now, that’s BTFD Coin (BTFD). Unlike the wild volatility of post-launch meme coins, presales offer investors a chance to secure assets at rock-bottom prices before the pump. With BTFD’s presale currently at $0.00016, those who get in now are locking in a 275% ROI before it even hits exchanges, and that’s just the beginning. Let’s put it into perspective. A $1,500 investment today at $0.00016 secures you 9.375 million BTFD coins . When the presale wraps up at $0.0006, your holdings would already be worth $5,625—a nearly 4x gain before public trading even starts. But the real magic happens if BTFD hits its predicted moon price of $0.006. That same $1,500 investment? It would be worth $56,250. This isn’t speculation—this is math. BTFD isn’t just hype—it’s built on Ethereum, ensuring security and long-term sustainability. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which launched on January 1, 2025, lets users earn rewards while playing, further boosting community engagement. Staking is another powerhouse feature, offering a 90% APY, meaning passive income while you wait for prices to skyrocket. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad has built a movement—one that embraces buying low, holding strong, and cashing out when the market moons. Did you miss the Bitcoin dips? Ethereum crashes? Dogecoin’s underdog story? This is your shot to BTFD and ride the bull market from the very beginning. And if you’re looking for even more ways to stack up your holdings, BTFD’s referral program makes it simple: To earn big with BTFD, simply connect your wallet on the BTFD official site , grab your unique referral code, and share it with friends, family, or your community. Whenever someone buys $50 or more, they score 10% extra BTFD, while you pocket 10% of their purchase—and if you land in the top 20, your rewards skyrocket even more. Keep an eye on your earnings, stack up BTFD, and secure your spot in the top new meme coin for significant returns before the presale ends! Turbo (TURBO) – The Meme Coin That Turned Peanuts into Fortunes Turbo (TURBO) started as a joke—literally generated by AI—but ended up making millionaires. Its presale days were overlooked, with many laughing at its experimental origins. But while skeptics stayed on the sidelines, early investors quietly loaded up. Back in its launch phase, Turbo traded for fractions of a cent, but its insane rally took it to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.0144 on December 11, 2024. At its peak, investors who had put in a mere $500 during its early days were sitting on millions. The doubters? They were left wishing they had taken the risk when it was still dirt cheap. That story isn’t unique. Dogecoin had the same fate. Shiba Inu followed suit. Every time a meme coin gets dismissed as a fluke, it ends up proving the naysayers wrong. The ones who win? The ones who get in before the hype wave crests. Turbo’s story is a reminder that missing a meme coin’s early days is a costly mistake. History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes—and right now, BTFD is playing the same song Turbo did before it took off. Will you listen this time? Final Call – BTFD Presale Is Almost Over, Are You In? If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing Turbo’s meteoric rise, BTFD is your second chance—and maybe your last. The 14th stage is almost complete, and once this presale ends, prices won’t be this low again. The $0.00016 entry point won’t last forever. When it hits $0.006, your ROI is 3650%. That’s the kind of return that turns small investments into financial freedom. While others hesitate, action-takers secure their future. If you’re waiting for a sign, this is it. The next meme coin explosion is unfolding right now. Get in before the BTFD Coin presale swings into action, or watch the top new meme coin for significant returns from the sidelines again.

BTFD Coin is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a thriving community, a high-yield staking system (90% APY), and a Play-to-Earn game already live. Its presale has raised $6.25 million, and analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, making it one of the hottest meme coins right now. How does BTFD’s presale compare to Turbo’s early days? Like Turbo, BTFD is in its undervalued presale phase, offering a huge upside for early buyers. Turbo’s launch price was dirt cheap, and those who got in made life-changing gains. BTFD’s $0.00016 presale price offers a similar early-stage entry before its moonshot. How much can I make if I invest $1,500 in BTFD? At the current price of $0.00016, a $1,500 investment gets 9.375 million BTFD coins. If BTFD hits its expected post-launch price of $0.006, that $1,500 turns into $56,250. Is there a risk in investing in meme coins like BTFD? Like any investment, meme coins carry risk, but BTFD mitigates it with a strategic presale entry, staking rewards, and a growing ecosystem. Getting in early minimizes exposure to post-launch volatility, unlike buying at an all-time high. How do I join the BTFD Coin presale? Simply visit the official BTFD website, connect your wallet, and buy at the current presale price before the stage sells out. Don’t wait—the price increases at every stage.

The SEC attached a $50K incentive for its employees in what the financial regulator is calling a “voluntary early retirement” program. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) have focused their efforts on significantly slimming the government workforce and saving the government money in several areas. Massive layoffs and federal buyout programs are the results of their efforts so far. Most recently, SEC has offered its long-term employees the chance to resign or retire for a cash prize of $50K. Photo of Elon Musk wielding the chainsaw that Argentine president, Javier Milei gave to him at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) SEC goes the voluntary early retirement route According to an internal memo from SEC Chief Operating Officer Ken Johnson, the voluntary early retirement program is open to permanent employees who were on the agency’s payroll before January 24, 2025. Employees eligible for the offer must make their decision by March 21, 2025, and separate from the agency by April 4, 2025. The program allows these employees to either resign, be transferred to another agency, or immediately retire. The memo also stated that employees who accept the incentive and return to the SEC within five years are obligated to repay the incentive in full. The Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to reduce the federal workforce have already resulted in the elimination of over 100K civilian jobs, and their momentum does not seem to be slowing down. In February, The White House instructed federal agencies to submit their plans for “ large-scale reductions in force ” by March 13. The memo from the White House didn’t provide any specific roles for termination but said to start with workers deemed non-essential during a government shutdown. Furthering their plans to save money, the memo also instructed federal agencies to submit proposals to move their offices out of Washington and into “less costly parts of the country.” It is expected that the immediate cost of the SEC’s buyout offer will be offset by eliminating further expenses on the employees who accept the offer. Additionally, the SEC has instructed all staff, including unionized workers, to return to the office starting April 14, 2025. This instruction follows an order from the president demanding that employees work in person . This order doesn’t come as a surprise, as Donald Trump ordered heads of departments and agencies to “take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements” on his very first day in office. The instructions have been met with pushback from employees as the union’s contract with the agency allows for remote work. The instruction only temporarily excludes employees who already have full-time remote arrangements or whose homes are more than 50 miles from an SEC office. Buyouts in the workforce The SEC buyout program is in line with the Trump administration’s aim of significantly slashing the government workforce. It is one of many other agencies that has offered incentives to workers to voluntarily part with their roles. Black and white photo of US President Donald Trump and DOGE head and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk sitting side by side. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) An average of 62,000 federal workers have retired each year over the past decade, according to data provided by the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), but with the strategies of DOGE and President Trump, that number is expected to rise sharply. The Department of Education offered a $25K incentive to its employees to voluntarily retire or resign. Although it was framed as a voluntary program, the announcement of the incentive also came with the threat of a “significant reduction in force for the US Department of Education” following the deadline for application. The White House also offered all 2.3M federal employees, including 783K civilians in the Defense Department, a buyout worth roughly eight months of their salary and benefits. The offer was reported to be for employees who refused to comply with President Trump’s demand for all workers to return to the office. The email offering the incentive was framed as an easy method for the administration to effectively end remote work for most of the federal workforce. Still, it also carried the threat of the “majority” of agencies seeing reductions in force following the expiration of the offer. The US Postal Service recently offered early retirement incentives of up to $15,000 to mail handlers and other support staff, citing operational changes as the reason behind the move. “The United States Postal Service is continuing to transform its business model and build an organization structured for success. As a result of our capital investments in state-of-the-art mail processing equipment and changes to our network, the Postal Service needs to reduce staffing in those facilities that are overstaffed as we continue to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service to all communities,” the USPS spokesperson said .

His remarks triggered a sharp decline in U.S. stocks during late afternoon trading, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also weakened. “They’re going to have to face a tariff. What they need to do is build their car plants and other facilities in the United States—then they won’t have tariffs,” Trump stated at the White House. Trump doubles down on tariffs, citing fentanyl crisis and trade imbalances Trump stated there was “no room left” for a deal to prevent the tariffs by addressing fentanyl flows into the United States. He also announced that reciprocal tariffs would take effect on April 2 against countries that impose duties on U.S. products. Additionally, he reaffirmed plans to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports from 10% to 20% as a penalty for Beijing’s continued shipment of fentanyl to the U.S., asserting that China “has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis.” CEOs and economists warn that Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico—which would affect over $900 billion in annual U.S. imports—would significantly disrupt the deeply integrated North American economy. The Trump administration confirmed that the tariffs would take effect on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT). At that point, Canada and Mexico will face a 25% tariff, with Canadian energy products subject to a 10% duty. Mexican officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters that Ottawa was prepared to respond. She noted that there’s a level of unpredictability and chaos coming from the Oval Office, and they would be dealing with it. Gustavo Flores-Macias, a public policy professor at Cornell University, said consumers could see price hikes within days. “The automotive sector is expected to face significant negative impacts, not only due to disruptions in the supply chains that span all three countries but also because higher vehicle prices could weaken consumer demand,” said Flores-Macias. Mexico, which first managed to evade Trump’s first round of tariffs by vowing to deploy thousands of troops to its northern border, has stepped up its anti-drug efforts and signalled it might also impose new measures on Chinese goods coming into Mexico. At a press conference on Monday before Trump’s announcement, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that her government was calm while awaiting his decision. She still stressed that Mexico would retaliate if tariffs were enacted. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum holds a press conference a day before the imposition of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico March 3, 2025. REUTERS/Luis Cortes According to Sheinbaum the country has a plan B, C, and D,” Sheinbaum said, without providing specifics. She noted that trade and fentanyl-related cooperation with the U.S. had been “very good.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, synthetic opioids—primarily fentanyl—were responsible for 72,776 deaths in the U.S. in 2023. Lawmakers and economists sound alarm on tariff fallout and inflation risks Representative Suzan DelBene, a Democrat from Washington, warned that imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico would burden American families with higher costs at the grocery store, gas pump, and pharmacy. “No president should have the power to raise taxes without a vote in Congress,” she said in a statement. Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that any inflationary impact from the tariffs would be “second-order small.” He added, “I don’t see the president wavering on this because he understands that to achieve a strong and prosperous America—with rising real wages and more factory jobs—this is the path he has chosen.” On Saturday, Trump levelled up his targeted sanction initiatives by starting a national safety probe into lumber and wood items, which might produce tremendous new tariffs. He particularly delivered to Canada, a nation already dealing with 14.5% tariffs on softwood. The prior week, Trump had actively reprimanded many Western nations for taxing American tech enterprises and threatened to sting more obstacles on billions of products. The same day, he imposed a new investigation into copper tariffs and other trade limitations. Trump intends to impose U.S. “reciprocal tariffs” equivalent to those of other nations and has either removed trade barriers. The European Union might rapidly face this initiative since the VAT taxes imposed by the European Union on its member states considerably affect the result. Nonetheless, Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s Policy Development and Review Department , believes that Trump’s “tariffs on steroids” strategy could fuel inflation and potentially push the global economy into recession.

This price fluctuation has led to millions of dollars in liquidations, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Cardano (ADA) Liquidations Data shows that a total of $40.80 million worth of ADA positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Of these liquidations, $30 million came from the long side, while $11 million came from the short side. Current Price Momentum As a result, ADA has recorded a 25% price drop in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.81. Due to this significant price fluctuation, its trading volume has dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels With the notable price drop, ADA has reached a crucial support level of $0.80. According to expert technical analysis, this support level was previously broken during the recent upside rally. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the asset holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 35% to reach $1.14. However, if the asset fails to hold this level, it could decline by 20% to $0.65 in the coming days. $110 Million Worth of ADA Outflow Despite market uncertainty, investors and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the token, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass .

The task force was announced by SEC acting chairman Mark Uyeda on Jan. 21. The task force has several aims, according to an accompanying description . They include “appropriately distinguish securities from non-securities, … provide realistic paths to registration for both crypto assets and market intermediaries … and make sure that enforcement resources are deployed judiciously.” The task force has familiar faces, and a few new ones Peirce, a vocal crypto advocate in Gary Gensler’s SEC, was named head of the task force on Jan. 21. In addition, Richard Gabbert was named the group’s chief of staff and Taylor Asher was named chief policy adviser. Gabbert and Asher are also senior advisers to Uyeda. There are 15 members of the task force. “The task force is composed of staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and other divisions and offices across the Commission,” Peirce said in the SEC announcement of the appointments. Some of the appointees are longtime SEC staffers. According to LinkedIn, Gabbert, for example, has been at the agency since 2011 and served as Peirce’s counsel for seven years. Others were hired for the task force position. Chief Counsel Michael Selig is joining from law firm Wilkie Farr & Gallagher. Asher was an aide to pro-crypto Senator Bill Hagerty for a year before joining the SEC as an adviser to Uyeda in 2023. The task force has veteran crypto defenders Senior adviser Landon Zinda came to the task force from advocacy group Coin Center, where he had been policy counsel. In October 2022, Coin Center and three individuals filed suit against the Treasury Department and its Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) seeking the removal of OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash and 44 wallets associated with it. The Tornado Cash suit was launched before Zinda joined the organization. During Zinda’s tenure, Coin Center has provided support for the Jarretts’ latest suit against the Internal Revenue Service and for Lewellen v. Garland, in which a software developer sued the Justice Department for targeting developers who create non-custodial crypto wallets for unlicensed money transmission. Before Coin Center, Zinda was counsel for the Senate Committee on Banking focusing on crypto and fintech. Zinda began his career at the Heritage Foundation. Senior adviser Chris Rice is also senior adviser in the SEC Division of Investment Management. He came to the agency in 2023 after working in alternative investments in major financial institutions. New policies precede the task force Mark Uyeda has been on the SEC staff since 2006 and has been a commissioner since 2022. U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkin to be the chair of the SEC. He has not been confirmed by the Senate yet. Atkins comes from a legal background. He was a commissioner at the SEC from 2002 to 2008 under three chairs. He has been on the staff of two SEC commissioners and was also co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance. No date has been set for Atkin’s confirmation hearing. Even without the new chair in place, the SEC has shown indications of a drastic policy change from Gensler’s strident anti-crypto stance. Since Jan. 20, when Uyeda was appointed acting chair, the agency has dropped actions against the Tron Foundation , cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken , decentralized exchange Uniswap , NFT platform Yuga Labs, MetaMask developer Consensus and financial services company Robinhood. The agency has also rescinded the burdensome accounting rule in Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 that required crypto platforms to treat all assets they custodied as liabilities.

With XRP trading at $2.19 and Dogecoin at $0.2, their growth potential appears limited compared to MUTM’s expected spike. Already in its presale phase, this rapidly developing altcoin has already surpassed over $2 million, with Phase 2 ongoing at a price of $0.015. Over 3,800 investors have already jumped on this project, looking to get a 33.33% hike in price during the next stage. Investors who buy now will enjoy a 300% profit when Mutuum Finance goes live at $0.06. Furthermore, with predictions anticipating rising to $16 in 2025, investors will achieve 1600x gains. Limited Upside: Why Dogecoin and Ripple Could Trail Behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been mainstream famous within the crypto market, yet their upside for future appreciation appears to be capped. Dogecoin, while it has a cult following and temporary social media bursts, doesn’t have strong fundamentals and real-world applicability beyond speculation. At the same time, XRP, valued at $2.19, continues to struggle with regulatory challenges, as its price movement heavily relies on legal proceedings and institutional acceptance. While the two coins may see a rise in value in the next market cycle, their potential upside is overshadowed by future projects with greater potential for growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), even at the stage of presale, is already indicating such humongous breakout potential that it’s far more of a good investment in 2025. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big DeFi Thing Mutuum Finance is fast becoming the next big thing in decentralized finance. This upcoming altcoin has already garnered over $2 million in funding and 3,800+ investors in its presale, with its groundbreaking dual-lending mechanism. Trading at $0.015 in Phase 2, investors have not much time before the next 33.33% price surge. With the initial launch price being $0.06, early investors would realize 300% returns, and analysts foresee even bigger gains during the following bull run. From its dual lending program and solid fundamentals, Mutuum Finance is turning into one of the most promising DeFi projects of the year. Mutuum Finance offers an innovative lending model that is a combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows individuals to lock stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-based liquidity pools, earning passive returns while facilitating instant borrowing. The P2P model facilitates direct lending contracts between users in a peer-to-peer manner, cutting out middlemen for greater efficiency, transparency, and autonomy. The hybrid model addresses conservative investors seeking stable yields as well as risk-taking traders seeking higher rewards. A Secure & Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is also launching a collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that offers security and price stability. Unlike volatile algorithmic stablecoins, the model is backed by full asset and therefore avoids devaluations at the click of a button. Deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and strategic liquidity management also aid long-term growth. Mutuum Finance is set to spearhead the next generation of DeFi innovation with its strong architecture and expanding adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) are constrained on the upside, with Dogecoin relying on hype and XRP battling regulation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers genuine utility with its double-lending mechanism, stablecoin and deflationary strategy. On a presale value of $0.015, early birds can earn 300% at launch and 1,600x gain if MUTM hits $16 by 2025. With more than 3,800 investors and $2 million raised, Mutuum is launching. With the next big crypto thing, the time to act is now.

Dogecoin’s goal to achieve a market capitalization resembling Tesla’s would necessitate a 2,990% increase in price to $7.82, presenting a substantial potential gain but reliant on community enthusiasm and the influence of figures like Elon Musk. ADA, currently trading below $0.75, faces downward pressure, with technical evaluations indicating possible drops to $0.70 unless it regains the $0.81-$0.84 resistance zone. Conversely, BlockDAG displays substantial advancement and community-supported expansion. With a $200 million presale, over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold, and initial participants experiencing a 2,380% return, BDAG’s operational foundation is notably strong. Its March beta launch, $30 million grants initiative, and growing user base (over 500,000 X1 Miner application users) suggest sustained value beyond simple market speculation. Dogecoin’s Market Cap Ambitions: A Feasibility Study Dogecoin maintains a broad discussion presence, supported by a dedicated community and endorsements from prominent individuals like Elon Musk. This recognition has contributed to Dogecoin’s continued relevance in the evolving digital currency market. For Dogecoin to match Tesla’s market cap, its price must reach $7.82 per coin, a 2,990% increase from its current $0.25332. Such a rise would transform 15,000 Dogecoin, presently valued at $3,798, into $117,352, attracting those seeking substantial gains. While Tesla’s acceptance of Dogecoin enhances its credibility, substantial demand growth is essential. Its community-driven appeal maintains its ongoing relevance. The examination of BlockDAG in comparison, shows a different trajectory. ADA’s Technical Analysis: Identifying Key Support Levels ADA’s price is under downward pressure, presently trading below the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart. If ADA’s price fails to remain above $0.75, a decline to $0.73 or even $0.70 is possible, indicating further weakness. Technical indicators, such as LuxAlgo Trendline Breaks, suggest a potential breakdown, making support levels crucial. The MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating reduced buying strength, while the RSI at 41.38 suggests ADA is approaching oversold conditions but is not yet at extreme levels. A breakout above $0.81 could shift sentiment, though resistance at $1.16590 and $1.34 may limit gains without sufficient trading volume. Rejection near $0.80-$0.84 validates a supply zone. If ADA’s price reclaims $0.81-$0.84, a recovery towards $1 is possible, but its ability to maintain key levels will determine its subsequent movement. The review of BlockDAG shows a different growth pattern. BlockDAG’s $200M Presale & Beta Launch: An Assessment of 30,000x Potential BlockDAG is gaining traction within the digital currency market with significant growth and strategic plans for 2025. In its recent AMA, attended by over 800 individuals, the team shared key updates, including a March beta test net launch, a $30 million developer grants program, and new team members focused on global expansion. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising $200 million with over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold. Early participants have experienced a 2,380% return, and new participants are securing coins before the next price increase. BlockDAG’s beta test net will enhance network scalability, security, and speed, inviting community participation in testing and earning rewards. The $30 million grants program supports developers in creating innovative dApps, with hackathons planned in collaboration with HackerEarth.

With 10 CEX listings planned and projections of a 30,000x increase, BlockDAG is positioned as a major digital currency opportunity. The examination of BlockDAG’s technological approach is very important. The potential of BlockDAG is very high. The future of BlockDAG is being closely watched. The analysis of BlockDAG’s growth shows real value. The progress of BlockDAG is significant. The review of BlockDAG’s roadmap is critical. Comparative Analysis & Future Outlook While Dogecoin’s market cap aspirations and ADA’s potential recovery may attract traders, BlockDAG’s strategy is based on tangible progress, not just market sentiment. Dogecoin’s path to a Tesla-sized market cap is highly speculative, and ADA’s potential gains depend on overcoming persistent downward pressure. BlockDAG is actively achieving milestones, including a beta test net launch in March and a developer grants program that promotes development. The X1 Miner application’s over 500,000 downloads and planned 10 exchange listings contribute to its expanding ecosystem. With early participants experiencing substantial returns and projections of a 30,000x increase, BDAG offers both immediate gains and potential for sustained growth.

As ADA struggles to regain ground—trading at $0.80 after falling over 40% from its December high—analysts believe a breakout could be on the horizon. A 70% rally isn’t off the table, particularly as Cardano pushes for deeper Bitcoin integration, a move that could reshape its standing in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is drawing serious attention from investors, with its presale exceeding $1.5 million over the weekend. While Cardano fights to reclaim its bullish momentum, Web3Bay is emerging as one of the most intriguing crypto plays of 2025, offering early backers the potential for exponential gains. Cardano’s 70% Upside—Is a Breakout Imminent? ADA’s price has been caught in a volatile range, hovering around $0.80. However, analysts suggest that a 70% rally could be within reach if Cardano can break out of consolidation. Hoskinson’s recent remarks have only added fuel to the speculation. In a lengthy interview, he took aim at Ethereum and Solana, arguing that neither has the infrastructure to build a robust DeFi layer on Bitcoin—a challenge that Cardano is actively addressing. Hoskinson sees Bitcoin integration as a game-changer for Cardano, unlocking access to Bitcoin’s liquidity while establishing a more decentralized financial ecosystem. With the Bitcoin market valued at over $2 trillion, the opportunity remains largely untapped. Other projects like Core and Stacks (STX) have attempted similar integrations, but Hoskinson insists that Cardano’s research-based approach and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) framework offer a superior solution. Technical analysts point to the $1 resistance as a critical barrier. If ADA clears this level, the next target sits at $1.36, aligning with the projected 70% rally. However, sustaining momentum will depend on continued adoption, network advancements, and successful Bitcoin integration. Web3Bay’s Presale Crosses $1.5M—A Sleeping Giant? While Cardano eyes a breakout, Web3Bay’s presale is already hitting major milestones. Surpassing $1.5 million over the weekend, the project has quickly become one of the fastest-growing crypto startups of 2025. Web3Bay is shaking up the e-commerce industry by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes intermediaries, lowers transaction costs, and empowers buyers and sellers through blockchain technology. Unlike centralized giants such as Amazon and eBay—known for high fees and seller restrictions—Web3Bay offers a peer-to-peer ecosystem where users maintain full control over transactions. Investor interest in Web3Bay has been surging, with demand for its 3BAY token driving its presale success. Currently priced at $0.005247, the token is expected to launch at $0.1959, potentially delivering a staggering 3,633% return for early investors. The project’s appeal lies in its ability to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. Blockchain-based e-commerce is still in its infancy, giving Web3Bay a critical first-mover advantage in decentralized marketplaces. Which Crypto Has the Biggest Growth Potential? Both Cardano and Web3Bay offer compelling opportunities, but their appeal depends on investment strategy and risk tolerance. Cardano, an established blockchain with a dedicated community, could see a major upswing if its Bitcoin integration succeeds. However, ADA’s short-term prospects hinge on breaking key resistance levels and gaining broader adoption in the DeFi space. A 70% rally is possible, but long-term growth will depend on Cardano delivering on its ambitious plans. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is in its early adoption phase, meaning its potential upside is far greater. With an estimated ROI of 3,633% for presale participants, it represents a rare opportunity to enter a high-growth project before widespread adoption. For those looking for a more established yet potentially slower-moving investment, Cardano remains a solid choice. But for investors willing to take a chance on an early-stage disruptor with massive potential, Web3Bay stands out as one of the most exciting opportunities in the market. With Cardano pushing toward a breakout and Web3Bay gaining momentum in its presale, the question is clear—will you wait for established cryptos to regain their footing, or will you get ahead of the curve with an emerging project that could redefine its sector?

41126459,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=706124,1741053636,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Will Bitcoin Rise Or Fall Again? QCP Questions Trump-Fueled Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rise-or-fall-again-qcp-questions-trump-rally/,"Bitcoin surged past $95,000 during low-liquidity trading hours on Sunday after US President Donald Trump made a major announcement. The formation of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), set the market ablaze with speculation. Many traders viewed this as a defining moment, one that could solidify crypto’s place in the U.S. financial system, while others remained wary, questioning whether the rally could sustain itself beyond the immediate reaction. Among those skeptical is QCP Capital. A Well-Timed Political Bitcoin Play? The timing of Trump’s announcement is difficult to ignore. Throughout the past week, risk assets faced mounting pressure as global markets reacted negatively to a series of economic and geopolitical developments. Trump’s newly imposed tariffs rattled investor confidence, while shaky Ukraine-Russia peace talks created additional uncertainty. Stock market volatility intensified, weighing heavily on sentiment across the financial sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Average Cost Basis At $90,950 — Why Is It Relevant? Bitcoin broke below its multi-month range, showing signs of weakness before Trump’s announcement. The sudden announcement was a stark contrast to the downward trajectory risk assets had been following. QCP Capital highlighted the political strategy behind the move: “For a president who thrives on being the market’s hero, last week’s risk asset performance performance was anything but inspiring. His slew of new tariffs and shakier than expected Ukraine-Russia peace talks rattled investor confidence. So, while the timing of the SBR was somewhat unexpected, the political calculus was clear — Trump needed a win before his approval ratings starts slipping, a metric he likely takes very personally.” However, questions remain as to whether this move represents a genuine shift in policy toward long-term crypto adoption or simply a well-timed announcement aimed at stabilizing sentiment before further economic strain emerges. While Bitcoin’s rapid ascent over the weekend excited traders, QCP Capital remains unconvinced that this rally represents a meaningful breakout. The firm pointed to several key market signals that indicate Bitcoin is not yet out of the woods. QCP Capital cautioned: “Are we back in the game? Not quite. BTC is still trading near the bottom of its multi-month range and frontend crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March. The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the US administration.” Lessons From The Past: The ‘Xi Candle’ Comparison For seasoned traders, the weekend’s price action is reminiscent of a historical event in the crypto market—the infamous Xi Candle of 2019. Prominent crypto analyst Cold Blooded Shiller took to X to draw comparisons between the two events. Reflecting on the Xi Candle, Cold Blooded Shiller recalled how Bitcoin had been in a prolonged downtrend, trading at fresh lows with market sentiment at rock bottom. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China should embrace blockchain technology. The result was a massive short squeeze, with Bitcoin skyrocketing by 40% in just two days. Traders at the time believed it marked the beginning of a new bullish era for crypto. “Sentiment was very quick to adjust. You’ll be surprised (not) to hear that it didn’t take much back then to shape the whole mindset of Twitter into the positives and ability for the market to now have an infinite bid,” he wrote. However, the euphoria was short-lived. Several weeks later, China backtracked on its pro-blockchain rhetoric, implementing fresh crackdowns on crypto exchanges and warning investors about the risks of digital assets. Bitcoin’s gains slowly eroded, with price action reversing over the following month and ultimately dipping below pre-announcement levels. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Cycle Really Over? This Indicator Suggests Price Could Rebound To $130,000 “We did not immediately reverse the candle. It actually took many weeks to do that, which made it all the more painful for those trading it or those who had their bullish bias,” Cold Blooded Shiller recalled. The similarities between the Xi Candle and Trump’s Crypto Reserve announcement are striking. Both events followed prolonged periods of market weakness, both saw a dramatic shift in sentiment almost overnight, and both created a new bullish narrative that was widely embraced by the market. The key question now is whether Trump’s announcement will lead to a sustained trend shift or if, like the Xi Candle, it will eventually fizzle out, leaving late buyers trapped at the top. Key Events To Watch This Week Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its gains or extend higher will likely depend on key macroeconomic and regulatory developments in the coming days. On Wednesday, markets will receive the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, a crucial economic indicator that could influence expectations for Federal Reserve policy. If PMI data shows signs of economic weakness, it could increase speculation about potential rate cuts, which may provide a tailwind for risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, stronger-than-expected data could reinforce the view that the Fed will maintain its restrictive policy stance, potentially pressuring crypto and equities alike. Friday brings the release of the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, a key employment indicator that has historically influenced market sentiment. A strong jobs report could signal continued economic resilience, reducing the likelihood of near-term rate cuts, which could negatively impact Bitcoin. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected report could fuel risk-on sentiment, further supporting BTC’s momentum. Also on Friday, the White House Crypto Summit is expected to provide critical insights into the future of the US Crypto Strategic Reserve. If tangible announcements emerge, BTC could rise further. However, if the event fails to deliver meaningful policy direction, the market could react negatively, leading to increased volatility. As QCP Capital put it, “Just when we think Trump has exhausted his cards, he may still have more surprises up his sleeve. Will this be the push toward that elusive all-time high? We’ll be watching.” At press time, BTC traded at $90,352.

Qubetics Is Set to Ignite,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-for-significant-returns-in-2025-missed-polygon-qubetics-is-set-to-ignite/,"The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing, with new trends emerging faster than you can refresh your feed. 2025 is no exception. After experiencing a major dip in early 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have regained some ground, sparking conversations about the next big thing. But as the usual heavyweights like Ethereum and Polygon continue to ride their well-worn waves, some fresh contenders are catching everyone’s eye. In fact, some promising cryptos that could’ve been snapped up earlier in 2025 are now considered missed opportunities—Polygon, for instance. But that doesn’t mean the ship has sailed for high returns. If anything, there’s a fresh opportunity on the horizon—Qubetics ($TICS). It’s quickly becoming the next big crypto to look out for in 2025, and the FOMO around it is palpable. While other tokens struggle to bring something new to the table, Qubetics is focused on real-world solutions, setting itself apart from the crowd. From its rapidly growing crypto presale numbers to analysts predicting explosive price surges post-launch, Qubetics is worth paying attention to. Missed Opportunity: Polygon Polygon, once a darling of the Layer-2 scaling solutions, has been making waves for its ability to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities. It was one of the first projects to really show that Ethereum could scale without compromising security or decentralization. And for a while, it seemed like Polygon would only grow bigger. Its aim to support Ethereum’s ecosystem and offer faster, cheaper transactions really caught people’s attention back in 2021 and 2022. Fast forward to 2025, and Polygon’s hype has started to die down. What happened? Well, as the years went on, competition caught up. Layer-2 solutions from various blockchain networks are quickly growing, and other projects have started outpacing Polygon in terms of innovation and adoption. While Polygon still holds some relevance, it no longer holds the same level of excitement or potential as it once did. The crypto world moves fast, and while Polygon did great things, it’s just not as “hot” as it once was. So, if you missed out on Polygon during its prime, you’re probably wishing you’d jumped in a bit earlier. But the good news is, there’s still time to cash in on newer projects with even greater potential. Qubetics: The Crypto You Shouldn’t Miss in 2025 Here’s where things get interesting. If Polygon’s miss was a reminder that the crypto world is always shifting, then Qubetics is the shining example of a project that’s ahead of the curve. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain solution—it’s aiming to tackle real-world problems that others haven’t been able to address. And that’s where it differs from most cryptos. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 24th stage, having sold more than 495 million tokens to over 22,000 holders, raising over $14.5 million. At just $0.0976 per $TICS token, it’s clear that early supporters are about to see massive returns as the presale progresses. If analysts are right, $TICS could skyrocket to $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 155% return on investment. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. After the presale ends, some analysts predict that $TICS could hit $1, which would result in a whopping 923% ROI. And it doesn’t stop there. Post-mainnet launch, the price could reach $5, representing a jaw-dropping 5018% return. What makes Qubetics even more enticing is the real-world application of its blockchain. The flagship product, QubeQode IDE, is a next-gen development platform that’s designed to solve a massive gap in the tech world. Developers and businesses alike are constantly looking for more efficient tools, and Qubetics delivers. By providing a seamless way for developers to write, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps), Qubetics is positioning itself to be a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem. Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner trying to streamline your operations. You could be in e-commerce, retail, or even healthcare—no matter the industry, Qubetics could help you develop a custom blockchain solution tailored to your needs. Or maybe you’re a developer working on the next big dApp. Instead of navigating through complex, fragmented platforms, you can use QubeQode to make your life a whole lot easier. That’s the beauty of Qubetics: it’s solving problems in real ways that businesses and individuals can relate to. Qubetics’ application has already gained significant traction. For example, a freelance developer could use the QubeQode IDE to launch a decentralized app without worrying about hefty upfront costs or complicated integration processes. Similarly, larger enterprises looking to move toward blockchain could integrate Qubetics’ tools to make their processes more efficient, secure, and cost-effective.Given its early momentum and the potential for massive returns, Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025. Popular Crypto Coin To Buy in 2025: Qubetics When you hear about a coin that’s already setting new records, it’s hard to ignore. Analysts are all buzzing about Qubetics and its future potential in 2025. Here’s why this crypto could be the one to watch this year: its use case is far more robust than a lot of the coins making waves right now. Qubetics stands out because it’s one of the few cryptocurrencies solving a real-world issue. Unlike many other coins that are mostly speculative or still struggling to gain solid footing in the blockchain space, Qubetics has proven it’s more than just a “promise.” The platform is actively being used in various sectors, ranging from tech startups to established industries like finance and healthcare. But it’s not just about utility—Qubetics also offers explosive growth potential. As its presale progresses, the $TICS price is set to rise rapidly. This means that anyone who hops on board now could be looking at some seriously impressive returns when the coin hits mainstream exchanges. And given its utility in real-world applications, there’s a high likelihood that $TICS could see long-term, sustained growth after its official mainnet launch. So, why should anyone care about Qubetics in 2025? Well, for starters, it’s tackling a problem that others have yet to touch. The QubeQode IDE is not just a tool for developers—it’s something that could dramatically shift how blockchain technology is used across industries. With blockchain becoming a critical part of various sectors, businesses are actively looking for ways to integrate it smoothly into their operations. Qubetics is the bridge they’ve been waiting for. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics So, here’s the takeaway: if you missed out on Polygon, it’s not too late. But don’t sit around waiting for the next big thing. Qubetics is here and already gaining serious traction. With a revolutionary development tool and real-world applications across multiple industries, Qubetics could very well be the key to massive crypto gains in 2025.

The regulator will take no enforcement action and has not issued any charges against the firm. Yuga Labs confirmed the news in a Mar. 3 post on X, calling it a “huge win” for the NFT industry and creators. The company added, “NFTs are not securities.” After 3+ years, the SEC has officially closed its investigation into Yuga Labs. This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward. NFTs are not securities. — Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) March 3, 2025 The SEC launched its probe into Yuga Labs in October 2022 to determine whether its NFT collections and ApeCoin ( APE ), a token linked to BAYC, should be classified as securities under the Howey Test. The inquiry was part of a larger campaign against NFTs led by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, which also targeted NFT markets and fractionalized NFTs.

The SEC has dropped other investigations involving cryptocurrency companies in recent weeks, which coincides with the decision to conclude the Yuga Labs inquiry. The agency recently settled litigation with Coinbase and Kraken and concluded investigations into OpenSea, Robinhood, Gemini , and Uniswap Labs. The market anticipates that the regulatory shift will have a positive impact on the BAYC NFTS floor price , which is currently trading around13.75 Ethereum ( ETH ), down more than 90% from its peak of 153.7 ETH in May 2022. Meanwhile, on March 3, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force revealed on the regulator’s official website that it will be holding a number of roundtables for the public called “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The goal of these roundtables is to establish more precise rules pertaining to digital assets. The first event, “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” is set for March 21 from 17:00 to 21:00 UTC. These talks will explore important issues in crypto regulation and signal how the agency is changing its stance on digital assets.

Right now, many traders are overly focused on Bitcoin, believing it to be the safest bet. However, historical trends suggest that when altcoin interest is at its lowest, a significant rally is usually on the horizon. Market experts predict that altcoins are gearing up for a strong recovery, with capital expected to shift from Bitcoin to high-growth altcoin projects. While Bitcoin maintains a dominant position, an altcoin boom is approaching, and early investors in the right tokens could see substantial returns. Among the top contenders, three altcoins stand out for their potential in the next market cycle. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain solid picks, but a rising star— Web3Bay (3BAY)—is catching investors’ attention. Ethereum (ETH) — The Smart Contract Leader Ready for Expansion Ethereum has consistently been the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. Despite growing competition from other blockchains, Ethereum remains the primary hub for decentralized applications, with institutional investors increasing their exposure to ETH. With Ethereum-based ETFs gaining traction, demand for ETH is rising, and analysts believe breaking past $3,500 could trigger a strong rally toward new highs. As DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets gain adoption, Ethereum is positioned at the center of blockchain growth, making it a must-have for the next altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are driving optimism by reducing gas fees and improving transaction speeds. With ETH’s supply declining due to its deflationary tokenomics, a supply crunch could send prices soaring in the coming months. Solana (SOL) — The High-Speed Blockchain on the Verge of a 13% Breakout Solana has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a setup that often signals an imminent breakout. Crypto analyst Ali recently pointed out that Solana is primed for a 13% price move, with $193 being a key level to watch. Despite past concerns over network congestion, Solana has continued to deliver high-speed transactions with minimal fees, attracting strong institutional interest. As DeFi and NFTs continue expanding, Solana remains one of the most efficient blockchain networks, positioning it ahead of rivals like Cardano and Avalanche. With trading activity rising and sentiment improving, Solana’s next breakout could push it past key resistance zones, bringing it closer to its all-time high. However, while Solana presents a solid long-term investment, another lesser-known altcoin is gaining momentum—Web3Bay. Web3Bay (3BAY) — The Hidden Gem With 4200% Growth Potential Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which are already established, Web3Bay gives investors the chance to buy in early before its projected surge. Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes middlemen, lowers fees, and enhances security for buyers and sellers. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay impose high fees and centralized control, whereas Web3Bay offers a blockchain-powered alternative with peer-to-peer transactions, transparency, and security. Web3Bay’s presale has already exceeded $1.5 million, reflecting strong demand for 3BAY tokens. Currently priced at $0.004562, its anticipated launch price of $0.1959 suggests a massive 4200% return—far exceeding the potential gains of Ethereum or Solana at this stage. What makes Web3Bay particularly compelling is its real-world application. Many cryptocurrencies rely on speculation, but Web3Bay is solving practical issues within the multi-trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. As demand for decentralized solutions grows, 3BAY is positioned for significant adoption, making it one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. Why This Is the Perfect Time to Buy These Altcoins The market is approaching a major altcoin rally, and history shows that early positioning is key to maximizing gains. Ethereum and Solana are showing strong signs of upward movement, but the biggest opportunity lies in early-stage projects like Web3Bay. With Ethereum aiming to break past $3,500, Solana consolidating before a key move, and Web3Bay still in its presale phase, now is the time to invest before prices skyrocket. Many investors miss out by waiting for confirmation, only to buy when prices have already surged. Those who take action now stand to gain the most. Ethereum and Solana offer solid long-term growth, but Web3Bay remains the most undervalued altcoin with the highest upside. Its disruptive e-commerce model, strong presale momentum, and projected 4200% ROI present a rare investment opportunity before it reaches mainstream markets. The question is—will you act now, or will you watch from the sidelines as another major crypto success story unfolds?

This reserve will include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Following the announcement, XRP’s value surged from $2.23 to $2.99. But can the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could affect everything. Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino pointed out that the case between Ripple and the SEC has big consequences for the future of XRP and the U.S. economy. He believes that if former President Donald Trump doesn’t act soon and the SEC continues its case against Ripple, it could hurt American investments in cryptocurrencies. However, Crypto Law founder and attorney John Deaton pointed out something interesting: the Ripple lawsuit was filed just before the end of Trump’s first term, under the leadership of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. Now, four years later, XRP has a chance to be a part of a major global cryptocurrency reserve. Deaton argues that if Trump does not intervene and the case continues, the U.S. could lose out on big opportunities in the growing crypto market. “He has to drop it,” Deaton said. What’s Next for XRP? The future of XRP and Ripple largely depends on how the case with the SEC plays out. If Ripple can resolve the issue, XRP could become a major part of the digital currency world. As Deaton said, this is a critical moment for the entire crypto industry, not just Ripple. How the SEC case is handled will impact not only XRP but also the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. and beyond. In conclusion, while the road ahead for Ripple and XRP is still uncertain, one thing is clear: the decisions made in this case could shape the future of cryptocurrency, with XRP playing a key role in the new world of digital finance.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|FIAT|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:00:26

Both will serve as senior advisors to the task force, alongside career SEC staff. Taylor Asher, who previously advised former Commissioner Mark Uyeda on policy, will serve as chief policy advisor.

ETH is now back below $2,200 and might decline further in the near term. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,350 support zone. The price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,160 and $2,250 resistance levels to start a recovery wave. Ethereum Price Dives 15% Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,550 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $2,400 and $2,350 support levels. There was a clear move below the $2,250 support zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price even dived below the last low and tested the $2,000 zone. A low was formed at $2,003 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,080 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,150 level. There is also a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $2,275 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,275 resistance might send the price toward the $2,350 resistance. An upside break above the $2,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,450 resistance zone or even $2,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,020 level. The first major support sits near the $2,000 zone. A clear move below the $2,000 support might push the price toward the $1,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,750 support level in the near term.

The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability.

The latest market shakeup has turned the crypto world into a battlefield where only the strongest projects survive. Those who pick wisely now could be sitting on life-changing gains when the next bull run ignites. But here’s the catch—getting in early is the name of the game. That’s why BTFD Coin (BTFD) has taken center stage. This presale is roaring through its 14th stage with investors rushing in for its 90% APY staking, P2E game rewards, and a potential 3650% ROI moonshot. With over $6.25 million already raised and more than 71 billion coins sold, it’s the hottest bet in the meme coin universe right now. Miss it, and you might regret it when the price rockets. Ready to uncover the best meme coin presale to buy this week? Let’s dive in. 1. BTFD (BTFD) – The Meme Revolution Offering 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Ever wished you could buy the dip before a meme coin goes parabolic? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin (BTFD) is delivering—except this time, it’s pre-loaded with opportunities that no other meme coin can match. This isn’t just another pump-and-dump meme token. BTFD’s ecosystem is built to reward its holders long-term, offering a whopping 90% APY staking, a fully playable P2E game, and an ever-growing community that thrives on smart, early-stage investing. Right now, BTFD is in its 14th presale stage, with each coin priced at $0.00016. But when the presale ends, its listing price will shoot up to $0.0006, meaning early investors could already be sitting on 275% gains before the token even hits the market. Imagine throwing in $1500 at today’s presale price of $0.00016. You’d be holding 9,375,000 BTFD coins. If BTFD reaches its predicted moonshot price of $0.006, that same investment would be worth a staggering $56,250. And if that’s not enough, BTFD’s referral program allows you to earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code and invest at least $50. It’s a win-win—stack tokens and stack profits. Why does BTFD deserve a spot on this list? No other meme coin is offering this combination of high-yield staking, gaming rewards, and a presale surge that’s already bringing in millions. This best meme coin presale to buy this week isn’t just a chance—it’s your golden ticket to crypto riches. 2. Book of Meme (BOME) – The Meme Library That’s Breaking the Internet Book of Meme (BOME) is rewriting the history of meme coins—literally. It’s not just a token; it’s an entire archive of the internet’s funniest and most viral memes, stored forever on the blockchain. Its decentralized meme library allows users to create, own, and monetize memes like never before. Recently, BOME has expanded its ecosystem, integrating NFT meme minting and meme staking, where holders can earn passive income by simply owning legendary internet memes. Why is BOME part of this list? Because memes aren’t just a joke anymore—they’re an economy, and BOME is leading the way. 3. Ponke (PONKE) – The Hottest Community-Driven Meme Coin With Explosive Potential Ponke (PONKE) has been on a meteoric rise, thanks to its highly engaged community and aggressive development roadmap. Unlike other meme coins that fizzle out after a few weeks of hype, Ponke has been delivering on its promises. With exclusive airdrops, staking rewards, and a major CEX listing in the pipeline, Ponke is gearing up for another massive breakout. Why does Ponke deserve your attention? Because a strong, loyal community is what separates short-lived meme coins from long-term winners. 4. Bonk (BONK) – The People’s Meme Coin That’s Here to Stay Launched as Solana’s first meme coin, Bonk (BONK) has proven it’s more than just a fun experiment. With massive adoption across NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, and Solana-based games, BONK is showing real-world use cases. The team recently introduced BonkPay, a decentralized payment system allowing users to spend BONK for real-world purchases, making it one of the few meme coins with tangible utility. Why is Bonk a must-watch? Because it has successfully bridged the gap between meme culture and real-world adoption. 5. Brett (BRETT) – The Under-the-Radar Meme Coin Making Quiet Moves Brett (BRETT) might not have the same cult following as some of the bigger meme coins, but that’s exactly what makes it an undervalued gem. It’s been stealthily gaining momentum, with whales accumulating and rumors of upcoming exchange listings swirling around. BRETT has also teased a metaverse integration, potentially making it the next big play-to-earn contender in the meme coin space. Why should Brett be on your radar? Because sometimes, the best gains come from the coins people aren’t talking about yet—but soon will be. Final Thoughts: Time is Running Out! With meme coins making yet another explosive comeback, the question isn’t if they’ll take off, but which ones will leave you behind if you don’t act now. The one project that stands out among the best meme coin presales to buy this week is BTFD Coin. With 90% APY staking, a fully live P2E game, and a presale about to hit its final stages, this could be your last chance to lock in early-stage gains before the moonshot happens. Once it’s listed at $0.0006, the rocket launch is officially on. Are you in, or are you going to be the one watching from the sidelines when BTFD reaches $0.006?

The analyst has pinpointed a critical resistance level that XRP will need to hold lest it crashes to new lows and eradicates recent gains. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.5 TradingView crypto analyst MadWhale has shared a new price analysis focusing on XRP’s future price potential. The analyst emphasized his strong track record of cryptocurrency trends, underscoring that he has accurately identified and hit all the gain targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Pump To $3.35 On The Horizon With Bullish Cup And Handle Pattern Formation MadWhale predicts that the XRP price could crash below $1.9 to $1.5. The analyst revealed that XRP is currently in a downtrend and has been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish structure. According to his price chart, the cryptocurrency is also trading within a descending channel and fast approaching a key resistance level. This critical resistance point at the $2 mark has been tagged as a psychological level where sellers are likely to emerge and trigger further downward pressure on the cryptocurrency. If a rejection occurs at this $2.00 resistance level, MadWhale highlights that the next support area and downside target will be around $1.90, representing a 17.62% value drop. If the resistance level fails completely and the $1.90 support level breaks, the TradingView crypto analyst has forecasted another major breakdown in the XRP price. He predicts that the cryptocurrency could experience a more profound decline of 35%, possibly dropping down to the next major support level at $1.5. This crash target aligns with the lower boundary of the descending channel in which XRP currently resides. MadWhale has revealed that the decline to $1.5 could serve as a pivotal point for price stabilization, hinting at a possible reversal in the cryptocurrency once bearish pressures wane. The analyst’s price chart also shows that XRP recently tested the upper boundary of the descending channel but faced a rejection near the resistance. The main daily resistance area for the XRP price is marked in red on the chart, suggesting that $2.6 is where selling pressure might occur. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.8, already significantly above MadWhale’s daily resistance area. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan Triggers Major XRP Price Surge After experiencing a significant price crash over the past few weeks, the XRP price seems to be recovering at an alarming pace. In just one day, the cryptocurrency saw a double-digit price surge, successfully reversing its previous downtrend. Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring Analysts have attributed this unexpected sharp surge to the recent United States (US) crypto reserve plan announced by Donald Trump. The US President had included XRP in his plans for a crypto reserve aimed at boosting the country’s debt strategy and crypto dominance. As news of this strategic plan spread, the XRP price saw a 24.5% increase, pushing its value significantly above the $2.5 threshold once again.

Last week, it reached an all-time high of $2.98, but has since pulled back by around 41%. This price volatility has raised questions among investors about what’s driving the changes in its value. The token’s future is closely tied to market sentiment and exchange listings. If major exchanges list Pi, it could spark renewed investor interest, pushing the token to new highs. According to CoinCodex, Pi could surge by 234.84% this month, with a potential average price of $3.37—an increase of 101.79% from its current level. The highest price forecast is $5.64. A major factor affecting Pi’s price is the anticipation surrounding its potential listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Recently, Binance held a community vote, with 86% of users supporting the listing of Pi. However, despite this strong support, Pi Network has yet to be listed, which has led to some uncertainty among investors and contributed to the recent price dip. Despite the exchange listing delays, Pi Network is seeing increasing real-world use. Businesses in countries such as the USA, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and India are accepting Pi as payment. In China, BYD Auto Service Company even allowed customers to purchase cars with Pi, selling around 100 vehicles globally. This growing acceptance could help boost Pi’s reputation in the crypto space. March will be a key month for Pi’s future, as it could determine whether the token bounces back or remains under pressure.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:43:12

Has Bitcoin Bottomed? Bitcoin experienced significant volatility over the past week, dropping from $96,000 on February 23 to $78,258 on February 27. However, it recovered most of its losses yesterday, rebounding to as high as $95,000. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Sell Pressure Fades, Could A Local Bottom Be Forming? Analyst Explains In the Quicktake post, abramchart highlighted the declining Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for BTC holders. For those unfamiliar, the SOPR measures the proportion of BTC wallets that have held the cryptocurrency for more than one hour but less than 155 days. According to SOPR, any value greater than 1 indicates that short-term investors are selling at a profit. Conversely, a value below 1 suggests that short-term investors are incurring losses. While a value under 1 may indicate bearish sentiment, it can also be seen as a sign of market capitulation, often followed by a potential trend reversal. The total crypto market cap surged by more than $200 billion yesterday, driven by US President Donald Trump’s announcement regarding the creation of a crypto reserve. As of today, the SOPR sits at 0.95, the lowest it has been since August 2024 when BTC was trading within a consolidation zone around the mid-$50,000 range. The post concludes: We have likely reached good accumulation zones for Bitcoin and are close to the bottom of the current wave. BTC Showing Signs Of Trend Reversal While predicting crypto markets can be difficult, some indications suggest that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a trend reversal after prolonged selling over the past month. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains For example, during its potential local bottom at $78,258, BTC partially filled a long-standing CME gap between $78,000 and $80,000. CME gaps often act as price magnets, and once filled, BTC typically moves in the opposite direction. Additionally, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that BTC has reached its most oversold level since August 2024. Martinez suggested that the high selling pressure on BTC might be nearing its end, potentially signaling a trend reversal. In related news, Andre Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, noted that despite the market pullback, BTC is flashing a massive contrarian buy signal, presenting an attractive risk-reward opportunity at current prices.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-trader-gains-1-2-million-in-two-hours-heres-how/,"Crypto trader and enthusiast Crypto Beast recently shared a post on X highlighting a substantial gain with XRP trading. According to his tweet, he earned $1.2 million in just two hours, attributing his success to his strong belief in XRP. The tweet quickly gained traction among cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts, prompting various responses from the community. Along with his post, Crypto Beast attached a screenshot of an XRP/USDT chart, showing a sharp price increase. The chart indicates a significant upward movement, with a key price level at $2.9110 and a percentage gain of 33.60%, demonstrating the volatility XRP experienced during that period. I just made $1.2M in 2 hours How? I’m a $XRP believer It’s as simple as that pic.twitter.com/lTGBAxFZpi — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) March 2, 2025 Community Reactions to the Rapid Gains The tweet sparked a conversation among traders, with some praising Crypto Beast’s conviction while others urged caution regarding XRP’s well-known volatility. A user named Crynet responded to the post, saying: “That’s quite the return in such a short time! Just remember, with great gains come great volatility—hope you’re ready for the rollercoaster ride ahead.” Crynet’s comment underscores a common sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. While large gains can be exhilarating, they often come with significant price swings. Many traders who experience rapid profits also face the risk of sharp corrections. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Jacqueline Marjory, took a more optimistic stance, stating : “That’s the power of conviction in your plays! $XRP has been showing signs of massive potential, and if you’ve been holding strong, those gains speak for themselves. It’s not just about the price action; it’s about believing in the long-term vision. Major respect for sticking with it!” Her comment reflects that XRP’s price movements are not just speculative but part of a broader growth trajectory. Many XRP supporters have long maintained that it has strong fundamentals and could see substantial adoption in the financial sector. The Nature of XRP’s Market Movements XRP’s market behavior has often been characterized by sharp price swings, making it attractive to traders looking for short-term opportunities. The 33.60% price surge, as shown in the attached chart, is a testament to XRP’s ability to generate substantial returns in a short period. However, such movements are risky, as corrections can follow rapid price increases. Crypto Beast’s success highlights the opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. It’s also a reminder of the importance of risk management. While his $1.2 million gain is impressive, not all traders will experience the same outcome, and significant price fluctuations can lead to losses just as quickly.

The leading cryptocurrency is down 10% on Tuesday, Mar. 4, according to the price tracker on crypto.news, reversing its weekend rally following Trump’s announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Investor sentiment quickly shifted after Trump reaffirmed 25% tariffs, triggering a major selloff across financial markets. The Dow Jones erased a 300-point gain to drop over 1,100 points, while the S&P 500 lost $1.5 trillion in market cap. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which had surged to $95,000 over the weekend, fell back into consolidation. Analysts had warned that the crypto reserve news lacked immediate impact and that macroeconomic risks could weigh heavier. The broader crypto market also suffered. Ethereum ( ETH ) plunged 15% to $2,067, marking its first drop below $2,100 in 15 months. Stocks linked to crypto, including Coinbase (-4.6%) and Robinhood (-6.4%), reversed earlier gains.

In his March 4 Substack article , he pointed to declining U.S. Treasury liquidity as a bullish sign, though he warned BTC could briefly test $70,000 if risk assets continue selling off.

SOL price is down over 20% and might struggle to recover above the $150 resistance. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $162 and $150 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $150 zone. Solana Price Dips Heavily Solana price struggled to clear the $180 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $165 and $155 support levels. It even dived below the $150 level. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The recent low was formed at $132 and the price is now consolidating losses with a bearish angle. Solana is now trading below $140 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $140 level. The next major resistance is near the $144 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $180 swing high to the $132 swing low. The main resistance could be $156 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $180 swing high to the $132 swing low. A successful close above the $156 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $165. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level.

The first major support is near the $125 level. A break below the $125 level might send the price toward the $120 zone.

While XRP remains a major player in cross-border payments, uncertainty surrounding regulations and price fluctuations has investors seeking new opportunities with high growth potential. Lightchain AI, with its blockchain and AI integration, is gaining traction as a top contender. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.6 million at a presale price of $0.006, reflecting strong confidence in its future. As investors look for stability and innovation, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a smart choice for long-term gains. Ripple Investors Face Market Ambiguity- What’s Driving the Shift Ripple’s XRP investors are navigating a landscape marked by significant market ambiguity. Recent price volatility, including a 4.3% decline to just under $2.02, has raised concerns. This downturn is influenced by the SEC’s ongoing legal actions against Ripple, alleging unregistered securities sales. Additionally, global economic factors, such as recent tariff announcements by President Donald Trump, have heightened market uncertainty, leading to cautious investor behavior. Despite these challenges, some investors remain optimistic, anticipating that a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the current administration could bolster XRP’s prospects. However, the convergence of legal uncertainties and macroeconomic factors continues to drive the current market shift, leaving XRP investors in a state of cautious anticipation. Lightchain AI- Safe Bet Amid Market Uncertainty As market uncertainty continues to impact cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI is emerging as a stable investment due to its well-structured tokenomics and low-latency performance. The platform’s tokenomics is designed for long-term sustainability, ensuring fair distribution and balanced incentives. With a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens , allocations are strategically placed for presale participants, staking rewards, liquidity pools, and ecosystem growth. Additionally, dynamic pricing mechanisms and deflationary elements, such as token burning, help maintain value over time. Beyond tokenomics, Lightchain AI boasts ultra-low latency, making transactions and AI computations seamless. Its high-speed processing allows real-time execution of decentralized applications while maintaining network efficiency. By prioritizing both economic stability and performance, Lightchain AI stands strong amid market fluctuations. Grab Investment Opportunities with Lightchain AI Presale The Lightchain AI presale presents an exciting opportunity for Ripple investors looking to diversify their portfolio. With a presale price of $0.006, participants have the potential to secure LCAI tokens at a discounted rate, anticipating future value appreciation. Moreover, early adopters can also benefit from staking rewards and liquidity pool incentives, further enhancing their investment returns. As the platform continues to grow and expand its use cases, LCAI tokens are expected to increase in value, given its well-structured tokenomics and demand for high-speed blockchain solutions. As such, investing in the Lightchain AI presale offers a unique chance to join an innovative platform with high growth potential. https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://twitter.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 05:10:41

The drop follows a short-lived rally after Donald Trump’s March 2 announcement of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, which briefly pushed ETH above $2,500. However, Trump’s confirmation that fresh tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico will go into force on March 4 has caused market sentiment to shift, raising concerns about broader economic instability. The announcement caused Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price to plummet, dropping below its pre-pump level of about $2190. Decentralized finance activity and the Ethereum futures market both indicate Ethereum’s declining momentum. Open interest in ETH futures has dropped by 10% over the last day, according to Coinglass data .

Staking (90% APY) and Bulls Squad Staking rewards are insanely high—90% APY, making BTFD a passive income machine for long-term holders. Combine that with the Bulls Squad, a unique community concept that gamifies engagement, and it’s easy to see why BTFD’s presale is moving fast. Referral Program: Turn Your Friends into Your Wealth Machine The BTFD referral program is a game-changer for those who want to maximize their profits beyond just holding. If your referral code gets used and you make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard, you’ll earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet : Visit BTFD’s official site and generate your referral code. Share Your Code : Send it to your friends, family, and crypto communities. Get Paid Big Time : If your referrals buy $50+ in BTFD, they get 10% extra tokens. You earn 10% of every purchase through your code if you make it into the top 20 referrers. Track your earnings in real time. This isn’t just a passive reward—it’s a 3650% ROI moonshot opportunity for those who bring in the biggest buys. With the 14th stage nearly complete, the referral competition is heating up, and every second counts. Investment Example: The Math Behind the 3650% ROI Let’s break it down with numbers. Say you invest $3,000 into the BTFD presale at $0.00016 per token. That gets you 18,750,000 BTFD coins. When BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment would be worth $11,250—a solid 275% gain.

In a post on X, he emphasized the strategic advantage of announcing on a Sunday when traditional financial markets are closed. He pointed out that this smart move by the president gives retail investors a unique opportunity, suggesting that traditional finance must adapt to the evolving landscape of digital assets. “For the first time, retail investors win. Traditional finance better catch up, or it will quickly become extinct,” Eric Trump stated, reinforcing that the financial world is no longer bound by conventional market hours.

The world no longer runs on a Mon-Friday,… pic.twitter.com/EPtbEisbdI — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) March 3, 2025 U.S. Crypto Reserve Announcement Donald Trump confirmed the creation of a U.S. Crypto Reserve on March 2, describing it as a necessary step to protect and elevate the cryptocurrency industry. Eric Trump shared his father’s statements, where the president criticized the regulatory stance of the Biden administration, claiming that it had hindered the growth of the digital asset sector. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration,” Trump stated, underscoring his belief that government policies had previously been detrimental to the sector. An Inclusive Reserve to Advance the Crypto Industry The reserve will reportedly include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Trump also stated that the reserve would contain other valuable assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By establishing a strategic reserve that includes multiple major digital assets, Trump signals a policy shift that could lead to broader adoption and institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. financial system. The inclusion of XRP, SOL, and ADA, in addition to BTC and ETH, suggests a diversified approach rather than focusing solely on the most dominant assets. Before the confirmation of the crypto reserve, Bitcoin maximalists were pushing for a Bitcoin-focused reserve , attempting to remove other digital assets from this monumental development. However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other advocates continually called for multi-token reserve , as involvement from the broader market could help to bolster the crypto space and encourage innovation. Eric Trump’s response underscores the broader implications of his father’s announcement, highlighting a shift in the U.S. government’s approach to digital assets. By establishing a U.S. Crypto Reserve, Trump aims to integrate cryptocurrencies more firmly into the financial system while challenging existing regulatory policies. This move could be a major step in advancing global finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Recent incidents highlight the increasing risks faced by both individual crypto holders and major platforms. Popular streamer Amouranth was the target of a home invasion where attackers allegedly sought access to her digital assets, while Bybit suffered a record-breaking $1.4 billion hack due to a security loophole. Popular Streamer Amouranth Targeted in Home Invasion by Crypto-Seeking Robbers Late in the night on March 2, popular streamer and internet personality Kaitlyn Siragusa, widely known as Amouranth, reported being the victim of a terrifying home invasion. The assailants, allegedly three armed men, broke into her residence while demanding access to her cryptocurrency holdings. According to Amouranth’s posts on X, the robbers were yelling for crypto during the invasion, heightening concerns over the growing trend of physical attacks targeting digital asset holders. In a harrowing series of social media updates, Amouranth detailed the events of the night, explaining that the robbers appeared to be specifically after her cryptocurrency assets. Just hours later, on March 3, she posted a security camera video showing the three men on her property. The footage captured the moment she led them to another section of the house before three loud noises rang out, prompting the invaders to flee the scene. While it remains unclear whether the noises were gunshots, alarms, or some other form of deterrent, the attackers’ swift retreat suggests that their plan was disrupted. Authorities have yet to release official details regarding the incident, including whether any suspects have been identified or apprehended. Amouranth’s prominence in the online world has not only made her a successful content creator but also a known figure in the financial and cryptocurrency sectors. In November 2024, she shared a screenshot of her Coinbase account revealing that she held approximately 211 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at around $20 million at the time. The screenshot also indicated holdings of around $80,000 in Ether (ETH). Given her public transparency regarding her wealth, some speculate that the attackers may have specifically targeted her due to these disclosures. With her significant cryptocurrency holdings and history of financial openness—including appearances on YouTube financial shows—Amouranth has been vocal about investment strategies and wealth accumulation. Amouranth’s ordeal adds to a growing list of “crypto wrench” attacks, a term used to describe physical threats or coercion aimed at forcing victims to transfer their digital assets. These crimes have surged in 2025 as cryptocurrency’s mainstream adoption continues to rise, making high-net-worth holders prime targets for criminals. Several high-profile incidents in recent months have underscored this alarming trend: January 2025: A Canadian volunteer moderator for a crypto forum reportedly went into hiding after kidnappers attempted to abduct him and force him to transfer his Bitcoin holdings. Jan. 21, 2025: David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, was allegedly abducted from his home, with the assailants demanding a crypto ransom before his eventual release. February 2025: Another alleged crypto-related kidnapping attempt occurred in Chicago, reinforcing concerns that such attacks are becoming more frequent and geographically widespread. Speaking on the rising trend of crypto-related physical attacks, security expert “Dr. Anon” explained in an interview that these attacks are “frequently ‘your money or your life’ situations carried out by sophisticated, professional, and organized criminals.” He also advised crypto holders to take proactive security measures, including the use of “decoy” wallets containing only a small portion of funds that can be surrendered under duress. The attack on Amouranth serves as a chilling reminder of the risks associated with holding and publicly discussing large cryptocurrency holdings. With digital assets being decentralized and irreversible once transferred, they remain a prime target for criminals who see an opportunity to exploit high-profile or wealthy individuals. Security experts suggest several precautions that crypto holders should take to mitigate risk: Avoid publicly sharing holdings: Broadcasting crypto balances on social media can make individuals targets. Use hardware wallets: Keeping assets in cold storage rather than online exchanges limits immediate access. Implement multi-signature wallets: Requiring multiple approvals for transactions can make forced transfers more difficult. Have a security plan: Personal safety should be a priority, with home security systems and contingency plans in place. The Bigger Picture: Crime and Cryptocurrency The attempted robbery at Amouranth’s home is part of a broader discussion around the risks and regulatory concerns surrounding cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional bank accounts, which have fraud protection and centralized control, digital assets rely solely on their owners to ensure security. Once funds are transferred, they are nearly impossible to recover. Law enforcement agencies worldwide have been increasingly working on strategies to combat crypto-related crimes, but decentralized technology often complicates tracking and prosecution. Cases like Amouranth’s show the urgent need for heightened security measures, both for individuals and the industry as a whole. While Amouranth appears to have escaped physical harm, the psychological toll of such an invasion cannot be understated. The attack serves as a stark warning to high-profile cryptocurrency holders about the real-world dangers that accompany digital wealth. As crypto adoption continues to expand, so too must the awareness of security risks and the necessary precautions to prevent such terrifying incidents in the future. Crypto Hack Losses Surpass $1.5 Billion, Experts Urge Stronger Bug Bounty Programs In other news, as cryptocurrency-related security breaches continue to escalate, losses from hacks have now surpassed $1.5 billion, according to a report by blockchain security firm CertiK. The staggering amount, fueled largely by the historic $1.4 billion Bybit hack, has prompted cybersecurity experts to call for more robust bug bounty programs to attract top-tier ethical hackers and strengthen platform security. On March 3, CertiK reported that the total losses from cryptocurrency hacks in February alone reached $1.53 billion. The vast majority of this sum—more than $1.4 billion—came from the exploit of Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange. However, even without this incident, the firm found that additional hacks and exploits resulted in $126 million in losses, including a $49 million theft from Infini. This rising wave of attacks sheds light on the increasing sophistication of malicious actors in the crypto space, who continually exploit vulnerabilities in both centralized and decentralized platforms. Ethical hacker Marwan Hachem said recently that these figures signal an urgent need for better bug bounty programs to incentivize white hat hackers to identify vulnerabilities before bad actors do. Hachem, who serves as the chief operating officer at cybersecurity firm FearsOff, criticized the bug bounty framework employed by Safe, the multisignature wallet provider used by Bybit. According to him, Safe’s bug bounty program classified front and back-end bugs as ‘out of scope,’ meaning ethical hackers who discovered these vulnerabilities were not eligible for rewards. This oversight proved disastrous. The Bybit hack occurred due to a vulnerability that was excluded from the bounty program’s scope. As a result, while ethical hackers had no incentive to report such vulnerabilities, criminals exploited them for one of the largest thefts in crypto history. “What they considered out of scope led to the biggest crypto hack in history,” Hachem stated. “We often breach platforms through bugs found in out-of-scope assets. Ethical hackers wouldn’t get rewarded for such findings, but criminals exploited them and stole $1.5 billion from Bybit.” Hachem pointed out that Bybit’s official bug bounty program offers a maximum reward of $4,000 on its website and up to $10,000 on the HackerOne platform. These amounts are negligible compared to the multi-million-dollar sums that malicious hackers can potentially steal. The cybersecurity expert argued that offering larger bounties upfront to ethical hackers would be far cheaper and more effective than trying to recover funds after a breach. He criticized the industry’s tendency to offer 10% of stolen funds as white hat rewards post-hack, stating that such reactive measures only embolden malicious actors rather than preventing attacks in the first place. “Motivating top ethical hackers to dedicate their time and attention to testing an exchange by offering higher rewards will greatly improve its security, will be a lot cheaper, and will safeguard its reputation,” Hachem emphasized. While bug bounty programs are crucial, cybersecurity experts also stress the need for stricter security measures to prevent incidents like the Bybit and Infini hacks from recurring. A spokesperson from CertiK said recently that several industry-standard practices must be adopted, including: Air-gapped signing devices to prevent unauthorized transactions. Non-persistent OS environments for transaction approvals to reduce exposure to malware. Enhanced authentication layers for high-value transactions to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, the firm recommended regular red-team exercises and phishing simulations to mitigate social engineering risks, which remain a major attack vector in the crypto space. CertiK’s report provided insights into the specific vulnerabilities that led to the Bybit and Infini hacks: The Bybit exploit was the result of a phishing attack, where multisignature signers were deceived into approving a malicious contract upgrade, effectively allowing attackers to gain access to users’ funds. The Infini hack occurred due to an admin private key leak, which allowed attackers to make unauthorized withdrawals. Both cases show the dangers of blind signing and inadequate transaction verification. CertiK emphasized that stronger authentication protocols, real-time transaction monitoring, and improved user interface security are necessary to prevent such breaches in the future. The Future of Crypto Security As the cryptocurrency sector continues to evolve, exchanges and other platforms must prioritize prevention over reaction. The rise in large-scale hacks demonstrates that weak security practices and insufficient bug bounty incentives are actively being exploited by criminals. Bybit’s record-breaking $1.4 billion hack should serve as a wake-up call to all crypto exchanges and wallet providers. Security must become a top priority, with an emphasis on: Significantly increasing bug bounty rewards to attract the best ethical hackers. Expanding the scope of security programs to cover all possible vulnerabilities. Implementing stronger authentication measures for both internal and user transactions. Conducting regular penetration tests and security audits to identify risks before attackers do. The surge in cryptocurrency-related hacks, culminating in February’s $1.5 billion losses, highlights the urgent need for stronger proactive security measures. Exchanges must rethink their approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that ethical hackers are adequately incentivized to uncover vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by criminals. With cybercriminals continuously adapting their tactics, the crypto industry must stay ahead of the curve. By offering more competitive bug bounty programs, tightening security protocols, and implementing stricter authentication measures, crypto platforms can significantly reduce their risk exposure and safeguard user funds from future attacks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-04 05:30:00

Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, sparked industry debate about its impact and regulatory clarity. Coinbase is also concerned about regulation, and even recently filed a FOIA request seeking details on SEC spending for crypto enforcement actions. Lawmakers Establish Congressional Crypto Caucus The United States House of Representatives will see the formation of a new pro-crypto group, as Congressmen Ritchie Torres and Tom Emmer announced the launch of the Congressional Crypto Caucus . The bipartisan caucus will advocate for digital asset-friendly policies and serve as a voting bloc to rally support for key crypto legislation. Torres confirmed the news through a post on X on March 3, while Emmer’s office shared that the group will play a crucial role in advancing pending legislation, including stablecoin and market structure bills. The formation of this caucus comes as a more action-oriented counterpart to the existing Congressional Blockchain Caucus, which was established in the later years of the Obama administration to boost and encourage understanding of blockchain technology. While that group largely functioned as an educational and discussion platform, the Congressional Crypto Caucus will actively influence policy decisions by mobilizing votes in favor of digital asset regulation. Currently, lawmakers in the House are reviewing a draft bill that is designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the US. The legislation was introduced by Representatives French Hill and Bryan Steil on Feb. 7, adding to the growing momentum for clear rules around digital assets. Representative Maxine Waters also voiced her support for a stablecoin bill that was introduced in 2024. Steil, who chairs the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, indicated that an updated version of the FIT21 bill, a key market structure proposal that was passed in 2024, may be on the horizon. Both Torres and Emmer have been very vocal supporters of the crypto industry. Torres has consistently advocated for balanced regulations that prevent crises like the FTX collapse while also ensuring the US remains a leader in finance and innovation. He previously expressed his support for FIT21 because of its role in consumer protection and industry oversight. Emmer serves as the House Majority Whip and vice chairman of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, and has also been a strong proponent of advancing crypto-friendly policies. He has positioned digital assets as a matter of American leadership, particularly under the current political climate. The emergence of the Congressional Crypto Caucus certainly aligns with the broader pro-crypto shift in Washington. President Donald Trump recently announced that his Working Group on Digital Assets was instructed to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a strategic crypto reserve. Additionally, Trump is set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Idea Gains Traction but Lacks Clarity Donald Trump’s recent announcement of a strategic crypto reserve generated a lot of discussion in the industry, with some experts seeing it as a positive development but also warning that it does not replace the need for clearer regulation. Patrick Young , go-to-market lead at Web3 app Galxe, believes that while the move signals growing government involvement in digital assets, the long-term impact on the market will depend on regulatory clarity rather than state-led accumulation of cryptocurrencies. Trump’s Truth Social post In a March 2 post on Truth Social , Trump revealed that his administration’s digital assets working group was instructed to include XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a US government crypto stockpile. He later stated that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be at the core of this reserve. Trump has been promoting the idea of a US strategic crypto reserve since mid-2024, and his latest statement had an immediate impact on the market. Bitcoin saw a sharp increase, and briefly jumped past $90,000 before stabilizing. Cardano surged by more than 40% in the first 24 hours after the announcement. Despite the market reaction, Young said that the broader industry is more focused on regulatory progress. He pointed out that a friendlier regulatory environment could serve as a more sustainable driver for crypto markets. Trump’s appointments to key regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raised expectations that clearer guidelines will soon be introduced. The SEC already moved forward with applications for US crypto products that previously stalled under the prior administration, which many believe signals a shift in regulatory approach. The commission also stated in February that meme coins are likely not securities, which also clarified a lot of questions that the industry had. Trump’s decision to include altcoins like XRP and Cardano in the reserve raised some concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Some industry figures suggested that the president could be leveraging the move to increase his own crypto wealth, given his connections to entities that hold various digital assets. Others pointed to the centralization risks that are associated with a government-controlled reserve of decentralized assets. Adam O’Brien , CEO of Bitcoin Well, questioned the rationale behind centralizing cryptocurrencies in a government reserve, and argued that if centralized assets were the goal, traditional blue-chip stocks would be a more logical choice. He also warned that such a move could set a precedent that shifts focus away from the fundamental decentralization principles of blockchain technology. While the creation of a strategic crypto reserve has been received as a step toward legitimizing digital assets at the federal level, many in the industry believe that long-term stability will ultimately depend on regulatory frameworks. Coinbase Seeks SEC Spending Details on Crypto Lawsuits Some in the crypto industry are still holding on to the damage that was caused by the previous administration. In fact, Coinbase filed a Freedom of Information Act request looking for details on how much the SEC spent on enforcement actions against crypto firms. Paul Grewal, the exchange’s chief legal officer, announced the move on March 3, and stated that the request covers investigations and enforcement actions from April 17 of 2021, to Jan. 20 of 2025. Coinbase is looking for information on the number of employees that were involved, third-party contractors used, and the overall cost of these regulatory efforts. Grewal criticized the SEC’s previous regulation-by-enforcement approach, and argued that it costs the US innovation, leadership, and jobs. He also questioned the budget and operational costs of the SEC’s now-defunct Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, which was replaced by the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit on Feb. 20 this year. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is very well known for his strict stance on crypto, resigned on Jan. 20 , 2025, the same day Donald Trump began his second presidential term. Under Gensler’s leadership since 2021, the SEC pursued more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms. After his departure, the agency completely reversed course by dropping multiple lawsuits, including cases against Kraken , Gemini , and Yuga Labs.

The protocol processed $4.66 billion in swaps in the week ended March 2, the highest tally on record, according to data source DefiLlama . The tally exceeded the $1 billion mark on Sunday alone. The surge in activity follows the hack of the crypto exchange Bybit on Feb. 22, which saw the North Korean malicious entity walk away with $1.4 billion in ether. Per observers, the entity used THORChain to swap and launder funds, resulting in a record activity on the platform. ""Starting from the initial Bybit Exploiter wallet, funds were sent across a further stretching net of wallets. With each 'hop' further from the main wallet, there was an increasing amount of intermediary wallets and the value transfers became smaller and smaller,"" blockchain analytics firm Nansen said in a report shared with CoinDesk. ""From hop 2, the hacker started interacting with third-party entities to start swapping and laundering the funds. Entities with the most inflow volume from the hack include THORChain, Paraswap, Mantle, OK DEX and DODO,"" Nansen added. CoinDesk reached out to THORChain for a comment on the matter. Per onchain analyst EmberCN, hackers have laundered the entire ETH balance in ten days, generating record revenue for THORChain. ""Hackers have laundered all 499,000 ETH ($1.39 billion) stolen from Bybit, a process that took 10 days. The ETH price has fallen by 23% in the process (from $2,780 to $2,130 today).

The markets toppled then but bounced back heavily, attracting over $300 billion in liquidity after validating a crypto strategic reserve. In the times when the markets were hoping that these tariffs could get delayed, Trump confirmed that the tariffs would begin on March 4, 2025. With this, the traditional markets plunged, driving the crypto markets back under a strong bearish influence. Bitcoin price and Ethereum price faced a huge pullback as they dropped below their respective psychological barriers at $84,000 & $2100, respectively. Therefore, this suggests that the excitement of the most-awaited announcement of a strategic reserve was very short-lived. Besides, the impact over the crypto markets quickly nullified with the probability of the start of a fresh tariff war. This suggests the market participants do not appear to be confident over the next price action as they continue to remain in fear. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve? Ever since the President announced the creation of a strategic reserve, the demand for only a ‘Bitcoin strategic reserve’ has emerged. Many criticize the inclusion of XRP, SOL, ADA, or other altcoins and push for only a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Besdies, more clarity is yet to be given after the announcement, while the formation is expected to consume more time than expected as it has to be tabled and approved in the parliament. Meanwhile, after a year of the first BTC ETF approval, the round of the first strategic reserve could have a similar impact. As rightly pointed out by a popular analyst, Crypto Rover , the BTC price has experienced a smooth upswing ahead of the expectation of the strategic reserve, and hence the impact of the news is yet to happen as it occurred after the approval of the ETFs. Therefore, the crypto markets are heading towards a very crucial phase, and hence, it would be more interesting to watch what new updates will unfold in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 05:48:27

The firm unstaked and distributed 3.03 million SOL (roughly $431.4 million) to 37 wallets just three hours ago. The company has followed a pattern of similar monthly activity over the past year by redeeming and transferring millions of SOL tokens regularly. The tokens move at regular intervals, mainly around the 12th to the 15th of each month, with amounts approaching 170,000 SOL. Spot On Chain noted that FTX/Alameda’s latest move was the largest unstake since November 2023. The firm also believes that FTX/Alameda’s latest unstaked Solana was likely part of the 11.2M SOL (nearly $2.06B) set to be unlocked in early March. FTX/Alameda Research’s SOL unstaking history. Source: Spot On Chain on X The analytic firm highlighted that FTX/Alameda had unstaked and unloaded 7.83M SOL since November 2023. The firm has now unstaked about $986M SOL to Coinbase and Binance at an average price of $125.8. In the wake of FTX’s unstaking activities, Solana has experienced a slight drop in prices since yesterday. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL has seen a 19.54% drop in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at $135.69 at the time of publication. FTX commences its creditor repayment process FTX’s latest unstaking followed its recent decision to commence its creditor repayment process this month, with an initial distribution of $1.2 billion to smaller claim holders. FTX’s creditor repayment process began officially on February 18 at 3 AM UTC. The repayment of $16 billion will begin with $6.5B to $7B in the first phase. The first batch of repayments will also target creditors with claims under $50,000, totaling approximately $1.2 billion. “It’s estimated that $6-7 Billion are going back into the hands of crypto investors. If a good fraction of that re-enters the market it could provide a boost to liquidity in the near future. – Miles Deutscher , Crypto analyst. Louis Origny, co-founder of FTXcreditor.com, told crypto influencer and journalist Tiffany Tong that account holders with claims over $50,000 may receive 175% of their original claim. He did not provide an official date for the distribution of funds to creditors with larger claims exceeding $50,000. The firm’s executive did reveal that the process is expected to begin in Q2 2025, with an estimated $16 billion to be disbursed in stages. He also highlighted that 50% of the repayment amount will be withheld to cover disputed claims. FTX revealed its reorganization plan that became effective on January 3, which outlined that all creditor repayments should be processed within 60 days of the effective date. Part of the plan tasked crypto custodian BitGo with handling the distribution of funds to creditors. The firm decided to base the payouts on crypto prices from November 2022, when FTX collapsed. Solana has also increased by over 700% since the company declared its bankruptcy, surging from about $22 to price levels slightly above $180. Ethereum holders with Ethereum in FTX will get a full $2500, the same price in 2022. FTX liquidated 41 million SOL in three auctions as part of its bankruptcy proceedings to refund its customers. Galaxy Digital was the largest buyer, acquiring nearly 25.52 million SOL at a price of $64 per token. At current SOL prices, Galaxy’s return rate stood at 187% since Solana’s price rose since the exchange went bankrupt. Pantera was the second-largest buyer, followed by a consortium of buyers who secured 13.67 million SOL at $95 per token. The purchase resulted in a 93% return rate, with other buyers managing to acquire 1.8 million SOL at $102 at 80% profit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

However, despite this bullish outlook, many ADA whales have already shifted their capital toward Rollblock’s presale – a promising GameFi altcoin gaining rapid traction. Rollblock is transforming the $450 billion gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology to eliminate fraud and scams. With over 7,000 games deployed on-chain, the platform has drawn significant investor interest. More than 50,000 investors have contributed nearly $11 million, making Rollblock one of the most promising presale altcoins of 2025. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Breaks the $1 Resistance Level Cardano has surged by 5.20% in the past month and 33% in the last week, and it’s now trading just below $1, with a $34 billion market cap. According to TradingView , its Average Directional Index has dropped below 46.8, signaling a strong uptrend that may persist unless a sell off ensues. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Santiment data shows that whale addresses holding 1 million to 10 million ADA has grown from 2,454 on February 21 to 2,789. This suggests large investors are onboarding ADA, which could trigger further highs for smaller holders. However, Crypto creator Satoshi Talks believes that ADA could test key support at $0.90 if the downtrend resturns. A break below may push it to $0.32, a level not seen since November 2024. However, if $90.0 holds, ADA could attempt a rebound, with resistance at $1,and $1.11. A breakout above these levels may help Cardano flip $1 resistance to support for the first time since late January. Grayscale has also added Cardano to its Smart Contract Fund, making ADA the fund’s third-largest asset at 18.23%. This move indicates confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential, even as its current price action remains volatile. Rollblock Hits $0.06 As 50,000+ Players Enter the Ecosystem Rollblock’s presale has been a massive success, with RBLK surging 500% across ten presale rounds. Now priced at $0.06, the token has attracted over 50,000 investors and raised nearly $11 million, making it one of the most successful GameFi projects of 2025. This growth isn’t just speculation – Rollblock’s innovative gaming ecosystem is driving real adoption backed by tried and tested utility. The platform hosts over 7,000 AI-powered games directly on-chain, ensuring full transparency and eliminating any possibility of fraud. Every outcome is immutably recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, guaranteeing fair play and further boosting investor confidence through superior security standards. Rollblock holds a full e-gaming license from the Anjouan Gaming Authority and has passed a SolidProof audit, verifying its smart contract integrity and solidifying the project’s compliance with the latest regulatory requirements. At the heart of this ecosystem is RBLK, a deflationary utility token with a fixed supply of 1 billion. Unlike inflationary altcoins like Cardano, Rollblock actively reduces the tokens in circulation, increasing scarcity and value over time. Its revenue-sharing model reinforces long-term growth. Up to 30% of platform revenue is used to buy back RBLK, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned and 40% distributed as staking rewards. This ensures constant demand, rewarding early investors while strengthening Rollblock’s ecosystem. Rollblock’s robust gaming ecosystem and deflationary tokenomics have caught the attention of many crypto experts and commentators. Here’s why Freddie Finance believes that this up-and-coming crypto gaming powerhouse could take everyone by surprise in 2025. This Crypto Presale Has INSANE Potential ($6M Already Raised?!) ROLLBLOCK Review Can Rollblock Outperform Cardano in 2025? Rollblock’s presale has skyrocketed 500%, hitting $0.06, with investors and players predicting a 100x surge toward $1.

With market sentiment shifting fast, attention also turns to Panshibi (SHIBI) , a panda-themed newcomer gaining traction in its presale at $0.005. While Cardano’s rapid climb underscores growing confidence in established altcoins, the latest Cardano Price Prediction further amplifies the buzz, and Panshibi’s meme coin appeal backed by locked liquidity and a robust design, offers a fresh angle for traders seeking high-upside meme tokens. Cardano’s Rally and Trump’s Crypto Reserve Observers point to a powerful catalyst in President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that Cardano would be part of a U.S. “Crypto Reserve.” Fueling the altcoin’s rally, Cardano climbed an impressive 60% after weeks in a stubborn downtrend. Now trading around $0.972 , the coin has pushed back above critical resistance at $1.00, an encouraging sign after languishing below that level. Market data reveals that this boost in buyer interest coincided with an uptick in the MVRV Long/Short Difference metric, signaling that long-term holders remain confident. Although the president pegged a lofty sum for the entire reserve package, skeptics caution that official numbers remain sparse. Regardless, the psychological effect of including Cardano in a high-profile initiative has contributed to bullish sentiment. Technical analysts warn that for ADA to maintain its upward path, $1.00 must be reliable support . A break below that threshold could drag the coin toward $0.85 or even lower, unraveling the recent gains. Nonetheless, traders remain watchful, as Cardano’s “living governance” structure and DeFi expansions underscore the network’s ambition. Panshibi (SHIBI): A meme coin Token with Locked Liquidity Amid the excitement over Cardano Price Prediction angles, a new meme coin stands out: Panshibi (SHIBI) . Priced at $0.005, the presale has already raised more than $1.2 million. Panshibi merges meme coin branding with robust tokenomics, locking liquidity for ten years and the team tokens for two. An AI-based “social-fi” model encourages staking and quest-based activities, seeking to sustain engagement well beyond its initial launch. Such a structured approach addresses the volatility typical of meme coins, reassuring those who fear sudden dumps. By building meme coin flair on top of a stable foundation, Panshibi catches the eye of risk-oriented traders looking for potential quick gains. A new meme coin token can sometimes thrive alongside more established altcoins, especially if market attention drifts from older memes or if bullish cycles return. While no meme coin asset is guaranteed success, the token’s mix of humor, locked liquidity, and interactive community fosters expectations of an upward climb possibly rivaling the big leaps of other early-stage meme coins. Conclusion As the crypto sphere buzzes over Cardano Price Prediction , talk of $1.20 or higher, the arrival of Panshibi (SHIBI) signals that meme coin tokens can still grab the spotlight if they blend novelty with security. Cardano’s bounce above $1.00 demonstrates that strong catalysts, like a U.S. Crypto Reserve mentioned, can quickly shape sentiment. Meanwhile, Panshibi’s presale success suggests that some traders prefer a meme coin’s thrill (and potential upside) that attempts to avoid typical pitfalls. Whether both can thrive simultaneously remains an open question, but their contrasting appeals highlight the vast opportunities and risks that define the crypto market.

Ripple (XRP) also experienced a strong surge after the announcement, but investors are still debating whether it can continue the explosive growth after substantial moves in recent months. Meanwhile, after gaining over 800% amid a turbulent market, many DOGE and XRP holders are reinvesting in DTX Exchange (DTX), a hybrid project that aims to transform the trading sector. In the bonus (final) round, the DTX presale is seeing overwhelming demand. Due to a $0.36 projected listing price, a 2x surge from now, it has emerged as the new safe haven for investors seeking a promising investment. Expert investors believe that the DTX Exchange could surpass XRP and Dogecoin prices before mid-2025. Dogecoin Price Reclaims $0.22, New Highs Soon? After 42 days of continuous downtrend, the Dogecoin price formed a pivot candle, surging above the $0.22 support. Last Friday, DOGE plunged to a low of $0.181, the lowest price seen since 7 November 2024. On late Sunday, the Dogecoin price surged over 15%, reaching a high of $0.24. This minor recovery offers hope to holders, but the meme coin remains under heavy pressure, as monthly stats show a loss of 30%. Courtesy: TradingView Commenting on the Dogecoin price prediction, renowned crypto analyst, Ali Martinez said that if it holds above the key support, an uptrending move could occur. Currently, the key level for Dogecoin price is the support range of $0.20 and $0.22. If DOGE manages to surge above the $0.28 resistance, then an uptrend could be confirmed. Can Ripple (XRP) Inclusion in Crypto Reserve Solve Regulatory Challenges? President Trump recently disclosed that the US cryptocurrency strategic reserve will have Ripple (XRP) and several other main digital assets. This information has resulted in the rise in value of the XRP, which rose by more than 36% in one go, reaching above $3.02. Ripple is facing SEC in court and aims to win the case, which could be one of the factors influencing its long-term upward trend. James Murphy, an attorney, expressed his opinion about why the SEC did not drop the suit against Ripple right away. He is a prominent figure in the field of financial services law and often shares his views on cryptocurrency-related legal disputes, particularly the Ripple vs. SEC one. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of uncertainty that drives XRP investors to hedge the risk and seek new industry leaders like DTX Exchange. DTX Presale Soars Past $15.50 Million: Easy 2X Opportunity While turbulent market conditions have affected Ripple and Dogecoin, DTX Exchange’s presale performance has been nothing short of remarkable. Due to the increasing demand, the bonus round is selling out rapidly, and the total raised has crossed $15.50 million. This incredible success demonstrates strong market validation for its innovation of a hybrid trading model, which combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. DTX Exchange’s hybrid protocol allows traders to access more than 120,000 financial assets, including stocks, crypto, ETFs, forex, and bonds. This approach eliminates the necessity of multiple platforms and also saves users from various charges, such as AMC. Experts consider the DTX token’s current valuation of $0.18 to be highly undervalued because, upon listing at $0.36, it will provide early investors with a 200% profit before it even hits major exchanges. Key Takeaways Ripple investors remain cautious due to regulatory hurdles, and the Dogecoin price is still struggling from sentiment shifts, while DTX Exchange has created a stir with its advanced platform being hailed as a one-stop solution for traders. Investors looking for a solid investment contender will most probably find that DTX offers a much superior upside compared to other cryptos.

The SEC’s decision means no penalties, no changes to Kraken’s business operations, and no admission of wrongdoing. The SEC has closed probes into major companies like OpenSea, Gemini, and Robinhood but continues to investigate others, including Ripple. A Major Legal Victory for Kraken The SEC filed a lawsuit in November 2023, accusing Kraken of mishandling customer funds and operating as an unregistered securities broker. Instead of settling, Kraken chose to fight the charges. A federal judge initially ruled that the SEC had a plausible case, which led to the case heading to trial. However, the SEC has now decided to drop the charges after reaching an agreement with Kraken. Pending approval from the SEC’s Commissioners, the case will be officially closed. “This dismissal lifts that cloud of uncertainty. It reaffirms that businesses like Kraken, which prioritize compliance and consumer protection, should not be subject to arbitrary legal battles,” the company stated. A Turning Point for Crypto in the U.S. Kraken celebrated the SEC’s decision, calling it more than just a legal victory. The company described the move as a turning point for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. The SEC’s decision, Kraken stated, puts an end to what they called a politically motivated campaign, lifting the uncertainty that has hindered innovation and investment in the industry. SEC’s Changing Approach to Crypto Enforcement Kraken’s win comes as the SEC, under new leadership, shifts away from the aggressive enforcement tactics that characterized the tenure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The new leadership has expressed a commitment to developing clear and fair regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, rather than relying on “regulation by enforcement.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 06:09:06

While the announcement initially triggered a jump in crypto trading, markets cooled on Monday as concerns about the implications of the plan surfaced. Trump announced plans on Sunday to establish a government-backed reserve that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano, claiming the move would help the United States become the “Crypto Capital of the World.” But the initiative has drawn criticism, particularly over the inclusion of multiple cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and whether such government intervention contradicts traditional free market principles. Related News: There Will Be Intense Cryptocurrency Spotlight In The US Senate This Week - Here Are The Details Of The Development Expected To Be Positive Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the richest man in American crypto with a net worth of $9.6 billion, expressed his skepticism on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that the reserve should focus solely on Bitcoin, which he called a “successor to gold” for the U.S. government. Billionaire investor Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of AI-focused defense firm Palantir and a staunch Trump supporter, was even more critical. Responding to Trump’s post, Lonsdale condemned the plan, arguing that “it is wrong for crypto brokerage firms to tax themselves” and that government intervention in crypto markets is “not the proper, principled role of government.” Notably, even those connected to Trump’s crypto chief David Sacks have voiced their disapproval of the plan. Jason Calacanis, Sacks’ co-host on the influential “All-In” podcast, called the move an example of “Trump Pump” and “a crazy scam.” Meanwhile, Jeff Park, a strategist at Bitwise, a crypto index fund manager in which Sacks’ venture capital firm was an early investor, called Trump’s decision to include multiple cryptocurrencies “a huge political miscalculation.” *This is not investment advice.

Retail and institutional players reacted differently at several stages of the dip, with the latter making market-swinging sales. United States foreign policies also affected the market despite being tipped to spur market growth during Donald Trump’s second term. Bitcoin Whale Dump Large Holdings In the last 30 days, Bitcoin whales have transferred 60,000 BTC to exchanges, heightening sell pressure. This follows shaky weeks in U.S. tech stocks, sparking bear sentiments in crypto assets. Bitcoin price sank below $100K after the launch of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and has struggled to find its previous momentum. As confidence plummeted further with Trump’s new tariffs, whales began moving assets to prevent losses gained in previous months. Last year, institutional inflow and whale accumulations spiked the asset’s price above $100k with an expected run to $150K this year. These recent outflows have slowed mainstream adoption, lowering sentiments as seen in a drop in the fear and greed index. The mark reaction shows fear as multiple assets dipped below previous support levels. Bitcoin whales dominate the market, and huge sales for large groups result in a plunge in the fear and greed index. Centralized exchange and whale balances are closely monitored to determine the next market direction. Despite these bear factors, investors bought the dip looking for good entry positions ahead of a rebound. Crypto trader Ali Martinez pointed out that the wider market recorded $6 billion in capital inflows as holders set sights on recovery. Rebound Hinged On Spot Bitcoin ETFs The nosedive affected Bitcoin, altcoins, meme tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers. Declined volumes negatively impacted the market leading to a crash in crypto prices. The wider market capitalization dropped from $3.5 trillion to $3.1 trillion, wiping out billions. Bitcoin price trades at $97,746, down 4% in the last seven days while altcoins recorded higher exits. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs which have attracted over $40 billion, dominating the financial markets are a lifeline to BTC price. Institutional appetite is growing as on-chain metrics point upwards despite the status quo. Firms like Standard Chartered made higher projections expecting a massive run before the end of Trump’s second term.

One critic on X referred to THORChain’s response as “negligence at best, greed at worst.” While other protocols acted accordingly to stop the movement of stolen funds, THORChain validators did not take any meaningful action.

The sharp reversal aligned with a cautious mood among traders after Monday’s market rally following the ambitious plan, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted. Trump’s Sunday declaration that the reserve would include ADA, XRP and SOL, alongside bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) ignited a market frenzy, with ADA soaring over 60%, XRP climbing 33%, and SOL jumping 22% within hours. The promise of a government-backed crypto stockpile was hailed as a game-changer, with analysts predicting it could legitimize digital assets and drive institutional adoption. However, the rally proved short-lived amid profit-taking and a general risk-off mood in broader equity markets. “Trump's latest tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico, and China caused a massive selloff of crypto assets, completely reversing the previous day's crypto strategic reserve gains,” Kevin Guo, director of HashKey Research, said in a Telegram message. “Despite a slew of pro-crypto deregulation initiatives and supportive policies, investors view cryptocurrencies as risk assets strongly bound by the performance of the US equity market.” On Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff on the import of various items after Trump, doubled the tariff on imports from China to 20%. The U.S. President also confirmed that 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would be effective on Tuesday. Bitcoin is down 9% in the past 24 hours amid the macroeconomic chaos, trading at $84,000 as of Asian afternoon hours. Ether lost 12% and trades just above $2,000 — its lowest since 2023.

Regulatory Case Ends Without Penalties The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Kraken with prejudice, preventing the regulator from refiling the case in the future. The crypto exchange confirmed the development, stating that the case was dropped without any admission of wrongdoing, penalties, or required changes to its business operations. Kraken framed the SEC’s decision as a pivotal moment for the crypto industry in the United States, suggesting it signals the end of a politically driven crackdown that has hampered innovation and investment. The exchange expressed optimism about a more stable regulatory landscape moving forward. The announcement from Kraken added, “The SEC’s decision to dismiss its lawsuit against us (and many others) is more than just a legal victory—it’s a turning point for the future of crypto in the US. It ends a wasteful, politically motivated campaign, lifts uncertainty that stifled innovation and investment, and clears the path toward a stable, forward-thinking regulatory regime. Legal Battle and Regulatory Uncertainty The SEC initially sued Kraken in November 2023, accusing the platform of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency. The regulator alleged that Kraken facilitated the trading of crypto asset securities without proper registration, depriving investors of key protections such as audits, disclosures, and oversight. Kraken denied the allegations and countered that the SEC had not provided clear guidelines on whether digital assets should be classified as securities. The exchange filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing regulatory uncertainty and a lack of fair notice. While a federal judge allowed certain aspects of Kraken’s defense to proceed, the SEC continued to pursue its claims until now. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation Kraken acknowledged the role of the new leadership at the SEC and the White House in influencing the decision, suggesting a shift in regulatory priorities. The company credited what it described as “bold and thoughtful” leadership for fostering a new era of crypto innovation. Senior Advisor Marco Santori celebrated the outcome, stating, “We beat the SEC! Congratulations to the best legal team in crypto. Fighting—and beating—the SEC was not foretold. Lawyers, lobbyists, and everyone in between… We had to earn it.” SEC Cases Dropping like Flies The dismissal follows a series of dropped crypto-related enforcement actions by the SEC under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. The regulator recently abandoned cases against Gemini, Consensys, Robinhood, and Uniswap, while also agreeing to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice. With the SEC scaling back its aggressive stance against crypto firms, industry participants are hopeful that future regulatory efforts will provide clearer guidelines rather than rely on enforcement-driven approaches.

Mintoak, an Indian ecommerce startup that facilitates merchant payments, has acquired Digiledge in a deal worth around $3.5 million, marking the first acquisition in India’s CBDC area, Reuters, has learned , citing sources close to the matter. With Digiledge, which specializes in CBDC and bill payments, Mintoak’s partner banks — HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI — could offer payment solutions in e-rupee, India’s form of CBDC. With the acquisition, Mintoak CEO Raman Khanduja says the firm wants to make it “easier for merchant acquirers to grow and help more small and medium enterprises access digital tools and financial services.” You might also like: India’s CBDC platform hits 5m users 20 months after pilot launch India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, launched its e-rupee pilot in December 2022. Initially, only banks could use it, but the scope expanded to payment firms in April 2023. The e-rupee adoption has been sluggish, with the RBI reporting 1 million retail transactions by late June 2024, a milestone reached only after local banks introduced incentives and partially paid employee salaries using the state-issued digital currency. The RBI had previously urged banks to increase transactions to at least 1 million per day by late 2023 to test the system’s scalability. However, this push has since ceased, casting doubt on the future of the digital currency initiative due to the gap between incentivized metrics and actual user adoption.

In the last seven days, the Hedera price has experienced a surge of 17.5%. In the last hour alone, the market has grown by around 0.5%. Let’s analyse the scenario deeper. Nasdaq Files for Grayscale’s Hedera ETF It was on Monday that the Nasdaq filed the form with the US SEC to list and trade the spot HBAR ETF of Grayscale. For an ETF to be traded on a major stock exchange, the exchange needs SEC approval. Nasdaq files 19b-4 to list & trade Grayscale Hedera ETF (HBAR)… pic.twitter.com/lbuyymptU7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) March 3, 2025 A 19b-4 form is a key regulatory document that facilitates the introduction of new investment products like ETFs into the stock market. As soon as the SEC acknowledges the filing, the regulator beings the approval process. For this reason, the filing is a crucial step in the process. HBAR’s Strong ETF Approval Chances It was not the first time that the Nasdaq approached the SEC to seek its approval to list and trade a spot Hedera ETF. Earlier, a 19b-4 form was submitted to the US SEC for the spot HBAR ETF of Canary Capital. Importantly, renowned ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently predicted that Hedera and Litecoin ETFs have the best chance of winning the approval of the SEC compared to other Altcoin ETFs. Hedera: Everything One Should Know Simply put, Hedera is a public network where anyone can build and use applications. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses a technology called “hashgraph.” This technology is designed to be faster, more secure, and more efficient than many blockchain systems. According to Jonathan Dotan , the founder of EQTYLAB, “Hedera’s enterprise-grade infrastructure, backed by a Council of global leaders like Dell Technologies, sets it apart from other blockchains by providing the scalability and security essential for bringing Verifiable Compute to market. Its visionary leadership team has long shaped the network to meet real-world business needs, positioning it as a trusted platform for enterprise adoption.” HBAR Price Reaction In the last 30 days, the Hedera market has seen a drop of 18.7%. However, in the last seven days, it has experienced a rise of 17.5%. In the last one hour alone, the market has surged by over 0.5%. The total market cap of HBAR is $9,543,646,221. Its 24-hour trading volume stands at $756,217,012. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ETH prices crashed to their lowest levels in 16 months, plunging 15% to $2,035 during early trading in Asia on Tuesday morning. The last time ETH traded below $2,000 was in November 2023, as the asset was slowly thawing from crypto winter. Ethereum has now returned to bear market levels and has dumped 50% since it tapped $4,000 in early December 2024. ETH Death Predicted Analyst ‘Nebraskangooner’ looked at the monthly timeframe chart and identified a double-top formation before predicting that prices would break down to the $1,200 level. This would send ETH back to bear market lows from late 2022 when it bottomed out at around $1,100. $ETH Monthly double top confirmed.

Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio, or price of ether in terms of bitcoin, fell to a five-year low of 0.024 this week as the asset tanked. #Ethereum – The key level to watch is the 200 weekly (black line). We need to close back above that like we did last week. Expect lots of manipulation and volatility. pic.twitter.com/aIskRebYqV — Anonymous | Crypto Predictions (@Crypto_Twittier) March 4, 2025 Flight to Risk-Off Many were questioning why crypto was crashing in such a bullish environment in the United States following years of being persecuted under the Biden administration. The Kobeissi Letter explained that the real driver here is the global move towards the risk-off trade and assets. “As trade war tensions rise and economic policy uncertainty broadens, ALL risky assets are falling. This was seen in stocks, crypto and oil prices, which all fell sharply today.” Moreover, Bitcoin is no longer seen as a store of value, having decoupled from gold, which hit an all-time high in late February. When Bitcoin falls, the digital lemmings follow, and Ethereum has been the first off the cliff. What is happening with crypto? Crypto markets are now worth -$100 billion LESS than they were prior to the US Crypto Reserve announcement. Over the last 24 hours, crypto has erased -$500 BILLION of market cap in a massive reversal. Here’s what you need to know.

It currently appears strong, but the next direction remains unknown while bearish. As expected, Bitcoin’s price collapsed last week following a strong breakthrough at the crucial $90k level, which has been standing as support for more than three months. It tested $78.2k with a long wick and closed that week’s price well above the lost crucial support. The collapse started after losing grip above the $95k level, but the price interestingly retested that level during yesterday’s surge – completing a break and retest pattern. The level was rejected, and the price dropped to around $93.6k at the time of writing. Retaking the rejected high with a surge could fuel more buying towards the $100k mark. This could signal a trend shift on the daily chart. But looking at the market, there’s no conviction for a shift yet following the latest price rejection. Of course, Bitcoin’s downtrend is still in play on the daily chart, but things are likely to change if the price stays well above the recent low. Otherwise, it may experience more dips in the coming days. Currently, it is gaining traction on the day. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Marking the $95k level as resistance since last weekend, a push above it should advance recovery to $99,550. The $103,278 level is the next resistance to watch, followed by the $109,588 resistance. Towards the downside, the $91k level is providing support along with $85k and $80k. If the price collapses through these levels to reclaim last week’s $78,258 low, the next drop may surface at $71k. Key Resistance Levels: $99,550, $103,278, $109,588 Key Support Levels: $91,000, $85,000, $80,000 Spot Price: $93,615 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It has seen a major recovery following a bounce back but is now losing steam. Ethereum has continued to mirror Bitcoin’s weekly movement but has failed to break below its critical $2,100 level, which has been providing support for the past four months. Respecting this critical level again, it bounced and recovered nicely to where it’s changing hands at around $2,378. The $2,550 level has posted a threat to the buyers in the past hours and is now holding it as resistance. A surge above it could trigger more increases in the coming days. Although it has formed a double-top pattern on the weekly chart, the price may crash soon. The potential target level for such a crash is $1,650. As soon as the price touches this level, a major bounceback is expected. The only condition for a bullish move right now is holding the critical support level. If it continues to strengthen, we may see a strong rally above the important $3k level before considering a reversal. While the trend is still in favour of the bears, they appear set for another rally. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential support levels for selling right now are $2,310 and $2,076. If the price breaks lower, $1,900 and $1,700 are the next support levels to consider for a test. In case of a reversal, ETH must retake a lot of resistance on the way up. For now, the close resistance level to watch for a test is $2,550 and $2,700. Higher resistance levels to keep in mind are $2,920 and $3,213. Key Resistance Levels: $2,550, $2,920, $3,213 Key Support Levels: $2,310, $2,076, $1,900 Spot Price: $2,378 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

China introduced tariffs on US goods and other trade measures on Tuesday in response to US President Donald Trump’s move to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.34% to close at 37,331, while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.71% to 2,710 on Tuesday, erasing gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 149 per dollar on Tuesday, approaching a five-month-high. Japan’s unemployment rate was at 2.5% in January 2025, slightly above market estimates and December's readings of 2.4%. Japanese companies reduced capital spending on plant and equipment by 0.2% year-on-year in Q4 of 2024, missing market expectations of a 4.9% increase and swinging from the strongest growth in three quarters of 8.1% in Q3. The consumer confidence index in Japan unexpectedly declined to 35.0 in February 2025, down from 35.2 in the previous month, below market expectations of 35.7. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.25% closing at 3,324, while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.28% to 10,679 on Tuesday, recovering earlier losses as investors assessed the impact of new tariffs , and the offshore yuan strengthened around 7.28 per dollar. The Trump administration's additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods took effect today, raising total US tariffs on China to 20%. In response, Beijing immediately announced new tariffs of 10%-15% on certain US imports, set to take effect on March 10, and imposed export restrictions on US firms. This new tariffs coincide with the start of a key annual political meeting in China this week. The country is anticipated to roll out fresh stimulus measures to help its economy withstand the impact of the increased tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.44% to 22,631 in the Tuesday morning session, following modest gains in the prior day. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.19% to 72,846 in morning trade on Tuesday, retreating for the third straight session and staying at their lowest level since early June 2024 amid losses in the tech sector, consumer goods, auto, and pharmaceuticals. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.58% to close at 8,189 on Tuesday, nearing its lowest level in two months. The Australian dollar slipped to around $0.62 on Tuesday, nearing a one-month low, after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s February meeting revealed that policymakers were focused on downside risks to the economy, signaling a more dovish stance. Retail sales in Australia increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January 2025, shifting from a 0.1% decline in the previous month and matching market expectations. Australia's current account deficit declined to AUD 12.5 billion in Q4 2024 from a downwardly revised AUD 13.9 billion shortfall in Q3. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended in red prompted by US President Trump’s confirmation that tariffs on key trading partners would take effect today.

Meanwhile, the markets dropped as President Trump confirmed the start of 25% tariffs on Canada & Mexico. While Bitcoin plunged below $84,000 and is struggling to regain the lost momentum, Pi Network is displaying decent strength. The PI price has been trying very hard to keep up the momentum since the early trading hours. What’s next? Will Pi price reclaim $2 this month? Soon after the launch, the PI price spiked high to mark highs close to $3 but failed to surpass the range. Currently, the token has surpassed Hedera and reached the 11th spot of the crypto rankings, which suggests it could be the next big thing in the markets. The price has sustained a notable bullish trend despite the ongoing market crash. Therefore, the price is now believed to reclaim the lost levels and close the quarterly trade on a bullish note. As seen in the above chart, the PI price broke out from the falling wedge in the short term but has yet to validate the upswing. After experiencing massive volatility, the volatility has squeezed as the Bollinger Bands have contracted well. Besides, the stochastic RSI has reached the overbought zone, which suggests that a temporary pullback could be on the horizon. Meanwhile, the local support zone, between $1.6 and $1.62, could offer a strong base, which may trigger a strong rebound to the upper resistance around $1.92. Regardless of the growing strength and potential to surpass the giants, the Pi Network is yet to get listed on Binance. In the times when the newly launched memecoins get listed within minutes, this delay could have a negative impact on the token, instigating a huge whale sell-off.

This reflects a growing belief in regulatory acceptance of crypto-based investment vehicles. However, approval remains uncertain, and the SEC’s final decision could still sway either way. Dogecoin Price Drops Despite ETF Hype Despite the growing optimism, DOGE has plunged over 15%, dropping to $0.19 amid broader market volatility. The trading volume has also dropped 16.80%, indicating weaker market activity. This decline came after the excitement surrounding Donald Trump’s crypto reserve announcement, which briefly boosted sentiment.

Lately, the chatter has been all about Bitcoin’s resurgence, leaving many wondering about the fate of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal, and it’s time to pay attention. According to CoinMarketCap (CMC), this crucial metric currently sits at a low 16, unchanged from yesterday, as of March 4th, 00:35 UTC. But what exactly does this number mean, and how should it influence your crypto strategy? Let’s dive deep into understanding the nuances of the Altcoin Season Index and what it signals for the current crypto market . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Weather Vane Think of the Altcoin Season Index as a weather vane for the cryptocurrency market. Instead of predicting rain or sunshine, it forecasts whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. This index, meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap , offers a data-driven perspective on market sentiment beyond just price fluctuations. It cuts through the noise and provides a clear, quantifiable measure of market trends. Here’s a breakdown of what makes up the Altcoin Season Index: Scope: It analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure representation of market dynamics. Timeframe: The index evaluates the performance of these cryptocurrencies over the past 90 days, offering a medium-term perspective that smooths out short-term volatility. Benchmark: Bitcoin (BTC) is the benchmark. The index compares the 90-day performance of each of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during the same period. Scoring: The index ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger ‘Altcoin Season’, while a lower score suggests a ‘Bitcoin Season’. To truly grasp its significance, let’s understand the thresholds that define Altcoin and Bitcoin Seasons. Decoding Bitcoin Season: What Does an Index of 16 Really Mean? With the Altcoin Season Index currently at 16, the message is unambiguous: we are in a Bitcoin Season . But what does this practically entail for investors and the broader crypto market ? The index operates on a simple yet powerful principle: Season Index Score Condition Market Characteristic Altcoin Season 75 or higher At least 75% of the top 100 coins outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Altcoins are generally experiencing higher gains than Bitcoin. Capital often flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher percentage returns. Bitcoin Season 25 or lower 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Bitcoin is generally outperforming altcoins. Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven in the crypto space. An index score of 16 firmly places us in Bitcoin Season territory. This means that over the past 90 days, a vast majority (more than 75%) of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have underperformed Bitcoin. Only a small fraction, 25% or less, have managed to outshine the original cryptocurrency. This dominance of Bitcoin has significant implications for the entire crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Strategies and Considerations So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to a Bitcoin Season ? Understanding the dynamics of this market phase is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are some key considerations: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin Season often coincides with increased Bitcoin dominance. This means Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows at a faster rate than the rest of the market, or it declines less during downturns. Keep an eye on Bitcoin dominance charts to gauge the strength of this trend. Altcoin Performance: While it’s called ‘Bitcoin Season’, it doesn’t mean all altcoins will necessarily decline in price. However, their growth may be slower and potentially more volatile compared to Bitcoin. Selectivity is key. Research and focus on fundamentally strong altcoins that can weather the Bitcoin-centric market. Risk Assessment: Bitcoin is generally perceived as less risky than altcoins . During Bitcoin Season, investors often gravitate towards Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven’ within the volatile crypto space. Consider adjusting your portfolio risk profile based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Trading Strategies: Traders might consider strategies that capitalize on Bitcoin’s strength, such as longing Bitcoin or Bitcoin-paired trading. For altcoin enthusiasts, identifying oversold altcoins with strong fundamentals could present buying opportunities, but caution and thorough research are paramount. Long-Term Perspective: Market seasons are cyclical. Bitcoin Season might be followed by an Altcoin Season, and vice versa. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on short-term market trends. Maintain a long-term perspective and focus on the fundamental value of your crypto investments. CoinMarketCap: Your Reliable Source for Market Intelligence Platforms like CoinMarketCap are indispensable tools for navigating the complexities of the crypto market . The Altcoin Season Index is just one of the many valuable metrics CMC provides to empower investors with data-driven insights. Here’s how CoinMarketCap can enhance your crypto journey: Real-time Data: Access up-to-the-minute price data, market capitalization, trading volume, and other crucial metrics for thousands of cryptocurrencies. Market Analysis Tools: Utilize tools like the Altcoin Season Index, dominance charts, and historical data to analyze market trends and identify potential opportunities and risks. Comprehensive Information: Explore detailed information about each cryptocurrency, including project descriptions, team details, tokenomics, and community links. Portfolio Tracking: Monitor your crypto holdings and track your portfolio performance directly on the platform. Educational Resources: Access a wealth of educational content, including articles, guides, and videos, to enhance your understanding of the crypto space. By leveraging the resources offered by CoinMarketCap and similar platforms, you can stay informed, make smarter investment decisions, and navigate the ever-evolving crypto market with greater confidence. Embrace the Season: Adapting to Market Cycles The Altcoin Season Index at 16 is a clear indicator: Bitcoin is currently leading the charge in the crypto market . While this might mean a period of relatively slower growth for altcoins in general, it’s crucial to remember that market seasons are cyclical. Understanding these cycles, utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index from CoinMarketCap , and adapting your strategies accordingly are key to long-term success in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investing. Don’t fear the Bitcoin Season ; instead, see it as an opportunity to reassess, strategize, and position yourself for the next shift in market winds.

The latest Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is flashing red, signaling a significant downturn in market sentiment. For those watching the volatile crypto markets, the shift is palpable. The index, a key metric for gauging investor emotions, has taken a dramatic dive, plunging 18 points to land at a chilling 15. This nosedive propels us from the already cautious “Fear” territory directly into the dreaded “Extreme Fear” zone. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio, and how should you navigate these turbulent times? Let’s delve into the details. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a creation of Alternative.me, is designed to quantify the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a mood ring for crypto investors. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0: Extreme Fear – Signaling a potential buying opportunity, or a sign of further decline? 100: Extreme Greed – Often precedes market corrections, indicating a possible bubble. Currently sitting at 15, the index screams “Extreme Fear.” But what factors contribute to this reading? The index isn’t based on guesswork; it’s a data-driven analysis incorporating six key metrics, each weighted to reflect its influence on market sentiment: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can breed fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume against the 30-day and 90-day averages. Weak momentum and low volume can indicate a lack of investor confidence. Social Media 15% Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. Dominance of negative sentiment fuels fear. Surveys 15% (Currently paused) Previously involved weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during fearful times, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for crypto-related search queries. A spike in searches like “Bitcoin crash” often correlates with market fear. Why is the Crypto Market Sentiment So Fearful Right Now? Several factors could be contributing to the current Extreme Fear in the crypto market . While the provided data doesn’t specify the exact reasons for this sudden 18-point drop, we can consider common drivers of fear in the crypto space: Geopolitical Instability: Global events, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine or rising inflation fears, can trigger widespread market uncertainty and risk aversion, impacting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Concerns about stricter regulations or potential crackdowns on the crypto industry by governments worldwide can induce significant fear among investors. Market Corrections and Liquidations: Significant price drops, like the one seemingly triggering this “Extreme Fear” reading, can lead to cascading liquidations, further amplifying negative sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: Rising interest rates, inflation, and fears of recession in major economies can all contribute to a risk-off environment, pushing investors away from volatile assets like crypto. It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects collective investor emotions, which can be highly reactive and sometimes irrational. However, understanding these emotions can provide valuable insights into potential market movements. Navigating ‘Extreme Fear’: What Should Crypto Investors Do? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes “Extreme Fear,” it’s natural to feel uneasy. However, seasoned crypto investors often view periods of extreme fear as potential opportunities. Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Benefits of ‘Extreme Fear’ Buying Opportunity? : Contrarian investors often see extreme fear as a signal to buy. When fear is rampant, asset prices can be driven down to undervalued levels, presenting potential entry points for long-term investors. The adage “buy when there’s blood in the streets” comes to mind. Market Reset: Extreme fear can purge the market of speculative excesses and unsustainable hype, paving the way for healthier, more sustainable growth in the long run. Challenges and Risks of ‘Extreme Fear’ Further Downturns: Extreme fear can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Panic selling can exacerbate price drops, leading to further declines. It’s impossible to predict the absolute bottom. Emotional Decision Making: Fear can lead to impulsive decisions, such as selling assets at a loss out of panic. It’s crucial to avoid emotionally driven trading. Increased Volatility: Periods of extreme fear are often accompanied by heightened volatility, making it a risky environment for inexperienced traders. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors During ‘Extreme Fear’ Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Is your portfolio positioned to weather potential further downturns? Consider rebalancing if necessary. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t make impulsive decisions based on fear. Instead, double down on your research. Understand the projects you’ve invested in and their long-term potential. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider using dollar-cost averaging to gradually buy into your chosen cryptocurrencies over time. This strategy can mitigate the risk of buying at the absolute peak or trough. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Keep abreast of market developments, but be wary of fear-mongering headlines and social media hype. Focus on credible news sources and fundamental analysis. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, view periods of extreme fear as temporary setbacks and potential long-term opportunities. Cryptocurrency Analysis : Is ‘Extreme Fear’ a Buying Signal? The million-dollar question: Is this Extreme Fear a screaming buy signal? Historically, periods of extreme fear in the crypto market have often been followed by market rebounds. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Ultimately, whether “Extreme Fear” represents a buying opportunity depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook on the crypto market . It’s a time for caution, careful cryptocurrency analysis , and strategic decision-making, not panic. Conclusion: Navigating the Fearful Crypto Seas The sharp drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to “Extreme Fear” is a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While fear can be unsettling, understanding its drivers and potential implications is crucial for informed decision-making. By staying calm, conducting thorough research, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these fearful times and potentially capitalize on opportunities that may arise. Remember, market sentiment is cyclical; fear eventually gives way to greed, and vice versa. The key is to be prepared and informed, regardless of the prevailing market mood.

However, the momentum appears to have faded, as evidenced by the ongoing retreat in the asset’s price. So, let’s explore the current accumulation trend and see what lies ahead for the crypto. XRP News: Ripple Whales Buy 1 Bln Coin Ripple whales have once again made headlines in the XRP news column with their latest buying trend. Renowned market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the trend , indicating the renewed interest of the market participants towards the asset. For context, Martinez said that whales or large investors have purchased nearly 1 billion coins from yesterday, as the price soared more than 25% nearing the $3 mark. However, despite the massive XRP whale accumulation, the momentum was short-lived. Source: Ali Martinez, X XRP Price Slips: Here’s Why XRP price today was down 13% to $2.31, with its trading volume falling 30% to $13.9 billion. Notably, the 24-hour high and low of the asset were recorded at $2.23 and $2.7, respectively. Further, XRP Futures Open Interest fell 23% to $3.16 billion, indicating a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. It appears that despite XRP whales’ heavy buying, investors grew concerned over the future of the market. Besides, it also comes amid a broader digital assets selloff, with the crypto market facing liquidation of over $1 billion since yesterday. Why Is Crypto Market Falling? The current crypto market crash could be due to Trump tariffs going into effect on Mexico and Canada. This event, alongside other macroeconomic woes, has weighed on the investors’ sentiment, causing a massive selloff in the market. In addition, the impact of the recent announcement from Donald Trump regarding the US Crypto Reserve was also short-lived. While it initially caused a massive spike in prices, some investors might take the opportunity to book profit, triggering the selling pressure in the market. What’s Next For The Crypto? The recent decline in XRP could also be attributed to the delay in Ripple Vs SEC case resolution. While Trump’s announcement to add XRP to the US Reserve asset sparked hopes, legal experts have refuted claims of the development’s impact in speeding up the XRP lawsuit resolution . As the XRP price slipped to the $2.3 level, experts highlighted key support levels for the asset. For context, Rose Premium Signals said that in a bearish case, holding the $2.40 level is key. Breaking below this level could drag down the price to below $2. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Echoing a similar sentiment, EGRAG CRYPTO said that the crypto is likely to retest the $2.3 and $2.2 mark. However, Ripple’s coin holds key support at $2.2, which could help in a strong recovery ahead. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Having said that, the crypto must hold the $2.2 mark to witness a strong recovery ahead. While experts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin, some have warned of a potential crash to below $2 if the bears continue to dominate.

This news, delivered via an X (formerly Twitter) announcement, marks a significant moment of relief for the NFT community and signals potential shifts in the regulatory landscape for digital collectibles. But what exactly does this mean for the future of NFTs and the broader crypto space? Let’s dive into the details of this landmark decision and explore its implications. Why is the End of the SEC Probe into Yuga Labs a Big Deal for Bored Ape NFTs? The conclusion of the SEC probe Yuga Labs faced is more than just a corporate victory; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire NFT ecosystem, especially for prominent collections like Bored Ape NFTs . Since October 2022, when reports first surfaced about the SEC’s inquiry, the shadow of regulatory uncertainty has loomed over Yuga Labs and the broader NFT market. The investigation’s closure brings a sense of clarity and reduces the immediate fear of enforcement actions that could have stifled innovation and growth. Here’s why this development is particularly noteworthy: Validation for NFTs: The SEC’s decision to close the investigation without any enforcement action can be interpreted as a form of implicit validation for the NFT asset class, at least in the context of Yuga Labs’ operations. Boost in Investor Confidence: The resolution of regulatory uncertainty often leads to increased investor confidence. We might see renewed interest and investment in Bored Ape NFTs and other blue-chip NFT collections as the overhang of potential SEC action is removed. Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, this closure could set a precedent for how the SEC approaches other NFT projects. It might suggest a more nuanced approach than initially feared by many in the crypto space. Focus on Innovation: With the legal cloud lifted, Yuga Labs can now fully refocus on innovation and expansion within the metaverse and NFT space, potentially accelerating developments for BAYC and their other projects. What Was the Focus of the Yuga Labs Investigation? While the specifics of the Yuga Labs investigation were never officially disclosed by the SEC, reports indicated that the inquiry centered around whether certain NFTs offered by Yuga Labs, and the distribution of ApeCoin, constituted unregistered securities offerings. This is a critical question that has been hanging over the NFT space as regulators grapple with how to classify and regulate these novel digital assets. The SEC’s scrutiny likely revolved around: Security vs. Collectible: Determining if Bored Ape NFTs and ApeCoin were being marketed and sold in a way that resembled investment contracts, thus falling under securities laws, or if they were legitimately collectibles. Utility and Promises: Examining the utility promised or implied for these assets and whether Yuga Labs’ actions constituted an “investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,” a key aspect of the Howey Test used to define securities. Secondary Market Activity: While Yuga Labs does not control the secondary market, the SEC may have been interested in how the secondary market dynamics and price appreciation of Bored Ape NFTs influenced investor perceptions. Crypto SEC Cases: A Trend of Resolution? The closure of the Crypto SEC cases against Yuga Labs is not an isolated incident. As mentioned, the SEC has recently resolved investigations or reached settlements with several prominent crypto firms, including Robinhood, Gemini, UniSwap Labs, MetaMask, OpenSea, Coinbase, and Kraken. This pattern raises questions about the SEC’s evolving approach to crypto regulation. Is the SEC softening its stance, or is this a strategic shift? Here are a few potential interpretations: Interpretation Possible Reasoning Strategic Focus Shift The SEC may be prioritizing enforcement actions against more egregious cases of fraud or clear violations, while taking a more measured approach to projects that operate in the gray areas of regulation, like NFTs. Resource Allocation The SEC might be re-allocating resources, focusing on areas they deem higher priority or where they believe they have stronger legal footing. Investigations are resource-intensive, and closures could reflect strategic prioritization. Legal Challenges and Setbacks The SEC has faced legal challenges in some of its crypto enforcement actions. These closures might indicate a recalibration based on legal realities and a desire to pursue cases with a higher likelihood of success in court. Dialogue and Engagement Perhaps these closures represent a move towards more dialogue and engagement with the crypto industry to establish clearer regulatory frameworks, rather than solely relying on enforcement actions. Navigating NFT Regulation: What’s Next? While the end of the NFT regulation probe into Yuga Labs is undoubtedly positive news, it doesn’t mean the NFT space is entirely out of the regulatory woods. Clarity on NFT regulation remains a crucial need for the industry to thrive sustainably. Here’s what to consider moving forward: Continued Regulatory Scrutiny: NFT projects should still expect regulatory scrutiny. The SEC and other agencies are likely to continue monitoring the space and may initiate future investigations. Importance of Compliance: NFT projects should prioritize legal compliance, seeking advice to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. This includes understanding securities laws, intellectual property rights, and consumer protection regulations. Industry Self-Regulation: The NFT industry itself can play a role in shaping its regulatory future. Developing best practices, promoting transparency, and engaging in constructive dialogue with regulators can help foster a more favorable regulatory environment. Global Regulatory Landscape: NFT regulation is not just a U.S. issue. Projects need to be aware of and compliant with regulations in different jurisdictions as the global regulatory landscape for digital assets evolves. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air for NFTs and the Metaverse The SEC concluding its investigation into Yuga Labs without any charges is undeniably a significant victory for the company and a breath of fresh air for the NFT community. It signals a potential shift in the regulatory climate and provides a much-needed dose of optimism. While the long-term regulatory framework for NFTs is still being shaped, this development offers a moment to celebrate progress and look forward to continued innovation in the exciting world of digital collectibles and the metaverse. It underscores the resilience and dynamism of the crypto space and its ability to navigate and overcome regulatory hurdles.

With Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs already in place, and Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) expected to follow, attention has now turned to other potential candidates. Here are the possible altcoins next to be added to the crypto reserve. Next Token To Add in Crypto Reserve A recent tweet post by CryptoRank highlights a list of altcoins currently awaiting ETF launches.

Dogecoin (DOGE), with a massive $32.4 billion market cap, stands out as a strong contender. Given its popularity and links to prominent figures like Elon Musk, it wouldn’t be surprising if it finds favor in Trump’s strategy with a possibility of Dogecoin ETF getting approval soon. Hedera (HBAR) and Chainlink (LINK), both valued at $10.4 billion, could also be appealing due to their blockchain infrastructure capabilities, which align with national security and financial interests. Litecoin, which was created as a faster alternative to Bitcoin in 2011, is closer to getting SEC approval for a spot Litecoin ETF. Experts believe there is a 90% chance it will be approved by the end of the year. Apart from all Avalanche, Polkadot & Aptos with market caps of $9.6 billion, $7.52 billion, and $3.74 billion, respectively also have strong foundations. These tokens could be next in Trump’s crypto reserves, helping shape the future of U.S. digital assets. Trump’s Crypto Strategy Perhaps CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently expressed concerns that the U.S. is using crypto as a tool for economic dominance. His remarks suggest that the Trump administration’s stance prioritizes digital assets that serve national interests while leaving others unprotected. Trump’s selective support for certain assets has sparked debates about whether crypto is becoming more centralized under political influence.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-in-local-distribution-phase-heres-the-significance/,"Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently noted that XRP whales have been offloading their holdings at unprecedented levels. In a post on X, Deutscher stated that large holders have been “aggressively selling” since the asset’s price surged by over 500% from November. He described the current market behavior as a local distribution phase, indicating that whales are taking profits following the substantial rally. Deutscher also attached a chart highlighting significant selling activity among whales. This pattern suggests a shift in market sentiment, as large-scale distributions typically indicate that investors who accumulated XRP earlier are now selling. The implications of such activity could influence both short-term price movement and broader market trends. $XRP whales are unloading at record levels! Large holders have been aggressively selling since the price rallied over 500% from November. $XRP seems to be in a local distribution phase right now. pic.twitter.com/NgaOoiZkWX — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 3, 2025 XRP’s Remarkable Run In late 2024, XRP began a remarkable run triggered by Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement . The asset rose from around $0.55 in early November, to a multi-year high of $3.39 in January 2025, marking a 516.4% increase. Contrasting Whale Behavior Despite the widespread selling reported by Deutscher, other recent whale movements provide a more complex picture. Some large investors accumulate tokens amid the sell-offs, signaling confidence in the asset. For example, a recent report highlighted that whales had acquired 1 billion XRP during a price dip. In another instance, a single entity purchased 65 million XRP , reinforcing the idea that not all major holders engage in the sell-off. These acquisitions contrast with the broader trend identified by Deutscher and suggest that while some whales are exiting, others see an opportunity to accumulate anticipating further gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for XRP? The significant movement of tokens by whales extends beyond buying and selling on the open market. Recent blockchain data reveals that Ripple and major holders moved 490 million XRP within 24 hours. Another report pointed out that 520 million XRP had been acquired by whales, further complicating the market outlook. Increased whale activities can impact liquidity, volatility, and overall market sentiment, making them critical indicators for traders and investors monitoring the asset’s trajectory. Deutscher’s observation that XRP is in a local distribution phase aligns with broader market trends where large holders capitalize on price surges to take profits. However, the mixed activity among whales indicates that while some major holders are liquidating their positions, these purchases suggest that other investors view the current price levels as a strategic entry point. At press time, XRP traded at $2.6 after a notable surge caused by Donald Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve including XRP. It will be intriguing to see how the whales react to this development. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

41136693,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136499,1741074786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing: IMF’s Strict Bitcoin Conditions for El Salvador’s $1.4B Loan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/imf-loan-el-salvador-bitcoin/,"In a move that has the crypto world buzzing, El Salvador’s pursuit of a substantial $1.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has come with strings attached – and these strings are tightly wound around Bitcoin . Yes, you heard it right. The IMF is laying down some serious ground rules regarding El Salvador’s favorite cryptocurrency, demanding significant changes to its Bitcoin strategy as a condition for financial assistance. Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating development and what it means for El Salvador and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the IMF imposing strict conditions on El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption? The IMF’s concerns aren’t exactly new. Since El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, the international financial institution has voiced worries about the risks associated with cryptocurrency adoption, particularly its volatility and potential impact on financial stability. For a nation seeking a massive IMF loan to bolster its economy, these concerns have now translated into concrete demands. The core issue? The IMF wants to ensure that public funds are managed responsibly and that the risks associated with Bitcoin are mitigated. Here’s a breakdown of the key conditions El Salvador must meet to secure the IMF loan : Phasing out Public Involvement in Chivo Wallet: By July 2025, El Salvador must cease all public sector engagement with the state-run Chivo wallet. This means no more government funds can be used to support or operate the Chivo wallet. Ending State Funding for Chivo: Following the previous point, the government must completely stop using state resources to finance the Chivo wallet by the specified deadline. Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN (Bitcoin Trust Fund): The controversial Bitcoin Trust Fund, FIDEBITCOIN, is required to be dissolved. This fund was set up to facilitate the conversion of USD to Bitcoin and vice versa when Bitcoin became legal tender. Audited Financial Reports: El Salvador must release fully audited financial reports for FIDEBITCOIN, providing transparency into the fund’s operations and financial status before its dissolution. Implementing a Bitcoin Holdings Management Framework: The government needs to establish a robust framework for managing its Bitcoin holdings. This includes clear policies and procedures for acquisition, storage, and potential sale of Bitcoin . Disclosing Wallet Addresses to the IMF: Transparency is paramount. El Salvador is mandated to disclose all its Bitcoin hot and cold wallet addresses to the IMF. This level of scrutiny is unprecedented in traditional financial agreements. Regular IMF Reviews: Compliance isn’t a one-time event. The IMF will conduct regular reviews until 2025 to monitor El Salvador’s adherence to these Bitcoin -related conditions. What are the potential benefits of these strict cryptocurrency regulations for El Salvador? While these conditions might seem restrictive, they could bring some unexpected benefits to El Salvador. Let’s explore the potential silver linings: Enhanced Financial Stability: By reducing public exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility, El Salvador could achieve greater financial stability. The IMF’s conditions aim to insulate public funds from the unpredictable nature of the Bitcoin market. Improved Investor Confidence: Adhering to international financial standards and demonstrating fiscal responsibility can boost investor confidence in El Salvador. This could attract foreign investment beyond just the crypto sector. Greater Transparency and Accountability: The requirements for audited reports and disclosure of wallet addresses promote transparency and accountability in the management of public funds related to Bitcoin . This can build trust with both international partners and Salvadoran citizens. Streamlined Financial Operations: Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN and phasing out the Chivo wallet could streamline government financial operations, removing complexities and potential inefficiencies associated with managing a parallel Bitcoin system. Securing the Crucial IMF Loan: Ultimately, compliance unlocks access to the $1.4 billion IMF loan , which is vital for El Salvador’s economic stability and development. This financial injection can support crucial public services and infrastructure projects. What challenges does El Salvador face in complying with IMF’s Bitcoin demands? Navigating these cryptocurrency regulation demands from the IMF won’t be a walk in the park for El Salvador. Significant hurdles lie ahead: Political Resistance: Bitcoin adoption is a flagship policy of President Bukele’s administration. Scaling back public involvement in Bitcoin could face political resistance from within the government and among staunch Bitcoin supporters. Technical Complexity: Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN, auditing its finances, and establishing a new Bitcoin management framework are technically complex tasks. El Salvador will need expertise and resources to execute these changes effectively and transparently. Public Perception and Chivo Wallet Users: The Chivo wallet has been widely adopted in El Salvador. Phasing out public support might lead to confusion and dissatisfaction among users who rely on it for transactions and Bitcoin access. Managing public perception during this transition will be critical. Economic Impact of Bitcoin Policy Reversal: While intended to enhance stability, a perceived reversal of Bitcoin policy could have unforeseen economic consequences, potentially impacting tourism and businesses that have embraced Bitcoin . Meeting Tight Deadlines: The July 2025 deadline for many of these conditions is relatively tight. El Salvador will need to act swiftly and decisively to meet these requirements within the given timeframe. Examples of other countries and cryptocurrency regulation El Salvador isn’t alone in grappling with cryptocurrency regulation . Many countries are navigating the complexities of digital assets, each with different approaches: Country Regulatory Approach Key Features United States Fragmented, evolving Multiple agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN) involved, focus on investor protection and anti-money laundering, ongoing debate about classification of cryptocurrencies. European Union MiCA Regulation Comprehensive framework for crypto-asset markets, aiming for harmonization across member states, covers issuers, service providers, and consumer protection. Singapore Pro-innovation, risk-based Supportive of blockchain technology and crypto innovation, but with strict AML/CFT regulations, licensing regime for crypto service providers. China Strictly Regulated, Centralized Digital Currency Banned cryptocurrency trading and mining, focuses on developing its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY. These examples highlight the diverse approaches governments are taking. El Salvador’s situation is unique due to its adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, making the IMF loan conditions particularly significant. Actionable Insights: What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin in El Salvador? The IMF loan conditions signal a significant shift in El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. While Bitcoin remains legal tender, the government’s direct involvement is being curtailed. Here are some actionable insights: Decentralization of Bitcoin in El Salvador: The IMF conditions push for a more decentralized approach to Bitcoin in El Salvador. Reduced government involvement could foster a more organic and community-driven Bitcoin ecosystem. Focus on Private Sector Bitcoin Adoption: With the state stepping back from Chivo, the onus will be on the private sector to drive Bitcoin adoption. Businesses and individuals will need to innovate and create solutions for Bitcoin usage. Increased Scrutiny on Bitcoin Adoption Globally: The IMF’s stance on El Salvador will likely influence how other international institutions and governments view Bitcoin adoption. It sets a precedent for conditional financial assistance related to cryptocurrency policies. Potential for a More Sustainable Bitcoin Ecosystem: By addressing concerns about financial stability and transparency, El Salvador could potentially build a more sustainable and resilient Bitcoin ecosystem in the long run, even if it looks different from the initial vision. Conclusion: A pivotal moment for Bitcoin and El Salvador El Salvador’s journey with Bitcoin has reached a pivotal moment. The IMF loan conditions represent a significant course correction, demanding greater fiscal prudence and transparency in its Bitcoin strategy. While challenges undoubtedly exist, these changes also present opportunities for a more mature and sustainable integration of Bitcoin into El Salvador’s economy. The world will be watching closely to see how El Salvador navigates these new conditions and what it means for the future of Bitcoin adoption globally. This episode serves as a stark reminder that even revolutionary financial technologies must operate within the bounds of sound economic principles and international financial norms.

Shiba Inu, FloppyPepe, and Pepe are top crypto tokens with the potential to grow from $20k to $1 million within a short period of time. Table of Contents FloppyPepe, the million-dollar crypto token Pepe gears for another major pump Shiba Inu works to revive winning ways Final thoughts Turning $20k to $1 million within a short period isn’t uncommon in the crypto world. In 2025, investors can make this happen by investing in some crypto tokens. Based on their potential, Shiba Inu (SHIB), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Pepe (PEPE) can surge massively, turning a $20k portfolio into a million-dollar bag. FloppyPepe, the million-dollar crypto token When Shiba Inu and Pepe first hit the market, these crypto tokens skyrocketed in value and made early investors millions. In 2025, FloppyPepe is hoping to do the same. FloppyPepe is a meme coin that embodies the humor, strong social media presence, community, and virality associated with successful meme cryptos; after all, it’s a Matt-inspired token like Pepe and Brett. While entertainment and humor were the main defining features of past successful meme coins, FloppyPepe is about to add AI technology to improve the meme space. The platform’s community number surged in the past 24 hours after the release of its Meme-o-Matic AI machine, a text-to-image AI tool that can convert text prompts into high-quality meme images. Available for free use on Telegram, tons of users are already discovering how to create viral memes and put them for sale on marketplaces. FloppyPepe is also about to release another AI agent called Floppy X. It’s a video generator that needs only text prompts or images to generate high-resolution videos. Floppy X videos are interactive, can record engagement, and can analyze the data collected. FloppyPepe isn’t limiting itself to AI tech, even though its Floppychain technology, which works like ChatGPT, is also on the way. The meme coin is spreading its wings to touch nature. According to its tokenomics, 1% of every transaction funds the care of wildlife like Hippos and endangered species. Seeing its potential to see a massive rise when it lists on major exchanges soon, investors are rushing to join its presale priced at $0.0000002 to be part of its upcoming rise to the moon shot. You might also like: Matt Furie’s meme created PEPE’s success, could FloppyPepe be the next 1,000x run? Pepe gears for another major pump After its 2021 moonshot, investors didn’t expect Pepe to see a massive pump again. However, in 2024, PEPE rose again to set a new all-time high of $0.000008585. Pepe continues to increase over the years, keeping its community optimistic. In 2025, as Bitcoin’s performance continues to fuel market optimism, Pepe may hit a new high. Despite Pepe’s large market cap, it’s impossible to rule out a 1,000x surge for the crypto token. Shiba Inu works to revive winning ways SHIB’s popularity during the 2021 bull market stemmed from its massive gains, making many early investors millionaires. However, it’s currently facing challenges. Despite this, Shiba Inu is expanding and working on a comeback, with recent efforts like token burns and partnerships with AI companies. In 2025, Shiba Inu could potentially deliver returns of up to 1,000x. Final thoughts Among the three crypto tokens, Shiba Inu, FloppyPepe, and Pepe, FloppyPepe’s introduction of AI technology into meme space and utilities makes it the most promising to deliver high returns of up to 1,000x. So far, the crypto token presale has raised about $900,000 in a few days, a sign of huge buying pressure since its private presale also sold out in a day, raising $1 million. With a superior burn model that removes 1% of each transaction of the crypto token from circulation, FloppyPepe, the SolidProof audited meme coin, is a sustainable investment for savvy investors. Still selling at $0.0000002, investors can join its presale today to get in while it’s still early. For more information on FloppyPepe, visit its website , Telegram , or X .

Bitcoin has retreated to around $84,000, marking a 9% decrease from the previous close. The total crypto market cap has also dropped by around 10% to $2.76 trillion. However, rumors about President Donald Trump considering zero capital gains tax for US-based cryptocurrencies have sparked enthusiasm among traders. If this rumor turns true, how will it impact USA coins and cryptocurrencies price predictions? Will President Trump Announce Zero Capital Gains on Cryptocurrencies? Crypto analyst Mike Alfred has sparked speculation about Trump announcing zero capital gains on crypto. He noted that Trump would announce this move during the White House Crypto summit on Friday. In January, The Street reported that Eric Trump had confirmed that US-based cryptocurrencies such as XRP would be exempt from capital gains tax while non-US-based projects would be subject to a 30% tax. This move will put the US on par with crypto-friendly countries like El Salvador, which exempts foreign investors from capital gains on Bitcoin to attract investors. If Trump confirms this development, it will drive price gains for cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). These three USA coins have already been included in plans for a crypto strategic reserve despite market-wide criticism . XRP Price Defends Support After 16% Decline The XRP price has recorded a sharp 16% drop in 24 hours to trade at $2.35 at press time. The price drop follows broader weakness across the cryptocurrencies market but XRP has managed to defend crucial support at $2.14. Technical indicators show mixed momentum. The CMF indicator is positive signalling underlying accumulation. The Awesome Oscillator remains negative but has flashed green suggesting the bearish momentum is weakening. For a bullish reversal, the XRP price needs to flip resistance at $2.70 for a rally to $3.40. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Cardano Price Drops 23% Amid Crypto Market Volatility Cardano price has dropped by 23% in 24 hours to trade at $0.82. Despite the dip, ADA price still trades above its 200-day SMA, which is a crucial support level. If bulls defend this zone, another rally past $1 could follow, However, if selling pressure continues, it could lead to a bearish Cardano price prediction and a drop to $0.67. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Solana Price Forms a Death Cross Solana price has formed a death cross on its daily chart with the 50-day SMA falling below the 200-day EMA. After falling by more than 18% in 24 hours, SOL trades at $138. The altcoin was struggling to defend multi-month support at $135. The RSI is yet to be oversold, indicating there is room for further downside. With FTX unlocks for SOL tokens weighing on the cryptocurrency price, it could decline towards $100 in the near term. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Bottom Line Speculation around President Trump’s potential zero capital gains tax for US-based cryptocurrencies like XRP, Cardano, and Solana has sparked enthusiasm about price performance. However, heightened volatility in the broader market has prevented these USA coins from making meaningful gains.

At first, it rose to a new ATH but crashed 53% amid a broader market correction and is struggling to recover. Although yesterday marked a significant recovery, the trend changed again, leading to another step down and more risk. With the FTX/ Alameda unstacking millions of SOL, the token is one step closer to a further crash. Will it drop below $100? Let’s discuss this. Solana Price Crash: What’s Happening Today? Today marks another turbulent day, and the entire crypto market is witnessing a crash , including the Solana price. It currently trades at $128.14 after a 19% drop in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization and trading volume are $70.16B after the 19% drop and $9.56B after the 24% drop. Interestingly, this drop is because the tariffs on Mexico and Canada go into effect. However, the most alarming thing is that this drop came after an impressive SOL price rally fueled by Donald Trump’s U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement. At a time when investors anticipated a further uptrend, possibly as high as $200, the SOL price crashed, with the FTX and Alameda unstacking 3.03M SOL, equivalent to $431.3M. FTX Unstake Event and Its Impact on SOL As the crypto exchange begins redistributing the funds of FTX crash-affected investors, the market is witnessing millions of token unlocks, which are affecting their price. The firm recently unstaked 3.03M SOL ($431.3M) and transferred them to multiple crypto wallets. 24,799 SOL ($3.38M) has already been deposited to the Binance exchange, liquidating the asset. More importantly, many similar unlocks will come in April and the month after that, injecting fear into the market. This is because large token unlocks often influence investors’ sentiments and cause price fluctuations. As the crypto market is already under pressure, investors wonder if Solana could crash below $100. Why Wouldn’t Solana Price Crash Below $100? The SOL token’s performance today shows high signs of volatility, and factors like investor sentiments, a drop in network performance, token unlocks, and broader market conditions are to blame. However, considering SOL’s rally yesterday and market sentiments, the Solana price may not crash to $100 despite the odds. This altcoin grew to $177.88 yesterday and witnessed high trading volume and open interest, showcasing high investor interest. This explains the token’s potential for recovery even in adverse market conditions. Although the SOL is on the brink of massive liquidation, a $100 crash is unlikely. According to the Coinglass data, $300M will liquidate if the SOL price crashes to $127. This might initially trigger a drop to $120, but a rebound may occur, making a dip below $100 unlikely. Lastly, the Bitcoin price recovery in March could prevent this altcoin from further falling. The historical data reveals that BTC is bullish this month from the last 4 years, and the same might also happen this year, assisting the altcoins in recovery. Conclusion: A Steep Correction, but No Collapse Despite the ups and downs, Solana’s status in the crypto market is prominent. Although the FTX’s $431.3M unlock puts significant downtrend pressure on the price, the current analysis sees support at $120. Hence, the SOL price crash to $100 is unlikely, but due to liquidation data, it may dip towards $120. Investors must consider the liquidation level, whale data, and Bitcoin’s price movement to better comprehend Solana price predictions.

Analyst Says ADA ‘Could Be Poised’ For Rally To $2.20,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-125-pump-coming-analyst-says-ada-could-be-poised-for-rally-to-2-20/,"On Sunday, Cardano (ADA) saw a massive 80% pump following the US President’s announcement of a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” that will include ADA. As the cryptocurrency retests its key support levels, some analysts believe it might be poised for a 125% rally from current levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Sets $0.43 Target Cardano Attempts Reclaiming $1 On March 2, US President Donald Trump announced the establishment of a “US Crypto Reserve” comprised of Cardano, XRP, and Solana (SOL), with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at the heart of the strategic reserve. On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump stated the strategic reserve would “elevate the critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.” The announcement sent many cryptocurrencies into an end-of-week pump to reclaim some recently lost support levels. ADA has been in a downtrend since December when it hit its 3-year high of $1.32 but failed to hold the $1 support in mid-January. The February market retraces sent the cryptocurrency’s price below several key support zones, with the token hovering between the $0.60-$0.80 price range. Following Trump’s announcement, Cardano rose 60% in two hours, climbing from $0.64 to the $1 barrier for the first time in over a month. ADA continued its surge in the following hours, recovering over 80% from its Friday low of $0.58. On Sunday, ADA hit a two-month high of $1.17 before retracing over 20% to the key $0.90 support zone. Cardano investor Sebastian noted that the retest of the $0.92 level was “perfectly normal after such an insane move.” The investor suggested it could consolidate within the $0.90-$1.00 range for a few days before resuming its ascending trajectory. Moreover, he asserted that If ADA breaks above its December high, the token could likely see a new all-time high (ATH) soon. ADA’s New High Could Be Near Crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that Cardano “could be poised for a rally to $2.20.” According to the post, investors should “watch for a 12-hour candlestick close above $1.19” to confirm the bullish breakout and target an 84% jump from the breakout level. Martinez also highlighted that Cardano whales bought over 420 million ADA in the past 24 hours, which could signal strong sentiment from large-scale investors on the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that Cardano’s chart displays a “big power of 3 in the making.” This pattern divides the price cycle into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Key Levels And Faces Resistance At $97K – Can It Break $100K This Week? The first phase consists of a consolidation near the recent high after a strong price performance. The second phase sees a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level and trades within a range below the recently lost zone. In the third phase, a strong price breakout occurs, with momentum building and participants entering the market. According to Sjuul, “the chart never lies,” and Cardano entered the distribution phase after Sunday’s pump, suggesting that ADA could retest December highs soon. As of this writing, ADA trades at $0.91, a 9.9% retrace in the daily timeframe.

The task force aims to tackle the regulatory challenges surrounding digital assets. This group of experts will help the SEC address critical issues, including compliance and regulatory guidelines, ensuring that crypto regulations are more clear and effective. The leadership team of the task force includes Richard Gabbert as Chief of Staff, Michael Selig as Chief Counsel, Taylor Asher as Chief Policy Advisor, and Sumeera Younis as Chief of Operations. In addition to these leaders, the task force benefits from the input of Senior Advisors, including Landon Zinda, Donald Battle, Bernard Nolan, Laura Powell, Veronica Reynolds, Christopher Rice, Mark Sater, Andrew Schoeffler, Frank Sensenbrenner, and Robert Teply. The combined expertise of these professionals covers key areas such as legal, policy, and operational matters within the cryptocurrency landscape. Formed in January 2025 under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, the Crypto Task Force is tasked with refining existing crypto regulations, creating clearer compliance processes, and improving disclosure standards. By ensuring that enforcement remains focused and effective, the SEC hopes to pave the way for a more secure and transparent crypto market. As part of their initiative to encourage public dialogue on crypto regulations, the task force will be hosting a series of roundtable discussions, named “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The first roundtable, scheduled for March 21, is titled “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status.” This event will be streamed live and is open to the public, with security measures limiting in-person attendance. However, recorded versions of the event will be made available for later viewing. Participants will also be able to engage in smaller, off-air breakout discussions. Commissioner Peirce highlighted the importance of collaboration with the public, noting that these roundtables will be a key part of developing a workable regulatory framework for digital assets. The creation of this task force and the upcoming roundtable events signal a commitment from the SEC to create a well-regulated crypto market. The task force’s work aligns with President Trump’s vision of supporting innovation in the crypto sector and reinforcing the US’s leadership in the global digital asset space. The discussions and findings from these roundtables are expected to provide valuable insights that could influence future policy decisions for the cryptocurrency industry.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:01:59

In a new thread, Ki Young Ju tells his 410,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s surge on Sunday is confirming his belief that Bitcoin’s bull market is far from over – as long as it doesn’t fall significantly below the $75,000 level. “Made a bold call knowing I could be way off, but glad I got it right.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Bitcoin surged over the weekend from around $84,000 to around $94,000, after President Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve for the US that will include the flagship digital asset. Ki Young Ju also says that deep-pocketed investors using the top US crypto exchange Coinbase were propelling Bitcoin to higher price levels over the weekend. “Coinbase whales led this Bitcoin surge.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The CEO points to other metrics that he says continue to signal bullishness, including Bitcoin’s hash rate. The hash rate measures the computational power used by miners to secure the BTC network. A higher hash rate indicates a stronger network and better security. “The chart that backs my belief in Bitcoin. When investment in its network security stops, it has likely absorbed enough capital. That’s the time to sell.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X He also says that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator shows the price of the flagship crypto asset is likely to go up based on historic precedence. MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at) and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued. “Bitcoin on-chain indicators feel like this – like something unfinished.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The flagship digital asset did retrace on Monday amid the Trump tariff news that caused a sell-off in the stock market.

This filing follows Bitwise’s earlier submission of an S-1 to the SEC. According to the filing, Coinbase Custody will manage the ETF's Dogecoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon will oversee the cash assets and handle administration tasks. The filing proposes that the ETF will hold Dogecoin as its primary asset, with its Net Asset Value (NAV) calculated daily using the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, an industry-standard pricing benchmark. This would allow the ETF to closely track the market value of Dogecoin, offering investors an opportunity to trade the meme cryptocurrency on traditional markets. Besides Bitwise, other major firms like Grayscale and Rex Shares have also filed for a Dogecoin ETF, with Grayscale’s application further along in the SEC's review process. Grayscale’s filing has already been acknowledged by the SEC, making it a strong competitor in this space. Market sentiment surrounding the approval of a Dogecoin ETF has been increasingly positive. According to Polymarket, the probability of approval has risen to 67%, up from 55% just a day before. Bloomberg analysts have also forecast a 75% chance of approval in 2025. This rising confidence reflects the market’s belief that a regulated Dogecoin ETF may soon become a reality, although approval is still not guaranteed. This potential ETF marks a turning point for Dogecoin, which began as a joke in 2013 but has since grown into the largest meme cryptocurrency, with a market cap surpassing $28 billion. Despite this, DOGE’s price has recently fallen by nearly 16%, with trading volume showing a marked decline of 17%. This drop in price and volume underscores broader market challenges, despite the increasing optimism around the ETF. Market optimism is increasing due to the growing chance of a Dogecoin ETF approval in 2025. Grayscale’s lead in the ETF approval process signals significant regulatory interest. However, DOGE’s price drop highlights the volatility of meme coins despite positive regulatory news.",,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:04:46

While liquidity decreases, the influx of new coins and inflation pressures are only adding to the downward trend. Investors became more cautious after Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and a 20% tariff increase on China, starting later today. The crypto market experienced significant volatility following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. While there was an initial surge in prices, those gains quickly faded as doubts arose over its execution and necessary regulatory approvals. Further, Trump’s announcement about tariffs added extra uncertainty, which led to a larger sell-off across the market. Crypto Liquidations Cross $1 Billion Crypto liquidations have surged to over $1.09 billion, with BTC alone accounting for more than $400 million. The crypto market has faced the most significant selloff of 2025, losing $460 billion in just 24 hours. This equates to an average loss of about $19.1 billion per hour for the last 24 hours staright, according to The Kobeissi Letter. We are seeing crypto's steepest selloff of 2025: Over the last 24 hours, crypto markets are down -$460 billion from their highs.

Market volatility is likely to continue, especially as these tariffs take effect later today. Bitcoin fell 9.8% to $83,725. Alankar Saxena, CTO and co-founder of Mudrex, cautioned the investors to stay careful as volatility could continue if BTC drops below the $81,000 support. However, there is room for recovery with resistance at $92,000 if market sentiment improves. Arthur Hayes Says BTC Could Drop To $70k Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s current bull market, maintaining that the cryptocurrency is on track for continued growth. However, he also warned that in the worst-case scenario, Bitcoin’s price could drop to around $70,000, aligning with the previous cycle’s all-time high. Altcoins Hit Harder In the last 24 hours, altcoins have taken a bigger hit, with Ethereum dropping to $2,000 and heading towards its worst Q1 performance ever. Ethereum dropped 15% to $2,083. After a brief spike above $2,500 following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement, Ethereum has now collapsed to $2,050, erasing all its weekend gains. The global crypto market cap fell by 10.5% to $2.76 trillion in the last 24 hours. Other altcoins also saw significant losses, with Cardano down 25%, Solana down 19%, Dogecoin down 16%, and XRP down 18%.

Goliath’s primary goal is to offer Visa-level transaction speeds , targeting up to 24,000 transactions per second, making it a strong contender in the competitive world of high-speed blockchain solutions. It aims to accomplish this with a Proof-of-Stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW) and selects validators based on the amount of tokens they stake, thus reducing the network’s carbon footprint. Goliath will provide scalable and secure infrastructure for banks and financial service providers, marking a significant step forward in blockchain technology for the finance sector. Onyx emphasized that while Goliath will be a Layer-1 blockchain , it will remain interoperable with existing financial networks, ensuring it can seamlessly integrate with current systems. The roadmap for Goliath’s development includes a testnet launch scheduled for Q3 2025 , followed by a mainnet release in Q1 2026 . These phases will allow the team to refine the blockchain before it’s fully deployed in the financial sector. In addition to the Goliath project, Onyx is also launching a Points Program for its existing Layer-3 XCN Ledger . Participants who bridge assets like WETH, USDT, and others from the Base blockchain to Onyx will receive rewards. Despite the optimistic announcements, Onyxcoin’s token (XCN) saw a significant drop of over 11% today, continuing a larger trend. The broader crypto market, grappling with bearish news from the Federal Reserve, saw major price declines, impacting XCN’s value. After Onyxcoin had a brief rally earlier this month, a mass exodus of investors occurred, and the token saw a significant 50% loss in February. The Goliath announcement has yet to slow down this downward trend, and while it’s an exciting innovation for the blockchain and financial sectors, it remains to be seen if it can halt XCN’s current struggles. Despite the challenges, Onyx’s Goliath project presents a promising leap forward in blockchain’s role in finance, especially with its focus on scalability, security, and energy efficiency. However, it will face fierce competition as other blockchain networks aim to provide similar solutions for high-speed financial transactions.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:07:24

Ongoing Efforts to Trace and Recover Assets The Bybit team is actively working with blockchain forensics firms and law enforcement to trace and recover the stolen assets. The significant amount that remains traceable suggests that coordinated action could lead to a portion of the funds being frozen or recovered.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) are tasked with creating the proposal for managing digital assets and cryptocurrencies. This initiative follows a recent directive aimed at promoting national growth and increasing economic stability. The move is seen as crucial in regulating the growing digital asset market in Vietnam, which ranks 7th globally in cryptocurrency ownership, according to data from Triple-A. As of now, cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender in Vietnam, and many businesses that operate in the country register abroad to avoid local regulations. This has created a competitive disadvantage for local companies and has led to a loss in potential tax revenue. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of taking action, stating that all levels of government and the people have shown support for the initiative. With this legal framework, businesses will be able to access capital from financial institutions more easily, and users will benefit from greater transparency, helping minimize risks associated with digital currency transactions. Additionally, the framework will help the government in taxing crypto transactions and digital assets, contributing to the national economy. Currently, the Vietnamese government does not have a clear definition of virtual currencies or digital assets. The country’s previous efforts to regulate digital assets were incorporated into the Law on Digital Technology Industry, classifying crypto as intangible assets. In 2025, the government plans to classify digital assets based on factors like technology and purpose. This is expected to create clearer guidelines for the regulation of digital assets, which will contribute to the growth of the sector. To support these efforts, the Vietnamese government is also exploring the possibility of setting up testing mechanisms, known as sandboxes, to help establish a digital asset exchange. This initiative is expected to boost the financial industry and help Vietnam develop its digital currency market further. Moreover, the country plans to launch financial hubs in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang by 2025. The Prime Minister’s recent directive also mandates the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to draft policies related to digital assets and sandboxes, with deadlines set for Q2 2025. As Vietnam moves forward with these regulatory efforts, the country aims to position itself as a key player in the global digital currency space.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:11:47

McWilliams brings over 20 years of experience in financial management and auditing, and his role is crucial in driving Tether’s strategy to become more transparent amid growing regulatory pressure. Under his leadership, Tether aims to carry out a comprehensive financial audit, which the company hopes will address the long-standing doubts surrounding its reserve backing. In a shift of roles, Giancarlo Devasini, the former CFO, has been moved to the Chairman position, where he will focus on broader strategic initiatives, including advancing Tether’s integration into the U.S. financial system and boosting global digital asset adoption. McWilliams' appointment marks a critical step toward reinforcing Tether’s standing in the $232 billion stablecoin market. For years, Tether has faced skepticism regarding the transparency and legitimacy of its reserves. Until now, the company has only provided quarterly attestations from the accounting firm BDO, but these reports have been criticized for lacking the thoroughness of a full audit. This opacity has fueled doubts, particularly following a 2021 settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office, which exposed that Tether had misrepresented the backing of USDT at a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar. Despite the challenges, Tether has disclosed that a significant portion—82.35%—of its reserves is in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits, with nearly 80% of these holdings in U.S. Treasury bills. Critics, however, argue that only a full audit will truly resolve lingering concerns about the company’s financial stability. Tether's move for a comprehensive audit fits into its broader strategic goals. Recently, the company relocated its headquarters to El Salvador, aiming to secure a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license. This relocation signals Tether’s intention to strengthen its operational foundation and expand within the institutional financial sector. This development also comes as Tether seeks to demonstrate greater accountability and enhance its relationship with regulators, institutional partners, and users. With McWilliams’ appointment, Tether hopes to restore confidence and solidify its position as a leader in the stablecoin market, aligning itself with institutional needs while working toward full regulatory compliance. The company’s focus on transparency and its efforts to provide a more detailed and trustworthy audit process are seen as key factors in achieving long-term success. Tether’s move for greater transparency, led by McWilliams, aligns with its strategy to overcome past criticism and position itself as a key player in the global financial ecosystem. The outcome of the comprehensive audit will be crucial in shaping Tether’s future and its ability to maintain trust among users and investors alike. Simon McWilliams ' expertise is expected to guide Tether through a thorough audit process, addressing concerns about transparency and boosting institutional trust. Tether's future depends on how well it can tackle transparency issues and regulatory demands. McWilliams' leadership comes at a pivotal time as Tether looks to regain its standing amidst growing skepticism and regulatory scrutiny.",,EN,0,0,USDT|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:14:54

At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.34, marking an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT predicts that XRP will climb approximately 16% to reach $2.80 by March 31, 2025. “Given the recent market trends and bullish developments surrounding XRP, a 16% increase to $2.80 by the end of March is a realistic projection,” ChatGPT stated. Several key factors support this forecast, including recent political endorsements and regulatory clarity in the United States. Trump’s Announcement Boosts XRP Sentiment A Times Tabloid report recently revealed that former U.S. President Donald Trump announced the inclusion of XRP in a newly established national cryptocurrency reserve. This move marks a major shift in U.S. policy toward digital assets, as the government officially recognizes the importance of blockchain-based financial systems. Alongside XRP, other major cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) were also included in this strategic reserve. The news sent shockwaves through the crypto market, sparking investor optimism. Following the announcement, XRP and other selected cryptocurrencies experienced a short-term price surge, reinforcing the argument that XRP has strong institutional backing and growing mainstream adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This development suggests that XRP could see further price appreciation in the coming weeks as investors digest the implications of a U.S. government-backed crypto reserve. XRP Receives Special Recognition in U.S. Federal Register Adding to the bullish outlook, another Times Tabloid report revealed that XRP received special mentions in the U.S. Federal Register . The document outlined XRP’s transactional utility and unique role in financial settlements, differentiating it from other cryptocurrencies that function primarily as stores of value. This recognition is significant because it reinforces XRP’s legitimacy in the regulatory space, reducing uncertainty for investors and institutions looking to integrate the asset into their payment systems. As regulatory clarity continues to improve, XRP could see heightened demand from financial institutions and corporate entities. Can XRP Reach $2.80 By March 31? Given these major developments, ChatGPT’s prediction of a 16% price increase to $2.80 seems increasingly plausible. The combination of government support, regulatory recognition, and increased adoption among institutions strengthens XRP’s foundation for growth. Additionally, the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining momentum. Historically, altcoins like XRP follow suit when these assets perform well. If overall market sentiment improves, XRP could quickly recover from its recent dip. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

41139177,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136557,1741080173,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Move: SBI VC Trade to Embrace USDC Stablecoin in Japan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sbi-vc-trade-usdc-stablecoin/,"Get ready for a significant shift in the Japanese cryptocurrency landscape! SBI VC Trade , the crypto exchange arm of financial giant SBI Group, is making waves. They’ve just announced a groundbreaking development: the exchange has secured Japan’s first license for a stablecoin-related trading business and will be supporting USDC stablecoin starting March 12th. This is not just another listing; it’s a potential game-changer for digital currency adoption in Japan and beyond. Let’s dive into what this exciting news means for you and the crypto world. What Makes USDC Stablecoin a Key Player? Before we delve deeper into SBI VC Trade’s move, let’s understand why USDC stablecoin is garnering so much attention. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins offer a beacon of stability. Here’s a breakdown of why USDC is considered a crucial digital asset: Pegged to the US Dollar: USDC is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. This means for every USDC in circulation, there is a corresponding dollar held in reserve. This peg provides price stability, unlike the fluctuating nature of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Transparency and Trust: USDC is issued by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. They are committed to transparency, regularly publishing attestations of their reserves by reputable accounting firms. This builds trust and confidence in the stablecoin’s peg. Growing Adoption: USDC is one of the most widely adopted stablecoins globally. It’s used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, centralized exchanges, and for international remittances. Its utility is continuously expanding. Regulatory Compliance: Circle actively engages with regulators and strives for compliance. This proactive approach makes USDC a preferred choice for institutions and users concerned about regulatory clarity. In essence, USDC acts as a bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world, offering the benefits of digital currencies without the extreme price swings. This stability is vital for wider digital currency adoption , particularly in markets like Japan where regulatory compliance and stability are highly valued. SBI VC Trade Secures Landmark Stablecoin Regulation License The real newsmaker here is SBI VC Trade securing Japan’s first “stablecoin-related trading business” license. This isn’t just a procedural step; it’s a landmark achievement under Japan’s evolving stablecoin regulation . Here’s why this license is so significant: First of its Kind: This license is specifically tailored for businesses handling stablecoins and related electronic payment services. SBI VC Trade is the pioneer in obtaining this specific regulatory approval in Japan. Regulatory Green Light: Japan has been proactive in establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This license demonstrates that SBI VC Trade has met stringent requirements and is operating within the legal boundaries set by Japanese authorities. Boosts Credibility: Being licensed by Japanese regulators enhances SBI VC Trade’s credibility and trustworthiness, both domestically and internationally. It signals a commitment to operating legally and responsibly within the crypto space. Opens Doors for Innovation: This license paves the way for SBI VC Trade to offer a broader range of stablecoin-related services, potentially including payments, remittances, and DeFi integrations, further driving digital currency adoption . This regulatory victory for SBI VC Trade is a strong indicator of Japan’s progressive approach to digital assets. It suggests a willingness to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. This could set a precedent for other countries looking to establish clear stablecoin regulation frameworks. How Will This Impact the Japan Crypto Exchange Market? SBI VC Trade’s support for USDC is poised to have a ripple effect across the Japan crypto exchange market. Let’s examine the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effect Increased Trading Volume USDC is a popular trading pair. Its addition could attract more traders to SBI VC Trade, boosting overall trading volume on the exchange. Enhanced Liquidity Stablecoins like USDC enhance market liquidity by providing readily available trading pairs and facilitating faster transactions between different cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Attracting Institutional Investors Institutional investors often prefer regulated and compliant platforms. SBI VC Trade’s license and USDC support could make it more appealing to institutions looking to enter the Japanese crypto market. Competitive Pressure Other Japan crypto exchange platforms may feel pressure to also seek stablecoin licenses and list USDC or other stablecoins to remain competitive. This could lead to a broader adoption of stablecoins across the Japanese market. Broader Market Growth Increased accessibility to stablecoins like USDC can contribute to the overall growth of the Japanese cryptocurrency market by providing a stable and reliable on-ramp and off-ramp for digital assets. Essentially, SBI VC Trade’s move could be a catalyst for a more mature and robust Japan crypto exchange ecosystem, attracting both retail and institutional participants. Benefits of USDC Support on SBI VC Trade: What’s in it for You? For users and traders, the introduction of USDC on SBI VC Trade brings several tangible benefits: Stable Trading Pair: USDC provides a stable and reliable trading pair against other cryptocurrencies. This reduces the risk of volatility when moving funds in and out of crypto positions. Fiat-like On-ramp/Off-ramp: USDC can function as a near-fiat on-ramp and off-ramp. Users can easily convert Japanese Yen to USDC and vice versa (through SBI VC Trade’s services), making it easier to enter and exit the crypto market. Reduced Transaction Costs: Using USDC for transactions can sometimes be more cost-effective than using traditional banking channels, especially for international transfers. DeFi Opportunities: While specifics are yet to be announced, SBI VC Trade’s license could potentially open doors for users to access DeFi opportunities involving USDC in the future, expanding their access to decentralized financial services. Increased Confidence: Trading on a licensed platform that supports a regulated stablecoin like USDC can enhance user confidence and security in their crypto activities. In short, USDC support on SBI VC Trade offers a more stable, efficient, and potentially more versatile experience for cryptocurrency users in Japan. Navigating the Future of Stablecoins and SBI VC Trade While this news is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to consider the broader context and potential challenges: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Stablecoin regulation is still evolving globally. While Japan is taking a proactive approach, the regulatory landscape could change, potentially impacting how stablecoins are used and regulated in the future. Competition in the Stablecoin Market: USDC is not the only stablecoin. Tether (USDT) is another dominant player, and other stablecoins are emerging. Competition and market dynamics could influence the long-term success and adoption of USDC in Japan. User Education: Wider adoption of stablecoins requires user education. SBI VC Trade and other industry players will need to educate users about the benefits and risks associated with stablecoins to ensure responsible usage. Despite these considerations, SBI VC Trade’s move to support USDC is a significant step forward for the Japanese cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing legitimacy and integration of digital assets within the traditional financial system. As digital currency adoption continues to accelerate, expect to see more innovative developments in the stablecoin space and further regulatory clarity around the globe. Conclusion: A Breakthrough for Japan’s Crypto Future SBI VC Trade’s acquisition of Japan’s first stablecoin license and its decision to support USDC is more than just a news headline; it’s a breakthrough moment for the Japanese cryptocurrency industry. It signifies regulatory progress, increased market maturity, and greater accessibility to stable and reliable digital assets for users. This move not only benefits SBI VC Trade and its users but also contributes to the broader growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Japan and potentially sets a positive example for other nations. Keep an eye on March 12th – it marks the beginning of a new chapter for USDC and SBI VC Trade in the dynamic world of digital finance.

One of the most talked-about possibilities is the 0% capital gains tax on U.S.-issued cryptocurrencies. Back in January, Eric Trump reportedly confirmed that U.S.-based cryptocurrencies like XRP would be exempt from capital gains tax, while foreign crypto projects could face a 30% tax. If such a policy is implemented, it could boost the prices of key U.S.-linked cryptos like Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). Top Altcoin To Buy Before Crypto Summit Additionally, Capo Of Crypto has recently added some altcoins to his portfolio in preparation for a potential market shift, believing they could benefit from the summit’s outcomes. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): A scalable blockchain with strong U.S. ties and a promising technical setup. However, currently seeing a drop of 14% from yesterday’s high. Render (RENDER): A project focusing on AI and 3D rendering with a strong U.S. presence. With a market cap of $1.82 billion, the Render token has seen a drop of 15% making it an attractive token to buy at discounted prices. Constellation (DAG): A low-cap token with government connections that could see increased demand. After seeing continued downward pressure DAG is forming a solid bullish pattern, looking to break the $0.050 resistance. ENA (Ethena): A rising altcoin that has caught attention due to its potential growth in the market. Right now, ENA is trading at $0.35 , down 16%, with a market cap of $1.12 billion. Solana (SOL): Since Trump’s Crypto Reserve includes Solana, its price reaction will be interesting to watch. SOL is currently trading at $137.

41139302,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136567,1741080367,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Australia’s Bold Crypto Stance: No Strategic Reserve, Just Smart Regulation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/australia-crypto-regulation-stance/,"In a surprising move that has the crypto world buzzing, Australia has firmly stated it will not be creating a strategic crypto reserve. While some nations are eagerly stockpiling digital assets, the land Down Under is taking a different, perhaps more pragmatic path. Let’s dive into why Australia is prioritizing regulation over reserves and what this means for the future of crypto in the region. Are they missing out on a golden opportunity, or are they playing the long game for sustainable crypto growth? Australia Crypto Regulation: Prioritizing Stability Over Speculation Forget the image of Australia hoarding Bitcoin in a digital vault! The Australian government, under Prime Minister Albanese, is laser-focused on establishing a robust framework for Australia crypto regulation . A spokesperson for Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones clarified that, unlike some U.S. states exploring crypto reserves, Australia’s current strategy centers on carefully regulating digital asset platforms. This isn’t a rejection of crypto; it’s a strategic decision to build a secure and reliable environment for digital assets to thrive. Why this focus on regulation? Here are a few key reasons: Protecting Consumers: Regulation is paramount to safeguarding Australians from the inherent risks associated with the volatile crypto market. Clear rules and oversight can minimize fraud, scams, and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Unregulated crypto markets can pose risks to the broader financial system. Prudent digital asset regulation ensures crypto operates within established financial boundaries, preventing systemic risks. Fostering Innovation Responsibly: Australia aims to be a hub for blockchain and digital asset innovation, but not at the expense of financial stability. Regulation provides a clear pathway for innovation to flourish within a safe and compliant environment. Think of it like building a house. Some might rush to fill their house with valuable furniture (crypto reserves) before the foundation is even properly laid (regulation). Australia, on the other hand, is meticulously building a strong regulatory foundation first to ensure everything built upon it, including crypto innovation, is secure and sustainable. The Allure of Crypto Reserves: Why Some Nations Are Stockpiling The idea of a crypto reserve , particularly a Bitcoin reserve, has gained traction in certain circles. Nations and even some corporations are exploring this concept. Why? Let’s look at the potential benefits: Diversification: Crypto, especially Bitcoin, is seen by some as a hedge against inflation and a diversifier away from traditional assets like fiat currencies and bonds. Holding a crypto reserve could diversify a nation’s balance sheet. Future-Proofing: Believers in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies see reserves as a way to future-proof their nation’s finances, positioning them to benefit from the anticipated growth of the digital asset space. Technological Leadership: Nations holding crypto reserves might be perceived as being at the forefront of technological adoption, attracting crypto businesses and talent. However, the path to crypto reserves is not without its challenges. Volatility, security concerns, regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions, and the environmental impact of some cryptocurrencies are significant hurdles. Blockchain Australia: Recognizing Potential, Navigating Risks Despite opting out of a strategic reserve, the Australian government isn’t dismissing the transformative potential of blockchain and digital assets. They explicitly acknowledge the capacity of these technologies to: Drive Economic Growth: Blockchain can streamline processes, reduce costs, and create new business models across various sectors. Enhance the Financial Sector: Digital assets and blockchain can modernize payment systems, improve efficiency, and foster financial inclusion. Foster Innovation: Embracing blockchain and digital assets positions Australia as a forward-thinking nation, attracting investment and talent in cutting-edge technologies. The key is to unlock these benefits responsibly through well-crafted digital asset regulation . This approach aims to nurture innovation while mitigating the inherent risks associated with this nascent technology. Crypto Adoption: A Measured Approach in Australia So, what does Australia’s regulatory focus mean for crypto adoption in the country? It suggests a measured and sustainable approach rather than a rapid, speculative surge. Here’s what we can expect: Gradual Integration: As regulations become clearer and more comprehensive, we’ll likely see a gradual integration of crypto into the mainstream financial system and various industries in Australia. Focus on Utility: Regulation can steer crypto adoption towards practical use cases – supply chain management, secure data storage, efficient payments – rather than purely speculative investments. Increased Trust: Robust regulation can build trust and confidence in the crypto space, attracting both institutional and retail investors who prioritize security and compliance. Instead of aiming for a quick win with a volatile crypto reserve, Australia is investing in long-term, sustainable growth of the digital asset ecosystem through thoughtful regulation. This strategy may not grab immediate headlines, but it could prove to be the more prudent and ultimately more rewarding path. What’s Next for Australia’s Crypto Journey? Australia’s decision to prioritize regulation over a strategic crypto reserve signals a mature and considered approach to digital assets. It’s a recognition that the long-term success of crypto hinges not on speculative hoarding, but on building a stable, secure, and innovative ecosystem. While the allure of quick gains from crypto reserves might be tempting, Australia is betting on the power of smart regulation to unlock the true potential of blockchain and digital assets for its economy and its citizens. This bold stance could position Australia as a leader in responsible crypto innovation in the years to come.

Lee's outlook comes amid economic uncertainty as President Trump navigates his first 100 days in office. Several factors are contributing to market volatility, including the Department of Government Expenditure (DOGE) program, which imposes austerity measures that reduce public spending, and the tariff policies creating further uncertainty for businesses and investors. Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced yet another reversal in price, filling in Friday's CME gap and currently sitting at $83,000 —down over 10% this year. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has also dropped nearly 10%, with another similar decline would trigger a bear market. Lee points to Friday’s upcoming job data as a key event that could dictate short-term market direction. If the data is worse than expected, he anticipates an initial wave of panic, but Lee believes it could also prompt the Federal Reserve to accelerate interest rate cuts. Currently, the futures market is pricing in 75 basis points of cuts for this year, which would bring the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3.50%-3.75% by year-end. So far, the Fed has already implemented 100 basis points worth of cuts in this cycle. Lee also addressed bitcoin’s struggles, noting that its recent downturn is not driven by negative news but rather by cyclical market forces. He sees a potential short-term price target of $62,000 but still see's bitcoin finishing over $150,000 by end of the year.

But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 10 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.0025, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication.

Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Avalanche: The Eco-Friendly Blockchain That’s Changing the Game Avalanche, or AVAX, is making waves in the blockchain world. It’s an eco-friendly platform known for low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Processing up to 4,500 transactions per second and finalizing them in under two seconds, it outpaces many competitors. A standout feature is its customizable Subnets, allowing users to create their own tailored blockchain networks. Its three interconnected chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—work together smoothly, handling everything from simple transactions to complex smart contracts. In today’s market, AVAX is catching the eye of those looking for innovative and practical solutions. Its hybrid consensus mechanism blends classical and Nakamoto methods, offering both security and speed—a combination that’s rare among cryptocurrencies. The AVAX token plays a vital role, not just in transactions but also in securing the network through staking and powering the Subnets. As the blockchain space grows more competitive, platforms like Avalanche that offer scalability, speed, and eco-friendly operations are standing out. With a shift towards sustainable and efficient technology, AVAX seems poised to make a significant impact. Chainlink: Bridging the Gap Between Blockchain and Real World Data Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts connect with real-world data. Smart contracts are digital agreements on the blockchain, but they often can’t access data outside their network. Chainlink solves this by using oracles, which are like trusted messengers that bring external information to the blockchain. It ensures the data is accurate by using a reputation system, so smart contracts get reliable information. This makes them more useful because they can interact with real-world events and applications. In the current market, technologies that enhance blockchain functionality are gaining attention. Chainlink stands out by focusing on connecting blockchains with external data sources. Its LINK token is important because it rewards those who provide data and helps keep the network secure through staking. As more industries look to use blockchain technology that interacts with real-world data, Chainlink’s approach could become increasingly valuable. Compared to other cryptocurrencies that focus solely on transactions or finance, Chainlink offers a service that expands what blockchain can do. This trend of integrating blockchain with real-world applications is something many are watching closely in the crypto market. Conclusion While AVAX and LINK are strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) could surpass them by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for significant growth during the current bull run.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors keenly observing global economic shifts, this development carries substantial implications for market volatility and the broader financial landscape. Let’s delve into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for you. Decoding China Tariffs: What’s Happening? On March 4th, Beijing declared its response to recently imposed U.S. tariffs by implementing its own levies ranging from 10 to 15 percent on a range of American agricultural and food products. This move isn’t just about tariffs; China has also placed export and investment restrictions on 25 U.S. companies, signaling a multifaceted approach to counter what it perceives as protectionist measures from Washington. This reciprocal action immediately raises concerns about a deepening trade war impact and its cascading effects on the global economy. Why are China Tariffs Increasing? The increase in China tariffs is a direct reaction to new tariffs imposed by the United States. This tit-for-tat escalation is characteristic of a trade war, where each nation responds to the other’s trade barriers with countermeasures. The core reasons behind this escalating trade tension can be summarized as: Reciprocal Retaliation: China frames these tariffs as a necessary response to protect its own economic interests in the face of U.S. trade policies. Economic Leverage: Tariffs are used as a tool to exert economic pressure and negotiate trade agreements more favorably. Protecting Domestic Industries: Both nations aim to protect their domestic industries from foreign competition through these measures, although the long-term effects can be complex and often detrimental to consumers and businesses. Impact on the Global Economy The imposition of China tariffs and subsequent restrictions on U.S. firms has far-reaching implications for the global economy. Here’s a breakdown of the potential impacts: Area of Impact Potential Consequence Agricultural and Food Sectors U.S. farmers and food producers face reduced access to the Chinese market, potentially leading to surpluses, decreased prices domestically, and financial strain. Chinese consumers may face higher prices or reduced availability of certain U.S. products. U.S. Companies The 25 U.S. firms facing export and investment restrictions could experience significant business disruptions, revenue losses, and challenges in maintaining their global operations. Supply Chains Global supply chains, already strained by various factors, could face further disruptions as businesses scramble to adjust to the new trade barriers. This can lead to increased costs and delays in production and delivery of goods. Market Volatility Financial markets are likely to react to these developments with increased volatility. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies often leads to investor anxiety, impacting stock markets, currency values, and potentially the cryptocurrency market as well. Geopolitical Relations Escalating trade disputes can strain broader geopolitical relations between the U.S. and China, impacting international cooperation on various fronts. Trade War Impact: A Deeper Dive The term “trade war” is often used to describe a situation of escalating trade tensions between countries. This scenario typically involves: Increased Tariffs: Countries impose tariffs on each other’s goods, making imports more expensive. Retaliatory Measures: Affected countries respond with their own tariffs and trade restrictions, leading to a cycle of escalation. Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars create uncertainty for businesses, investors, and consumers, impacting economic growth and stability. Disrupted Trade Flows: The flow of goods and services between countries is disrupted, altering established trade patterns. The current situation with China tariffs and U.S. responses certainly fits the description of an escalating trade dispute, with potential to morph into a full-blown trade war if not managed carefully. Market Volatility and Cryptocurrencies For those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding market volatility is paramount. Traditional financial markets often react strongly to geopolitical and economic uncertainties, and these reactions can spill over into the crypto market. Here’s how: Risk-Off Sentiment: Increased trade tensions can trigger a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets. Investors may move away from perceived riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies towards safer havens like government bonds or gold. Currency Fluctuations: Trade disputes can lead to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or the Chinese Yuan can impact the cryptocurrency market, which is often priced in USD. Economic Slowdown Concerns: A trade war impact can lead to concerns about a global economic slowdown. In such scenarios, investors might become more cautious across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Safe Haven Narrative: Conversely, some argue that in times of economic uncertainty, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be seen as a safe haven asset, uncorrelated to traditional markets. However, empirical evidence for this is still developing, and market reactions can be unpredictable. Navigating the Uncertainties: Actionable Insights Given the evolving situation with China tariffs and the potential for increased market volatility, what steps can you take? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in the trade dispute and their potential economic consequences. Reliable news sources and financial analysis are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile times. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s in crypto or traditional assets. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategies accordingly. Consider using risk management tools like stop-loss orders if you are actively trading. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market volatility is often a short-term phenomenon. Maintain a long-term perspective on your investments and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market swings. Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, especially in uncertain market conditions. Conclusion: Urgent Need for Global Trade Resolution The escalating trade tensions marked by increased China tariffs and restrictions on U.S. companies represent a significant challenge to the global economy. The potential for prolonged trade disputes and a full-blown trade war is a serious concern, with implications ranging from disrupted supply chains to increased market volatility. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macroeconomic factors is essential for navigating market uncertainties and making informed decisions. The situation underscores the interconnectedness of the global economy and the urgent need for diplomatic solutions to trade disputes to ensure stability and growth.

Recent data reveals a concerning pattern: U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have experienced a significant net outflow of $12.1 million on March 3rd. This marks the eighth consecutive trading day of net outflows, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment and prompting crucial questions about the future trajectory of the ETH ETF market . Let’s delve into the details of this intriguing development and understand what it might mean for the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Recent Ethereum ETF Outflows: What’s Happening? According to data from Farside Investors, a financial information platform closely monitoring ETF flows, the cumulative net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs reached $12.1 million on March 3rd. This figure represents the combined activity across all listed spot ETH ETFs in the United States. To break it down further: BlackRock’s ETHA: This ETF recorded a substantial net outflow of $16.1 million. This is noteworthy as BlackRock is a major player in the ETF space, and their ETF performance often reflects broader market trends. Bitwise’s ETHW: In contrast to the general outflow trend, Bitwise’s ETHW ETF experienced a net inflow of $4 million. This positive inflow amidst overall outflows could indicate specific investor interest in Bitwise’s offering or a divergence in investment strategies. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings on March 3rd. This suggests a mixed bag of investor reactions, with some ETFs experiencing outflows while others remained stable. To better visualize the situation, here’s a table summarizing the ETF flows on March 3rd: ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Flow (USD Million) BlackRock ETHA -16.1 Bitwise ETHW +4.0 Other ETFs Various 0.0 Total Net Flow -12.1 Why are we seeing consecutive ETH ETF Outflows? Understanding Crypto Investment Trends Eight consecutive days of net outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs raise eyebrows and prompt us to ask: what’s driving this trend? Several factors could be at play, reflecting broader crypto investment trends and market dynamics: Profit Taking: After a period of price appreciation in Ethereum and the broader crypto market, some investors might be taking profits. Selling ETF holdings could be a part of this profit-taking strategy. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Periods of uncertainty or price corrections can lead investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, triggering outflows from ETFs. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as interest rate hikes or inflation concerns, can influence investor sentiment towards all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Uncertainty in the macroeconomic landscape can lead to risk aversion and outflows from crypto ETFs. Rotation into other Assets: Investors might be reallocating their capital from Ethereum ETFs into other asset classes that they perceive as more attractive at the moment. This could include other cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, or even traditional commodities. ETF Maturity and Market Dynamics: As spot Ethereum ETFs are relatively new products, the market is still finding its equilibrium. Initial excitement and inflows might be followed by periods of adjustment and outflows as the market matures. Spot Ethereum ETFs: Benefits and Challenges in the Digital Asset Outflows Scenario Spot Ethereum ETFs were hailed as a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption, offering both benefits and challenges, especially when we observe digital asset outflows . Let’s examine both sides of the coin: Benefits of Spot Ethereum ETFs: Accessibility and Convenience: ETFs provide traditional investors with an easy and regulated way to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the digital asset. This lowers the barrier to entry and broadens the investor base. Liquidity and Transparency: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and price transparency. This is a significant advantage compared to directly holding and trading Ethereum on crypto exchanges. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, providing investors with a level of security and investor protection not always available in the decentralized crypto world. Diversification: ETFs allow investors to diversify their portfolios by including exposure to Ethereum alongside traditional assets, potentially enhancing risk-adjusted returns. Challenges Highlighted by Digital Asset Outflows: Market Volatility Amplification: While ETFs offer access, they can also amplify market volatility. Large inflows and outflows can exacerbate price swings in the underlying asset, as seen with the current digital asset outflows . Tracking Error: ETFs aim to track the price of Ethereum, but there can be tracking errors due to ETF operating costs, market inefficiencies, and other factors. This can lead to slight deviations between the ETF’s performance and the actual price of Ethereum. Centralization Concerns: While providing regulated access, ETFs are inherently centralized products. This contrasts with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies and might not appeal to all crypto enthusiasts. Fees and Expenses: ETFs charge management fees and other expenses, which can erode returns over time compared to directly holding Ethereum. Navigating the ETH ETF Market: Actionable Insights So, what can investors and market observers glean from these recent Ethereum ETF outflows ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor ETF Flows Closely: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF flow data from sources like Farside Investors. Significant and sustained outflows can be an indicator of shifting market sentiment. Consider Broader Market Context: Don’t just focus on ETF flows in isolation. Analyze them in the context of broader crypto market trends, macroeconomic factors, and news events that could be influencing investor behavior. Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio: Relying solely on Ethereum ETFs for crypto exposure might not be optimal. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio across different assets and investment strategies. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies and crypto ETFs are inherently volatile. Ensure your investment decisions align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Stay updated on market developments, regulatory changes, and technological advancements to make informed investment decisions and navigate the ETH ETF market effectively. Conclusion: A Cautious Outlook on Ethereum ETF Market? The recent $12.1 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs , marking eight consecutive days of outflows, is a noteworthy development in the evolving crypto investment landscape. While Bitwise’s ETHW saw inflows, the overall trend suggests a cautious sentiment among investors, potentially driven by profit-taking, market volatility, or broader macroeconomic uncertainties. Understanding the dynamics of digital asset outflows and the nuances of the ETH ETF market is crucial for investors navigating this exciting yet complex asset class. As the market matures, monitoring these trends and adapting investment strategies will be key to success in the world of cryptocurrency ETFs.

Bitcoin Has A Major Supply Wall Between $95,400 & $98,200 In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed about how the various BTC price ranges are looking in terms of on-chain resistance and support. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance range is assumed to lie in the amount of supply that was last purchased/transacted by investors at price levels falling in said range. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As Bitcoin & Altcoins Bounce Back That is, strong support/resistance ranges carry the cost basis of a large number of addresses. The reason behind this is that to any investor, their break-even level is naturally a special level, so when retests of it happen, they are probable to make some kind of move. Holders who were in loss prior to such a retest may be tempted to sell, as they would at least recoup all of their investment. Investors who were in profit, however, may decide to buy more instead, as they could believe the same acquisition level would end up paying off again in the future. Naturally, just a few investors showing this buying/selling would have no effects on the cryptocurrency’s price, so the range would need to contain the cost basis of a significant amount of addresses if it has to act as a resistance or support boundary. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows how the Bitcoin supply is distributed at ranges around the current spot price: In the graph, the size of the dot correlates to the amount of coins that the investors purchased inside the corresponding range. It would appear that one range ahead of the current price particularly stands out in terms of the size of its dot: $95,400 to $98,200. At these price levels, around 2.29 million addresses purchased a total of 1.66 million tokens. Given that the range is above the asset’s price at the moment, all of these investors would be in the red.

It now remains to be seen whether demand would be enough to outpace these potential sellers, if BTC can rally far enough to retest this range. BTC Price Bitcoin neared the $95,000 level during the latest price rally, but it seems its price has since faced a retrace as it’s now back to $90,700.

Solomon, who was speaking at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney on Tuesday, mentioned risks to global trade policies and how those risks could affect economic growth. Judge grants Trump’s request to delay civil fraud trial President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico effective immediately, the White House announced Monday. Tariffs on Chinese imports will rise from 10% to 20% after China failed to stop the shipment of fentanyl into the U.S. These moves have also fueled fresh volatility in equity and bond markets as investors assess their possible impact on global trade and growth. Solomon recognized the economic risks associated with those policies, but he emphasized that they don’t necessarily indicate a looming economic recession.

Congress Centre – Aspen 2. Copyright by World Economic Forum/Sandra Blaser. David Solomon said at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney that there are trade imbalances and that the president is aggressively taking action to level the playing field. He added that Trump is executing this view. Business leaders express cautious optimism Solomon has also tried to remain cautiously optimistic despite some market analysts’ warnings about potential economic headwinds. He noted that business executives are acutely attuned to the impact of trade policies and the state of credit markets. He also noted that the economy has been without a conventional credit cycle for more than a decade, resulting in an accumulation of excess. While it may not be an immediate threat, he noted that people need to look ahead and recognize the increasingly interconnected nature of financial systems. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of Blackstone Inc., spoke at the same conference. Schwarzman cited a quarterly survey by Blackstone of the 250 companies it owns, none of whose executives expect a recession this year. “The U.S. economy remains in good shape,” he declared. Despite Solomon’s optimism, some economists have been warning about stagflation — a scenario when high inflation continues while growth slows. In a report, Business Insider wrote that prolonged inflationary pressure and higher interest rates are expected to inhibit economic momentum, especially if spending among consumers weakens. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, also recently took a more sober view of the economy. He added that there are still geopolitical risks, inflationary pressures, and the potential for all kinds of disruptions from global trade conflicts. Although the U.S. economy is holding steady, the long-term effects of Trump’s hardline trade policies are unknown. Market analysts will converge on how businesses have adjusted to the changing trade landscape. Solomon said that investors should stay alert and mindful of changing credit cycles and market dynamics. “The trick is understanding how all the pieces talk to each other,” he added.

41139441,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136526,1741080730,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Tax Reality Check: Cochran Debunks Trump’s Unilateral Power,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-tax-trump-cochran-reality/,"Is the crypto community buzzing with excitement about potential tax relief? Rumors swirled recently, fueled by whispers from digital asset circles, suggesting that former President Donald Trump might be considering a dramatic move: abolishing the crypto capital gains tax. The prospect of such a change, especially with a White House summit on the horizon, ignited hopes among crypto investors eager for friendlier tax policies. But before you start celebrating tax-free crypto profits, a crucial voice of reason has stepped in to temper expectations and inject a dose of reality into the conversation. Decoding the Crypto Capital Gains Tax Debate The heart of the matter lies in understanding who actually holds the power to change tax laws in the United States. Adam Cochran, a respected figure in the blockchain space and founder of Cinneamhain Ventures, took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify a critical point: President Trump, or any U.S. President for that matter, cannot unilaterally wave a magic wand and eliminate the crypto capital gains tax . This isn’t a matter of presidential decree; it’s a matter of legislative authority. Cochran’s comments directly addressed speculation ignited by Mike Alfred, founder of Eaglebrook Advisors, who hinted at a potential push for tax elimination at an upcoming White House summit on March 7th. While Alfred’s suggestion sparked enthusiasm, Cochran’s expert opinion serves as a vital reminder of the checks and balances within the U.S. government. Why Congress, Not Trump, Holds the Tax Law Key To grasp why Cochran’s statement carries weight, it’s essential to understand the fundamental structure of U.S. lawmaking. Tax laws are not presidential prerogatives; they are the domain of the legislative branch, Congress. Here’s a breakdown: Legislative Authority: In the U.S. system, Congress is explicitly granted the power to create and amend tax laws. This power is enshrined in the Constitution, ensuring that significant financial policies are debated and decided upon by elected representatives. Presidential Role: The President’s role in the legislative process is primarily to sign bills into law or veto them. While a President can certainly propose tax reforms and advocate for them, they cannot bypass Congress to enact these changes single-handedly. Checks and Balances: This separation of powers is a cornerstone of American democracy, designed to prevent any single branch of government from becoming too powerful. It ensures that major policy changes, like tax law amendments, require broad consensus and deliberation. The Reality of Tax Reform: Amending the tax law , including the rules surrounding crypto capital gains, is a complex legislative process. It involves drafting bills, committee hearings, debates in both the House and the Senate, and ultimately, a vote in both chambers. Therefore, while President Trump (or any president) can express intentions or desires regarding tax policy, actual changes to the crypto capital gains tax necessitate Congressional action. Cochran’s statement isn’t about downplaying the potential for future tax reforms; it’s about grounding expectations in the reality of how U.S. law is made. The Implications for Crypto Investors: Navigating the Tax Landscape So, what does this mean for crypto investors navigating the often-murky waters of taxation? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Don’t Bank on Unilateral Action: While presidential support for crypto-friendly policies is valuable, don’t assume that a president can unilaterally alter existing tax law . Focus on legislative developments and Congressional actions. Stay Informed About Legislative Efforts: Keep an eye on legislative proposals related to cryptocurrency taxation. Organizations like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center often track and advocate for sensible crypto tax policies. Engage with Policymakers: Advocacy matters. Contact your elected representatives to voice your opinions on crypto taxation. Grassroots movements can influence legislative priorities. Plan for Current Tax Regulations: For now, the crypto capital gains tax remains in effect. Ensure you understand your tax obligations and maintain accurate records of your crypto transactions. Consult with a tax professional specializing in cryptocurrency for personalized advice. Focus on Long-Term Policy Changes: Meaningful and lasting changes to crypto taxation will likely come through legislative reforms. Support initiatives aimed at creating a clearer and more favorable tax framework for digital assets through Congressional action. Could Tax Reform Still Be on the Horizon? While unilateral presidential action is off the table, the conversation around crypto capital gains tax reform is far from over. Here’s what to consider: Presidential Influence: Even without unilateral power, a president can significantly influence the legislative agenda. If President Trump were to actively advocate for crypto tax reform, it could increase the likelihood of Congress taking up the issue. Political Will: The political climate plays a crucial role. Growing bipartisan interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology could create an environment more conducive to tax reform. Economic Arguments: Arguments for crypto tax reform often center on promoting innovation, attracting investment, and keeping the U.S. competitive in the global digital economy. These economic considerations can sway policymakers. Stakeholder Engagement: The crypto industry, advocacy groups, and individual investors all have a role to play in pushing for tax reform. Consistent and informed engagement with policymakers is key. The Bottom Line: Navigating Crypto Tax Realities Adam Cochran’s clarification serves as a vital reality check in the often-hyped world of crypto news. While the prospect of immediate crypto capital gains tax abolition by presidential decree is wishful thinking, the broader conversation around sensible crypto taxation remains important. True and lasting change will require navigating the legislative process and engaging with Congress. For crypto investors, the message is clear: stay informed, understand the legal landscape, and focus on supporting policy initiatives that promote a fair and innovative future for digital assets. Don’t get swept away by rumors; focus on the facts and the legislative path to potential tax reform.

Has the Expected Support Arrived?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/industry-leaders-talk-about-trump-adding-xrp-sol-and-ada-to-us-crypto-reserves-has-the-expected-support-arrived/,"US President Donald Trump made a surprise announcement on Sunday about the creation of a national strategic reserve. At this point, Trump announced on Sunday that he plans to establish a reserve that includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Trump claimed that this move will allow the US to become the Cryptocurrency Capital of the world. Although the announcement was initially met with enthusiasm by markets, they cooled on Monday amid concerns about its implications. While the addition of other altcoins to the reserve besides Bitcoin and Ethereum was criticized, industry experts argued that the altcoins in question lacked the developer activity and decentralization features present in BTC and ETH. Nic Carter, General Partner at Castle Island Ventures, criticized Trump’s decision on XRP, ADA, and SOL, saying, “The government’s job is not to run a fake crypto hedge fund. It’s not their job to pick winners and losers.” Ethereum and Solana Make Sense Apart from Bitcoin! SPACE ID senior manager Harrison Seletsky said he supports Trump’s diversified crypto reserve plan but that the choices are wrong. Seletsky said that Ethereum and Solana’s inclusion in the reserve makes sense given their strong and growing developer activity. However, the famous name, who argued that it does not make sense to include XRP and ADA in the reserve, said that XRP and ADA have smaller TVL than ETH and SOL. “In my eyes, the inclusion of XRP and ADA in the reserve delegitimizes the idea of including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which are the mainstays of the industry, in the reserve.” Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime Digital Assets, also criticized the inclusion of XRP, ADA, and SOL in the reserves, saying that these are tech companies that happen to own cryptocurrencies. “These altcoins are very centralized and the sense of ownership is very intense. These altcoins are constantly changing and adapting to the market, whereas Bitcoin is a decentralized product with no owner or control group and is more similar to gold.” Trump Did It For His Own Token! Jean Rausis, co-founder of DeFi platform SMARDEX, shared the same opinion, while stating that Trump's XRP, ADA, SOL announcement was not planned. “The announcement of the US crypto reserve, which will include XRP, SOL, and ADA, is a clear sign that President Trump is trying to pump his own money. There is no benefit to having these assets in the strategic reserve. “It is clear that Bitcoin and Ethereum are much more suitable for reserves, but BTC and ETH are touted as afterthoughts.” Only Bitcoins! As a result, industry leaders have argued that Bitcoin and Ethereum make more sense for the US national reserve. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsely argued that it was only right to include Bitcoin: “I had imagined the Strategic Reserve would just be Bitcoin. That makes the most sense to me. Many crypto assets have value, but we're talking about a reserve here, not a US investment portfolio. That's why Bitcoin is arguably the best store of value in the digital age.” *This is not investment advice.

41139464,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136517,1741080893,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Asian Currencies Plunge as Trump Tariffs Loom,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asian-currencies-trump-tariffs/,"Are you watching the forex markets closely? If you are invested in or keeping an eye on Asian Currencies , you need to pay attention. A significant shift is underway in the global currency landscape, and it’s directly linked to the resurgence of trade tensions fueled by potential Trump tariffs. Let’s dive into why Asian Currencies are currently under pressure and what it means for the broader Currency Market . Why Are Asian Currencies Retreating? The Trump Tariff Effect The primary driver behind the current weakness in Asian Currencies is the increasing anticipation of new tariffs being imposed by former US President Donald Trump, should he return to office. His previous administration was marked by aggressive trade policies, and the mere prospect of a return to these policies is sending ripples through the global financial markets. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Fear of Trade Wars: Trump’s “America First” approach often involved unilateral tariff impositions, which historically led to retaliatory measures from other countries, effectively sparking trade wars. This uncertainty and potential disruption are making investors nervous about economies heavily reliant on exports, particularly in Asia. Dollar Strength as a Safe Haven: In times of global economic uncertainty or heightened risk aversion, the US Dollar tends to strengthen. Investors flock to the dollar as a safe haven asset, perceiving it as less risky compared to emerging market currencies. The threat of Trump Tariffs is injecting uncertainty into the global trade outlook, thus boosting demand for the US Dollar . Impact on Asian Economies: Many Asian Currencies are tied to economies that are heavily dependent on international trade, especially with the United States. Tariffs can significantly impact their export competitiveness, reduce economic growth, and subsequently weaken their currencies. Capital Outflows: As investors become wary of the potential negative impacts of Trump Tariffs on Asian economies, we are seeing capital outflows from these regions. Investors may move their funds to what they perceive as safer or more stable markets, further weakening Asian Currencies . The Steady Rise of the US Dollar: A Pillar of Strength Amidst Uncertainty While Asian Currencies are facing headwinds, the US Dollar is exhibiting remarkable steadiness. This isn’t just a passive stability; it’s a proactive strengthening driven by several factors: Safe Haven Demand: As mentioned earlier, the US Dollar benefits from its safe-haven status during periods of global economic unease. The looming Trump Tariffs and the associated trade tensions are creating exactly this kind of environment, driving investors towards the dollar. Strong US Economic Data: Relatively robust economic data from the United States, including employment figures and inflation indicators, supports the US Dollar . A stronger US economy makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Federal Reserve Policies: The monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve also plays a crucial role. While future rate cuts are anticipated, the current relatively higher interest rates in the US compared to some other developed economies make the US Dollar more appealing for yield-seeking investors. Geopolitical Stability (Relatively): Compared to many other regions facing geopolitical risks, the United States is often perceived as a relatively stable geopolitical environment, further enhancing the attractiveness of the US Dollar . Which Asian Currencies Are Most Affected? Not all Asian Currencies are reacting uniformly to the tariff threats. Some are experiencing more pronounced declines than others. Here’s a look at some of the currencies most under pressure: Chinese Yuan (CNY): As the world’s second-largest economy and a major trading partner of the US, China and its currency, the Yuan, are highly sensitive to US-China Trade Tensions . Any escalation in tariffs directly impacts the Chinese economy and the Yuan. South Korean Won (KRW): South Korea is another export-oriented economy heavily reliant on global trade. The Won is often seen as a bellwether for Asian economic sentiment and is susceptible to fluctuations based on trade policy developments. Taiwanese Dollar (TWD): Similar to South Korea, Taiwan’s economy is deeply integrated into global supply chains, and the Taiwanese Dollar is vulnerable to trade-related shocks. Singapore Dollar (SGD): Although Singapore is a highly developed economy, its currency is also affected by regional economic sentiment and trade flows, making it sensitive to broader Trade Tensions in Asia. Emerging Southeast Asian Currencies: Currencies like the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR), and Thai Baht (THB) can also be impacted, though potentially to varying degrees, depending on their specific trade exposures and economic fundamentals. It’s important to note that the extent of the impact can vary based on the specific details of any tariffs imposed, the retaliatory measures taken, and the overall global economic conditions at the time. Navigating the Currency Market Amidst Trump Tariff Uncertainty: What Should You Watch For? For those involved in the Currency Market , whether as traders, investors, or businesses with international exposure, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Here are some actionable insights and key factors to monitor: Trump’s Political Statements: Pay close attention to statements and policy announcements from Donald Trump and his campaign regarding trade and tariffs. These pronouncements can be leading indicators of potential market movements. US Trade Policy Developments: Monitor official US trade policy announcements, reports, and any legislative actions related to tariffs and trade agreements. Asian Economic Data: Keep an eye on economic data releases from major Asian economies, such as GDP growth, export figures, and manufacturing indices. Weakening economic data could further pressure Asian Currencies . Central Bank Actions: Watch for any interventions or policy responses from central banks in Asian countries. They may attempt to stabilize their currencies or mitigate the economic impact of trade tensions. Global Risk Sentiment: Overall global risk sentiment will continue to play a significant role. Events that heighten risk aversion will likely further strengthen the US Dollar and weigh on Asian Currencies . The Broader Implications of Trade Tensions The retreat of Asian Currencies and the strengthening of the US Dollar due to potential Trump Tariffs are not isolated events. They are symptoms of broader shifts in the global economic and political landscape. Here are some wider implications to consider: Aspect Implication Global Supply Chains Increased tariffs could further disrupt global supply chains, leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Companies may need to re-evaluate their sourcing and production strategies. Inflationary Pressures Tariffs can contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing the cost of imported goods. This could prompt central banks to adjust their monetary policies, potentially leading to higher interest rates in some economies. Geopolitical Risks Trade Tensions often exacerbate geopolitical risks. Strained trade relationships can spill over into other areas of international relations, increasing global instability. Emerging Markets Vulnerability Emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia heavily reliant on exports, are especially vulnerable to trade wars. Currency weakness, capital outflows, and reduced economic growth can pose significant challenges. Investment Strategies Investors may need to adjust their portfolios to account for increased volatility and uncertainty in currency and equity markets. Diversification and risk management become even more critical in this environment. Is This a Buying Opportunity? Or a Warning Sign? For some, the current weakness in Asian Currencies might present a buying opportunity. If you believe that the tariff threats are overblown or that Asian economies will prove resilient, then buying Asian Currencies at lower levels could be a strategic move. However, it’s equally important to recognize the risks. The potential for escalating Trade Tensions and a prolonged period of uncertainty should not be underestimated. Consider these questions: How likely are significant Trump Tariffs to be implemented? What would be the scale and scope of these tariffs? How resilient are Asian Currencies and economies to trade shocks? What are the potential retaliatory measures from affected countries? What is your risk tolerance and investment horizon? Answering these questions will help you determine whether the current situation represents an opportunity or a warning sign for your investment strategy. Conclusion: Navigating the Turbulent Waters of Global Currencies The current retreat of Asian Currencies against a steady US Dollar , driven by the specter of Trump Tariffs , underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and the profound impact of trade policy on Currency Market dynamics. Understanding these forces is essential for anyone operating in or observing the global financial landscape.

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, just dropped some exciting news that’s set to shake up the crypto index fund landscape. They’ve announced the addition of five new digital assets to their Coin50 Index. This move isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant expansion that could offer fresh opportunities for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolio and tap into broader crypto market trends . Let’s dive into what this means for you and the wider crypto sphere. What’s the Buzz About Coinbase Coin50 Index? For those new to the concept, the Coinbase Coin50 Index is designed to mirror the performance of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Think of it as a benchmark for the broader crypto market, similar to how the S&P 500 functions in traditional finance. It’s a market capitalization-weighted index, meaning that cryptocurrencies with larger market caps have a greater influence on the index’s overall movement. Coinbase also offers perpetual futures trading linked to this index, providing traders with sophisticated tools to engage with the broader crypto market. Here’s a quick rundown of why the Coin50 Index matters: Broad Market Exposure: It offers diversified exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Benchmark Performance: It serves as a performance benchmark for the overall crypto market, allowing investors to gauge market sentiment and trends. Investment Tool: With futures trading available, it’s not just an index for tracking; it’s also a tool for active trading and portfolio management. Which New Crypto Listings Are Joining the Coin50 Party? The five new digital assets joining the Coin50 Index are: Pepe (PEPE): The memecoin sensation that took the crypto world by storm. dogwifhat (WIF): Another popular memecoin, known for its Shiba Inu dog with a hat. Compound (COMP): A decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that facilitates lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies. Aptos (APT): A layer-1 blockchain focused on scalability and security, aiming to be a fast and reliable platform for decentralized applications. Aerodrome (AERO): A decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Base network, designed for efficient and low-cost trading. Why is Coinbase Expanding the Coin50 Index Now? Coinbase’s decision to add these new crypto listings to the Coin50 Index is likely driven by several factors: Market Evolution: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Including newer, trending assets like PEPE and WIF reflects the dynamic nature of the space and ensures the index remains relevant and representative. DeFi Growth: The inclusion of COMP and AERO highlights the growing importance of DeFi within the crypto ecosystem. These assets represent established and emerging players in decentralized finance. Layer-1 Innovation: Adding APT signifies the continued interest in and development of layer-1 blockchains that aim to solve scalability and efficiency issues. Investor Demand: Coinbase likely sees investor demand for exposure to a broader range of cryptocurrencies, including those that have gained significant traction recently. Benefits of Diversifying with Crypto Index Funds Like Coin50 Investing in crypto index funds , such as those linked to the Coin50 Index, can offer several compelling benefits: Diversification: The most significant advantage is instant diversification. Instead of betting on a single cryptocurrency, you’re spreading your investment across 50 assets, reducing risk associated with individual asset volatility. Simplicity: Index funds simplify crypto investing. You don’t need to research and pick individual coins; the index does the asset selection and weighting for you based on market capitalization. Passive Investment: Index investing is largely passive. The index is rebalanced periodically (Coinbase rebalances Coin50 quarterly), so you don’t need to actively manage your portfolio daily. Cost-Effectiveness: Compared to actively managed crypto funds, index funds typically have lower expense ratios, making them a cost-effective way to gain broad market exposure. Exposure to Market Growth: By tracking the top 50 cryptos, you’re positioned to benefit from the overall growth of the crypto market. As the market cap of the top cryptos increases, so should the value of the index. Let’s visualize the diversification power of crypto index funds in a table: Investment Approach Diversification Level Research Effort Management Style Potential Risk Single Cryptocurrency Low Moderate Active High (Asset-Specific) Top 10 Cryptos Portfolio Medium Moderate Active/Passive Medium Coinbase Coin50 Index High Low Passive Lower (Market-Based) Navigating the Crypto Market Trends with Coin50 Staying ahead of crypto market trends is crucial in the fast-paced world of digital assets. The Coinbase Coin50 Index can be a valuable tool for this. By tracking its performance, investors can gain insights into: Market Sentiment: The overall direction of the index reflects the general sentiment towards the broader crypto market. An upward trend suggests bullish sentiment, while a downward trend indicates bearishness. Sector Performance: Analyzing the performance of individual assets within the Coin50 Index can reveal which sectors of the crypto market are currently outperforming or underperforming (e.g., DeFi, memecoins, layer-1s). Emerging Trends: The inclusion of new assets in the index can signal emerging trends and growing investor interest in specific types of cryptocurrencies or blockchain technologies. Risk Assessment: Monitoring the volatility of the Coin50 Index can help investors assess the overall risk level in the crypto market at any given time. Are There Challenges to Consider with Crypto Index Investing? While crypto index funds offer numerous benefits, it’s essential to be aware of potential challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Even with diversification, index funds are still subject to overall market swings. Index Composition: The Coin50 Index is market cap-weighted. This means that a few large cryptocurrencies can heavily influence the index’s performance. Changes in the top crypto rankings can significantly impact the index. Rebalancing Frequency: Coinbase rebalances the Coin50 Index quarterly. This means that the index’s composition may not always perfectly reflect the very latest market trends, especially in a rapidly evolving market. Fees and Tracking Error: While generally cost-effective, index funds still have expense ratios. Additionally, there can be a slight tracking error, meaning the fund’s performance may not exactly mirror the index’s performance. Regulatory Risks: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the crypto market as a whole and, consequently, crypto index funds. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Research the New Assets: Familiarize yourself with PEPE, WIF, COMP, APT, and AERO. Understand their use cases, tokenomics, and potential risks before considering them as part of your investment strategy. Explore Coin50 Futures: If you’re an experienced trader, consider exploring Coinbase’s perpetual futures linked to the Coin50 Index. This can offer opportunities for hedging or leveraged trading (but be mindful of the risks involved in futures trading). Assess Portfolio Diversification: Evaluate your current crypto portfolio. Is it sufficiently diversified? Could a crypto index fund like Coin50 be a suitable addition to enhance diversification? Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with crypto market trends and developments. Monitor the performance of the Coin50 Index and the assets within it to make informed investment decisions. Consider Risk Tolerance: Crypto investing is inherently risky. Ensure that investing in crypto index funds aligns with your risk tolerance and overall financial goals. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Crypto Index Investing Coinbase’s addition of PEPE, WIF, COMP, APT, and AERO to the Coin50 Index is more than just a routine update. It’s a significant move that reflects the evolving nature of the crypto market and the growing demand for diversified investment options. By expanding the index to include these trending and innovative assets, Coinbase is providing investors with even broader exposure to the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or just starting your journey, understanding the Coin50 Index and its constituents can be a valuable step in navigating the dynamic crypto landscape. This update truly amplifies the potential of crypto index funds as a strategic tool for modern investors.

This move comes amid a wave of staffing changes within the regulator, signaling a potential shift in its approach to crypto enforcement. According to a March 4 Bloomberg report , the SEC sent an internal email outlining the “voluntary separation incentive” or “voluntary early retirement program.” The memo, dated February 28, was issued by SEC Chief Operating Officer Ken Johnson, inviting employees to apply for the incentive by March 21. To qualify, employees must have been on the SEC payroll before January 24 and must voluntarily exit the agency through resignation, transfer, or retirement. The memo also specifies that those who accept the incentive cannot return to the SEC for at least five years, or they must repay the entire bonus. Federal Workforce Faces Restructuring The SEC’s voluntary resignation program aligns with a broader effort by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , to downsize federal agencies. According to Reuters, DOGE has already cut more than 100,000 positions across the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce through layoffs and buyouts. The SEC has not provided an official reason for the staff reductions, but speculation is growing that the regulator is shifting its focus away from aggressive enforcement. In early February, reports emerged that the SEC was scaling back its 50-member crypto enforcement unit. Commissioner Hester Peirce also outlined a revised regulatory approach , suggesting a more balanced assessment of whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. Crypto Industry Sees Regulatory Softening The SEC’s staffing shake-up coincides with significant changes in its legal actions against the crypto industry. In recent weeks, the regulator has dropped lawsuits against several major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, and Kraken. This suggests a softening stance on crypto regulation, a stark contrast to the aggressive enforcement actions seen over the past two years. Meanwhile, the U.S. labor market remains in focus this week as investors anticipate key economic reports, including nonfarm payroll data, initial jobless claims, and the February Jobs Report. These indicators are expected to provide insight into the overall health of the economy and the potential impact of ongoing federal workforce reductions.

But a recent development in the US has sent ripples of concern through the AI community and beyond. The Trump Administration’s recent budget cuts are casting a dark shadow over the future of AI research , specifically targeting the National Science Foundation (NSF), a critical pillar of scientific advancement in the nation. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, where AI is increasingly becoming a transformative force, these developments are particularly noteworthy. Are we witnessing a setback in the progress of AI innovation due to these unexpected policy shifts? Let’s dive into the details. Why are Trump Administration Cuts Alarming for AI Research? Reports are emerging that the Trump Administration has initiated significant staff reductions at the National Science Foundation, an agency vital for nurturing scientific and engineering progress. According to Bloomberg, several NSF employees, specifically chosen for their deep AI research expertise, have been terminated. This isn’t just a routine reshuffle; it’s a strategic blow to the agency’s core capabilities. Here’s why this is raising red flags: Expertise Drain: The fired employees were specialists in AI, meaning their departure represents a loss of institutional knowledge and specialized skills crucial for guiding and evaluating AI research proposals. Directorate Disruption: The Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP), a key NSF department instrumental in channeling government grants into AI funding , is directly impacted. This directorate was designed to accelerate technological breakthroughs, and its disruption could have far-reaching consequences. Grant Funding Stalled: The immediate fallout includes the postponement or cancellation of numerous review panels. These panels are the gatekeepers of AI funding , responsible for assessing and approving research projects. The delays are already stalling funding for promising AI initiatives. This situation isn’t just about bureaucratic changes; it’s about the tangible impact on the pace and direction of AI research in the US. For the crypto world, which often benefits from and integrates the latest AI advancements, a slowdown in this sector could indirectly affect the innovation pipeline. NSF Layoffs: A Closer Look at the Impact on AI Funding The National Science Foundation plays a pivotal role in the US science and technology ecosystem. It’s a primary source of federal funding for fundamental research across various disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence. The recent NSF layoffs are not just isolated incidents; they signal a potential shift in governmental priorities and a possible contraction of support for scientific research. Let’s break down what these NSF layoffs could mean for AI funding : Impact Area Description Potential Consequence Grant Review Process Layoffs lead to the cancellation/postponement of review panels. Delays in approving and disbursing AI funding , hindering project timelines. Directorate for TIP Disruption of a key directorate focused on technology, innovation, and partnerships in AI. Reduced efficiency in identifying and supporting cutting-edge AI research initiatives. Expertise Within NSF Loss of experienced AI specialists within the NSF due to layoffs. Weakened capacity to strategically guide and evaluate future AI research proposals and funding allocations. Overall Research Ecosystem Potential chilling effect on the broader scientific community and discouragement for researchers seeking federal grants. Slower progress in AI research and development, potentially impacting US competitiveness in the global AI landscape. The table illustrates a cascading effect. The initial NSF layoffs trigger disruptions in grant processing, weaken institutional expertise, and could ultimately dampen the entire AI research ecosystem. For those watching the intersection of crypto and AI, this warrants close attention as it could shape the future technological landscape. Elon Musk Criticism and the Department of Government Efficiency Adding another layer of complexity to this situation is the involvement of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. AI experts have voiced strong disapproval of the Trump Administration cuts to scientific grant-making, particularly those championed by this department. Geoffrey Hinton, a luminary in the AI field and Nobel Laureate, didn’t mince words in his critique. He publicly called for Elon Musk’s expulsion from the British Royal Society, citing the “huge damage he is doing to scientific institutions in the U.S.”. This is a powerful statement from a respected figure in the scientific community, highlighting the gravity of the situation. Musk responded on X, acknowledging the possibility of mistakes and expressing a commitment to correction. However, the core concern remains: are these Trump Administration cuts , influenced by a focus on efficiency, undermining critical areas of scientific research, specifically AI research , which is vital for future innovation and economic growth? The debate underscores a fundamental tension between fiscal austerity and long-term investment in science and technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI Innovation? The implications of these Trump Administration cuts and NSF layoffs could be profound. While the immediate impact is on AI funding and research projects, the long-term consequences could reshape the landscape of AI innovation in the United States. Consider these potential future scenarios: Brain Drain: Reduced funding and instability in research environments could lead to top AI talent leaving the US for countries with more supportive research ecosystems. Slowed Innovation: Delays and reductions in AI funding can stifle groundbreaking research, potentially pushing the US behind in the global AI race. Economic Impact: AI is projected to be a major economic driver. Hampering AI research could weaken US competitiveness and future economic prosperity. National Security: AI is increasingly critical for national security. Cuts in this area could have implications for defense and strategic technological advantage. For the crypto and blockchain community, these developments are a reminder that the broader technological ecosystem is interconnected. Progress in AI can fuel advancements in blockchain and vice versa. A setback in one area can have ripple effects across the entire tech landscape. It remains to be seen how this situation will evolve, but the alarm bells are ringing loudly within the scientific and tech communities. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for US AI Research The Trump Administration cuts and subsequent NSF layoffs represent a critical juncture for AI research in the United States. While the administration’s rationale might be rooted in fiscal efficiency, the potential damage to the nation’s scientific infrastructure and future innovation pipeline cannot be ignored. The concerns raised by AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton and the visible disruptions in AI funding processes underscore the urgency of this situation. As the world increasingly looks towards AI as a transformative technology, these developments warrant close scrutiny and raise important questions about the future of US leadership in AI innovation. The crypto world, deeply intertwined with technological advancements, should be keenly aware of these shifts and their potential long-term impact.

41139695,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136495,1741081354,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Confident Prediction: Bitcoin to Boom as US Stock Market Bottoms Out, Says BitMEX Co-founder",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-boom-stock-market-bottom/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! Are you ready for a potential market shift that could send Bitcoin soaring? According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, the wait might not be long. In a recent blog post, Hayes delivered a compelling Bitcoin price prediction , suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) is not only nearing its bottom but is also poised to lead a powerful recovery, even before the traditional markets find their footing. Decoding Hayes’ Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction Hayes, a prominent voice in the crypto sphere, isn’t known for mincing words. His latest analysis points towards a fascinating divergence between Bitcoin and the U.S. stock market. He notes that Bitcoin reached a staggering high of around $110,000 just before a significant U.S. political event, only to correct by about 30% to approximately $78,000. While a 30% drop might sound alarming, Hayes views this as a healthy correction within a larger Bitcoin bullish cycle . He confidently asserts that the critical support level for Bitcoin lies at $70,000, marking the peak of the previous market cycle. Let’s break down Hayes’ key arguments: Bitcoin’s Resilience: Despite the recent dip, Hayes emphasizes Bitcoin’s inherent strength and its position within a continuing bullish trend. He sees the $70,000 level as a robust floor. Historical Context: He draws on historical price action, noting the previous cycle’s peak as a crucial support indicator. Liquidity Signals: Hayes highlights the declining U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) as a positive sign, indicating increased liquidity in the market. Why Crypto Market Recovery Could Be Bitcoin-Led? Hayes’ analysis isn’t just about Bitcoin’s individual trajectory; it’s about its potential leadership in a broader crypto market recovery . He suggests that Bitcoin, being a more agile and sentiment-driven asset compared to traditional stocks, is likely to bottom out and rebound faster. This is a significant point for investors looking for early signals of market turnaround. Consider these factors supporting Hayes’ view on Bitcoin leading the crypto recovery: Factor Description Implication for Bitcoin Market Sentiment Crypto markets are heavily influenced by sentiment and narratives, which can shift rapidly. Positive news or shifts in macroeconomic outlook can quickly drive Bitcoin’s price upwards. Technological Advancements Ongoing developments in blockchain technology and crypto adoption continue to build long-term value. Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, benefits directly from increased adoption and technological progress. Decentralization Appeal In times of economic uncertainty, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin becomes more attractive to investors seeking alternatives to traditional systems. Bitcoin’s inherent properties as a decentralized and finite asset position it as a safe haven during financial turmoil. The U.S. Stock Market Bottom and Its Ripple Effect The connection between Bitcoin and the US stock market bottom is central to Hayes’ thesis. He posits that while Bitcoin might experience a brief dip to $70,000 if traditional risk assets face a sharp sell-off, its bottom will likely precede that of the stock market. This is a crucial insight for investors trying to time their market entries. Hayes points to the declining TGA as a potential catalyst. A shrinking TGA often indicates increased liquidity in the financial system, which can be beneficial for risk assets like Bitcoin. However, it’s important to remember that market dynamics are complex, and various factors can influence both the stock market and Bitcoin. Key takeaways regarding the U.S. stock market’s influence: Intermarket Dynamics: While Bitcoin is increasingly correlated with traditional markets, Hayes believes it will decouple and lead the recovery. TGA as a Liquidity Indicator: The U.S. Treasury General Account’s balance is a key metric to watch for liquidity shifts. Potential Sell-offs: Be prepared for potential short-term dips in Bitcoin if the stock market experiences significant downturns. Arthur Hayes Bitcoin Strategy: Accumulate and Hold for the Long Haul Hayes isn’t just making predictions; he’s also outlining a strategy. He reiterates his approach of steadily accumulating Bitcoin during market downturns, emphasizing a leverage-free approach. His long-term vision remains incredibly bullish, anticipating a major financial transformation that could propel Bitcoin’s price past the $1 million mark. This isn’t just short-term speculation; it’s a long-term conviction based on macroeconomic trends and Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. Hayes’ actionable insights for investors: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Consider a strategy of regularly buying Bitcoin, especially during price dips, to average out your entry point. Avoid Leverage: Hayes strongly advises against using leverage in volatile markets, focusing on long-term accumulation of actual Bitcoin. Long-Term Perspective: Adopt a long-term investment horizon, recognizing Bitcoin’s potential to appreciate significantly over time. Conclusion: Is Bitcoin Poised for a Major Rebound? Arthur Hayes’ analysis presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s imminent rebound and its potential to lead the next crypto market recovery . His Bitcoin price prediction , grounded in market analysis and historical context, offers a beacon of hope for crypto investors navigating market uncertainties. While caution is always advised in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, Hayes’ confident stance and strategic recommendations provide valuable insights. The confluence of factors he highlights – Bitcoin’s resilience, declining TGA, and potential stock market bottom – paints a picture of a potentially explosive upward trajectory for Bitcoin. Is this the moment to strategically position yourself for the next crypto boom? Hayes certainly seems to think so.

41139696,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136492,1741081381,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting First: Japan’s Dojima Exchange Set to Launch Revolutionary Bitcoin Futures Trading,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dojima-exchange-bitcoin-futures-trading/,"Get ready for a groundbreaking development in the Asian cryptocurrency landscape! Japan’s Dojima Exchange, a well-established futures exchange based in Osaka, is poised to potentially revolutionize the way investors in Asia engage with Bitcoin futures trading . According to a recent Bloomberg report, Dojima Exchange is gearing up to file an application with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) this month, seeking approval to list Bitcoin futures products. This move is fueled by the burgeoning number of crypto enthusiasts and a significant surge in the demand for sophisticated crypto futures exchange options within Japan. If the FSA gives the green light, Dojima will etch its name in history as the first traditional exchange in Asia to offer Bitcoin futures trading . Let’s delve into what this exciting development means for the crypto world. Why is Dojima Exchange Venturing into Bitcoin Futures Trading? The decision by Dojima Exchange to explore Bitcoin futures trading is not arbitrary. It’s a strategic response to several key factors shaping the current financial environment in Japan and beyond: Surging Crypto Investor Base: Japan has consistently been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. The nation boasts a significant and continuously growing population of crypto investors who are increasingly looking for diverse investment avenues within the digital asset space. Increased Demand for Futures Trading: As the cryptocurrency market matures, so does the sophistication of its investors. There’s a rising demand for tools that allow for more nuanced trading strategies, including hedging and leveraged positions. Crypto futures exchange platforms provide precisely these capabilities, making them highly attractive to experienced traders and institutions. Filling a Market Gap: Currently, no traditional exchange in Asia offers Bitcoin futures. This presents a clear gap in the market that Dojima Exchange is aiming to fill. By becoming the first mover in this space, Dojima could attract substantial trading volume and establish itself as a leading platform for Bitcoin futures trading in Asia. Understanding Bitcoin Futures: A Quick Overview For those new to the concept, Bitcoin futures trading might seem complex. In essence, futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset, in this case, Bitcoin, at a predetermined price on a future date. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Feature Description Contract An agreement to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price on a future date. Futures Price The agreed-upon price for Bitcoin in the future contract. Expiration Date The date when the futures contract expires and must be settled. Leverage Futures trading often involves leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with less capital. This amplifies both potential profits and losses. Hedging Futures can be used to hedge against price volatility. For example, miners can use futures to lock in a future selling price for their Bitcoin. The Role of the FSA Approval in Japan’s Crypto Market The FSA approval is a critical step for Dojima Exchange’s plan. The Financial Services Agency in Japan is known for its stringent regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges. Obtaining FSA approval signifies that Dojima Exchange will operate under a regulated and compliant environment, offering a level of security and trust that is paramount for both institutional and retail investors. The FSA approval process typically involves a thorough review of various aspects of the exchange’s operations, including: Security Measures: Ensuring robust security protocols to protect user funds and data. Compliance Framework: Adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations. Operational Stability: Demonstrating the exchange’s capacity to handle trading volumes and maintain operational integrity. Investor Protection: Implementing measures to safeguard investors and ensure fair trading practices. If Dojima Exchange successfully navigates the FSA approval process, it will not only legitimize its crypto futures exchange but also contribute to the overall maturity and credibility of the cryptocurrency market in Japan. Impact on the Japan Crypto Market and Beyond Dojima Exchange’s potential foray into Bitcoin futures trading is expected to have significant ripple effects across the Japan crypto market and potentially the broader Asian region: Increased Institutional Participation: A regulated crypto futures exchange operated by a traditional player like Dojima could attract more institutional investors who have been hesitant to enter the crypto market due to regulatory uncertainties and lack of established platforms. Enhanced Market Liquidity: The introduction of Bitcoin futures on a traditional exchange can boost market liquidity, making it easier for traders to execute large orders without significantly impacting prices. Greater Price Discovery: Futures markets contribute to price discovery by reflecting the collective expectations of market participants about future price movements. This can lead to more efficient and transparent price formation for Bitcoin. Competitive Landscape: Dojima’s move could spur other traditional exchanges in Asia to consider offering crypto derivatives, fostering competition and innovation in the market. Global Recognition: Japan’s continued embrace of cryptocurrency innovation, exemplified by Dojima’s initiative, reinforces its position as a leading hub for digital assets on the global stage. What are the Potential Challenges? While the prospect of Dojima Exchange launching Bitcoin futures trading is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Obtaining FSA approval can be a lengthy and complex process. There’s no guarantee that the application will be approved in the anticipated timeframe, or at all. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. This inherent volatility can pose risks to both the exchange and traders, especially in leveraged futures trading. Competition from Existing Crypto Exchanges: Dojima will face competition from established cryptocurrency exchanges that already offer Bitcoin futures. To succeed, Dojima will need to differentiate itself through its regulatory compliance, service offerings, or target audience. Educating Traditional Investors: Traditional futures traders might need education on the nuances of cryptocurrency markets and the specific risks and opportunities associated with Bitcoin futures trading . Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors Here’s what you should be paying attention to in light of this development: Monitor FSA Approval News: Keep an eye on news related to Dojima Exchange’s FSA approval application. This will be a key indicator of whether and when Bitcoin futures trading might launch on the exchange. Understand Futures Trading: If you’re interested in Bitcoin futures trading , now is a good time to educate yourself about futures contracts, leverage, risk management, and trading strategies. Track Japan Crypto Market Trends: Follow developments in the Japan crypto market . Dojima’s move could signal broader trends in regulatory acceptance and institutional adoption in the region. Compare Platforms: When Dojima Bitcoin futures (if approved) become available, compare their offerings with existing crypto futures exchange platforms in terms of fees, leverage, security, and user interface to make informed trading decisions. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Asian Crypto Futures Dojima Exchange’s plan to list Bitcoin futures trading is a significant leap forward for the Asian cryptocurrency market. It represents a convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, potentially opening doors for greater institutional participation, enhanced market maturity, and increased accessibility to sophisticated crypto investment tools in Japan and beyond. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of this initiative are undeniable, signaling a vibrant and evolving future for crypto futures exchange landscape in Asia.

Nasdaq, a leading global exchange, has just taken a significant step that could potentially revolutionize how investors access Hedera (HBAR). They’ve officially filed a 19b-4 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade the Grayscale Hedera ETF. This move, reported by Cointelegraph, signals a growing institutional interest in Hedera and the broader digital asset market. But what does this mean for you, and what are the implications for the future of crypto ETFs? Let’s dive into the details. What is the Buzz About the Grayscale Hedera ETF? The core of this exciting development is the Grayscale Hedera ETF . An ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is essentially a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock. In this case, the proposed ETF would hold Hedera (HBAR), allowing investors to gain exposure to this cryptocurrency without directly holding the digital asset themselves. Grayscale Investments, a well-known digital asset manager, is behind this initiative, further adding credibility and weight to this filing. Nasdaq’s filing of the 19b-4 filing is a crucial step in this process. A 19b-4 is a form required by the SEC for exchanges to propose new rules, in this case, rules to list and trade a new ETF. It’s essentially asking the SEC for permission to make the Grayscale Hedera ETF available for trading on the Nasdaq exchange. This is not a simple formality; it kicks off a review process by the SEC to determine if the ETF meets all regulatory requirements and protects investors. Why is a Nasdaq ETF Listing a Big Deal for Hedera? Listing on Nasdaq is a significant milestone for any ETF, and especially for a Hedera ETF . Here’s why it matters: Increased Accessibility: An ETF makes investing in Hedera significantly more accessible to a broader range of investors. Many traditional investors are more comfortable investing through regulated exchanges and familiar investment vehicles like ETFs rather than directly buying and managing digital assets. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs traded on major exchanges like Nasdaq typically enjoy high liquidity. This means investors can easily buy and sell shares of the Hedera ETF, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery for HBAR itself. Institutional Adoption: A Nasdaq-listed crypto ETF signals a growing acceptance and institutionalization of digital assets. It opens the door for institutional investors, who often have mandates to invest in regulated and easily accessible products, to allocate capital to Hedera. Validation for Hedera: The fact that a major institution like Grayscale is proposing a Hedera ETF, and a leading exchange like Nasdaq is willing to list it, is a strong validation of Hedera’s technology, ecosystem, and long-term potential. What are the Potential Benefits of Investing in a Hedera ETF? For investors, a Hedera ETF offers several compelling benefits: Simplified Exposure to HBAR: Investing in an ETF eliminates the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing HBAR tokens. You can gain exposure through a traditional brokerage account. Diversification: Adding a Hedera ETF to your portfolio can potentially diversify your investment holdings and provide exposure to the cryptocurrency market without the need to deeply understand the underlying technology. Regulation and Transparency: ETFs are regulated investment products, offering a level of transparency and investor protection that may be lacking in direct cryptocurrency investments. Potential for Growth: Hedera Hashgraph is a promising technology with various real-world applications. If Hedera’s ecosystem grows and adoption increases, the value of HBAR, and consequently the Hedera ETF, could potentially appreciate. What Challenges and Hurdles Does the Grayscale Hedera ETF Face? While the Nasdaq filing is positive, the crypto ETF still faces challenges: SEC Approval Process: The SEC’s approval process for crypto ETFs has been historically cautious and lengthy. There’s no guarantee that the Grayscale Hedera ETF will be approved, or how long the review process might take. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. The value of HBAR and the Hedera ETF could experience significant price swings, which investors need to be prepared for. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the ETF and the broader crypto market. Competition: The crypto ETF market is becoming increasingly competitive. The success of the Grayscale Hedera ETF will depend on its structure, fees, and investor demand compared to other available options. What are the Next Steps for the Hedera ETF? The immediate next step is for the SEC to review the 19b-4 filing . This involves a period of public comment and evaluation by the SEC staff. The SEC will consider various factors, including market surveillance, investor protection, and the underlying assets. Here’s a simplified timeline: Stage Description 19b-4 Filing Nasdaq submits the 19b-4 form to the SEC to propose listing the Grayscale Hedera ETF. SEC Review The SEC begins its review process, including soliciting public comments. Potential Delays The SEC can extend the review period if needed to gather more information or address concerns. Decision The SEC will ultimately approve or disapprove the 19b-4 application. Listing (if approved) If approved, the Grayscale Hedera ETF will be listed and begin trading on the Nasdaq exchange. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do? While the Grayscale Hedera ETF is not yet available, here are some actionable insights for investors: Stay Informed: Keep following news and updates regarding the SEC’s review of the 19b-4 filing. Cointelegraph and other reputable crypto news sources are good resources. Research Hedera: If you’re interested in the Hedera ETF, now is a good time to research Hedera Hashgraph, its technology, use cases, and potential. Understand the underlying asset before considering investing in the ETF. Assess Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment goals before considering any investment in a Hedera ETF or HBAR directly. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek advice from a qualified financial advisor to determine if a Hedera ETF aligns with your overall investment strategy. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Hedera and Crypto ETFs Nasdaq’s groundbreaking filing for the Grayscale Hedera ETF marks a significant advancement for both Hedera and the broader crypto ETF market. It represents a major step towards mainstream adoption of digital assets, offering investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to HBAR. While SEC approval is not guaranteed, this development underscores the growing institutional interest and maturity of the cryptocurrency space. The potential listing of a Nasdaq ETF for Hedera is undoubtedly something to watch closely, as it could pave the way for further innovation and investment in the digital asset ecosystem.

Pi Coin price recorded a surge of over 5% today despite a broader crypto market selloff, with BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL losing between 9% and 15% each. Besides, the crypto has also secured 11th place as a top asset by market cap, outpacing Hedera despite the HBAR ETF hype. Pi Network Outpaces Hedera: Here’s All Pi Network has secured 11th place on the top crypto ranking, surpassing the market cap of Hedera. Besides, it also emerged as a clear winner despite a broader crypto market selloff, with more than $1 billion in liquidation over the last 24 hours. Notably, this comes as Pi Coin value added more than 5% and exchanged hands at $1.73, after touching a 24-hour high of $1.85. On a weekly basis, the crypto has added 11% reaching a market cap of $12.02 billion. On the other hand, the 12th ranked crypto, Hedera price today was down 7% to $0.2303 with a market cap of $9.65 billion. Notably, this decline comes despite the recent hype over the HBAR ETF launch in the US with Grayscale’s 19b-4 Hedera ETF filing with the US SEC. However, it appears that the optimism faded due to the broader crypto market selloff. Top Crypto By Market Cap What’s Next For Pi Coin Price?

This development, if happens, could significantly boost the crypto’s appeal to the investors. On the other hand, crypto has also gained notable traction recently, as it extended deadlines for KYC and mainnet migration for Pioneers. This extension, as per their announcement, is the last chance for the traders to migrate to the mainnet. A Closer Look Into The Recent Market Trends The market also discussed Pi Coin’s potential to be added to the US Crypto Reserve asset in the coming days. For context, Donald Trump has reiterated his pledge to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Besides, he also revealed plans to add US-issued altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA alongside Bitcoin as a Strategic asset. Having said that, the community anticipates Pi Network to be added as a US Strategic Reserve asset in the near future. This development, if happens, could further trigger a robust rally in the asset’s price. Meanwhile, all eyes are now on the upcoming Pi Day on Friday, March 14. A flurry of market experts anticipates positive announcements or key developments regarding the Pi Coin on this date. Notably, a Pi Coin enthusiast Dr Picoin recently said that as the crypto is retesting the $1.8 resistance, it is likely that it will soar past the $2 mark again this week.

41139828,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136485,1741081657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Trump’s Shocking Ukraine Aid Cut – How Will Global Instability Impact Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-ukraine-aid-global-instability/,"In a dramatic turn of events shaking the foundations of international relations, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly ended all military aid to Ukraine. This seismic shift in US foreign policy , as reported by Watcher Guru on X, has sent ripples of concern across the globe. For those in the cryptocurrency sphere, where markets are sensitive to geopolitical tremors, this news arrives at a critical juncture. But what exactly does this mean, and how could it potentially impact the volatile world of digital assets? Decoding the Shocking Halt to Ukraine Military Aid The abrupt cessation of Ukraine military aid by the United States marks a significant departure from previous policies. While details remain sparse, the implications are potentially far-reaching. Let’s break down what we know and what this could signify: The Announcement: The news surfaced via a post from Watcher Guru on X, a platform known for disseminating financial and political updates. While official confirmation from U.S. government sources is pending, the report has already ignited widespread discussion and speculation. Potential Motivations: The reasons behind this decision are currently unclear. Speculation ranges from shifting US foreign policy priorities to domestic political considerations. It’s crucial to monitor official statements and evolving narratives to understand the underlying rationale. Immediate Impact: The immediate fallout is likely to be felt most acutely in Ukraine, which has been reliant on international military assistance. The move could embolden adversaries and alter the balance of power in the region. Global Reactions: Expect a spectrum of reactions from global leaders and international bodies. Allies may express concern, while adversaries could perceive this as an opportunity. The diplomatic ramifications are just beginning to unfold. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Geopolitical Risk ? You might be wondering, what does this geopolitical development have to do with cryptocurrency? The answer lies in the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets. Here’s why crypto investors should be paying close attention: Market Volatility: Geopolitical risk is a notorious catalyst for market volatility. Uncertainty breeds fear, and fear often translates to market fluctuations. Both traditional and cryptocurrency markets can experience heightened volatility in response to significant geopolitical events. Safe Haven Assets: In times of global instability , investors often seek safe haven assets. Historically, assets like gold have played this role. Some argue that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are emerging as modern-day digital gold, offering a hedge against traditional market turmoil and currency devaluation. Economic Uncertainty and Inflation: Major shifts in international relations can trigger economic uncertainty . Military aid cuts and their cascading effects can influence economic stability, trade relations, and even inflation rates. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes viewed as a hedge against inflation, making them potentially more attractive during periods of economic instability. Decentralization Appeal: Geopolitical tensions can underscore the appeal of decentralized systems. In a world facing increased uncertainty and potential disruptions to traditional financial channels, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies becomes a more compelling feature for some investors. Navigating the Waters of Global Instability : What’s Next? The situation is fluid, and the full consequences of this US foreign policy shift are yet to be seen. However, for crypto investors, here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news developments from reputable sources. Monitor official statements from governments and international organizations to understand the evolving situation. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is always a prudent strategy, especially during times of uncertainty. Consider diversifying across different asset classes, including a mix of cryptocurrencies, and potentially traditional safe haven assets. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Geopolitical risk can amplify market swings, so ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level for volatility. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions can be dramatic, maintain a long-term perspective. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their cyclical nature. Focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of your crypto investments amidst short-term turbulence. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of high volatility, stablecoins can offer a safe harbor within the crypto ecosystem. They provide a way to reduce exposure to market fluctuations while remaining within the digital asset space. The Unfolding Story of Economic Uncertainty and Crypto’s Role The decision to halt military aid to Ukraine injects a significant dose of economic uncertainty into the global landscape. How this unfolds will be crucial for all markets, including cryptocurrencies. Will this event trigger a flight to safety? Will crypto markets react as a hedge, or will they be swept up in broader market downturns? These are the pressing questions facing investors now. It’s essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is still relatively young and reactive to global news cycles. Events like this can serve as stress tests, revealing how digital assets behave under pressure. While the immediate impact remains to be seen, the long-term implications for the adoption and perception of cryptocurrencies as alternative assets are definitely in play. In conclusion, the reported halt of US military aid to Ukraine is a significant geopolitical event with potential ramifications for global markets, including the cryptocurrency space. By staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective, crypto investors can navigate these uncertain times and potentially position themselves to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The intersection of geopolitics and crypto is becoming increasingly important, and this latest development underscores the need for vigilance and informed decision-making in the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.

XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin’s Halving Cycle: Is Now the Time to Invest in Digital Gold? Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, created to change how we use money. It was introduced by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto. Instead of relying on banks, Bitcoin lets people send money directly to each other. This is done through a technology called blockchain, which is like a shared ledger that everyone can see. Miners help keep the network secure by solving puzzles, and they get rewarded with bitcoins. This system aims to prevent fraud and keep transactions safe. One unique feature of Bitcoin is the “halving” that happens every four years. This means the rewards for miners are cut in half, making bitcoins more scarce. With a limited supply of 21 million coins, this scarcity can increase demand. As the market evolves, some see Bitcoin as a good investment compared to other cryptocurrencies. Its potential lies in its decentralized nature and strong security. While the market can be volatile, many believe that Bitcoin’s technology and growing acceptance make it an attractive option in today’s digital economy. Ethereum’s Next Leap: How ETH Is Shaping the Future of Blockchain Ethereum isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a game-changer in the blockchain world. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it has introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps. This has opened doors to decentralized finance, where people can access financial services without traditional banks. The shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 made Ethereum more efficient and eco-friendly. Solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon are speeding up transactions and cutting costs. Ether (ETH) is at the heart of it all, used for transactions, rewards for stakers, and as a valuable asset. In today’s market, Ethereum shows strong potential. Its continuous upgrades aim to make it faster and cheaper to use. The upcoming sharding phase is set to boost its scalability even more. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s active development and wide use give it an advantage. Trends show that Ethereum often benefits from market cycles influenced by Bitcoin halvings. With its solid technology and growing ecosystem, Ethereum stands out as an attractive option in the crypto space right now. Solana’s SOL Coin: Speed and Scalability in the Crypto World Solana is a blockchain platform that puts speed and scalability first. Competing with networks like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps. What makes Solana stand out is its design choices aimed at faster transactions. Developers can build on Solana using various programming languages, giving them flexibility. At the center of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. More than just a coin, SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. In today’s market, SOL shows promising potential. Its value lies in supporting the Solana ecosystem, rewarding participants, and giving users access to a range of projects. Unlike some other platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale. This unique approach makes it appealing to developers and investors looking for a high-capacity network. With the increasing demand for fast and efficient blockchain solutions, SOL stands out as an attractive option. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Solana’s focus on speed and scalability could give it an edge over competitors. A Fast and Borderless Future: Exploring the Potential of XRP In the world of digital currencies, XRP stands out as a cryptocurrency built for speed and efficiency. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP operates on the XRP Ledger—a decentralized system without a central authority. This means transactions are secure, irreversible, and don’t require a bank account for settlements. With its design as a digitally native, programmable currency, XRP offers fast, low-cost transactions that cross borders effortlessly. Its name, derived from “ripple credits,” reflects its mission to enable seamless payment transfers across various currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP’s potential lies in its ability to facilitate quick and cheap transactions, making it an attractive option compared to other cryptocurrencies that face high fees and slower processing times. Ripple, the company associated with XRP, holds a significant amount of XRP in escrow, releasing it in a controlled manner to support network liquidity and the ecosystem. This approach aims to prevent inflation and maintain value. As the world moves toward more digital and decentralized finance solutions, XRP’s technology and purpose position it as a promising player worth watching in the cryptocurrency market. Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable Crypto Revolution Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, like Ethereum, but with a twist. Its native coin, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and even stake on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on being flexible, sustainable, and scalable. Instead of using the energy-hungry proof-of-work system like Bitcoin, Cardano uses a proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros. This means it’s much more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Another innovative aspect is Cardano’s two-layer structure. The Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer deals with smart contracts. This setup boosts its ability to process transactions—potentially up to a million per second. With the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, interacting with smart contracts became more secure and cost-effective. In the current market, ADA looks attractive, especially for those concerned about sustainability in crypto. Compared to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA offers similar features but with greater efficiency and scalability. As the demand for eco-friendly cryptocurrencies grows, Cardano’s unique approach positions it well for future success.

Others like Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson advocate for a multi-token approach. Meanwhile, Australia rejected similar plans, and is rather prioritizing regulatory frameworks over accumulation. Bitcoin Only True Reserve Asset? The debate over which cryptocurrencies should be included in the United States’ proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve intensified after President Donald Trump’s announcement of the initiative. The reserve is expected to include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP, which attracted very differing opinions from key figures in the cryptocurrency space. Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss argued that only Bitcoin meets the criteria for being a US reserve asset, and stated that it is the only digital asset that qualifies as “hard money” and a “proven store of value like gold.” While he acknowledged that many other cryptocurrencies have their place in the market and are listed on Gemini, he insisted that a strategic reserve should stick to higher standards. His brother and Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss agreed , and added that Ethereum could potentially be considered alongside Bitcoin, comparing them to America’s physical gold and oil reserves. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared a similar perspective, and suggested that Bitcoin alone will be the best choice because of its simplicity and status as the most widely recognized and accepted digital asset. However, he also proposed an alternative approach, where the US could adopt a market cap-weighted index of cryptocurrencies to eliminate potential bias in asset selection. Bitcoin advocate and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow took a stricter stance by arguing that only proof-of-work cryptocurrencies should be included in the reserve. He claimed that proof-of-stake assets, like Solana and Cardano, are susceptible to manipulation by foreign actors who could gain control simply by acquiring a large amount of the tokens. In his view, Bitcoin and potentially Litecoin will be the only suitable assets. Despite the skepticism from Bitcoin maximalists, executives from Cardano and Ripple defended the inclusion of their respective tokens. Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson rejected criticism from gold advocate Peter Schiff, and said that XRP demonstrated resilience and maintained a strong community over the years. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also long supported a multi-token reserve. The Crypto Strategic Reserve proposal was made after extensive discussions from Trump’s newly established Working Group on Digital Assets, which has been evaluating its structure and potential impact. Trump is also set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, where discussions will cover regulatory policies, stablecoin oversight, and broader crypto market dynamics. Crypto Leaders Debate Trump’s Vision Although Donald Trump’s plan to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve has been met with some optimism in the industry, experts still warn that it does not replace the need for clearer regulatory guidelines. Patrick Young , go-to-market lead at Web3 app Galxe, believes that while the initiative signals growing government interest in crypto, long-term growth will depend on regulatory clarity. Trump’s announcement led to a short-term surge in crypto prices. Bitcoin briefly climbed above $90,000 before settling, and Cardano saw an even sharper reaction after gaining more than 40% in the first 24 hours after the news. According to Young, while crypto reserve developments can drive short-term price movements, industry-friendly regulations will play a much bigger role in sustaining long-term growth. ADA’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Trump has taken steps toward a more pro-crypto regulatory environment by appointing leadership at key agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that advanced a number of crypto-related applications that were previously stalled under the prior administration. Many in the industry are looking forward to new SEC leadership clarifying what constitutes a security, especially after the agency stated in February that meme coins are unlikely to fall under that classification. (Source: SEC ) Despite the optimism, Trump’s inclusion of altcoins also attracted criticism, with some questioning whether the move could benefit his personal crypto holdings. Young pointed out that Trump accumulated various altcoins through entities under his control, which certainly raises serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, Adam O’Brien , CEO of Bitcoin Well, warned that including altcoins in a government reserve introduces centralization risks. He argued that if centralized assets are considered, traditional blue-chip stocks could just as easily be part of the reserve. While the proposal stirred excitement and price movements, it also raised many questions about how a government-backed crypto reserve should be structured and what assets should be included. Australia Rejects Crypto Reserve Plans Australia’s government has no plans to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, despite recent moves by the United States under President Donald Trump. While a number of US states are also considering adding cryptocurrency to their balance sheets, Australia’s current ruling party is focused on regulation rather than accumulation. A spokesperson for Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones confirmed that the government is prioritizing a regulatory framework for digital asset platforms. The government has been engaging with industry stakeholders to develop a tailored regulatory approach. It is, however, important to keep in mind that with Australia’s federal election looming before May 17, the political landscape may soon shift. A recent YouGov poll shows the opposition coalition holding a slight lead over the current Labor government. However, the coalition has not commented on whether it will consider a different stance on a crypto reserve. Industry experts are still very divided on the practicality of a national crypto reserve. Tom Matthews , head of corporate affairs at Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, believes that while the idea is popular, it carries a lot of risks. He pointed out that cryptocurrency price volatility could undermine the effectiveness of a strategic reserve, making it difficult to gain political traction. He also suggested that a more feasible approach might be the creation of a sovereign wealth fund with long-term crypto holdings. Jonathon Miller, managing director for Australia at Kraken, argued that cryptocurrency has already been recognized as an investment-grade asset. He specifically pointed to the presence of crypto ETFs on major exchanges and investments from superannuation and sovereign wealth funds. Miller suggested that institutions like the Future Fund and even the Australian Treasury should consider allocating assets to crypto. Meanwhile, regulatory oversight of the crypto industry in Australia is increasing. In December, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center CEO Brendan Thomas announced that the agency will shift its focus toward crypto in 2025, including a crackdown on crypto ATM providers that may not comply with anti-money laundering laws. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission also released a consultation paper in December, proposing that many digital assets be classified as financial products. This will require firms to obtain proper licensing.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|ADA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-04 09:49:02
41139854,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136476,1741081779,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Uncertainty Looms: Analysts Question Altcoins in US Crypto Reserve, Bitcoin’s ‘Digital Gold’ Status Solid",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/analysts-question-altcoins-crypto-reserve/,"The idea of a national crypto reserve is gaining traction, especially in the U.S., but a crucial question is emerging: should it be more than just Bitcoin? Recent statements from former President Trump have ignited discussions about including a basket of cryptocurrencies in a strategic crypto reserve, moving beyond just Bitcoin. But are altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) really suitable for a national reserve? Let’s dive into the insightful analysis from Bernstein and explore the complexities. The Bitcoin ‘Digital Gold’ Argument for a Crypto Reserve Bernstein analysts, in their March 3rd note, highlighted a key distinction: Bitcoin’s position as “digital gold.” This narrative, which resonates with many crypto enthusiasts and increasingly with institutional investors, provides a strong rationale for including Bitcoin (BTC) in a crypto reserve . Think of it like a digital-age equivalent of gold reserves held by central banks – a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a globally recognized asset. Here’s why Bitcoin fits the ‘digital gold’ narrative: Limited Supply: Just like gold, Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it inherently scarce. This scarcity is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of any single government or entity, offering a level of independence and resilience that appeals to the idea of a reserve asset. Established Network: Bitcoin boasts the most mature and robust blockchain network, with a proven track record of security and uptime. Global Recognition: Bitcoin is the most widely recognized and accepted cryptocurrency globally, making it a liquid and easily tradable asset. The Altcoin Conundrum: Why Question Inclusion in a Crypto Reserve? While the case for Bitcoin in a crypto reserve seems relatively clear-cut, the inclusion of altcoins like ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA raises significant questions. Bernstein analysts point out that the rationale for holding these cryptocurrencies in a national reserve is far less obvious. Unlike Bitcoin’s established narrative as ‘digital gold’, altcoins operate in a more diverse and, arguably, less defined space. Here’s the challenge with integrating altcoins into a national crypto reserve: Lack of Clear Narrative: While each altcoin has its own use case and community, none currently possess the broadly accepted ‘store of value’ narrative that Bitcoin enjoys. Ethereum, for example, is more focused on smart contracts and decentralized applications, while XRP is geared towards payment solutions. SOL and ADA are focused on blockchain scalability and ecosystem development. These are valuable technologies, but are they reserve assets? Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for altcoins is still evolving and often unclear, especially in the U.S. This uncertainty can pose risks for a national reserve, as regulatory actions could significantly impact the value and usability of these assets. Volatility and Market Maturity: Compared to Bitcoin, many altcoins exhibit higher volatility and are part of less mature markets. This increased risk profile might make them less suitable for a national reserve aimed at stability and long-term value preservation. Centralization Concerns: Some altcoins, while decentralized to some extent, may have different governance models and concentration of token ownership compared to Bitcoin, raising questions about their true decentralization and resilience. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Proposal: A Strategic Shift? The discussion around a U.S. crypto reserve gained momentum following posts by former President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Trump mentioned that his executive order had directed the Presidential Working Group to explore forming a strategic crypto reserve that included not just BTC, but also ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. This proposal suggests a potentially broader and more inclusive approach to a national crypto strategy. Trump’s rationale, though not explicitly detailed in the report, could stem from several factors: Diversification: Including multiple cryptocurrencies might be seen as a way to diversify the reserve and reduce risk associated with relying solely on Bitcoin. Technological Innovation: Recognizing the diverse potential of blockchain technology and the different functionalities offered by various altcoins might be a driver for including them. Political Signaling: Embracing a broader range of cryptocurrencies could be interpreted as a more inclusive and forward-looking approach to crypto policy, potentially appealing to a wider range of stakeholders. US Crypto Policy: Navigating the Complexities of a Digital Reserve The debate around including altcoins in a U.S. crypto reserve underscores the complexities of formulating a comprehensive US crypto policy . While a Bitcoin reserve aligns with its ‘digital gold’ status and established market presence, expanding it to include other cryptocurrencies introduces new challenges and considerations. Key questions for policymakers to consider include: Defining the Purpose: What is the primary objective of a national crypto reserve? Is it purely a store of value, a strategic asset, or something else? The answer will influence the selection of cryptocurrencies. Risk Assessment: A thorough risk assessment of each potential cryptocurrency is crucial, considering factors like volatility, regulatory risks, technological vulnerabilities, and market liquidity. Operational Challenges: Managing a multi-asset crypto reserve introduces operational complexities related to custody, security, and portfolio management. Transparency and Governance: Clear guidelines on the governance and management of the crypto reserve are essential to ensure transparency and accountability. The Future of Crypto Reserves: Bitcoin and Beyond? The discussion initiated by Bernstein’s analysts and Trump’s proposal is crucial for shaping the future of crypto reserves and US crypto policy . While Bitcoin’s role as ‘digital gold’ makes it a strong contender for inclusion, the case for altcoins is far from settled. The debate highlights the need for careful consideration of the goals, risks, and operational aspects of establishing a national crypto reserve. Ultimately, the decision of whether to include altcoins in a U.S. crypto reserve will depend on a complex interplay of economic, political, and technological factors. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, a nuanced and informed approach is essential to harness the potential of digital assets while mitigating potential risks.

Joining the whitelist ensures priority access to the presale and early staking rewards, offering traders a first-mover advantage in this new era of decentralized finance and multi-asset trading. The Challenge: Trading Across Markets is Inefficient Despite the rapid expansion of digital finance, trading remains highly fragmented, forcing investors to juggle multiple platforms to access different markets. Crypto traders rely on exchanges like Binance or Coinbase but lack direct access to traditional financial assets, making diversification difficult. Stock and forex traders, meanwhile, use brokers that do not support cryptocurrencies, cutting them off from blockchain-driven financial opportunities. This separation creates inefficiencies, restricting traders from executing seamless cross-market strategies. Shifting funds between asset classes—such as moving profits from meme coins into Gold ETFs—requires multiple transactions across different platforms, leading to delays, additional fees, and missed opportunities. Without a unified trading solution, investors struggle to react to market fluctuations in real time, making it harder to hedge risks, rebalance portfolios, and execute cross-asset strategies efficiently. This lack of integration limits financial flexibility, forcing traders to navigate a complex and outdated system that no longer fits the fast-moving, interconnected nature of modern markets. The Solution: One Platform for All Markets BlockchainFX eliminates these inefficiencies by uniting all major asset classes into a single, all-in-one trading platform, allowing users to move effortlessly between crypto, stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, and bonds.

Traders can also invest in commodities such as Gold, Silver, and Oil, or access institutional-grade bonds and other traditional assets, making it the most comprehensive trading ecosystem available today. The instant asset swap feature removes liquidity lockups and withdrawal delays, ensuring traders can react immediately to market changes. For example, if Bitcoin experiences a surge but macroeconomic indicators suggest rising uncertainty, users can instantly swap BTC for Gold ETFs as a hedge—without waiting for fund transfers or navigating multiple platforms. By eliminating friction and providing a truly unified trading experience, BlockchainFX offers the efficiency, flexibility, and profitability that modern traders demand in an increasingly connected financial world. Market Opportunity: Why Multi-Asset Trading is the Future Financial markets are more interconnected than ever, yet less than 1% of global trading volume comes from crypto. Asset Class Daily Trading Volume Market Share Forex $7.5 trillion 77.85% Bonds $1.1 trillion 11.42% U.S. Stocks $700 billion 7.27% Commodities $250 billion 2.59% Crypto $89 billion 0.87% The crypto industry is rapidly expanding into mainstream finance, with institutional players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan entering the space. This blurring of boundaries between digital and traditional finance creates a huge demand for a unified trading solution—one that BlockchainFX is uniquely positioned to fulfill. Why Now? The Shift Toward All-in-One Trading Platforms Several key trends make this the perfect time for BlockchainFX’s launch: Crypto is going mainstream – Major institutions are integrating blockchain-based financial products.

Proves Tougher Than Pokémon,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/super-mario-ai-benchmarks/,"Forget complex datasets and intricate algorithms for a moment. In a stunning twist, researchers are now throwing AI models into the pixelated world of Super Mario Bros. to truly test their mettle. Yes, you read that right! Move over Pokémon, because this iconic plumber is the new boss in town when it comes to AI benchmarks . Is this just playful experimentation, or does it reveal something profound about how we evaluate artificial intelligence? Let’s dive into this intriguing development. Why Super Mario Bros. for AI Benchmarks? We all know games have long been playgrounds for AI. From chess to Go, conquering virtual worlds has served as a tangible way to measure AI progress. But why Super Mario Bros., a seemingly simple side-scrolling adventure? Hao AI Lab at UC San Diego argues it’s precisely this perceived simplicity that makes it a powerful AI benchmark . Unlike some complex strategy games, Super Mario demands real-time decision-making, precise timing, and the ability to adapt to unpredictable environments. Think about it: dodging Goombas, navigating tricky jumps, and strategizing power-up usage – all in milliseconds! This requires a different kind of intelligence than processing vast amounts of data, and that’s exactly what researchers are keen to explore. AI Models Performance Face the Mushroom Kingdom So, how did the top AI contenders fare against the might of Bowser’s minions? Hao AI Lab put several leading models to the test using their in-house framework, GamingAgent. Here’s a quick rundown of the AI models performance in this unexpected arena: Anthropic’s Claude 3.7: Emerging as the star player, Claude 3.7 demonstrated impressive adaptability and strategic gameplay, navigating levels with relative ease. Anthropic’s Claude 3.5: Close behind its sibling, Claude 3.5 also showed strong performance, proving Anthropic’s models are quite adept at jumping and running. Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro: Surprisingly, Gemini 1.5 Pro, a model known for its prowess in many other areas, struggled to keep pace in the fast-paced world of Mario. OpenAI’s GPT-4o: Another heavyweight contender, GPT-4o, also found the going tough, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-time gaming environments. It’s crucial to note that this wasn’t your nostalgic NES cartridge experience. The game ran in an emulator integrated with GamingAgent , a framework designed to translate the game environment into actionable information for the AI. GamingAgent provided basic instructions and visual input (screenshots) to the AI, which then generated Python code to control Mario. This setup allowed researchers to standardize the testing process and focus on the core AI capabilities needed for gameplay. The Reasoning Paradox: Why ‘Thinking’ Models Struggle in AI Gaming ? One of the most intriguing findings was the performance disparity between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Reasoning models, like OpenAI’s older models, are designed to meticulously ‘think’ through problems step-by-step. While generally superior in many benchmarks, they surprisingly underperformed in Super Mario compared to ‘non-reasoning’ models. Why this counterintuitive result? The researchers pinpointed timing as the critical factor. Reasoning models take precious seconds to deliberate actions – an eternity in a game where milliseconds matter. In Super Mario, hesitation is fatal. A delayed jump means plummeting into a pit, a moment’s indecision leads to a Goomba collision. AI gaming , especially fast-paced genres like platformers, demands rapid, almost instinctive responses, favoring models that can react swiftly over those that ponder deeply. Is AI Gaming Progress Real Progress? The Evaluation Crisis The rise of AI gaming benchmarks raises a crucial question: Are these virtual victories truly indicative of real-world AI advancement? Some experts are skeptical. They argue that games, while challenging, are inherently simplified and abstract representations of reality. Games offer neatly defined rules, predictable environments, and, crucially, an infinite supply of training data – luxuries not found in the messy, unpredictable real world. Andrej Karpathy, a prominent figure in AI research, has voiced concerns about an “evaluation crisis.” He questions the current metrics used to assess AI, suggesting that flashy gaming demos might not accurately reflect genuine progress towards more general and robust AI. “I don’t really know what [AI] metrics to look at right now,” Karpathy admitted, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding how to truly measure the ‘goodness’ of these increasingly sophisticated models. Are we focusing too much on spectacular but narrow achievements, like conquering Super Mario, while overlooking the broader, more fundamental challenges of artificial intelligence? The Future of Super Mario AI and Beyond Despite the ongoing debate, using Super Mario as an AI benchmark offers valuable insights. It pushes AI models to develop skills in real-time decision-making, spatial reasoning, and adaptive strategy – abilities that, while honed in a virtual world, could have implications for real-world applications requiring rapid response and environmental awareness, such as autonomous systems or robotics. Whether it’s navigating a treacherous level in Super Mario or a complex scenario in the real world, the ability to react quickly and strategically is paramount. So, while we might chuckle at the thought of AI battling Bowser, this seemingly playful experiment highlights a serious point: we need diverse and challenging benchmarks to truly understand the strengths and limitations of AI. Super Mario, in its charmingly pixelated way, is proving to be a surprisingly effective tool in this crucial evaluation process. And who knows, maybe one day we’ll see an AI not just beat the game, but design its own revolutionary levels!

Nasdaq Files for Grayscale’s Spot Hedera (HBAR) ETF Amid Growing Altcoin ETF Momentum The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has officially submitted a 19b-4 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to list and trade Grayscale’s spot Hedera (HBAR) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This marks another significant development in the expanding landscape of cryptocurrency ETFs, as institutional demand for digital assets continues to rise. The filing, made on Monday, is part of the two-step process required to propose a crypto ETF for regulatory approval. Once the SEC acknowledges the submission, it will be published in the Federal Register, initiating a structured review process by the agency. This latest move by Nasdaq comes just a week after the exchange submitted a similar filing for Canary Capital’s spot HBAR ETF. The back-to-back applications indicate growing interest in Hedera (HBAR) as an investment-grade asset and suggest that the altcoin ETF market is quickly evolving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hedera Hashgraph is a decentralized public network that operates on a Hashgraph consensus mechanism, offering an alternative to traditional blockchain solutions. Unlike proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks, Hedera’s unique consensus system provides faster transaction speeds, improved security, and lower fees. Governance of the Hedera network is handled by a council of major industry players, including Google, IBM, Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, and LG Electronics. This corporate backing has given the project a level of legitimacy and institutional trust that many other cryptocurrencies struggle to achieve. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, has noted that Hedera and Litecoin currently hold the best odds of securing SEC approval for their respective spot ETFs. Given their advanced progress in regulatory discussions, these altcoin ETFs may be among the first approved beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Following the reelection of Donald Trump, the SEC has seen an influx of crypto ETF filings. This shift signals renewed optimism that a crypto-friendly regulatory landscape is emerging, which could lead to approvals for a variety of altcoin ETFs. In addition to HBAR, issuers have already filed for spot ETFs tied to: Solana (SOL) XRP (XRP) Cardano (ADA) Litecoin (LTC) Dogecoin (DOGE) Recently, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also filed a 19b-4 form for Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF, further fueling speculation that regulators may greenlight altcoin-based ETFs in the near future. Will the SEC Approve Hedera’s ETF? While Bitcoin spot ETFs received their long-awaited approval in January 2024, altcoin ETFs still face regulatory hurdles. The SEC has historically been hesitant to approve non-BTC/ETH crypto products due to concerns over market manipulation, liquidity, and security compliance. However, with increasing institutional demand and Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto, many experts believe that the first altcoin ETF approvals could arrive by mid-2025. Analysts predict that HBAR’s strong governance model and transparent compliance efforts could make it an attractive candidate for approval, potentially paving the way for broader altcoin ETF adoption. Nasdaq’s filing for Grayscale’s HBAR ETF marks another milestone in the race to bring altcoin ETFs to the US market. With major exchanges like Nasdaq and NYSE backing these proposals, and regulatory attitudes shifting post-election, the chances of seeing more diverse crypto investment products are steadily increasing. The SEC’s decision on Grayscale’s HBAR ETF could set a precedent for future altcoin ETFs. If approved, it may open the floodgates for a new wave of institutional crypto investments, further legitimizing digital assets as a mainstream financial instrument. For now, all eyes remain on the SEC as the regulatory clock starts ticking on the latest round of crypto ETF applications. SEC Delays Decision on Cboe’s Ether ETF Options, Pushing Final Ruling to May Nasdaq’s filing of the Hedera ETF comes days after the SEC once again postponed its decision on whether to approve Cboe Exchange’s request to list options on Ether ETFs. In a regulatory filing dated Feb. 28, the agency extended its deadline until May, citing the need for additional time to review the proposal. This marks the second delay for Cboe’s application, which was originally submitted in August 2024. The SEC had previously extended its review period in October, a move that signaled growing regulatory scrutiny over derivative products tied to cryptocurrency ETFs. Cboe’s request specifically seeks to list options on the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), one of the most prominent Ether ETFs in the US market. According to VettaFi data , FETH has amassed around $1.3 billion in net assets, making it one of the leading Ethereum investment products available. This delay mirrors the SEC’s Feb. 7 response to Nasdaq ISE, which also sought approval to list options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is currently the largest Ether ETF, boasting more than $3.7 billion in assets under management. The SEC has given itself until April to make a final ruling on that application. Despite these delays, the demand for Ether ETFs continues to grow. Since Ethereum spot ETFs launched in July 2024, the sector has attracted approximately $11 billion in total net assets, signaling institutional investors' appetite for regulated Ethereum investment products. The creation of an options market for ETH ETFs is widely seen as a critical step toward mainstream institutional adoption. Options are financial contracts that grant traders the right—but not the obligation—to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset at a predetermined price. These instruments provide investors with flexibility in hedging, leverage opportunities, and additional risk management strategies. The precedent for crypto ETF options was set in November 2024, when options trading began for spot Bitcoin ETFs. On its first trading day, options contracts on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw an impressive $2 billion in total exposure, showcasing robust market demand. A similar response is expected for Ethereum ETF options, should the SEC eventually approve them. While the SEC remains cautious about expanding ETF-linked derivatives, the broader crypto derivatives market continues to evolve. Investment managers argue that the expansion of cryptocurrency ETF options in the US could accelerate institutional adoption and unlock significant upside potential for investors. The SEC’s stance on Ethereum ETF options comes at a time when other crypto derivative products are gaining traction. On Feb. 19, Coinbase launched Solana (SOL) futures, adding another major digital asset to the growing list of tradeable crypto derivatives. On Feb. 28, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced its plans to launch SOL futures contracts on March 17, pending regulatory approval. The Trump Administration’s Pro-Crypto Policies Could Influence the SEC’s Decisions One factor that could influence the SEC’s decision-making process is the Trump administration’s increasingly pro-crypto stance. Since his reelection, President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to make the US the “world’s crypto capital.” His administration has already begun appointing crypto-friendly officials to key financial regulatory positions, fueling speculation that the SEC could speed up approvals for a variety of crypto financial products, including ETF-linked options. With the SEC now targeting May for a decision on Cboe’s Ether ETF options and April for a ruling on Nasdaq ISE’s application for BlackRock’s ETH ETF options, the market remains in a state of anticipation. A favorable decision could signal a major milestone for Ethereum adoption, unlocking new avenues for institutional investors and improving liquidity in the crypto derivatives market. Conversely, further delays or outright denials could stall momentum for ETH derivatives, potentially slowing institutional inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem. For now, all eyes remain on the SEC, as the crypto industry awaits clarity on the future of Ethereum ETF options trading in the US.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|MARKET|ALTCOIN|HBAR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-04 10:00:00

Just when you thought the crypto narrative couldn’t get any more intriguing, El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) has made waves again, reinforcing its commitment to Bitcoin. Let’s dive into the details of this latest Bitcoin purchase and explore what it signifies for the nation and the broader crypto landscape. Why Another Bitcoin Purchase for El Salvador? In a recent announcement that reverberated across the crypto community, ONBTC declared on X (formerly Twitter) that El Salvador has added five more Bitcoin to its treasury. This might seem like a modest amount, but it’s a powerful signal of the country’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin, especially as crypto regulations become a global focal point. So, what’s driving this continued accumulation of Bitcoin? Doubling Down on a Vision: El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin, viewing it as a tool for financial inclusion and economic growth. This latest purchase reinforces that vision. Strategic Accumulation: Buying Bitcoin incrementally, especially during market dips, can be a strategic move to average out the purchase price and potentially benefit from future price appreciation. Confidence Signal: Despite market fluctuations and external pressures, El Salvador’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation sends a message of confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin. [img]Image URL here[/img]El Salvador continues to invest in Bitcoin. El Salvador’s Growing BTC Holdings: A Closer Look With this recent acquisition, El Salvador’s total BTC holdings now stand at an impressive 6,100.18 BTC. At current market prices, this translates to approximately $509 million. Let’s break down what this means in real terms: Metric Value Total Bitcoin Holdings 6,100.18 BTC Estimated Value (USD) $509 Million Significance Demonstrates strong commitment to Bitcoin strategy This substantial BTC holdings position El Salvador as a unique case study in national Bitcoin adoption. It’s a bold experiment that the world is watching closely, particularly other nations considering digital currency strategies. Navigating Crypto Regulations and IMF Pressure It’s no secret that El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption journey hasn’t been without its challenges. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed concerns and urged El Salvador to reconsider its Bitcoin policies. In response, El Salvador has reportedly tightened crypto regulations concerning Bitcoin purchases and holdings. What are these regulations, and why are they significant? Increased Oversight: New regulations likely involve enhanced monitoring and reporting of Bitcoin transactions and holdings within the country. Compliance Measures: These measures aim to address the IMF’s concerns regarding financial stability, money laundering, and consumer protection in the context of Bitcoin. Balancing Innovation and Stability: El Salvador is attempting to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation in digital currency and ensuring financial stability, especially under international scrutiny. The Global Impact of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bet El Salvador’s foray into Bitcoin has had a ripple effect globally. It has: Sparked Global Conversation: El Salvador’s adoption has forced a global conversation about the role of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in national economies. Inspired Other Nations: While no other nation has fully replicated El Salvador’s approach, several countries in Latin America and beyond are exploring Bitcoin and digital currency strategies with renewed interest. Tested Regulatory Frameworks: The situation in El Salvador is testing the limits and adaptability of international financial regulations in the face of decentralized digital currencies. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn? El Salvador’s ongoing Bitcoin experiment offers several key takeaways for individuals, businesses, and policymakers: Diversification is Key: For nations and individuals alike, considering Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio strategy can be a forward-thinking approach. Regulation is Evolving: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still nascent and rapidly evolving. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial. Long-Term Vision Matters: El Salvador’s commitment to Bitcoin demonstrates the importance of a long-term vision when adopting disruptive technologies. Conclusion: El Salvador’s Bold Stance on Bitcoin El Salvador’s latest Bitcoin purchase is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a statement of intent. It underscores the nation’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s potential, even amidst regulatory pressures and market volatility. As El Salvador continues to navigate this pioneering path, the world watches, learns, and debates the future of digital currency in the global economy. Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast, a financial analyst, or simply curious about the future of money, El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey is a story you can’t afford to ignore.

41140357,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=686437,1741082475,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41140357.jpeg,TRON-based USDT accelerates inflows to centralized exchanges as supply grows,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tron-based-usdt-inflows-supply-grows/,"TRON-based USDT is changing its profile, with recent inflows to centralized exchanges. Despite its high supply, this version of USDT was mostly used within the TRON ecosystem and for P2P payments. The TRC-20 version of TRON is flowing into exchanges, in a shift of its trading profile. The token’s supply is back at 63.73B , with additional inflows in the past week. The inflows also increased after Tether minted another 1B tokens for the TRON blockchain. The new mint arrived on March 1, though with a limited effect on the overall crypto market. After the latest USDT mint and increased activity, TRX remained relatively unchanged. However, after the latest market drawdown, TRX only lost a cent to trade at $0.23. TRON-based USDT accelerated its flow into exchanges during the latest bull cycle. Currently, 6.1% of USDT deposited on exchanges is coming from the TRON network. Despite the leading position of Ethereum-based tokens in terms of overall value, the TRON version makes up with activity and volumes. Binance is the largest holder of USDT on TRON compared to all exchanges. The leading market operators are in the top 10 of holders, including Bybit, OKX, and Kraken. At the same time, Ethereum-based stablecoins had a supply of 75.9B, with some outflows in the past week. Both versions of the token add to the growth and influence of USDT liquidity, with 5.2B new tokens added in the past month. USDT is attempting to recover its turnover as a tool for payments, DEX activity and transfers. In the past month, USDT increased its turnover by 6.57%, up to $25B. The regulated USDC token saw volumes above $48B, but the monthly result is down by 85% . Activity on TRON, which is 10 times that of Ethereum, is the main driver for the overall performance of USDT. TRON-based USDT offers no-fee transactions The transfers of USDT are preparing for the promised no-fee transfer shift. Justin Sun announced the change on February 25, and the shift was supposed to happen within a week. The current fee report shows that sending USDT on TRON is still priced between $3 and $6.29, depending on the status of the sending and receiving wallet. Free transactions are available on the TRON chain, with no additional expenses to onboard the token. USDT remains the stablecoin with the highest turnover and usage for both centralized and decentralized markets. USDT boosts the available liquidity on TRON, but the project’s founder aims to revive Decentralized USD (USDD). The stablecoin is riskier, due to its algorithmic issuance. One of the functions of USDT on TRON is to support the liquidity of USDD. The effect of increasing printing and activity may boost the usage of USDD for passive income, DeFi, and other tasks. However, USDD has been viewed with skepticism as a potentially risky asset. The previous version of USDD suffered de-pegs and was phased out during the bear market. After the 2024 bull market, TRON’s founder Justin Sun returned to the idea of USDD and once again started growing the token’s supply. Sun explained that currently, USDD is gaining popularity, and will offer a 1:1 swap with USDT. “ USDD is currently positioned as the wrapped version of USDT. The relationship between USDD and USDT is currently very similar to the relationship between WETH (Wrapped ETH) and ETH. Why should ETH be wrapped into WETH? Because the standards of Defi protocols are different, WETH is easier to interact with DeFi protocols,” explained Sun in a recent post on X. Sun has also tried to grow the acceptance of the TRON ecosystem, where critics have seen risk due to non-transparent creation of tokens. One of the latest bids to raise the value of TRON is the partnership and consultancy position with Trump’s investment fund, World Liberty Fi. The fund still owns 41.718M TRX , while Sun has acquired a $30M stake by buying WLFI tokens. At this point, it remains to be seen whether the TRON ecosystem will become part of the US-centered crypto activity.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President confirmed the plan to establish a cryptocurrency reserve, numerous rumours on how the composition of the proposed reserve would be have been released. Many believe that apart from Bitcoin, the US crypto reserve would include several prominent altcoins, including XRP, Solana, Ethereum, and Cardano. However, some renowned experts like Will Baxter have expressed reservations about the possible inclusion of altcoins in the reserve, appealing aggressively for the creation of a BTC-only reserve. Let’s understand what Baxter has to say! Ready? Trump Confirms a US Crypto Reserve The victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election reversed the approach of the US administration towards the crypto industry. In the initial days of the induction itself, the Trump administration introduced some aggressive policies to support the industry. The establishment of a special crypto task force under the US Securities and Exchange Commission to develop a clear crypto regulation framework and the appointment of pro-crypto leaders in key administration positions in the White House were the prominent ones among the policies adopted by the Republican government. Recently, the US government confirmed its plan to establish a crypto reserve. Currently, there is no clarity on what would be the composition of the US crypto reserve. Will Baxter, a Vice President at Braiins Mining, has strongly called for the creation of a Bitcoin-only reserve. The prime reasons why he believes including altcoins in the crypto reserve would be a huge mistake are given below. President Trump confirmed that America will get a Crypto Reserve. Sadly, it will include XRP, Solana, Ethereum, and Cardano. Here are 7 reasons why including altcoins (especially XRP) is a HUGE mistake and why the reserve should be bitcoin-only — Will Baxter (@willbaxter88) March 3, 2025 Bitcoin Is the Only Truly Decentralised Asset Baxter has highlighted the truly decentralised nature of Bitcoin. There exists no founding team to control Bitcoin. But most altcoins have centralised foundations or companies. Altcoins Has Pre-Mined Supply, Giving Insiders an Edge Baxter has emphasised the issues related to pre-mined supply. Bitcoin has no pre-mined supply. Meanwhile, the case of altcoins is different. Almost all the top ten altcoins including ETH have pre-mined supply. Ethereum pre-sold at least 70% of its initial supply. Importantly, Ripple holds no fewer than 55% of the total supply of XRP, and Solana Foundation, insiders and VCs own 50% of the total supply of SOL. Censorship Resistance and Security Issues The expert has also pointed out the importance of security. Bitcoin is known for its robust mining network. It is considered as highly secure. Are altcoins as secure as BTC? The sensible answer is no. It is not sensible to include a crypto with a questionable security framework to the national reserve of a country – which wants its economic system to be highly resistant to external threats. Ethereum’s History Proves It’s Not Immutable The expert has explained how a hack exposed the fundamental weakness of the world’s largest altcoin. Ethereum lost approximately $60 million in the DAO hack. Emphasising how Etheruem rolled back its blockchain after the hack, the expert has argued that Ethereum can be altered when convenient. Bitcoin’s Real-World Usage vs. Altcoin Speculation Baxter has also argued that altcoins see minimal real economic activity compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is used by millions as a store of value and settles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Markets Crash as U.S.-China Trade War Escalates: $500B Wiped Out , Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply vs. Altcoin Supply Changes The expert has brought attention to the issue of supply as well. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins . However, top altcoins, even Ethereum, have changed their supply rules multiple times. Altcoins Lobbied Their Way Into the Reserve Baxter has alleged that altcoins like XRP, Solana, Ethereum and Cardano have lobbied their way into the US crypto reserve. He has explained why it is unfair to include altcoins in the reserve, asking: “we don’t put tech stocks on our national balance sheet. Why would we put their blockchain equivalents there?” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-reveals-worst-case-scenario-for-bitcoin-predicts-bottom-level-here-are-the-details/,"BitMEX founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes has reaffirmed his bullish outlook on Bitcoin despite the recent market downturn, stating that the cryptocurrency remains in a bull cycle and that in a worst-case scenario, BTC will bottom at $70,000, the all-time high of the previous cycle. Arthur Hayes Remains Bullish on Bitcoin, Sees $70,000 as Worst-Case Bottom “I still believe we are in a bull cycle and therefore, at worst, the bottom would be at $70,000, the all-time high from the previous cycle,” Hayes wrote on X. Hayes highlighted the decline in the US Treasury General Account (TGA) as a positive sign of liquidity, explaining that the contraction in TGA injects liquidity into the financial system, which can support risk assets like Bitcoin. Despite his optimism, Hayes signaled a cautious approach, saying his team would “chase dips” without using leverage, a sign that volatility remains a concern even amid long-term bullish expectations. The team's comments came as Bitcoin traded around $82,000 following a 10% drop triggered by macroeconomic concerns and Trump's new tariffs. Many analysts agree that strong liquidity indicators could help Bitcoin recover, with upcoming events like Trump’s crypto summit potentially shaping the next market move. *This is not investment advice.

Despite blockchain analytics firms, law enforcement agencies, and crypto exchanges closely monitoring the movement of the stolen funds, the attacker effectively leveraged decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to clean them fully. Laundering Details On-chain analytics platform EmberCN started tracking the funds soon after they were stolen. On February 25, the firm revealed that the hacker had laundered more than 89,000 ETH, valued at about $224 million, in about 60 hours. The attacker washed another 45,900 ETH worth some $113 million a day later, bringing the total amount laundered to 135,000 ETH. They repeated the process on February 27, swapping 71,000 ETH with a market value in the region of $170 million. At that point, about four and a half days after the attack, the perpetrator had managed to convert 206,000 ETH into other crypto assets, averaging about 45,000 ETH daily. However, they still had another 292,000 coins left, worth a whopping $685 million, and worked relentlessly night and day to clean them. According to EmberCN, by February 28, the bad actor had added another 59,800 ETH to their laundered loot, bringing it to 266,000 ETH, with 233,000 remaining. Interestingly, on March 1, a Saturday, the exploiter took a break from cleaning the stolen funds, managing to clear only a relatively modest 14,300 ETH valued at $32.2 million. They resumed activities the next day, converting 62,200 ETH, and by the morning of March 4, EmberCN reported that the attacker had laundered all the remaining funds. Bybit’s Take Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has offered a slightly different take from the analytics firm’s. In an X post on Tuesday, he provided an executive summary of the attack, stating that about 83% of the stolen funds, worth approximately $1 billion, have been converted into Bitcoin (BTC) and spread across nearly 7,000 wallets. Of the total amount lost in the exploit, 20% cannot be traced, while 3% has been frozen. Zhou also claimed that a large chunk of the untraceable funds, about 79,655 ETH, was laundered through the eXch exchange. The attacker, linked by the FBI to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, also processed another 40,233 ETH via OKX’s web3 wallet. Still, on-chain detectives have traced about 16,680 ETH, with the rest seemingly gone with the wind unless Bybit gets additional information from OKX. According to Zhou, the primary platform the hackers used in the laundering process was THORChain. He estimates that more than 361,000 ETH, valued at over $900 million, has been swapped via the cross-chain liquidity protocol.

The 2025 Super Cycle Could Change Everything!,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/codenamepepe-merges-ai-functionality-with-viral-meme-coin-appeal/,"The post From $500 to $1 Million With Memecoins? The 2025 Super Cycle Could Change Everything! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme coins have become the talk of the town in the crypto world. With the bull run in full swing, these quirky coins are capturing attention for their potential to create massive profits. Coins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK are making waves as part of the new frenzy. There’s also buzz about an emerging project, Codename:Pepe, which promises to use artificial intelligence to navigate the meme coin market and deliver unique trading insights. This intriguing new player raises the question of whether it can replicate the success of its predecessors and become a star in the cryptocurrency universe. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Introduction to Dogecoin Dogecoin is a digital currency that began in December 2013. It features the popular Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the coin was meant to be a light-hearted, user-friendly alternative to Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, meaning new coins can always be made. It builds on technology from Litecoin, focusing on fast transaction speeds by using a system called Scrypt. This has helped Dogecoin gain a wider audience over time. Dogecoin has seen its popularity grow due to high-profile endorsements and its use in various charitable campaigns. One famous supporter is Elon Musk, who has publicly declared his liking for the coin. People have used Dogecoin to fund unique causes, such as helping a bobsled team and building water wells in Kenya. Its price history has shown volatility, often rising and falling with broader market trends. Despite the fluctuations, Dogecoin continues to have a dedicated fan base and remains a significant player in the world of cryptocurrencies. Overview of Shiba Inu Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu, often abbreviated as SHIB, was launched in 2020 as a meme coin. It aimed to capitalize on the success of Dogecoin, another meme-based cryptocurrency. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, SHIB uses the ERC-20 token standard. This digital currency gained rapid popularity due to endorsements from well-known figures like Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Initially intended as a medium for simple transactions, its rising fame led to the development of additional projects. These include a decentralized exchange and a non-fungible token (NFT) project, differentiating SHIB from other meme coins by offering real utility. Current Outlook on SHIB’s Market Potential Since reaching a peak in 2021, the price of SHIB has stabilized around $0.00001 – $0.00002. Despite this stabilization, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded, introducing products like its own metaverse and games. This infrastructure could support future growth, but it may require an external catalyst for significant price movements. If another rise in cryptocurrency markets occurs, new users could be drawn to Shiba Inu’s products, possibly increasing its value. As of now, while SHIB maintains a significant market presence, it faces competition from newer meme coins. Overview of Pepe the Frog Cryptocurrency Pepe cryptocurrency is inspired by a viral meme featuring a cartoon frog created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. It operates as a deflationary meme coin using Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard. The project focuses on simplicity, transparency, and community engagement, embodied in its three-phase goals: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. Its approach remains straightforward, aiming to maintain fun and avoid complex promises. Like other cryptocurrencies, Pepe’s price is driven by market supply and demand. The token’s supply is capped at 420.69 trillion, with its value fluctuating based on buyer interest. Historically, Pepe achieved a high of $0.00002825 on December 10, 2024, but later experienced a downturn. For the token to reach new highs, renewed buyer interest is essential. As of the writing, it ranks among the top 30 cryptocurrencies, with competitors like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Various analysts provide mixed predictions for Pepe’s future, showing both optimistic and cautious long-term outlooks. Bonk (BONK): Overview and Market Dynamics Bonk (BONK) is a meme coin that operates on the Solana blockchain. Unlike most meme coins that are based on Ethereum, BONK taps into Solana’s advantages, such as speed and lower costs. It primarily serves as a transactional tool between its users on the Solana network. Upon its release in December 2022, BONK’s price increased significantly alongside the value of Solana’s native token, SOL. The creators of BONK aim to provide an efficient transaction-focused token within the Solana ecosystem. As of now, BONK is priced at approximately $0.00003439, with a market capitalization of around $2.62 billion. Despite being significantly smaller than competing meme coins like SHIB and DOGE, BONK has shown substantial growth over the past year. Analysts have varied opinions on its future; some believe it benefits from upcoming market trends and adoption within the Solana network, while others express concerns about its anonymous founders and lack of detailed project information. Price forecasts for BONK up to 2050 show a range of possibilities, with predictions of gradual growth over the decades. Conclusion As the market evolves, established memecoins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK may offer less potential for short-term gains. While they have paved the way for meme-based tokens, their growth trajectories have stabilized, making room for new entrants to capture investor interest.

Do you also worry about the fact that one day Quantum computers will advance to the level of breaking the cryptographic foundations? Well, if yes, your worry is legit since Web3’s top layer networks can have potential disruptions from it, such as Ethereum. Researchers and Analysts have long been worried from the looming threats on the cryptographic foundations from the ongoing advancements in the Quantum Computing world. For instance, in December 2024, Google unveiled the Willow quantum-computing chip , a 105-qubit processor that achieved a significant milestone in quantum error correction. Though it is not yet powerful enough to threaten Bitcoin’s encryption, which would require millions of qubits – the advancement does exemplify the need for the crypto community to explore quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions proactively. In a step towards leading the required solutions and ways, Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that manages Ethereum, has announced its grant support for a new venture – a post-quantum cryptography focused research organisation – ZKnox. Though the exact amount of grant was not unveiled, ZKNox is set to work towards improving the post-quantum cryptography as quantum computing is evolving at an unprecedented pace. Ethereum’s Push for Post-Quantum Security Quantum computing has long been viewed as a potential disruptor to current cryptographic systems, including those securing blockchain network. Infact, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, has also previously discussed the importance of quantum resistance and potential migration strategies to ensure the blockchain remains secure in the coming decades. He had suggested a strategic hard fork combined with the adoption of quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques. Through its grant program, the Foundation aims to support initiatives like post-quantum (PQ) cryptography-focused ZKNox that can future-proof Ethereum and other blockchain networks from potential quantum-based attacks. According to the official announcement, the grant will provide ZKNox with the necessary resources to develop and implement quantum-resistant zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic method crucial to privacy and scalability in Ethereum’s ecosystem. 1/ Introducing ZKnox @zknoxhq ! This new research organization is at the forefront of advanced cryptography, backed by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation. Their mission: provide high impact open source code that improves Ethereum security and efficiency. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) March 3, 2025 Need for Post-Quantum Cryptography Since Quantum machines reply on qubits to solve complex problems simultaneously, the whole architecture of the internet and Ethereum can be in danger, at the ultimate peak scale of development in quantum computing. Co-founder by the ex-CFO of unicorn Ledger, Baccha Nicolas, ZKnox, aims to develop such post-quantum cryptography techniques that will save Ethereum from the potential Quantum hacks and threats. Post-quantum cryptography is a field dedicated to developing cryptographic methods that can withstand attacks from quantum computers. Current cryptographic standards, including those securing Ethereum’s blockchain, primarily rely on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), which quantum computers could potentially break using algorithms like Shor’s algorithm. VitaliK Buterin on the threats to Ethereum from Quantum Computers Can ZKnox be a game-changer in PQ security In its 2025 roadmap , ZKnox revealed that Ethereum’s reliance on ECDSA for externally owned account (EOA) signatures makes it vulnerable to quantum attacks. It aims for optimized implementation of the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), a core operation in PQ cryptography that accelerates complex computations for PQ signature verification. As the Ethereum Founcation unveiled, the team at ZKNOX has implemented this NTT in Yul. The benchmark test revealed impressive gas savings for several PQ signature verification algorithms, using an agile approach allowed developers to use various signature schemes. Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, designed to resist quantum computer attacks, are often computationally intensive but NTTs speeds up complex calculations and help in improving the efficiency of post-quantum signature verification In a notable efforts towards reducing the on-chain expense required for the implementations of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, it has reduced the the on-chain cost of FALCON signatures from 24M to 2.5M gas and proposed EIP-7885 to accelerate lattice-based cryptographic primitives. This step has made the PQ transactions 12x cheaper on Ethereum. It will also develop a clear and practical 7702 + 4337 integration scenario tailored for hardware wallets. Towards a secured Post-Quantum future Thus, the Ethereum Foundation’s grant to ZKNox represent a critical step in securing Ethereum’s future against quantum threats. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, ensuring robust cryptographic security is paramount. By investing in post-quantum solutions now, Ethereum is not only safeguarding its network but also setting a precedent for the broader blockchain industry.

With major tax reforms and government-backed crypto initiatives on the table, this could be a turning point for the industry. But not everyone is convinced. Trump’s Tariff policy has backfired, with millions wiped out from the market due to China’s retaliation. The market is in fear and expects some solid actions from Trump to help crypto assets rebound. Here’s what you need to know about the White House Crypto Summit. Tax-Free Crypto? Investors Are Watching Closely One of the biggest expectations from the summit is a potential tax break on crypto sales. Investor Mike Alfred suggests that Trump’s administration is considering eliminating capital gains taxes on crypto transactions, a move that could encourage more trading and long-term investment. Crypto analyst Ran Neuner believes this policy could also include incentives for blockchain developers to bring their projects back to the US. If Trump delivers on this promise, it could flood the market with fresh institutional capital and give retail investors a reason to stay bullish. Whereas investor Joe Lonsdale argues that taxation should be minimal, calling it a form of theft. He opposes using tax money for political agendas or crypto projects, stating that only essential services like defense and courts should be funded. https://twitter.com/JTLonsdale/status/1896245689488920748 The Crypto Reserve Controversy Another hot topic is Trump’s push for a US-backed crypto reserve, which allegedly includes tokens like XRP, ADA, and SOL . While some see this as a step toward legitimizing crypto, others question why taxpayer money should be used to invest in speculative assets. Critics argue that Trump might be using this as leverage to push for a Bitcoin-focused reserve instead. Crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer suggests Trump is playing a negotiation game—putting XRP and ADA on the table to force Congress into backing a Bitcoin reserve. Who’s in the Room? So far, there’s no confirmation on the guest list, but Trump’s key crypto advisors—David Sacks and Bo Hines—are expected to attend. Industry leaders could also make an appearance, which may hint at potential partnerships or government support for specific crypto projects. Market Impact If Trump follows through with tax incentives and crypto-friendly policies , it could fuel a massive rally in the market. But if investors see the crypto reserve plan as unrealistic or politically motivated, it might trigger a negative reaction. https://twitter.com/TakeToken_net/status/1896844412405141792 Either way, this summit will set the tone for how the US government approaches crypto moving forward.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 11:46:52

With confidence low, indicators suggest more decline in the Solana coin price. The Shiba Inu coin also lost key support and was outperformed by the new AI coin IntelMarkets (INTL) . INTL, an emerging cryptocurrency at the crossroads between AI and DeFi, defies broader bearish sentiment. Offering a hedge against market shocks, IntelMarkets has become a favorite, outclassing the crypto market after soaring over 900%. With more to come after Tier-1 exchange listings, it might be this year’s best ICO. IntelMarkets (INTL): Outperforming Top Crypto Coins IntelMarkets (INTL) , standing out in the ICO world as a blend of AI and DeFi, is among the new altcoins to watch out for. Exploding over 900% in the past few months, it outperformed the Shiba Inu coin and Solana coin. Set for further gains post-launch, it is among the best altcoins to invest in. With early funding exceeding $11 million, its solid fundamentals cannot be overlooked—a big catalyst. Unlike conventional trading platforms, INTL will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels—an AI-powered trading platform. Besides its advanced trading bots, the platform can run on the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. Meanwhile, at $0.091 in the tenth ICO stage, experts believe INTL is a steal. A 75x jump in value is projected after listing on Tier-1 exchanges like Bybit and Kucoin, placing it on the list of the best new cryptos to invest in. Gearing up to reshape the crypto trading scene, it is a new DeFi project to keep on the radar. Solana (SOL): Bears Eye Further Decline The Solana coin fell below $130, down over 25% on the weekly chart. Has it bottomed yet? Further downturns aren’t out of the question, especially considering technical indicators like the bearish MACD Level (12, 26) and 20-VWMA. At the same time, top analysts forecast a retest of lower price levels for the Solana coin. Investors Reality, a crypto analyst on X, suggests the Solana coin price might hit $120 or $85 if the US stock index nukes. Itzpoopster, another analyst, targets $100. On the flip side, a bounce is also on the cards; an overall market rally might spark an upswing. However, considering current market conditions, the Solana coin might not be the best crypto to invest in. Instead, IntelMarkets (INTL) is a more compelling alternative, backed by a bullish narrative and has huge growth prospects. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Below Key $0.000015 Support The Shiba Inu coin also took a big hit this week, dumping over 10%. It retails below $0.000014, although a breakout above $0.000015 might spark a significant correction. Also, bold Shiba Inu coin price predictions have been flying, making it one of the altcoins to watch. Smellyrino, a crypto trader and analyst, expects a 400% upswing after identifying $0.000013 as key support. SHIBGems, more optimistic, predicts the Shiba Iun coin price to hit $0.000025. These bullish forecasts are supported by bullish technical indicators like the MACD Level (12, 26) and Momentum (10). However, to make the most of this bull run, IntelMarkets might be a more promising alternative than the Shiba Inu coin. The new AI coin has tangible applications and plenty of room to run as a low-cap. IntelMarkets (INTL): Outclassing Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) While top altcoins like the Solana coin and Shiba Inu coin nosedived, IntelMarkets (INTL) is in the spotlight. It skyrocketed over 900% from the initial price of $0.009 to the current price of $0.091. Approaching its scheduled launch in Q1, it might be this year’s best crypto investment.

The repercussions of this and the broader market turmoil have led to ETH price plummeting by 14% overnight. ETH Price Analysis 04th March 2025 Its price is currently floating around $2,087, if it falls below $2,000, Ethereum could test the $1,900 mark, where buyers may step in. In contrast, a strong push above $2,200 could take the price toward $2,400. XRP Price Prediction: XRP has incurred a fall of 16% on its daily chart, taking its price to $2.36, at the time of press. The token has faced heavy selling pressure, with long liquidations tallying up to $50 million. A further plunge could lead to a slide to the $2.20 mark. XRP Price Analysis 04th March 2025 That being said, a break below $2.20 could see XRP testing $1.76 and potentially $1.55, where the 200-day SMA lies. However, a bounce above $2.48 might open the doors for a recovery toward the much anticipated $3.00 price tag. FAQs Why Bitcoin price is falling? Amid rising uncertainty in the financial markets, political decisions in the U.S, the Bitcoin price today has dropped by ~9%. Why is ETH crashing? With rising selling pressure, liquidations, reduced trading volume, and ETF outflows, the price of ETH has been crashing. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Considering the current market sentiments and circulating supply of Ripple tokens, it is highly unlikely for this altcoin to achieve this target price.",Uncategorized|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|BTC|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 11:48:09

Although Dogecoin and Ethereum are still favorites, a new entrant has joined the list. The name is IntelMarkets (INTL) . IntelMarkets has attracted the attention of whale investors who have been instrumental in raising over $10.8 million in presale funding. The trading platform of IntelMarkets is equipped with the most advanced artificial intelligence and supports both the Solana and Ethereum chains. Ethereum (ETH) Could Rally To $4k on One Condition A recent report hitting the market shows that whales have not given up on Ethereum (ETH). Data from Santiment shows that they bought over 140k ETH amid the ongoing downturn. Fortunately, the Ethereum price has increased by 3.2% in the past week, signaling an increase in buying pressure. CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum price has been trading at the $2k level for more than a week. If this momentum continues, the Ethereum price could surge to $3k in the next few days. Bulls only have to watch out for the $2,900 Ethereum price zone for rejection. Surpassing it could be the trigger that pushes the Ethereum price to a new peak. On the other hand, a rejection could push the Ethereum price down to retest the $2.5k support. According to Ted, the Ethereum price could break out past the $4k level if it mirrors the movement of Bitcoin in 2020/2021. Dogecoin (DOGE) Forecasted To Hit $1.7 As Whales Get Active Apart from the Ethereum crypto, whales have also been showing massive interest in Dogecoin (DOGE). A recent tweet by Ali Martinez shows they have bought over 110 million coins in the last two days, signaling positive sentiment. Interestingly, the accumulation comes as the DOGE price drops on the weekly and monthly levels. CoinMarketCap price feed reveals that the DOGE price has plummeted by 4.4% and 28.4% on these levels, respectively. Nevertheless, there is still hope for a DOGE price rebound. Trader Tardigrade notes the DOGE price could skyrocket to $1.7 if it mirrors its 2017 price pattern. Another expert known as AltcoinScholar emphasized the importance of the $0.22 level for a DOGE price rally. AltcoinScholar said the DOGE price could rally soon if bulls hold this region. In the meantime, technical analysis shows that investors are hyped about the Dogecoin crypto. The Fear and Greed Index has returned to Greed, supporting a DOGE price rally. Why Whales Are Interested In IntelMarkets (INTL) IntelMarkets (INTL) has also attracted investors’ attention since the beginning of the presale and has received more than $10.8 million. Retail and institutional investors have also expressed interest in the project as they believe that it will revolutionize the trading of cryptocurrencies. This positive response shows that there is a good perception of IntelMarkets. IntelMarkets is an innovative crypto trading platform that is yet to be launched and uses artificial intelligence and blockchain. Unlike other platforms, it has trading robots that are capable of learning from the market data and adapting to the changes. Also, IntelMarkets provides a copy trading option for newcomers, which enables them to copy the actions of successful traders. This is especially beneficial to beginners in that they can make profits from the market without necessarily having to understand the market well. INTL token is currently in its crypto ICO stage and has soared by more than 900% to reach its current price of $0.091, which indicates the token’s growth and investors’ interest. Given the fact that IntelMarkets is equipped with unique features and has already gained a high level of presale popularity, it can become a serious player in the field of crypto trading. Whales’ Best Altcoins To Buy While waiting for the next bull run, whales are stacking up Ethereum, Dogecoin, and IntelMarkets (INTL). Despite being a new project, the price of INTL is expected to rise by 10x in the coming months. Such potential makes it a good crypto to buy.

The Bank of Israel has unveiled a preliminary design for the digital shekel, but its launch will depend on further discussions with the government. In the document , Israel’s central bank explained that the digital shekel is designed to be accessible to all, saying the state-controlled currency “will be available to the entire public, including children, foreigners (including tourists), all types of businesses, public institutions, and financial entities.” “Similar to cash, it will be a universal means of payment – anyone will be able to pay anyone, and anyone will be able to receive payment from anyone, but with the convenience and advancement of a digital means of payment.” The Bank of Israel You might also like: Israel CBDC plans on hold ahead of potential digital euro launch It’s assumed that businesses would pay lower costs than existing options, though it’s unclear what fees will be implemented. The central bank claims payments with the central bank digital currency would be fast, with support for offline payments. Addressing privacy concerns, the Bank of Israel reassured that the level of privacy “will be higher compared to existing digital payments.” “The level of privacy in the digital shekel will be higher compared to existing digital payments, and similar to cash, it will also offer the possibility of anonymous payments in limited amounts.” The Bank of Israel The digital shekel could also integrate with other systems, enabling users to “receive or make payments in the digital shekel even if the other party to the payment does not use the digital shekel.” The central bank emphasized that a final decision on issuing the digital shekel hasn’t been made yet, noting that if future conditions show the benefits outweigh the costs and risks, the Bank of Israel “will be prepared” to implement the “action plan.” The Bank of Israel started looking into the digital shekel in 2017, researching the possible benefits and challenges of launching a CBDC. During the initial phase, they focused on global trends in digital currencies, the technology behind them, and how they could affect monetary policy and financial stability. In 2021, the Bank took things up a notch by forming a special team to dive deeper into developing the digital shekel.

The Albanese government has no current plans to follow in the US’s footsteps, prioritizing digital asset regulation instead. On March 2, US President Donald Trump directed the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets to include Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a newly proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve. Several US states have also started exploring ways to add crypto to their balance sheets , signaling a potential shift in how digital assets are integrated into national financial policies. However, a spokesperson for Australian Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones made it clear that the government’s priority remains regulatory oversight rather than asset accumulation. During an interview , the spokesperson stated that the administration was focused on developing a framework for a “fit-for-purpose digital asset regulatory regime” and emphasized the economic opportunities presented by blockchain technology. Complexity in Crypto Reserves While the idea of a national crypto reserve has gained traction in some circles, experts warn that such a move comes with significant risks. Tom Matthews, head of corporate affairs at Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, pointed out that the extreme price volatility of crypto could pose a challenge. “If one of the main goals of your country’s strategic reserve is to hedge against crises, the price volatility of crypto is a problem,” he noted. Rather than a direct reserve, Matthews speculated that a more practical approach might be the development of a sovereign wealth fund that holds crypto as part of a diversified portfolio. Regulatory Focus Grows in Australia While Australia may not be pursuing a strategic reserve, regulators are keeping a close eye on the sector. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (AUSTRAC) announced in December that it will shift its enforcement priorities toward crypto in 2025, particularly targeting unregulated crypto ATM providers. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) also released a consultation paper in December, proposing that many digital assets be classified as financial products, requiring firms to obtain licenses. Despite the government’s cautious stance, Australia has rapidly emerged as a hub for crypto ATMs . Data from Coin ATM Radar shows that the country now ranks third globally, with over 1,453 ATMs in operation—up from just 67 in August 2022.

Vietnam to Draft Legal Framework for Cryptocurrencies This Month Vietnam has been a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption, ranking among the top three countries worldwide in terms of population holding cryptocurrencies in 2021 and 2022. An estimated 21% of Vietnamese citizens own digital assets, reflecting the country’s strong individual interest in crypto. Regulatory Push Amid Growing Adoption While crypto trading and investing are common in Vietnam, the lack of a clear legal framework has raised concerns among regulators. The government’s new directive marks an effort to create guidelines for crypto usage, taxation, and investor protection while encouraging blockchain innovation. Vietnam’s move follows a trend seen in other Asian countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which are implementing crypto-friendly regulations to balance innovation with investor protection. The upcoming legal framework could provide clarity for businesses and individuals operating in the Vietnamese crypto market. *This is not investment advice.

On February 20, the day of the launch, the market recorded a growth of 765.87%. Between February 20 and 26, the market surged steeply by around 2,692.85%. The trend reversed in late February. Since February 27, the market has dropped by nearly 38.47%. However, in the last 24 hours, the PI price has grown by over 3.5%. The big question now is: Can It reclaim $1.95 resistance? Time to analyse the scenario deeper. Why Is PI Experiencing a Price Struggle Now? There are at least three reasons for the current price struggle in the PI market. Primarily, the PI Network’s decision to postpone the grace period of the Know Your Customer period for the third time has not been received well by the crypto market. Secondly, the emergence of strong sentiment against the listing of PI on the Binance crypto exchange has negatively affected the confidence of the PI community. Finally, the overall weakness in the cryptocurrency market , caused due to the Trump administration’s move to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, has limited the PI market’s growth potential considerably. PI Technical Analysis Suggests a Bullish Trend The PI price dropped below a descending trend line after the all-time high. Notably, at one point on March 2, the price dropped as low as $1.51. Recently, it broke strongly above a descending trend line. The price now stands at $1.7356. Importantly, there exists a strong resistance at the $1.95 level. The RSI reading, observed on the four-hour chart of Pi Network, is at 41.13. This figure indicates that there is a high chance for growth in the PI market. The MACD reading, on the same chart, is -0.0810. There is a high possibility that the signal will move above zero. Both these indicators suggest that the market is likely to experience strong bullish momentum soon. PI completed a five-wave increase before correcting. This correction ended on March 2, when the price touched a low of $1.51. Experts believe that the $1.95 resistance is a very crucial level in the PI market. They suggest that if the market breaks above this resistance, it could confirm the bullish wave count. Pi Network Price Prediction According to analysts, if the price of PI breaks above the $1.95 resistance decisively, it could reach as high as $2.40. If PI fails to overcome the pressure from the resistance, its price could slip to a depressively low level of $1.11. Can PI Break the $1.95 Resistance? There are a few key factors that strongly support the PI market’s upward momentum. Firstly, in a community poll organised by Binance, a vast majority of the respondents supported the listing of PI on the exchange . Secondly, some merchants in Asian countries like China, Vietnam and South Korea have started to accept PI. Thirdly, considering the fact that PI is a Made-In-USA crypto coin, speculations on whether PI will be included in the US national reserve are slowly gaining attention . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Looking at past trends, March has been a bearish month for crypto, with losses recorded 50% the time since 2013. But this time things in March could be different, as several major events are lined up to take place. Here’s what’s coming up. March 6: CFTC Forum on Tokenized Assets and Stablecoins The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will kick things off with a forum focused on tokenized assets and stablecoins. According to the CFTC , the pilot program will explore “tokenized non-cash collateral,” which includes stablecoins and similar products. Companies like Circle, Coinbase, Crypto.com, MoonPay, and Ripple will be part of the discussions. More details about the forum will be shared once everything is confirmed. March 7: White House Crypto Summit with Trump Next in the line, we have one of the most anticipated events, the White House Crypto Summit hosted by President Donald Trump. Trump has recently made headlines with his pro-crypto stance, including talk of establishing a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. The summit will bring together major crypto leaders, policymakers, and financial experts to discuss the country’s role in digital assets. March 10-14: Senate Banking Committee Votes on Stablecoin Bill Regulation has been a hot topic in the crypto world, and between March 10 and 14, the Senate Banking Committee will vote on a stablecoin bill. However, the bill is all about creating clear rules for stablecoins. It focuses on keeping users safe, reducing risks to the financial system, and stopping illegal activities. If passed, this bill could bring more clarity to the legal status of stablecoins in the U.S. March 21: SEC’s First Crypto Roundtable The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will hold its first crypto roundtable on March 21. The meeting will likely focus on rules for crypto, market stability, and how digital assets fit into current financial systems. This will give the SEC a chance to learn more about the crypto market and its challenges. With all these major events happening in March, the crypto industry is bracing for a month of potential volatility and key developments that could shape its future.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 11:59:56

When people talk about zero-knowledge cryptography in 2024, they’re often referring to a privacy-focused use case that relies on a combination of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, digital wallets, and users with some degree of web3 knowledge. You might also like: Zero-knowledge modularity can help to scale web3 | Opinion Zero-knowledge proofs have existed since the 1980s, long before the advent of web3. So why limit their potential to blockchain applications? Traditional companies can—and should—adopt ZK technology without fully embracing web3 infrastructure. At a basic level, ZKPs unlock the ability to prove something is true without revealing the underlying data behind that statement. Ideally, a prover creates the proof, a verifier verifies it, and these two parties are completely isolated from each other in order to ensure fairness. That’s really it. There’s no reason this concept has to be trapped behind the learning curve of web3. Most organizations that could benefit from ZK technology aren’t using blockchains or are not even aware of web3. The industry is still young, with many just now familiarizing themselves with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), not to mention Layer 2s and 3s. Despite all that, ZKPs can already be applied to a variety of real-world use cases, and they don’t need to integrate fully web3 rails to do so. Do you trust your slot machine payout? With zero-knowledge proofs, you don’t have to trust a gaming operator. You can just enjoy playing and have peace of mind knowing that the game is designed fairly. Every digital gambling machine in the world should be designed with ZKPs; it just makes sense for the operators and the players. The best part is that players can enjoy the benefits without the words “web3” or “crypto” even entering their minds. Recently, DraftKings and White Hat Gaming were fined $22,500 by the state of Connecticut for their online slot machine game, which failed to pay any winners over one week in August 2023—even though there were more than 20,600 spins that week. The game advertised that nearly 95 cents would be paid out for every $1 wagered, so the algorithm should have returned $19,570 to the players who wagered $20,600 in spins. Instead, players lost $20,600—all of which went to DraftKings. This is where zero-knowledge proofs can make a big difference. A ZKP could prove that a game paid out a certain amount of money over a given period and at a specific hit rate without revealing individual spins or player identities. This is great, but there is still the problem of verifying the proof. Someone needs to ensure that DraftKings, or any gaming operator, constructed the proofs correctly based on all the required data. It could be DraftKings themselves, but we shouldn’t trust them to handle their own verification. A regulator or auditor could do it, but this would likely cost DraftKings a lot of money, which would then be passed on to the customer. In this situation, the best option is a public and decentralized network built specifically to verify proofs in a quick and cost-effective manner. Instead of the user being asked to trust a centralized entity, they can trust a decentralized protocol that ensures nefarious actors (i.e., those who may try to verify an incorrect proof) are punished if they misbehave. AI output and trustworthiness AI’s potential for deception is well-established. However, there are ways we can harness AI’s creativity while still trusting its output. As artificial intelligence pervades every aspect of our lives, it becomes increasingly important that we know the models training the AIs we rely on are legitimate because if they aren’t, we could literally be changing history and not even realize it. With ZKML, or zero-knowledge machine learning, we avoid those potential pitfalls, and the benefits can still be harnessed by web2 projects that have zero interest in going onchain. Recently, the University of Southern California partnered with the Shoah Foundation to create something called IWitness, where users are able to speak or type directly to holograms of Holocaust survivors. This is an undeniably powerful use of machine learning. There’s something so strangely moving about interacting with a hologram of a Holocaust survivor and feeling like you’re having a real conversation. But with a subject this sensitive, it’s even more crucial that the algorithm underlying the hologram is generating factual information. Enter zero-knowledge proofs. If we were to reimagine this project, we might consider adding a “proof of algorithm output” where the user is able to see evidence that the responses they are seeing are based on a Natural Language Processing algorithm that was correctly trained on troves of historical transcripts and interviews with Holocaust survivors, ensuring that the information presented is accurate. ZKPs make it possible to get proof of this input data and AI training without revealing the underlying information. Fact-checking the Holocaust information would also require perusing vast amounts of data, potentially requiring the end user to download or access large data sets and then spend hours reading or watching interviews. ZKPs allow the user to forgo this tedious and resource-intensive process. In this case, we might trust USC to verify proofs for this particular project, but there are certainly more use cases with AI where the end user may not want to trust a centralized entity to both create and verify proof. When incentives to construct “fake” proofs and have them verified align, decentralized proof verification makes the most sense. ZK is a trustless, decentralized system for all We don’t need to trust companies or robots to tell us the truth because we have ZK. Many industries can level up with zero-knowledge blockchain solutions, even if they know nothing about the web3 space. By tapping into ZK proof verification, companies and institutions can essentially keep doing everything they have been infrastructure-wise. They just need to create a simple system for proof creation and then use a decentralized system like zkVerify to handle the proof verification. Even though a blockchain is used, the users don’t need to worry about that. The future of ZK will be massive, and organizations won’t have to change much to reap the benefits. They can just plug and play.

In 2028, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $1.01, with an average price of $0.83. By 2031, HBAR could trade between $2.56 and $3.04, with an average price of $2.63. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) cryptocurrency is one of the altcoins that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing at a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we might see a bullish scenario happening sooner: perhaps a retest of its all-time high.

Image Source: Trading view The 1-day HBAR/USD chart on March 4 shows a recent uptick in price, with HBAR trading near $0.227 after a strong bounce from support. Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility, with price testing the middle band as resistance at $0.252. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48.56 suggests neutral momentum, leaving room for further upside if buying pressure continues. However, rejection at the upper Bollinger Band could lead to a retest of lower support near $0.185. A bullish breakout above $0.26 could push HBAR higher, while failure to maintain momentum may result in a pullback. Traders should monitor volume and market sentiment. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBAR/USD chart . Image Source: Trading view The 4-hour HBAR/USD chart shows a recent price retracement following a strong rally, with HBAR trading around $0.226. The Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility, with the price testing the middle band as support. MACD suggests a weakening bullish momentum as the histogram turns negative, signaling a potential trend reversal. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.01 reflects a neutral market stance. If HBAR holds support at $0.216, it may attempt another breakout toward resistance at $0.270. However, a further breakdown could push prices lower. Traders should monitor volume and momentum indicators for confirmation of the next move. What can you expect from the HBAR price analysis next? The HBAR/USD price analysis across the 4-hour and 1-day charts shows mixed signals. On the 1-day chart, HBAR is recovering after a dip, testing resistance near $0.252. Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility, while RSI at 40.97 suggests it is still in neutral territory. On the 4-hour chart, HBAR consolidates around $0.226, with the MACD showing weakening bullish momentum. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.01 signals indecisiveness. If HBAR maintains support at $0.216, an upward move toward $0.270 is possible. A breakdown below support, however, could trigger a further decline. Watch for volume surges to confirm direction.

Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.34 How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth $2.10 Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely in the near future. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $2.23 and $2.65, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.34 by 2025 and $0.50 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Hederah Hashgraph’s historic price sentiment HBAR price history; Source: Coinnmarketcap The year 2019 started with a negligible price figure, which remained consistent for the initial months. Price trends fluctuated significantly throughout 2019, dropping to $0.01 by the end of 2019. HBAR opened the year 2021 at $0.03, remaining steady for the first few days. The price significantly increased to $0.1 by the first week of February 2021, driven by the continuous network efforts of early January. HBAR started 2024 modestly, surging in April to a high of $0.1793 before stabilizing around $0.110 in May and dropping to $0.051 by September. November saw a rebound, with HBAR reaching $0.3012 and $3.34B in trading volume, closing the year near $0.29 after peaking at $0.30 in December.

Another $80 billion could be about to get erased from altcoins if this support fails. Total2 at critical support Source: TradingView These are scary times for those holding altcoins. We are supposed to be in the midst of a bull run, but the bleed-out in cryptocurrencies just does not appear to want to stop. Currently, the altcoin market cap is just at the conjunction of the 0.618 Fibonacci and the rising trendline. If this support fails, the next stop is the 0.786 Fibonacci at $919 billion. Of course, some may say that the 39% that the altcoins market cap has already fallen from the top can be considered quite normal for a bull market. In fact, the previous bull market saw a drop of 60% before a rally up and past the previous all-time high. A similar correction this time could see the altcoins market cap going nearly all the way back to the $620 billion absolute bottom support. Not a scenario that would inspire confidence for getting much above the current all-time high by the end of this bull market. $ETH on brink of disaster Source: TradingView Probably the canary in the coalmine for the health of the altcoins is Ethereum (ETH). If this one drops, there is a very big likelihood that the rest will follow. $ETH is once again sitting on the brink of disaster. The price is at the very lowest level of the band of major support, and is only just above the bull market trendline, which stretches all the way back to July 2020. If this fails, and the price consolidates below, we might have to say goodbye to this current bull market. Will the $SOL bull trendline confirm as failed? Source: TradingView Solana (SOL) is the major layer 1 smart contract competitor to Ethereum, and as can be seen in the chart above, the bull market trendline has already potentially failed. The price has come well down below it, and the current monthly candle is looking to confirm the breakdown. That said, there is still the rest of this month to go, and anything can still happen. Very strong horizontal support is just below the price, and the Stochastic RSI momentum indicator is approaching the bottom. If one looks back at the last time the Stochastic RSI was this low, it was at the beginning of the bull run for $SOL. There is a scenario where the price could still pierce through the support band and hit the $100 horizontal support level. If it didn’t turn back up from there the bull run for $SOL could be over. That said, If it did turn back up, and the monthly Stochastic RSI started to rise, who knows how far $SOL could eventually go. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The altcoins have suffered even more, with the likes of SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK, and many others posting double-digit price declines over the past 24 hours. BTC Rejected Violently Probably very few people might have expected the massive volatility bitcoin and the entire crypto market will have to go through once Donald Trump took office. Let’s leave the months heading to his inauguration aside and even the crash from last week, which was mostly blamed on his tariffs and other geopolitical decisions. Let’s focus only on the events that transpired in the past 48 hours or so. Recall that on Sunday afternoon, the US president confirmed plans that his administration will work on a crypto reserve. This resulted in immediate price surges from most digital assets, especially those that he namedropped. A day later, BTC’s price had peaked at $95,000 as it had added ten grand in 12 hours. However, that’s where the rejection came in, as Trump’s tariffs were right around the corner (starting today). Bitcoin was quickly pushed down from the $95,000 level to under $90,000. It kept losing value as Trump paused the military funding to Ukraine. The culmination came hours ago when BTC dumped to $82,500. Although it has recovered over a grand since then, it’s still nearly 10% down on the day . Its market cap has slumped to $1.660 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is close to 58% on CG.

Ethereum is down to $2,100 after an 11.5% drop, XRP has slumped to $2.35 after losing 12% in a day, and SOL has dumped beneath $140 after a 16% decline. Similar or even more painful decreases come from DOGE, ADA, LINK, LTC, AVAX, SUI, XLM, SHIB, and many, many others.

Amid fresh trade tariffs and macroeconomic shifts, investors are moving toward safer assets like gold. However, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee remains optimistic, predicting that markets are close to bottoming out and that Bitcoin could still reach $150,000 by year-end. Market Uncertainty Hits Bitcoin Hard The recent downturn in Bitcoin isn’t happening in isolation. The U.S. has confirmed new trade tariffs against Canada and Mexico, rattling financial markets. Stocks have taken a hit, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropping sharply. Bitcoin followed suit, and BTC fell to $83K from $95K, dropping 10% in a single day and wiping out its recent gains . Analysts from The Kobeissi Letter note that this “global move” away from risky assets has made Bitcoin vulnerable. Gold, on the other hand, has performed well, trading near all-time highs. Gold went up by 10% while Bitcoin has fallen by the same percentage since January—suggesting that investors no longer see Bitcoin as a safe haven. Adding more selling pressure on BTC. Tom Lee: Bottom in Sight, BTC Still on Track for $150K Despite the pullback, Tom Lee believes this is just part of Bitcoin’s natural market cycle. He suggests that markets are currently in a bottoming phase and could stabilize by the end of the week. His focus is on Friday’s job data, which he sees as a major trigger for the next market move. Speaking to CNBC, he reveals several factors behind this catastrophic bloodbath, he directly blames the government’s complex measures under the Department of Government Expenditure (DOGE) program, which has reduced public spending. On top of this, his new tariff policies have created uncertainty for businesses and investors. He further adds that if job numbers come in worse than expected, there could be an initial wave of panic. However, Lee argues that poor data might push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates faster, which could provide a strong tailwind for Bitcoin and stocks. Futures markets are already pricing in 75 basis points of cuts by the end of the year, on top of the 100 basis points already implemented. The Bigger Picture for Bitcoin Lee isn’t overly concerned about Bitcoin’s short-term weakness. He attributes the decline to broader market cycles rather than any fundamental weakness in crypto. While he acknowledges that Bitcoin could briefly drop to $62,000, he remains confident that it will stage a strong comeback, potentially breaking past $150,000 before the year is over. According to trader Daan Crypto Trades, Bitcoin is retesting its 200-day moving average , a crucial support level in bull markets. He sees this as a rare and important moment, highlighting the need for bulls to hold this level to maintain the uptrend. $BTC Re-testing the Daily 200MA again.

Considering the current market sentiment and recent whale activity, it appears that whales may be saying goodbye to Solana. Will the SOL Price Fall to $100? Besides this, another crypto trader appears bearish on SOL, having deposited 2 million USDC to long the token. However, the bearish signal comes from the fact that he has placed a limit order between $100 and $131.82 to accumulate tokens. This suggests that SOL could drop to the $100 level in the coming days.

Additionally, Professor Satoshi expects the Fed to likely skip a rate cut in March and the potential for a larger 50 bps cut in May. A potential return of quantitative easing in 2025, one he has been anticipating since last year’s growth scare.""The Federal Reserve are always behind because they are data driven. On my bingo cards for 2025 is return of quantitative easing. Which no one thinks is possible but have been thinking this for sometime because ever since the growth scare last year, we managed to kick the can down the curb until now"".However, the strengthening Japanese Yen could be the canary in the coal mine, which is currently at its strongest level this year against the U.S. dollar at 148.

The vaults, including Vault 26949, Vault 22025, and Vault 1985, are collateralized with ETH and hold a combined value of over $348 million. However, they face liquidation risks if ETH’s price drops to $1,929, $1,844, or $1,796, respectively. Market watchers are closely monitoring these levels, as a breach could destabilize the DAI stablecoin and ripple through the broader DeFi ecosystem, potentially causing significant volatility. The slide comes as ETH grapples with its worst price action in recent years—down 12% in the past 24 hours to reach levels last seen in late 2023. Derivatives Positioning The price swoon continues to shake out leverage traders. Bitcoin and ether futures open interest on Binance has hit the lowest level since August last year. Open interest in BTC and ETH futures listed on the CME has declined to levels seen in November. The CME basis, however, has recovered above 5%, hinting at renewed bullish flows. Top 25 cryptocurrencies are down on a 24-hour basis, but only HYPE, BCH, XMR, SUI, OM, BNB, UNI and TON have seen a concurrent rise in open interest. That's a sign of traders shorting the decline in these tokens. On Deribit, BTC and ETH options show a renewed bias for puts.

The market is experiencing a significant shake-up. Bitcoin, the king of crypto, is currently facing a tough time, losing ground as traditional safe-haven assets like gold are gaining traction. What’s behind this dramatic shift, and what does it mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into the current market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Under Pressure Amid Trade War Escalation The global financial landscape is currently dominated by escalating trade war tensions, primarily sparked by fresh U.S. trade tariffs imposed on Canada and Mexico. This move has triggered a ripple effect across global markets, causing investors to reassess their risk exposure. Assets perceived as risky, such as cryptocurrencies and stocks, are facing a sell-off, as investors seek refuge in safer alternatives. This flight to safety is a classic market reaction during times of economic uncertainty. Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp downturn, plummeting by $10,000 in a mere 24 hours. This dramatic drop has effectively erased the gains from its recent rally, leaving many investors wondering about the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . Is Bitcoin Losing its Safe Haven Status? For a long time, Bitcoin was touted by many as a digital gold, a hedge against inflation and economic instability, a safe haven asset in the digital age. However, recent market behavior is challenging this narrative. Analysts at The Kobeissi Letter have pointed out a significant divergence in performance between Bitcoin and gold: Gold’s Resurgence: Gold, the traditional safe-haven asset, is experiencing a strong year, up by 10% year-to-date. This highlights gold’s enduring appeal as a store of value during turbulent times. Bitcoin’s Struggle: In stark contrast, Bitcoin is down 10% year-to-date, indicating that it is currently not behaving as a safe haven in the eyes of many investors. This performance gap raises a crucial question: Is Bitcoin truly a safe haven asset, or is it still primarily viewed as a risky, speculative investment? The current market dynamics suggest that investor perception is leaning towards the latter, at least for now. Why Gold Shines While Bitcoin Slumps Amid Trade War? Several factors contribute to gold’s outperformance compared to Bitcoin in the current environment: Established History: Gold has a centuries-long history as a store of value and a safe haven. Its reliability in times of crisis is deeply ingrained in investor psychology. Tangible Asset: Gold is a physical, tangible asset. In times of uncertainty, some investors prefer the security of holding a physical commodity compared to digital assets. Liquidity in Traditional Markets: Gold markets are highly liquid and well-established within the traditional financial system, making it easier for institutional investors to allocate capital to gold during risk-off periods. Bitcoin’s Volatility: Despite its potential, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. In times of heightened risk aversion, investors often shy away from volatility and seek stability. The ongoing trade war intensifies global economic uncertainty. When trade relations between major economies sour, businesses face disruptions, supply chains are affected, and overall economic growth prospects dim. In such an environment, investors typically reduce their exposure to riskier assets and increase allocations to safe havens like gold. The current situation is a textbook example of this market behavior. Critical Support Level for Bitcoin: 200-Day Moving Average From a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin’s price is now testing a crucial support level – its 200-day moving average (DMA). The 200-DMA is a widely followed technical indicator that often acts as a significant support or resistance level. What does this mean for Bitcoin? Key Level: Holding above the 200-DMA is considered crucial for Bitcoin bulls. A break below this level could signal further downside pressure and potentially trigger more sell-offs. Psychological Significance: The 200-DMA is not just a technical level; it also carries psychological weight. Many traders and investors use it as a benchmark to gauge the overall trend and health of Bitcoin’s price action. Potential Outcomes: Bullish Scenario: If Bitcoin bounces back from the 200-DMA and reclaims higher levels, it could indicate resilience and a potential resumption of the upward trend. Bearish Scenario: A sustained break below the 200-DMA could confirm a shift in momentum and potentially lead to a deeper correction in Bitcoin’s price. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action around the 200-DMA to determine the next likely direction. The coming days and weeks will be critical in assessing whether Bitcoin can maintain this vital support level. Navigating the Crypto Market Amidst Global Uncertainty The current market scenario underscores the importance of diversification and risk management in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin holds long-term potential, it’s crucial to acknowledge its inherent risks and its sensitivity to broader market sentiment and global economic events. The crypto market is still relatively young and prone to significant price swings. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Monitor Market Developments: Stay informed about global economic news, particularly updates on trade wars and geopolitical events. These factors can significantly impact the crypto market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes, including both cryptocurrencies and traditional assets like gold. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Use stop-loss orders and other risk management tools to protect your capital. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market corrections are a normal part of investing. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: The Evolving Narrative of Bitcoin and Safe Havens The current market dynamics present a fascinating case study in the evolving narrative of Bitcoin and its role as a potential safe haven. While gold continues to assert its dominance as the go-to safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and trade war anxieties, Bitcoin is facing a reality check. The recent price slump serves as a reminder that Bitcoin, while innovative and disruptive, is still subject to market forces and investor sentiment. Whether Bitcoin will eventually mature into a true safe haven asset remains to be seen. For now, in the face of global economic headwinds, traditional safe havens like gold are shining brighter, while Bitcoin navigates a period of increased volatility and uncertainty within the broader crypto market .

This classic real estate negotiation strategy involves starting with an extreme demand, creating leverage over the counterparty to ultimately seal the deal at a lower price, which was your intended goal all along. U.S. President Donald Trump, formerly a real estate tycoon, is seemingly employing the same strategy in securing the promised strategic crypto reserve comprising bitcoin (BTC) and probably ether (ETH). On Sunday, Trump said on Truth Social that he expects payments-focused XRP, Solana's SOL, and Cardano's ADA tokens to be a part of the strategic digital assets reserve with bitcoin and ether at the core. The initial market reaction was exuberant, lifting the total market cap by 11% or $300 billion to $3.09 trillion. The rally, however, ran out of steam Monday as market participants began criticizing Trump for being misinformed or ignorant for backing the inclusion of XRP and ADA. As expected, the initial excitement paved the way for the realization that Trump still needs to secure Congressional approval, and the plans to invest in altcoins contradict D.O.G.E's efforts to cut costs and bring down debt. ""Big problem here is optics. When you include altcoins whose use case is too nascent to be deemed ""nationally strategic,"" you risk the assumption of inside dealing even if it were patently false. This is politically negative, even among a subset of crypto enthusiasts,"" Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investment Management, said on X. ""Trump is about to understand in crypto land what bitcoin—and only bitcoin—represents,"" Park added. However, per some observers, the mention of altcoins appears to serve as a form of extreme demand, intended to overwhelm the opposition (Congress) and create leverage in discussions about the strategic crypto reserve. ""The announcement is probably just Trump's usual negotiation tactic. I.e. Calling for a Strategic Reserve with XRP, SOL and ADA, so he can get one for BTC (and maybe ETH),"" Ilan Solot, senior global market strategist at Marex Solutions, said in a client note titled ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" Solot added that the U.S. would retain the apprehended digital asset stockpile, but the probability of the government buying fresh BTC is less than 50%. Meanwhile, the odds of ETH purchases are small but real while those for altcoins are miniscule. Critics argue against XRP and ADA by pointing out that these cryptocurrencies lack the real-world presence and the established utility of Ethereum and Solana, which actively support financial activities through stablecoins. Additionally, the CME has not yet announced plans to list XRP and ADA futures, which is probably why many are against the addition of these coins to the national reserve. Note that before approving the spot bitcoin and ether ETFs, the SEC had approved ETFs investing in the CME-listed BTC and ETH futures, trusting the exchange's monitoring system to take care of the price manipulation concerns. Jason Atkins, chief commercial officer at crypto-making firm Auros, said that market reactions to Trump announcements unfold in three phases, with the first characterized by rumors, the second by a hyperbolic announcement and the final one by tough negotiations. ""The second phase is triggered by an official announcement from Trump or his team, which tends to mirror the speculative nature of the first. His negotiation style –characterized by hyperbole, outsized promises, and demands beyond what is immediately feasible – often results in an initial surge in sentiment. We saw this overnight, as the market reacted positively, largely due to the relief following the risk reduction in phase one. However, caution is warranted,"" Atkins told CoinDesk in a late Monday email. Atkins added that the possibility of another leverage washout remains high as investors reassess the reality of bureaucracy, negotiations, and the uncertainty surrounding the actual flow of funds. ""Given that Congressional approval remains a hurdle and the timing of real fund movements is uncertain, traders and investors will need to assess whether this is a structural shift or just another cycle of speculation-driven volatility,"" Atkins noted.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|ADA|ETH|FIAT|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-04 12:21:47

A seismic shift is underway in global trade dynamics that could ripple through various sectors, potentially influencing even the cryptocurrency markets. China, a major global economic player, has just announced a significant move: blocking soybean imports from three major U.S. exporters and suspending all U.S. lumber imports. This isn’t just about soybeans and lumber; it’s a potentially critical development in the ongoing saga of international trade relations. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you. Why is China Halting US Soybean Exports and Lumber Imports? According to reports from The Economic Times and China’s customs department, the reasons cited by China are centered around “quality and safety concerns.” Specifically, import qualifications have been revoked for three U.S. soybean giants: CHS Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company Grains Merchandising LLC, and EGT. Furthermore, a blanket suspension on all Lumber import suspension from the U.S. is set to begin on March 4th. While the official statements point to quality issues, the timing and scale of these actions raise eyebrows and fuel speculation about broader geopolitical and economic undercurrents. Is this purely about quality control, or is there more to this story? Let’s break down the key aspects: Quality Concerns: China states that the bans are due to quality and safety issues. However, details regarding these specific issues have been somewhat vague, leading to skepticism. Geopolitical Tensions: This move comes amidst existing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Many analysts view this as a potential escalation in a silent trade war, even if not explicitly stated as such. Economic Impact: Both soybeans and lumber are significant commodities. These bans could have considerable economic repercussions for U.S. exporters and potentially impact global supply chains and prices. Retaliation or Leverage?: Is China using these import suspensions as leverage in ongoing negotiations or as a form of retaliation for other policies or actions taken by the U.S.? This remains a crucial question. The Impact on US Soybean Exports and the Global Market Soybeans are a massive export for the United States, and China is a major importer. The implications of blocking US soybean exports from these key exporters are significant: Impact Area Potential Consequences U.S. Soybean Farmers Potential loss of a major market, leading to decreased demand and potentially lower prices for U.S. soybean farmers. This could impact their profitability and livelihoods. U.S. Exporters (CHS, Louis Dreyfus, EGT) Direct financial losses due to revoked import qualifications. They will need to find alternative markets for their soybean exports. Global Soybean Prices Uncertainty in the market could lead to price volatility. Initially, prices might decrease due to reduced Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans. However, long-term effects will depend on how quickly alternative suppliers and demand patterns adjust. Alternative Soybean Suppliers Countries like Brazil and Argentina, which are also major soybean exporters, could benefit from increased Chinese demand. What About the Lumber Import Suspension? The suspension of all U.S. Lumber import suspension starting March 4th adds another layer of complexity. Similar to soybeans, this action can have broad repercussions: U.S. Lumber Industry: U.S. lumber producers will face reduced export opportunities, potentially leading to decreased production and price adjustments in the domestic market. Chinese Construction and Manufacturing: China relies on lumber for its construction and manufacturing sectors. This suspension could disrupt supply chains and potentially increase lumber costs within China, although they will likely seek alternative sources. Global Lumber Market: The global lumber market could see shifts as China seeks lumber from other countries, potentially impacting prices and trade flows worldwide. Is This a Trade War Escalation? Understanding Trade War Escalation The term “ Trade war escalation ” might sound alarming, but it accurately reflects the potential trajectory of increasing trade tensions between major economic powers. While neither the U.S. nor China may explicitly declare a “trade war,” a series of escalating trade barriers and restrictions can effectively function as one. Here’s how this situation could be viewed as an escalation: Increased Trade Barriers: These import bans are significant trade barriers. They restrict the flow of goods and represent a departure from normal trade relations. Tit-for-Tat Actions: Trade disputes often involve retaliatory measures. If the U.S. responds with its own trade restrictions, it could create a cycle of escalation. Broader Economic Impact: Escalating trade tensions can negatively impact overall economic growth, investment, and business confidence in both countries and globally. Uncertainty and Volatility: Trade wars breed uncertainty, which can lead to market volatility and disrupt long-term economic planning. The Broader Global Trade Impact and Cryptocurrency Connection The ramifications of these trade actions extend beyond just soybeans and lumber. The Global trade impact is multifaceted and could influence various markets, including cryptocurrencies: Economic Uncertainty: Increased trade tensions contribute to global economic uncertainty. In times of uncertainty, some investors may turn to assets perceived as safe havens or alternative investments, and sometimes cryptocurrencies are considered in this category, although this is highly debated and depends on the specific crypto asset and investor sentiment. Market Volatility: Trade disputes can trigger volatility in traditional financial markets. Cryptocurrency markets, already known for their volatility, could experience amplified price swings in response to broader economic uncertainty. Supply Chain Disruptions: Trade barriers can disrupt global supply chains, potentially leading to inflation in certain sectors. Inflationary pressures can sometimes be seen as a positive factor for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are sometimes touted as an inflation hedge, although this is also a complex and debated topic. Geopolitical Risk: Escalating trade tensions are a form of geopolitical risk. Geopolitical events can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite, impacting both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. It’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. While trade disputes might be one piece of the puzzle, they are not the sole determinant of crypto prices or market trends. However, understanding these broader economic shifts is vital for anyone navigating the cryptocurrency space. Actionable Insights: Staying Informed and Prepared So, what can you do to stay informed and prepared amidst these evolving trade dynamics? Stay Updated: Keep abreast of news related to US-China trade relations and global economic developments. Reputable financial news sources and economic analysis websites are essential. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in uncertain times. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s traditional assets or cryptocurrencies. Understand Market Volatility: Be prepared for potential market volatility in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Risk management strategies are crucial. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): In the crypto space, DYOR is paramount. Understand the assets you invest in and how global events might impact them. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Global Trade China’s block on U.S. soybean and lumber imports is more than just a trade hiccup; it’s a potentially significant development that underscores the complexities and uncertainties of global trade in the current climate. Whether this is a temporary measure or a sign of deeper, more protracted trade tensions remains to be seen. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that events seemingly far removed from the crypto world can still have ripple effects. By understanding these dynamics, you can navigate the ever-changing landscape with greater awareness and make more informed decisions.

In a recent development, Israel released an initial design proposal for its official digital shekel (DS). Though the country’s potential launch of the digital shekel remains uncertain, Israel’s recent move underscores the growing alignment of global CBDC projects around key issues like anonymity, architecture, and ecosystem roles. Israel Introduces Preliminary CBDC Design: What You Should Know Notably, the Bank of Israel has taken a significant step in its CBDC initiative despite uncertainty on its potential launch. On March 3, 2025, the Steering Committee of the Bank of Israel published a preliminary design for its central bank digital currency, digital shekel. The proposal outlines the project’s key components, including its supporting ecosystem, functional capabilities, technical architecture, regulatory framework, and future plans. Israel believes that the CBDC could benefit public interests. In an official statement , the central bank highlighted, The DS is expected to offer a wide range of benefits to all segments of the population. It will be available to the entire public, including children, foreigners, all types of businesses, public institutions, and financial entities. Digital Shekel: Israel’s Potential Plans Interestingly, the Bank of Israel envisions developing a CBDC with a dual purpose. The plan includes the digital shekel catering to both retail transactions for individuals and businesses, as well as wholesale transactions for financial institutions. Similar to other proposed CBDCs, the central bank will have the control over the issuance and system rules of the digital shekel. Meanwhile, private-sector Payment Service Providers (PSPs) will manage customer onboarding and frontend services. In addition, Israel’s CBDC is poised to offer key features like offline functionality, interoperability with other payment systems and more. The bank stated, “The DS will be interoperable with other payment systems, allowing users to receive or pay in digital shekel even if the other party to the payment does not use the digital shekel.” The Rise of CBDCs: Central Banks Worldwide Embrace Digital Currencies Reportedly, nearly 134 countries and currency unions are exploring a centralized digital currency. The number has skyrocketed from just 35 in May 2020 to now represent 98% of global GDP. Three countries- the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria- have fully launched their CBDCs. The BRICS nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are currently testing their own CBDCs. Recently, the European Central Bank (ECB) released the inaugural progress card outlining the digital euro’s key features. Crypto Reserve vs Digital Fiat: US and Israel’s Different Approaches Israel’s CBDC update comes on the heels of the United States’ plans to adopt Bitcoin, XRP, SOL, and ADA for the national crypto reserve. This showcases the two countries’ diverse approaches to digital currencies. Though the digital shekel’s potential launch teeters on the brink, the US’ crypto reserve strategy will soon be implemented. It needs to be seen how these distinct approaches influence the global financial landscape.

At the moment, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is leading the way, and it’s not just hype. This crypto coin has AI-driven trading bots running 24/7, bolstering rewards for ETH buyers, and a presale that’s moving fast. I’ve seen it myself, one of my buddies, Jake, jumped in early, and let’s just say his portfolio is looking real nice. “Easiest money I’ve ever made,” he told me. Don’t wait too long, or you’ll be watching from the sidelines. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), The Meme Coin That Actually Does Something Most meme coins are all bark and no bite, but Dawgz AI is built different. It’s got real AI-powered trading, staking rewards, and a growing presale that’s leaving slow movers in the dust. While other meme coins rely on hype, $DAGZ actually works, making money while you sleep . Why $DAGZ Stands Out AI-driven trading bots go 24/7, automatically buying low and selling high. ETH staking rewards mean holders earn passive income with competitive APY . Presale momentum is strong , over $2.3M raised and climbing. Strong tokenomics keep things balanced: 30% presale, 20% staking, 10% liquidity. Pro tip: Coins with real utility are the ones that survive. $DAGZ isn’t just a meme, it’s a trading machine. Why Dawgz AI Is Better Other meme coins are just a logo and a dream. $DAGZ does something , it trades, earns, and grows your bag without you lifting a paw. Fun fact: When you ask yourself “ what is the best crypto to buy right now?” , the answer isn’t always the most obvious. Smart investors look for projects that do more, just like $DAGZ. Chainlink (LINK), The Backbone of Smart Contracts Chainlink (LINK) isn’t flashy, but it’s one of the most important cryptos out there. It connects smart contracts to real-world data, keeping DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain gaming running smoothly . Without Chainlink, a lot of Web3 would just stop working. Why People Like LINK Essential for DeFi , It provides accurate price feeds for decentralized exchanges. Trusted by major projects , Big players in crypto rely on Chainlink’s oracles. Strong track record , LINK has been around for years and proven itself. Expanding use cases , More blockchains are integrating Chainlink for data security. Why Dawgz AI Is Better Chainlink is necessary, but it’s not the best crypto to make money fast . LINK’s price moves slowly , and it’s not designed for quick profits . Dawgz AI , on the other hand, trades for you with AI-powered bots, making profits while you sleep. Plus, it offers staking rewards, which LINK doesn’t. If you’re looking for long-term stability, LINK is solid. But if you want a crypto that works for you and actually makes money, $DAGZ is the better bet. EOS.io (EOS), The OG of Scalable Blockchains EOS was once the biggest name in blockchain scalability. It promised fast transactions, low fees, and a developer-friendly ecosystem. While it’s still around, newer projects have taken the spotlight. So, is EOS still worth buying? Let’s break it down. Why EOS Still Matters Fast and cheap , EOS transactions are nearly instant with no gas fees. Developer-friendly , It supports smart contracts with flexible coding options. Enterprise adoption , Some companies still use EOS for private blockchain solutions. Fun fact: The best crypto to buy now for 2025 isn’t just about tech, it’s about adoption. Even the best blockchain can struggle if people stop using it. Dawgz AI vs. EOS EOS might be fast, but it doesn’t earn passive income for holders. No staking, no trading bots, no automated gains. It’s up to you to trade manually and hope for the best. Meanwhile, Dawgz AI works for you with AI-powered trading, giving rewards for ETH holders, and a growing presale. EOS is a tool, $DAGZ is an opportunity. Fun fact: AI-powered crypto trading bots are projected to dominate retail investing in the next few years. That’s why $DAGZ is ahead of the game. Feature Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Chainlink (LINK) EOS.io (EOS) Utility AI-powered trading & staking Decentralized price oracles Scalable blockchain Passive Income Yes (staking rewards) No No Presale Growth $2.3M+ raised Not a presale token Not a presale token Speed 24/7 auto trading Real-time data feeds Fast transactions Use Case Profit automation DeFi & smart contracts Enterprise & dApps Best For Making money passively Blockchain infrastructure Developers & enterprises Bottom line? Dawgz AI is the only one designed to put money in your pocket without the extra effort. What Is the Strongest Meme Coin? Meme coins are everywhere, but not all of them have real staying power . The strongest and best cheap crypto to buy have a mix of hype, utility, and a solid community backing them up. Let’s break down what makes a meme coin actually strong. Hype That Lasts A meme coin needs more than a catchy name, it needs people talking, trading, and holding long-term. A strong community keeps the hype alive. Social media buzz drives demand . Big presales show early investor confidence. Utility Beyond the Meme The best meme coins don’t just sit in a wallet; they actually do something . That’s where Dawgz AI stands out. AI-powered trading bots work 24/7. Staking rewards give holders passive income. Real financial benefits separate it from meme coins that rely only on hype. Tokenomics That Work Bad tokenomics kill meme coins fast. The strongest ones have a fair supply, good liquidity, and a smart allocation. Dawgz AI: 8.888B stock with balanced distribution. Liquidity & staking reserves make sure the price holds up. Presale momentum means people are buying in early. What Is the Best Crypto to Make Money Fast?

PEPE has made a strong comeback with a 15% price increase, signaling a renewed interest in meme coins. Meanwhile, an emerging meme project, Panshibi (SHIBI) , is rapidly gaining traction and investor interest. Having raised over $1.22 million in presale funding, analysts predict a 15x return. At the same time, Ripple Labs' token, XRP, surged 30% following U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest speech, which fueled speculation about crypto-friendly policies. With XRP, PEPE, and SHIBI waves, investors are questioning where the best opportunities lie. Should traders stick with PEPE? Join the early excitement of SHIBI, or bet on XRP’s bullish trend? PEPE News: 15% Price Recovery Sparks New Hype PEPE has bounced back with an impressive 15% gain, reigniting enthusiasm among meme coin traders. Recent PEPE news suggests that renewed market interest in meme coins and whale accumulation drive this rebound. Meme coins have continued to dominate the crypto markets. Their total market capitalization has grown significantly, reaching $115 billion as of early 2025, accounting for nearly 10% of the total crypto market cap. CoinGecko analysis reveals that ""the most popular crypto narrative in 2024 was by far the meme coin narrative, which captured 30.67% of global investor interest.” Meme coins have now become the top choice for investors looking for high-potential opportunities. According to PEPE news reports, the token’s sudden price jump is linked to increasing trading volume and speculative buying ahead of a potential breakout. PEPE whales are signaling a strong confidence in the token’s future price action. PEPE news forum indicates traders and investors are certain about further gains if market sentiment remains bullish. PEPE wasn't the only meme coin to experience a price surge after Trump's speech; the Ripple Labs token, XRP, also recorded a 30% increase. Trump's speech about his plans for crypto-based reserves hinted at more favorable crypto policies under his administration, fueled speculation that XRP could see increased institutional adoption. XRP's price jump came unexpectedly as its parent company, Ripple Labs, is still struggling with the U.S. S.E.C. Analysts suggest XRP could see even larger gains if regulatory conditions improve. Unlike meme coins like PEPE and Panshibi, XRP is a utility-based cryptocurrency with strong ties to financial institutions. On CoinMarketCap , XRP trades at $2.86, a 31.90% increase from the previous day's lows. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Next 15x Meme Coin? While PEPE is recovering, SHIBI is emerging as one of the hottest new meme coins in the market. Its presale has raised over $1.22 million, and investors are positioning themselves for a potential 15x gain. Why are high-profile figures, Crypto influencers, and PEPE news forums buzzing about SHIBI? Let's see. Panshibi (SHIBI) is an Asian-inspired project with a panda-themed identity that combines real utility with meme coins. In Asian culture, the panda signifies prosperity, and Panshibi's cultural appeal is expected to drive adoption in the region. Panshibi combines SocialFi, AI, and Defi integrations to build an ecosystem with real utility for long-term sustainability. Some of its utilities include; Stake to Earn: Long-term holders can stake their tokens to earn as much as 1200% APYs.. Exclusive Perks: Early/presale buyers get automatic access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club. Quest To Earn: Community members can participate in quests to earn rewards and incentives. Panshibi is designed to foster transparency, rewards, and fairness to its community. To ensure investor confidence, Panshibi has undergone a smart contract audit, its liquidity pool has been locked for 10 years, and its team tokens locked for 2 years. SHIBI is currently in presale stage 4, valued at $0.005. The presale stages will be in 15 stages, and the token price will continue to increase as the stage advances. Early buyers would see a 1200% increase during the presale, and analysts predict a 15x return post-launch. You are still early; buy SHIBI now!

Pepe Price Prediction has been all over my feed lately, and I’ve been watching every price move. It’s had a wild run, but let’s be real, meme coins are all about momentum. Some fade, while others take over. Right now, a new contender is catching eyes: Dawgz AI . It’s still in presale but pulling in new investors daily, and I’ve seen this pattern before, early movers often win big. So, will PEPE keep running, or is a shift coming? Let’s break it down and see if it’s time to double down or look at what’s next. Pepe Price Prediction 2025 Pepe Price Prediction for 2025 has traders watching closely as PEPE keeps gaining momentum. Some forecasts put it at $0.000055, while others see a breakout past $0.0027 if the hype stays strong. With meme coins , things can change fast, market trends, investor sentiment, and whale activity all play a role. PEPE’s recent surge suggests it’s still in the game, but will it hold its ground or face new competition? Let’s break down what could be next for the Pepe token price prediction. PEPE’s Long-Term Growth: Will It Stay King of the Memes? PEPE’s rise has been nothing short of legendary, but the real question is: How far can it go in the long run? If meme coin mania keeps thriving, PEPE holders could be in for some serious gains over the next few decades. Let’s look at the long-term projections. Expected Growth by 2030 By 2030, Pepe price predictions suggest a range between $0.00015 and $0.00028, with an average of $0.00021. That’s a potential 500% increase from today’s price if PEPE maintains strong community backing and whale support. While there will be some dips, history shows that meme coins with dedicated holders tend to rebound in a big way. Expected Growth by 2040 If PEPE continues its run, we could see it trading between $0.0012 and $0.0024 by 2040. That’s a massive 2,500% gain for early investors. Meme coins that survive long-term shifts in the market often become cultural icons, and if PEPE keeps its relevance, it could be one of the biggest names in crypto history. Expected Growth by 2050 By 2050, PEPE could be a powerhouse, with some forecasts placing its value between $0.01 and $0.015. That’s a 10,000% ROI for those who got in early. If mainstream adoption and meme culture continue to merge with crypto, PEPE might not just be a joke, it could be one of the strongest tokens in the game. The road ahead is wild, but the question remains: Will PEPE stay the king of meme coins, or will a new contender take the throne? PEPE’s Short-Term Growth: What to Expect in 2025 Pepe Coin (PEPE) has captured the attention of meme coin enthusiasts, and 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. With the current PEPE coin price experiencing fluctuations, investors are keen to understand its short-term growth potential. Here’s a month-by-month breakdown of PEPE’s price predictions for 2025:​ March 2025 PEPE might see a slight correction, dipping to $0.00000980 – $0.00001350. This could create a good entry point for buyers looking to accumulate before the next rally. April 2025 Stability could return, with prices averaging $0.00001250 as investor confidence grows. If PEPE holds support, it might set the stage for a stronger move upward. May 2025 The trading volume could pick up, pushing PEPE to $0.00001375 – $0.00001600. A breakout past resistance could signal the start of a bigger run. June 2025 Momentum may continue, with PEPE climbing to $0.00001580. If FOMO kicks in, this could be a key month for traders looking for short-term gains. July 2025 PEPE could reach $0.00002280, marking one of its strongest months. Increased hype and retail buying could fuel further growth. August 2025 The price might push toward $0.00002550, but profit-taking could cause some short-term dips. Traders should watch for buying opportunities during retracements. September 2025 A cooldown phase is possible, with PEPE dropping to $0.00001860 as some investors take profits. This could be a solid accumulation period for long-term holders. October 2025 PEPE may stabilize around $0.00001900, setting up for a potential rebound if market sentiment remains positive. November 2025 A gradual climb could take prices back up to $0.00002065, with renewed interest from investors looking to ride the next wave. December 2025 PEPE might close the year strong at $0.00002150 if bullish sentiment remains. With meme coin hype still alive, short-term traders could find plenty of opportunities throughout 2025. Dawgz AI vs. Pepe Coin: Which Meme Coin Stands Out? Meme coins are all about hype, but not all of them offer the same potential. Pepe Coin (PEPE) has already made its mark, while Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is gaining traction with a fresh approach. Let’s compare them side by side. Feature Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Pepe Coin (PEPE) Origins Meme-based but integrates AI-driven trading and staking Inspired by “Pepe the Frog” meme, driven by internet culture Utility AI-powered trading algorithms and staking rewards Primarily a speculative asset with no real-world function Token Supply Fixed supply (8,888,888,888 tokens) designed for scarcity Inflationary, relies on continuous investor demand Market Performance In presale, raising millions with strong investor interest Experienced rapid gains but highly volatile Community Mix of meme coin fans and AI-focused investors Large, meme-driven audience Growth Potential Long-term potential with AI utility and staking incentives Dependent on meme popularity and trading cycles Which One is the Better Investment? PEPE is a fun, speculative coin that thrives on hype. It’s had huge price swings, making it a high-risk, high-reward option. Dawgz AI , on the other hand, blends meme culture with AI-powered trading and staking, giving it actual utility beyond just speculation. If you’re looking for short-term meme coin volatility, PEPE might still have some fuel left. But if you want long-term potential with real use cases, Dawgz AI could be the smarter bet. The meme coin space moves fast, are you chasing the past or betting on the future? Which crypto gives highest return in 2025? There’s no guaranteed highest-return crypto for 2025, but meme coins and AI-driven projects are catching serious momentum. Pepe Coin (PEPE) has seen explosive gains before, but its volatility makes it unpredictable. Meanwhile, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is still in presale, attracting investors betting on AI-powered trading and staking rewards for long-term growth. High-risk options like these can deliver massive returns, but they can also crash just as fast. Do your research, watch market trends, and time your moves wisely. Final Verdict Pepe Price Prediction for 2025 shows potential for short-term gains, but its long-term success depends on meme culture and market hype. While PEPE has delivered explosive growth in the past, its lack of real utility makes it a high-risk investment. On the other hand, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offers more than just speculation, combining AI-powered trading and staking rewards with meme coin appeal. With a fixed supply and growing investor interest in its presale, it presents a compelling alternative for those looking beyond short-term hype. Both coins have potential, but the real question is: Are you chasing quick gains or investing in something with long-term utility? Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

A few years ago, if you asked someone about the best meme coin to buy , they’d probably laugh. Now? Nobody’s laughing. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE turned small investments into money. The next one that will explode? There’s no crystal ball, but there are signs to look for – community hype, utility, and timing . Some meme coins are just pump-and-dump scams. Others stick around and actually build something. Let’s look at the top contenders and see which one has the best shot at taking off. Coins That Could Be the Next Big Thing Not all meme coins are created equal. Some are just hype, while others actually have real potential . Here are a few that are making waves right now. 1. Dawgz AI Meme coins come and go, but DAWGZ AI is built differently . Dawgz AI packs high-frequency AI trading algorithms designed to generate consistent profits while you sit back. Imagine having an army of smart trading bots working 24/7 to maximize your bag. And the best part ? It’s still in presale , meaning you can grab it before the hype sends it to the moon.

AI-Powered Trading – The bots work non-stop, aiming for solid returns without effort. Easy for Everyone – It’s designed so that even new investors can get in.

Tokenomics That Make Sense DAWGZ AI has a total supply of 8,888,888,888 tokens, and they’re distributed smartly: 30% – Presale (your early chance to get in) 24% – Marketing (driving hype and demand) 20% – Staking Rewards (earn passive income) 15% – Community Rewards (for active holders) 10% – Liquidity Pool (to keep trading smooth) 1% – Foundation (long-term growth) How Much Can You Make? Let’s say you throw in $100 at the presale price of $0.00177. If DAWGZ AI hits even $1, you’re looking at a massive 56,497% gain. That’s life-changing money. So, is this the best meme coin to buy? Nobody knows for sure, but if you want a shot at the next big winner, DAWGZ AI is worth a serious look. 2. Shiba Inu: The Dog Coin That Won’t Quit Shiba Inu isn’t just a lucky meme coin that blew up and disappeared. It’s still here, still trading strong, and has one of the biggest crypto communities out there.SHIB has a $7.61B market cap and $412M in daily volume. That’s not chump change. It started as a Dogecoin alternative but now has real projects, DeFi use cases, and its own blockchain. Why People Still Buy SHIB It’s a household name – If you ask anyone about meme coins, they know Doge and SHIB. The SHIB Army is massive – This community has kept SHIB alive and pushing forward. Shibarium gives it real utility – Unlike most meme coins, SHIB has its own layer-2 blockchain for lower fees and faster transactions. It’s cheap to stack – You can still buy millions of SHIB for a few bucks, and if it ever hits a penny, early holders are golden. Is SHIB a High-Return Meme Coin? Even with price dips, Shiba Inu refuses to die. It’s still a top 20 crypto, has a circulating supply of 589.25 trillion SHIB, and continues to burn tokens to reduce supply. 3. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Refuses to Fade Dogecoin wasn’t meant to be serious. It was a joke, a fun little internet experiment. But jokes don’t usually turn into a $29 billion empire with $2.93 billion trading hands every single day. This isn’t just some random coin that popped up last year and disappeared. Dogecoin has been around for a decade, and it still gets people talking. Elon Musk loves it, businesses accept it, and it has one of the strongest communities in crypto. Why Dogecoin is Still a Money Maker The original meme coin that started it all. Every other meme coin is just trying to catch up. It’s actually used for payments , from Tesla merch to tipping your favorite creators. Billions in daily trades mean you can always buy or sell with no problem. The Dogecoin community is as strong as ever, and they don’t let their coin fade away. Can Dogecoin Still Make You Money? Dogecoin has been called dead more times than we can count, yet it keeps bouncing back. With 148.27 billion DOGE in circulation, it’s still one of the most traded cryptos on the market. If you’re looking for a meme coin that refuses to die and keeps printing money for early believers, Dogecoin is still leading the pack. 4. Pepe: The Meme Coin That Came Out Swinging Pepe didn’t wait around to make history. It launched in 2023 and blew up overnight, turning early buyers into legends. Some thought it was just another meme, but Pepe is still standing strong with a $3.06 billion market cap and $901 million in daily volume. This isn’t just hype. 409,000+ holders have stacked up PEPE, and it’s still one of the most talked-about meme coins. If you missed Doge and Shiba, Pepe could be your second chance. Why Pepe Still Has Potential It went from nothing to a multi-billion-dollar market cap in months One of the most liquid meme coins with nearly a billion in daily trades A growing holder base that keeps the momentum going The low price per coin makes it easy to stack a massive bag Is Pepe a High-Return Meme Coin? Pepe still has 420.68 trillion tokens in circulation, which means there’s room to grow. It has one of the strongest trading volumes in the meme coin space; people aren’t done with it yet. If you’re looking for a meme coin with explosive potential, Pepe might be the one to watch. 5. Bonk: The Underdog Meme Coin That Keeps Surprising Bonk came out of nowhere and slapped the crypto world . It’s the first dog-themed meme coin on Solana, and people ate it up. What started as a fun token turned into a serious contender, pulling in a $978 million market cap with $141 million in daily volume. Bonk isn’t just riding the meme wave. It’s been adopted across the Solana ecosystem, integrated into projects, and actually being used for payments. While some meme coins rely on hype, Bonk has carved out a real place in the market . Why Bonk is Worth Watching It’s the face of meme coins on Solana , a blockchain known for speed and low fees. Nearly a billion-dollar market cap , proving it’s more than a fad. Active community and real use cases beyond just speculation. Still dirt cheap , meaning stacking up a bag is easy. Can Bonk Be a High-Return Meme Coin? 77.75 trillion tokens in circulation but still growing in Solana. Its strong volume and adoption give it an edge over most new meme coins. Is it a low-cost meme coin with real momentum? Bonk is the dark horse. What is the next big crypto? Dogecoin and Shiba Inu already had their moment. The real money is in catching the next one early. That’s why DAWGZ AI stands out. It’s not just another meme coin – it comes with AI-powered trading bots that work while you hold. That’s not common in this space. It’s still early, and early is where the big money is. Strong community, real tech, massive potential. If you’re looking for the next big crypto , $DAGZ might just be it.

This has resulted in bullish movement for Dogecoin, which is on track to see a huge increase over the next month. For those seeking even greater upside, Rollblock is emerging as a major opportunity in blockchain gaming. The platform’s play-to-earn model and expanding ecosystem position it to benefit from GameFi’s resurgence. With projections of 50-100x gains, Rollblock could be one of the standout gaming tokens of this market cycle. Exploring Rollblock’s Bullish Potential Ahead Of Altcoin Season Rollblock is revolutionizing blockchain gaming, an industry poised for exponential growth in the coming year. With a vast library of over 7,000 games, ranging from classic casino staples like blackjack to cutting-edge blockchain-exclusive experiences, the platform offers a truly dynamic gaming environment for multiple demographics. The recent addition of sports betting has further strengthened Rollblock’s appeal, broadening its ecosystem and attracting more users. Having raised nearly $11 million in its tenth presale stage with over 50,000 members, Rollblock is rapidly cementing itself as a frontrunner in iGaming and blockchain entertainment this cycle in time for this market recovery. Central to Rollblock’s ecosystem is the RBLK token, which drives sustainability and community engagement.

Leveraging AI-powered fraud detection and advanced encryption, the platform provides a secure, transparent gaming environment that fosters trust among players and investors alike. Tantalizing Bullish Catalysts Bode Well For Dogecoin’s Price Dogecoin remains speculatory following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve amongst top ten cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano were included, Dogecoin was notably absent. Despite this, Dogecoin surged by 16% before a price correction retrace, Leading to speculation over whether it could be added in the future. While memecoins are often dismissed as speculative assets, Dogecoin has shown resilience and continues to attract mainstream adoption. The Dogecoin Foundation has recently struck deals with major brands to accelerate Dogecoin’s real-world utility, with plans to integrate payments into major sporting events, restaurant chains, and even US government services. Technically, Dogecoin’s price action has been bullish following the crypto reserve announcement, rebounding into its descending trend channel and testing critical resistance levels. Ali Martinez has highlighted an ascending price range for Dogecoin, stretching back to 2015, suggesting that if momentum holds, Dogecoin could eventually climb toward a $4 price target at the peak of the bull run, which would represent a nearly 1,900% increase. In addition, Elon Musk’s continued influence and the potential for DOGE payments on X could provide further catalysts for Dogecoin’s growth. If Dogecoin gains traction as a widely accepted payment method, some analysts believe it could reach new all-time highs, pushing past its 2021 peak of $0.74 and potentially solidifying its status as an actual legitimate digital currency.

Expert Insights & Future Predictions,https://nulltx.com/can-dogecoin-reach-1-expert-insights-future-predictions/,"Can Dogecoin Reach $1, or Will a Stronger Competitor Take the Lead? Can Dogecoin reach $1 , or is it just a meme-fueled dream? As someone who’s watched the wild world of crypto unfold, I’ve seen hype take coins to the moon – but I’ve also seen the market shift in unexpected ways. Dogecoin has been the internet’s favorite for years, but in 2025, the real question isn’t just if it will hit $1 – it’s whether a smarter, more powerful competitor is about to steal the spotlight. That’s where Dawgz AI comes in. This isn’t just another meme coin riding a wave of speculation – it’s built different. With a pocketful of trade bots , Dawgz AI doesn’t just promise hype; it delivers insane ROI by capitalizing on Ethereum’s powerhouse smart contract platform. If you’re looking for the next big thing, it’s time to ask: Why bet on Dogecoin when you could be holding the future? Can Dogecoin Reach $1? Dogecoin, created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, has evolved from a meme into a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. As of March 3, 2025, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.20 per token , with a market capitalization of around $29.58 billion. This valuation positions it among the top cryptocurrencies globally. The question remains: Can Dogecoin reach the elusive $1 mark? Historical Performance and Volatility Dogecoin’s journey has been marked by significant volatility. In May 2021, it achieved an all-time high of approximately $0.74, propelled by social media buzz and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. However, such rapid ascents were often followed by steep declines, highlighting the coin’s susceptibility to market sentiment and speculative trading.​ Market Capitalization and Supply Dynamics Reaching a price point of $1 would imply a substantial increase in Dogecoin’s market capitalization. With a circulating supply of about 148.28 billion DOGE tokens, a $1 price would result in a market cap of approximately $148 billion. This figure would surpass the current market capitalizations of several established cryptocurrencies, necessitating a significant influx of capital and widespread adoption.​ Technical Analysis and Predictions Technical analysts have observed patterns that could suggest potential upward movements. For instance, a recent breakout above a long-term falling wedge pattern has led some analysts to set an ambitious price target of $0.43 for Dogecoin. While this target is optimistic, it remains below the $1 threshold . Conversely, some machine learning algorithms have made bolder predictions. Dogecoin was anticipated to reach $1 by March 2025, with potential to climb as high as $1.11 by April . However, it’s essential to approach such forecasts with caution, as the cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous unpredictable factors.​ Factors Influencing Dogecoin’s Potential to Reach $1 Several elements could play pivotal roles in determining whether Dogecoin attains the $1 milestone: Mainstream Adoption: Increased acceptance of Dogecoin for transactions by businesses and merchants could drive demand and, consequently, its price. For example, Tesla’s acceptance of Dogecoin for merchandise purchases has set a precedent.​ Technological Developments: Enhancements to Dogecoin’s infrastructure, such as integration with smart contract platforms or improvements in transaction efficiency, could bolster its utility and attractiveness to investors.​ Regulatory Environment: The stance of global regulators towards cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, can significantly impact its price trajectory. Positive regulatory developments could encourage institutional investment, while stringent regulations might deter potential investors.​ Market Sentiment: As with many cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin’s price is heavily influenced by public perception and media coverage. Sustained positive sentiment, driven by endorsements or increased community engagement, can lead to price appreciation.​ Dogecoin Price Predictions for 2025: Month-by-Month Outlook Predicting cryptocurrency prices is never an exact science, but analysts have provided estimates for Dogecoin’s potential trajectory throughout 2025. While Dogecoin has had its fair share of ups and downs, these monthly forecasts give an idea of how the price could evolve over the year. Let’s take a look at how DOGE might perform month by month. Month Average Price (USD) January $0.35 February $0.37 March $0.31 April $0.32 May $0.37 June $0.43 July $0.47 August $0.48 September $0.50 October $0.54 November $0.58 December $0.64 Why Dawgz AI Outshines Dogecoin: Smarter Tech, Higher Returns, and Real Utility Dogecoin may have started the meme coin revolution, but Dawgz AI is here to perfect it.

The Best Low-Risk Options,https://nulltx.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-long-term-the-best-low-risk-options/,"Which Crypto to Buy Today for Long-Term? The Best Low-Risk Options If you’re wondering which crypto to buy today for long-term gains, the key is finding low-risk investments with strong growth potential. While many cryptocurrencies rely on hype, smart investors look for projects with utility, demand, and a solid roadmap. One of the best options right now is Dawgz AI , a low-supply, AI-powered crypto currently in presale at just $0.00313. Unlike high-risk meme coins, Dawgz AI offers AI-driven staking rewards and real-world utility, making it a future-proof investment. With its upcoming price increase, getting in early could lead to huge long-term returns. Which Crypto to Buy Today for Long-Term – 3 Low-Risk Options Finding a low-risk crypto with strong long-term potential can be challenging, especially in a volatile market. While many projects promise massive gains, only a few have real utility, strong demand, and sustainable growth. If you’re wondering which crypto to buy today, we’ve identified three solid investments that offer stability, long-term potential, and lower downside risk. 1. Dawgz AI If you’re looking for a high-reward, low-risk crypto with long-term potential, Dawgz AI is the standout choice. Dawgz AI is backed by AI-powered trading technology, designed to generate consistent returns while rewarding early investors. Why Dawgz AI is the Best Crypto to Buy Today Dawgz AI is in its early-stage presale, currently priced at $0.00313, but that won’t last long. With over $2.3 million already raised, demand is rising, and the next price increase is on the horizon. Investors who act now can lock in the lowest price before Dawgz AI enters exchanges, where prices could soar. This project stands out because of its AI-driven automation, which offers staking rewards and high-frequency trading capabilities. Dawgz AI has a total supply of just 8.88 billion tokens, making price appreciation far more realistic. Tokenomics and Utility: 30% allocated to presale, allowing investors to buy in early before listing. 2% staking rewards, encouraging long-term holding. AI-powered trading algorithms work 24/7 to deliver profit-generating strategies. Strong community-driven momentum, with a growing army of holders ready to push Dawgz AI into the mainstream. 2. SPX6900 SPX6900 has emerged as a strong contender for long-term crypto investors, showing massive growth from its lows and attracting significant trading volume. With a market cap of $482.99 million and a circulating supply of 930.99 million tokens, this token has already proven its ability to deliver substantial returns. Why SPX6900 is a Strong Long-Term Crypto Investment SPX6900’s price skyrocketed from its all-time low of $0.002384 to an all-time high of $1.77 in January 2025, representing a staggering 196 million percent increase. While it has since corrected to $0.5187, the project continues to show strong market resilience, and its recent price dip may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors. The project benefits from high liquidity, steady trading volume of $34.71 million in the last 24 hours, and a relatively limited supply of 1 billion tokens, making further price growth more achievable than projects with massive supply dilution. Is SPX6900 a Low-Risk Crypto? While SPX6900 has experienced significant volatility, dropping over 70% from its all-time high, its strong market presence and ability to recover from dips indicate that it has long-term staying power. Investors looking for a crypto with past breakout performance and future upside should keep SPX6900 on their radar. 3. Bitcoin Notcoin (NOT) has made waves in the market, but does it have long-term stability? With a market cap of $277.05 million and a circulating supply of 102.45 billion tokens, its large supply poses challenges for major price appreciation. Notcoin’s Performance and Market Trends Notcoin saw a strong initial surge but has been on a downward trend for months, struggling to regain momentum. While its high trading volume suggests liquidity, its massive supply makes significant long-term growth difficult. Current price: $0.002704, down 14.32% in the last 24 hours. All-time high: $0.02896 (June 2024), marking a 90.67% drop from its peak. All-time low: $0.002309 (just a week ago), showing weak price support. 24-hour trading volume: $85.04 million, demonstrating active trading but high volatility. Is Notcoin a Low-Risk Long-Term Crypto? Notcoin remains a highly speculative investment. While it still sees strong trading interest, the 90% drop from its all-time high raises concerns about its ability to sustain long-term value. Investors should consider whether its current price levels will hold or continue declining. For those looking for a truly low-risk, long-term crypto, Dawgz AI remains the better option. Unlike Notcoin, Dawgz AI has a lower supply, AI-powered utility, and a strong presale entry point at just $0.00313, making it a smarter investment with more growth potential. Which Meme Coin Has the Best Future? If you’re searching for the next big meme coin with real profit potential, look no further than Dawgz AI. This isn’t just another hype-driven token, it’s a high-utility, AI-powered revolution set to dominate the market. Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on community speculation, Dawgz AI integrates AI-driven trading and staking rewards, creating real value for holders. Currently in presale at just $0.00313, this is your chance to buy before prices surge. With a low supply, massive investor demand, and upcoming price increases, Dawgz AI is the meme coin built for the future, don’t miss out! Conclusion If you’re wondering which crypto to buy today for long-term gains, the answer is clear, Dawgz AI is the ultimate investment opportunity. Right now, it’s in presale at just $0.00313, but the next price increase is coming fast. Early buyers always win in crypto, don’t wait until Dawgz AI hits major exchanges.

As top assets get government attention, strong possibilities lie ahead for undervalued tokens. The major gainers include Chainlink, Cardano, Remittix (RTX) , AVAX and XRP, which are all likely to grow strongly. These cryptos aren't only topping charts; they have solid fundamentals, interesting use cases, and increasing adoption. There's momentum building, and right now may be the time to investigate which crypto to purchase before the next big breakout. Why XRP Price Has Surged 24% as Ripple CEO Backs US Strategic Reserve Plan XRP has soared roughly 25% within the last day as renewed investor confidence enters the market. The latest rally came after U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned a potential XRP Reserve, giving crypto bulls new energy. The other big tokens have followed suit, with Solana (SOL) up 12%, Ethereum 8%, and Cardano (ADA) up 53%. As of press time, XRP's value is up 19% at $2.65. The increased value occurs amid a record trading volume of $19.16 billion, up 427%. The rally comes after Trump made brand new remarks about the Strategic Reserve. Unlike past government initiatives targeting Bitcoin only, this reserve contains XRP, ADA and SOL and also signals a move to blockchain networks with real-world utility and scalability. Remittix: Blockchain & Traditional Finance for Seamless Global Transfers With Remittix, users can send cryptocurrencies to any fiat bank account worldwide. Over thirty currencies are supported, so users can connect their crypto wallets and make payments. This makes worldwide payments accessible and also eliminates the need for conventional financial institutions. Above all, Remittix (RTX) charges a transparent fee structure. In contrast to standard remittance services, which require substantial foreign exchange rates and hidden charges, Remittix charges a flat transaction fee. There are no hidden fees for currency conversion or bank transfers; the sender gets the total amount with no deductions. The platform is really simple to use. It has an interface similar to a standard banking app, where consumers send crypto payments, and recipients receive fiat currency. This makes Remittix practical for crypto-savvy individuals and newcomers to digital assets. Yet another advantage of Remittix will be speed. By leveraging blockchain technology, crypto transfers are processed immediately. The corresponding fiat transactions are then settled through local banking networks, typically within the same day. This efficiency beats traditional banking systems, which take several days to process international transfers. Remittix also removes numerous restrictions placed by banks on financial accessibility. Almost all that's needed is an internet connection to start transactions, making it an excellent option for all those restricted to areas without banking facilities. This feature facilitates financial participation and inclusion in the world economy. Being a decentralized platform, Remittix has no central authority, and transactions are peer-to-peer. This structure provides transparency since blockchain records are traceable and immutable. End users understand their transactions are verifiable and secure. With these features, Remittix is combining cryptocurrency and conventional finance in a fast, low-cost and easy way to send international cash. Cardano Jumps 60% After US Crypto Reserve Announcement Cardano (ADA) makes a solid comeback, surging 60% following days of downward movement. The rally came after Trump unveiled a national crypto reserve that includes ADA. This restored investor confidence and sent Cardano above $1 for the first time in over a month. Cardano is at $1.06 and must find $1 as a support level to sustain its rally. If it holds, ADA could continue climbing and cement its position as among the best cryptos to buy at this time. With growing adoption and institutional interest, many consider Cardano the very best crypto for the long term. Chainlink Is Gaining More Influence in the Crypto Market Chainlink (LINK) is quickly becoming one of the best crypto investments because its decentralized Oracle network drives blockchain advancements. Ranking 13th by market capitalization, LINK is trading for $16.54 , up 15% in the last 24 hours. The project has a $10.5 billion market cap, which demonstrates growing investor trust in its long-term potential particularly when blending blockchain with actual information. Chainlink traded $280.37 million in volume this last day up 34.49%. Its circulating supply stands at 638.09 million tokens of 1 billion. The launch of Chainlink 2.0 provides cross-chain interoperability and off-chain computation. With huge players like Vodafone and Binance operating nodes, Chainlink remains a very good crypto to invest in that delivers utility beyond traditional smart contracts. Avalanche's Rapid Growth Makes It a Top Investment Under U.S. Crypto Reserve News Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining ground as one of the very best cryptos to buy following reports that the U.S. government is considering a crypto asset. This announcement triggered increased market interest, with AVAX reaching $42.15 up 3.8% from a 24-hour high. The token boasts a $15.2 billion market capitalization, showing investor trust in its prospects. With thousands of transactions a second and low fees, Avalanche is a strong contender for institutional adoption. The network's subnets also transform blockchain scalability, attracting projects in DeFi, gaming and enterprise space. With speculation that Avalanche is in the proposed U.S. crypto reserve, AVAX is solidly positioned as the best crypto to invest in. If institutional demand keeps rising, the token might see additional price increases in future months. Why Investors Are Flocking to Remittix The RTX token is still on presale, giving early investors a chance to get involved with this new payment solution. The RTX token is now trading at $0.0694, a significant premium over its ICO price. The presale has raised over $13.4 million and sold over 57% of the tokens. This high investor interest demonstrates the industry is confident Remittix is able to transform cross border payments by integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream banking. With good presale momentum, revolutionary technology and increasing community support, Remittix could be a contender in the changing financial landscape.

Meanwhile, Rollblock is emerging as a major player in blockchain gaming, combining play-to-earn mechanics with a rapidly growing ecosystem. As gaming tokens regain traction, Rollblock is well-positioned to be one of the standout performers this cycle. Discover Rollblock’s One-Of-A-Kind Potential Rollblock is emerging as a major force in blockchain gaming, revolutionizing iGaming with its advanced play-to-earn ecosystem. With over 50,000 active members and $10.8 million raised in its presale, the platform is rapidly scaling and positioned for exponential growth in the evolving GameFi sector. Featuring a massive collection of over 7,000 games, Rollblock caters to both traditional casino players and blockchain gaming enthusiasts. The introduction of sports betting has expanded its reach, offering users a decentralized entertainment hub where they can wager on major sporting leagues such as the Premier League and UFC events. Security is a top priority, with Rollblock implementing advanced protections to ensure fairness and transparency. Backed by regulatory approvals from SolidProof and Anjouan Gaming, the platform stands apart from competitors in an industry often plagued by trust issues and security vulnerabilities. Rollblock’s deflationary tokenomics model strengthens long-term value by allocating 30% of platform revenue to RBLK buybacks. Of these, 60% are permanently burned to create scarcity, while 40% are distributed as staking rewards. This sustainable approach incentivizes investors and players, fueling continued platform expansion. Could Ethereum Be On The Verge Of A Significant Breakout? Ethereum is currently at a crossroads as investors anticipate a breakout to occur in the short-term future. President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve on TruthSocial, which notably includes Ethereum, was timed to perfection to save Ethereum from collapse and the potential for a new altcoin season. Institutional interest in Ethereum remains strong at this time, as evidenced by a recent surge in whale accumulation. Over just a 24 hour period, whales purchased 190,000 ETH worth over $422 million, indicating immense confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential despite recent stagnation in early 2025. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price currently sits at $2,156 , with analysts divided about how Ethereum will pan out in the next few months. If momentum continues to build, Ethereum could reclaim previous highs and continue to solidify itself as the core Layer-1 in the digital blockchain economy and the second biggest altcoin. In addition, Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem continues to address concerns over centralization and scalability. Research from Ethereum developers suggests that a decentralized random block proposal system could mitigate the dominance of a few major entities in block production, a shift that could enhance Ethereum’s censorship resistance while improving transaction efficiency. Leadership changes at the Ethereum Foundation are also pivotal. The recent appointment of Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak as co-directors is a strategic move that aims to balance Ethereum’s core values with the need for optimization to compete with alternative giants such as Solana and Sui.

Notorious for their price swings, the current surge in the swinginess of prices has sent many investors scurrying to their on-chain accumulation data for greater insights. In the realms of potential support and resistance, on-chain data seems to be hitting the nail right on the head when it comes to Bitcoin. Current data suggest a price point that’s very much in play at present is right around the $96k level. For traders and holders alike, this is an increasingly concerning point. Bitcoin Faces Resistance as Losses Mount for Holders On-chain data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) is now up against a huge resistance level at around $96,000. This level is significant because it’s roughly where 1.66 million BTC are held by investors who bought at a higher price. If the price of BTC had dropped to, say, $20,000, those investors would have written off that purchase as a loss and moved on. But because the price is hovering near their entry point, many of these underwater holders might feel the need to sell at $96,000 in order to at least pay off the debt they incurred with that purchase. Volatility has returned to crypto, and on-chain accumulation data can be invaluable in pinpointing potential support and resistance zones. In the short term, a key resistance level appears around $96k, where roughly 1.66 million BTC is currently being held at a loss. Fearful… pic.twitter.com/nnrkRTqP6H — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 3, 2025 In cryptocurrency markets, the decision made by many to sell when they’ve reached their break-even points is quite common, especially during times of uncertainty. At such times, even a moderate amount of selling may create a substantial level of selling pressure, making it difficult for Bitcoin to achieve any kind of sustained upward movement—especially if the upward price target is $96k. The longer the price stays below $96k, the more it appears that the market itself may be forcing some sellers to exit at their break-even points below $96k. Meanwhile, the market has already shown us that it can create a level of selling pressure when it appears headed towards a smooth and sustained retracement. And this event may be pivotal. ETF Outflows Reflect Waning Confidence Amid Volatility The recent flows into Bitcoin ETFs have also caused concern in the market. Between Feb. 24 and Feb. 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw significant outflows. In that five-day window, ETF outflows totaled $2.61 billion; this wasn’t just taking money out of ETFs and moving it onto the Bitcoin blockchain—that’s somewhere we might expect there to be a healthy amount of accumulation if confidence in Bitcoin is as strong as some say it is. This wasn’t. The outflows suggest that institutional investors—who usually drive much of the liquidity in Bitcoin markets—may be taking a more cautious stance amid increasing volatility. The large withdrawal figures could mean that these investors are looking for safer, more stable assets or are unwilling to expose themselves to the kind of risks that crypto assets seem to be presenting. And we know from past experience that the kind of price fluctuations we’re seeing now (with the kind of mutations we’re seeing now from day to day) are not good for Bitcoin’s institutional image. Last week (February 24 to February 28, ET), Bitcoin spot ETF had a net outflow of US$2.61 billion; Blackrock ETF IBIT had a net outflow of US$1.17 billion; Ethereum spot ETF had a net outflow of US$335 million. https://t.co/YanotfbWiJ — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 3, 2025 The Impact of Market Sentiment on Bitcoin’s Short-Term Outlook These factors—on-chain data revealing significant BTC holdings sold at a loss and the outflows from ETFs that are big enough to make a dent—point to the short-term forecast for Bitcoin being swayed by sentiment, which is not something you want if you’re bullish. Fear permeates the market when sentiment is on the downswing, and that pushes actual Bitcoin sales down, as appears to be the case now. Of course, when fewer actual Bitcoins are sold at higher prices, that pressure seems to be pushing the price down toward the $96k resistance zone. At present, the tug-of-war over the price action of Bitcoin appears to revolve around who is doing the accumulating and where the accumulation is happening. Long-term holders have apparently chosen this moment to step in and begin some accumulation of their own, at least on the types of exchanges where on-chain data is available. But not all accumulation is happening on OTC desks or by custodians holding private keys. And while the price action of Bitcoin is still highly volatile, there is now a picture emerging from on-chain data as to what might be the major price support and resistance zones. Conclusion: Navigating the Volatility Ahead With the return of volatility to the crypto market, the path ahead for Bitcoin will likely be influenced by a combination of technical and external factors. On the technical side, accumulating on-chain and reaching key resistance levels like the $96,000 target will be crucial. But we also shouldn’t ignore the significance of external elements like ETF outflows that could tip the market. If the holders’ sentiment is positive, then overcoming $96,000 will be more likely, but if the opposite is true, we’re in for a short retracement. It will be very important for investors to understand these essential data points and market signals if they hope to navigate the current volatility and make well-informed decisions while Bitcoin tries to reestablish itself in a turbulent market. Yet with support and resistance levels that seem to be in constant transition, how can one hope to stay on top of things? One approach is to obsess over these on-chain and market-wide developments and look to capitalize on them as future opportunities. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

BTC initially plunged from near $100,000 to $78,200 last week and then bounced back to $95,000 on Monday, and down $83,800 today. One crypto analyst believes that the BTC price will remain in a wide range between $70K and $90K for a while. Bitcoin Price to Remain Between $70K and $90K for a While BTC and other cryptocurrencies have numerous catalysts ahead. There are rumours that Donald Trump will use his crypto summit to pitch no capital gains tax for US coins . He has also hinted that the US will start a strategic crypto reserve . Additionally, the SEC has dropped numerous crypto lawsuits against top companies like Uniswap and Coinbase. In an X post , Alphractal estimated that Bitcoin price will remain inside the wide range of between $70,000 and $90,000 for a while. It based this case to the fact that this is where metrics like open interest, trade count and buying volume. Alphractal estimates that there will be frequent liquidations before a clear breakout emerges. Bitcoin Liquidity Profile The Bitcoin price prediction came as its volatility jumped. The average Bitcoin volatility has more than doubled in the last ten days. Santiment data shows that the four-week Bitcoin volatility has jumped to 0.052, the highest level since December 8 last year, after bottoming at 0.027 last month. Bitcoin Volatility This volatility has been driven by the trade war between the United States and its top trading partners that will impact trade worth over $2.2 trillion a year. The US is now levying a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, risking slow growth and high inflation. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Death Cross Risk Emerges BTC has been highly volatile in the past few days, after crashing below the crucial support level at $89,000. This price was the neckline of the double-top pattern at $108,200. The coin has crashed below the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages. With the spread between the two narrowing, there is a risk that the coin may form a death cross, where the two cross each other. Bitcoin price has dropped below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, crash below last week’s low of $78,200, which is also the 50% retracement level, may trigger more downtrend to the 61.8% retracement level at $71,500. This price is within the $70,000 and $90,000 range set by Alphractal. On the flip side, a surge above the resistance at $95,000 will catalyze a surge, possibly to $100,000 and the all-time high. Bitcoin Price Chart Potential Catalysts for Bitcoin Bitcoin has numerous catalysts ahead. From a macro level, there are rising odds that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates soon. A good evidence for this is that US bond yields have continued falling, with the 10-year and 30-year yields crashing to the lowest level since December 6. US bond yields Bitcoin may benefit from a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as that will trigger more purchases by the US and other countries. Further, Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Z score has dropped to 2, meaning that the coin has become undervalued. Bitcoin MVRV Chart The MVRV-Z score ratio is a popular indicator that looks at the market value and the relative value and then conducts its z score.

These “smart money” wallets are now rebalancing, and in doing so have shifted interest toward several distinct narratives and projects. Their diversification is largely across the spectrum. From meme coins to AI integration and state-of-the-art stablecoins, what these smart investors are buying gives us a better idea of the next big thing in the market. Smart Money Wallet Accumulations by Sector Recent data indicates that accumulation among smart money wallets is heavily concentrated on meme tokens, wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), AI agents, and stablecoins. Though some of these narratives may appear unconventional, they’re emerging alongside trends that could reshape parts of the crypto landscape. Meme Tokens: $WIF (Dogwifhat) One of the most notable tokens attracting astute investor attention is $WIF, a meme token that’s surging on the Solana blockchain. Known as the “Meme King of Solana,” $WIF is capturing investor interest due to its strong, fast-growing community. Over the past 24 hours, two smart wallets have purchased more than $2.3 million in $WIF, highlighting a shift in investor confidence toward meme coins beyond the well-established players Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB). The meme coin sector still offers very traditional payoffs for decidedly untraditional projects. The success of the $WIF token, for instance, can’t really be understood without appreciating the strength of community-driven crypto projects in this space. Sure, you might laugh off the group that twirls virtual Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): Bridging Bitcoin and DeFi Another prominent accumulation area is wrapped Bitcoin ($WBTC). WBTC is a token of Bitcoin (BTC). It permits use of the coin in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. In the past 24 hours, two smart money wallets have accumulated a combined $498,000 worth of WBTC, illustrating the necessity of connecting Bitcoin to Ethereum and using it in DeFi protocols. Investors appear to be building a position in Bitcoin while at the same time utilizing the tantalizing opportunities opened up by DeFi. Wrapped Bitcoin is crucial to this. WBTC is now the main vehicle through which DeFi users can gain access to Bitcoin. Why not go a step further and Bulk Up Bitcoin in DeFi? If wrapped Bitcoin is core to DeFi right now, what might using DeFi with Bitcoin in an unwrapped state yield? Yes, it’s risky. But for the long-term investor, it could pay dividends. In short, the play is Bitcoin in DeFi. AI Agents: $ARC (AI Rig Complex) A narrative that is drawing attention from smart money investors these days is artificial intelligence (AI), and one project within this ecosystem that is gaining traction is $ARC (AI Rig Complex). $ARC looks at AI agents and their integration with blockchain technology. In the smart money sphere, three wallets have loaded up on $ARC to the tune of a total of $50,000 over the last 24 hours. This growing interest seems to be coalescing around the potential applications of AI within the blockchain and cryptocurrency spaces. The next step in the evolution of decentralized technologies seems to be the integration of AI and blockchain. Many innovative projects are popping up that sit at this intersection. $ARC is one of them, and it’s a good example of the kind of research and development that’s happening now. Of the many such projects, some could be expected to come up with solutions that are as-yet undiscovered, and R&D by successful ones will likely make the crypto space more robust. The uses of AI to do this are the part that’s just starting to get interesting. Infinite Money: $IMG (Infinite Money Glitch) One of the unconventional narratives making waves is $IMG (Infinite Money), a token that promises rewards in Solana (SOL) for holding the asset. Known as the “infinite money glitch,” $IMG has captured the attention of one smart money wallet, which accumulated $10,000 worth of the token. Despite the speculative nature of this project, its rise to prominence reflects a growing interest in innovative and experimental models within the crypto space. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: Meme Tokens (7 wallets) Wrapped Bitcoin (5 wallets) AI Agents (4 wallets) Infinite Money (2 wallets) Stablecoins (1 wallet) Top accumulations and reasoning: $WIF … pic.twitter.com/TXgj67r3ZS — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 3, 2025 The concept of the ‘infinite money glitch’ may seem to come from the gaming world, but it has made its way into cryptocurrency. The notion that rewards can simply be earned from holding a token is enticing to many risk-seeking investors. And in all fairness, what could be more speculative than a currency that seems to guarantee annual returns of 30% to 50% for simply holding it? While the long-term viability of $IMG or nation-state cryptocurrencies remains unproven, their recent rise highlights a continuous and mostly unregulated innovation frontier. Stablecoins: $EURC (Euro Coin) Stablecoins remain a fundamental part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the $EURC stablecoin, recently approved in Dubai, has drawn the attention of an interesting wallet in the last 24 hours. This wallet, not exactly known for making bad calls, has accumulated $10,000 worth of $EURC. So it’s probably safe to say: There’s confidence in $EURC making it big. And why wouldn’t it? It’s a stablecoin with an entirely European flavor. $EURC is a euro-backed stablecoin gaining traction and becoming credible in its adoption across many parts of the world. $EURC is a project in line with what one might consider a central bank digital currency—a safe, stable, and regulatorily clear currency for the global digital economy. The surge in interest around stablecoins is closely tied to the global conversation about the need for regulatory clarity. What we at Stably see as the ultimate outcome of this conversation is a diversified digital dollar, digital euro, and digital pound, stable currencies that accordingly can be used for cross-border payments and as a safe store of value for all kinds of crypto financial applications. Conclusion: Smart Money’s Strategic Moves Across the Crypto Landscape The smart money is not just throwing cash at the latest objects of lust in the cryptocurrency world, like meme tokens. But it is, indeed, directing cash towards these far-from-silent communities. On the one hand, we have the wrapped Bitcoin exposure story to narrate. And on the other, we have what is, more or less, a stable narrative for the not-so-stable stablecoin observed during this latest cash accumulation phase. Intelligent capital investors are spreading their investments through different sectors, indicating their faith in the long-term growth of many emerging trends in the crypto space. The market is maturing; new technologies are continuously surfacing. These investors appear to be well-versed and quite enamored with the space, making more strategic bets across sector and style in their portfolios than ever before.

This burgeoning segment, currently valued at a robust $17.6 billion, has seen explosive growth over the past year and is projected to reach an astonishing $10 trillion market value by 2030. A major change is happening with how institutional investors see tokenized assets, and it’s just starting to be felt. Real-world assets like real estate, commodities, and private credit have long been confined to either the physical world or traditional finance. But the tokenization of these assets is making possible a new suite, or wave, if you will, of financial products that are decidedly more accessible and efficient than their forebears. And as we watch these developments, it’s worth noting that RWAs have quickly become one of the crypto industry’s fastest-growing market segments. Driving Growth: Private Credit Markets and Tokenized Treasuries Two key factors can be held responsible for the rapid growth of the RWA market: private credit markets and tokenized treasuries. Private credit markets, which have always been somewhat difficult to see through and access, are becoming a major area of focus for tokenization. By turning the private credit assets into tradable tokens, they’re made much more liquid and much more straightforward to trade and manage on the blockchain. In the same way, driving institutional adoption has been the role of tokenized treasuries. To participate in this market, institutions don’t need traditional intermediaries like banks, because treasuries—usually backed by the government—are now tradeable on blockchain networks. This is a much easier access point for participating in the market. And since participators can potentially earn higher yields and better liquidity given the types of structures being used here, treasuries have become quite popular among institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios in the crypto space. The need for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) directly reflects the burgeoning demand for inventive financial remedies that link conventional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi). The wellspring of this asset class is a key reason both are expected to grow in tandem. The desire on the part of financial institutions to buy into the RWA space through crypto partnerships is also causing concern on the part of some privacy advocates. Unprecedented Growth and Expanding Market Opportunities In the previous year only, the RWA market has been an impressive growth of 90%. This extraordinary growth underscores the incredible demand for tokenized issues and the vast, untapped potential within this sector. RWAs give institutional investors a way to enter the crypto space while still holding assets that possess real-world, tangible value—real estate, for instance. For investors who may have been shy about the volatility and perceived risk of cryptocurrencies, RWAs provide a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Institutional interest is exploding. RWAs are one of the fastest-growing segments in crypto, currently valued at $17.6B, with forecasts estimating a $10T (yes, trillion!) market by 2030. Over the past year alone, the sector has grown by 90%, largely driven by private credit… pic.twitter.com/1a5eDLxjvE — exponential.fi (@ExponentialDeFi) March 3, 2025 This growth is not just a fleeting trend but a sign of an evolving financial ecosystem. As institutional investors grow more comfortable with blockchain technology and its promise of transparency, security, and efficiency, the appeal of RWAs seems set to grow exponentially. Tokenized real estate, commodities, and private equity are just a few examples of the asset classes making their way into the crypto space, and this trend seems likely to continue as more industries explore the benefits of blockchain solutions. In addition, the integration of RWAs into decentralized finance platforms is elevating these assets’ utility and accessibility. For instance, tokenized real estate can now be used as collateral in DeFi lending protocols, which is creating novel opportunities for lending and borrowing. The tokenization of traditional assets is also democratizing investment in these assets. Fractional ownership of tokenized traditional assets enables investors to access and participate in DeFi protocols in a way that was previously impossible. The Road Ahead: A $10 Trillion Market by 2030 In the foreseeable future, the RWA market appears to be set for phenomenal growth. It is not just an impressive growth rate that we are forecasting, but it is also the sheer size that we are foreseeing for tokenized real-world assets by the end of this decade. We see the total market value of RWAs hitting somewhere around 10 trillion dollars by 2030. Institutional adoption of the asset class is our main driver for this growth. RWAs are not just a sweet deal for institutional investors; they present a far bigger opportunity for the crypto ecosystem. The look of RWA markets—and their performance—is a key indicator of DeFi’s potential. If the RWA market does what it is supposed to do, the DeFi and crypto industries will look at them as serious vehicles for growth, not just speculative playpens. The growing number of established financial firms investigating blockchain-based solutions means that the divide between old finance and new decentralized technology is fading fast. Today, the biggest players in crypto seem to be working hard to set up the appearance—if not the reality—that the industry carries as much weight as the virtual or augmented reality space, and involves as many real-world assets. Conclusion: The Future of RWAs in Crypto The swift ascent of real-world assets in the cryptocurrency space underscores the institutional interest in tokenized assets. With a current market cap of $17.6 billion and projections to reach a staggering $10 trillion by 2030, RWAs might be seen as one of the most exciting and transformative sectors in a maturing crypto market. As the financial ecosystem continues to integrate with this new asset class, tokenized RWAs could represent an increasing part of the indie investment world. Investors and institutions seeking diversification and new opportunities in blockchain technology would do well to consider RWAs. Because as tokenization develops, the potential of RWAs seems boundless, and the market barely appears to be aware of just how much real growth and true potential are packed into RWAs.

Ripple’s recent partnership with BDACS for institutional custody services has done little to stem XRP price volatility, which has declined 37% over the past month. Meanwhile, investors looking for growth are turning to DTX Exchange ‘s $0.18 presale, which anticipates 2x in value to $0.36 upon listing. DTX Exchange has quietly attracted over 15,000 former Ripple traders seeking both privacy protection and substantial upside potential before its anticipated Q2 launch. DTX No KYC Edge Drives Over 15,000 XRP Traders Over 15,000 Ripple traders are diversifying into alternative crypto projects during ongoing regulatory concerns. Many are prioritizing platforms with no KYC (identity verification) rules to protect their financial privacy while dealing with uncertain legal landscapes. As mainstream exchanges tighten identity checks, privacy-conscious traders are migrating to options like DTX Exchange. This platform appeals to Ripple holders by offering secure trading without compromising user anonymity—a balance increasingly rare in today’s regulated markets. XRP price has fallen 37% in a month to $2, reflecting its volatility during regulatory debates. Traders now seek assets that combine privacy features with growth potential, hedging against uncertainties tied to government oversight. Source: XRP Price, Monthly Chart, CoinMarketCap Experienced investors are targeting presale projects with strong token economics and built-in privacy tools, viewing them as safer bets in today’s cautious market environment. The steady flow of capital from the Ripple community to DTX Exchange indicates a strategic repositioning as traders seek the best crypto to buy for both fast gains and long-term stability. DTX Exchange at $0.18 Has a 200% Upside Current market analysis positions DTX Exchange as a standout performer in the presale space, with its token priced at an accessible $0.18 during the bonus stage. The projected listing price of $0.36 represents a potential 2x on investment for presale participants, a compelling value proposition in today’s fluctuating market. By using the promo code “LIST2X”, investors can double their token wallets, positioning themselves for potential 2X returns upon listing. While the XRP price has experienced a weekly decline of 23%, the new DeFi project DTX has maintained steady growth throughout its presale phases. The platform has successfully raised over $15.3 million from more than 720,000 unique investors, demonstrating substantial market confidence in its hybrid trading model. Financial experts point to the limited supply of 475 million DTX tokens as a key factor supporting its long-term value proposition. Compared to Ripple’s market cap of $120 billion, DTX Exchange offers early investors an opportunity to enter at a favorable valuation before its mainstream exchange debut. A crypto analyst recently tweeted: “Projects combining traditional finance with blockchain innovation typically outperform market expectations by 3-4x upon listing. DTX Exchange’s hybrid model and strong presale performance make it a top crypto to invest in before mainstream adoption kicks in.” The Passive Income Model From DTX Outshines XRP Price’s 37% Drop XRP price volatility has intensified over the past month, with the asset experiencing a substantial 37% decrease that has left many holders seeking more stable returns. The passive income model introduced by DTX Exchange offers a compelling alternative through its innovative staking mechanisms and revenue-sharing structure. DTX Exchange uses a custom Layer-1 blockchain to enable unique features like micro-investing across assets and institutional-grade analytics. This tech backbone helps users profit in both rising and falling markets—a stark contrast to Ripple’s recent instability. Serious investors recognize that portfolio diversification extends beyond simply holding different cryptocurrencies to include varying income-generation strategies. DTX Exchange’s copy trading feature represents one of several avenues through which users can generate passive returns, making it potentially one of the best cryptos to buy for sustainable income. Platforms offering diverse income streams (like DTX’s access to 120,000+ assets) tend to outperform single-use cryptos during turbulent periods. Traders can pivot between stocks, crypto, forex, and ETFs in one place, reducing reliance on any single market. Conclusion As the XRP price continues to face challenges, DTX Exchange emerges as a standout alternative with its privacy-focused model and significant upside potential. The combination of no KYC requirements, passive income opportunities, and projected 200% growth presents a compelling case for diversification.

Today, March 4, 2025, the asset has soared over 10% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.24, seemingly reclaiming its crucial support level of $0.25. Why is HBAR Price Rising? The potential reason behind HBAR’s impressive price rally is the recent Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) filing by the asset management giant Grayscale. Additionally, Nasdaq assisted the asset manager with the filing process. HBAR Sees $12 Million in Exchange Outflows With the filing, investors and long-term holders have shown strong interest, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of over $12 million worth of HBAR in the past 24 hours. This substantial outflow from exchanges has the potential to create buying pressure and fuel an upside rally, which explains today’s HBAR gains. Source: Coinglass In addition to investors’ bullish outlook, intraday traders seem strongly positioned on the bullish side. Major Liquidation Levels At press time, the major liquidation levels are at $0.22 on the lower side and $0.246 on the upper side, with traders over-leveraged at these levels. Data further revealed that traders betting on the bullish side have built $7.50 million worth of long positions at the $0.22 level, whereas $3.85 million in short positions have been placed at the $0.246 level. Source: Coinglass These liquidation levels and over-leveraged positions by traders show that bulls are currently dominating and could support the asset’s upcoming upside momentum. HBAR Price Action and Upcoming Level With today’s gain, HBAR seems to be regaining its crucial support level of $0.25, which it lost during the recent price decline. According to expert technical analysis, HBAR is reclaiming this key level. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the asset successfully reclaims the $0.25 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 50% to reach $0.38 in the coming days.

However, up to 77% have been traced, giving some hopes of recovery. Nearly two weeks after the Bybit hack, the lost funds have gone through multiple transactions. The exchange’s CEO Ben Zhou noted that 3% have been intercepted and frozen. Another 20% of the funds have gone dark, while 77% are still traceable. 3.4.25 Executive Summary on Hacked Funds: Total hacked funds of USD 1.4bn around 500k ETH, 77% are still traceable, 20% has gone dark, 3% have been frozen.

This and… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) March 4, 2025 The hack also served as a stress test for crypto partnerships, as 11 counterparties participated in freezing the funds. Zhou noted that most of the ETH had been laundered through THORChain , though this was also the reason for being able to track down the coins. ETH was swapped into BTC, which can also be mixed but is also easily traceable. Currently, most of the funds are automatically split into new BTC wallets, each holding 1.71 coins as a balance. The exchange is a long way from intercepting each wallet, especially if the funds are laundered through risky external markets. Non-KYC exchanges pose a risk Most of the dark funds were sent to the eXch, a non-KYC market operator. The exchange was among the first to receive inflows from the hacker’s wallets. More than 10 days ago, Bybit contracted the market operator but did not receive a response. Some of the dark funds were later discovered by bounty hunters, with Mantle at the top for assistants and bounty hunters . The protocol intercepted over $41M in funds previously considered lost. Additional funds may be tracked down, contingent on OKX cooperating with the history of its Web3 wallet team. Hacker managed to swap out of all ETH holdings In just 10 days, the Bybit hacker managed to swap all of the available ETH, for an estimated 499,395 tokens. The main tool for immediate, though traceable swaps, was THORChain. The #Bybit hacker has laundered all the stolen 499,395 $ETH ($1.04B currently), mainly through #THORChain . https://t.co/VSpKk7KSNp pic.twitter.com/HL4gb9f4e8 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 4, 2025 Bybit’s team is also reaching out to THORChain for any chance of tracking funds. For now, the BTC wallets where most of the funds are parked remain free and uncensored, except for being flagged. THORChain can technically track and filter malicious addresses that interact with its nodes. However, it is up to the nodes to achieve consensus on which addresses to blacklist. Currently, THORChain has received a list of addresses to be denied swaps, but not all nodes can be made to support the list. THORChain itself has no links to the hack; it was simply used as the most accessible tool for immediate swaps. The project advises all US-based node operators to track down addresses from an FBI list. For the Bybit hack, the arrangement of tracking the Lazarus addresses remains uncertain. THORChain carried an estimated 70% of the swaps after the Bybit hack. The peak day of swaps was February 24, when THORChain had the highest transaction count since 2023. Elliptic joins the Bybit investigation with real-time monitoring The biggest challenge after a large-scale hack is to warn all counterparties of the event, and start intercepting transactions from flagged wallets. Elliptic has already introduced automated tracking, which intercepted $150,000 of the Bybit funds when they were sent to an exchange. Elliptic has its own blacklist of addresses, tied to the current Bybit hack and previous Lazarus group exploits. The recent exploit brought out a new level of cooperation for crypto entities. Previously, exchanges only acted in a limited fashion to intercept funds. The largest hack, however, caused all protocols to track down the funds where possible. Additionally, despite facing the biggest hack, Bybit never stopped withdrawals and managed to rebuild its liquidity within days. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

For instance, while Solana reached an all-time high in January 2025, Ethereum’s last peak was in 2021. This stark contrast between the competitors has crypto investors wondering: Can Solana price reach $500 before Ethereum hits $5,000? In this article, we explore whether this could happen in the near term. Solana price today trades at $134 after an 18% drop in 24 hours. At the same time, Ethereum price had declined by 12% to trade at $2,075. Why Solana Price Can Hit $500 Before Ethereum Hits $5,000 Top asset managers have given a bullish Solana price forecast for 2025. As Coingape reported, Wall Street giants anticipate that SOL price could reach $520 this year. There are several reasons why Solana can hit this target before Ethereum reaches $5,000. Let’s explore: Solana Network Outpaces Ethereum Solana has often been labeled an “Ethereum killer” due to its fast speeds and low costs. Network activity shows that blockchain users may be abandoning Ethereum for Solana, making it likely for SOL to outperform ETH. Data from TokenTerminal shows that Solana had the highest monthly active addresses of 73.4M. Ethereum pales in comparison with only 7.4M monthly active addresses. Active Addresses DeFiLlama also shows that the 30-day DEX volumes on the Solana blockchain came in at $109 billion, higher than Ethereum’s $88 billion. As the network grows, it supports a bullish Solana price prediction and a potential rally for SOL to $500 before the Ethereum price reaches $5,000. Potential ETF Approval Solana price has several catalysts that could spark gains to $500. The SEC is expected to give its decision about a spot SOL ETF by October. Moreover announcement by Trump to have Solana added to a US crypto strategic reserve has also increased the chances of approval. On Polymarket, there is a 76% chance that a spot SOL ETF will be approved in 2025. If this approval happens, the institutional demand for SOL could lead to the altcoin outperforming Ethereum and possibly reaching $500 in 2025. Moreover, while Ethereum has a spot ETF, the gradual outflows show that institutional interest is weak. Solana ETF SOL/ETH Remains at Range Highs Solana has also been outperforming Ethereum as seen in the SOL/ETH ratio. This ratio has surged to 0.065, and it has also been moving within an ascending parallel channel, indicating that the SOL price has been gradually posting more gains than ETH. SOL/ETH: 1-week Chart If SOL/ETH continues to move within this ascending parallel channel, it will show rising bullish momentum, making it more likely for SOL price to reach $500 before ETH price reaches $5,000. Solana Price Analysis Currently, the technical outlook for Solana price is weak because of the downturn across the broader crypto market. The RSI on the weekly chart is oversold, showing bears have the upper hand. Moreover, SOL had failed to defend support at $154. On the other hand, the flattening ADX shows weakening momentum, which may pave the way for a bullish reversal. However, strong buying pressure is needed to push SOL past the recent high of $298 to the 227.2% Fibonacci level of $535. SOL/USDT: 1-week Chart Conclusion While a surge in Solana price to $500 may not happen in the near term if the trend across the broader market fails to shift, network activity shows it is more likely for Solana price to reach $500 before ETH reaches $5,000. The approval of a SOL ETF and the rising interest in US altcoins could also support these gains.

While Bitcoin is expected to dominate, many believe that altcoins like XRP, Solana, Ethereum, and Cardano could also be part of the reserve. Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero has shared insights into how the government might manage these assets. Romero’s Predictions on the US Crypto Reserve Romero suggests the Trump administration will not purchase new crypto but instead use only seized assets for the reserve. He predicts Bitcoin will make up around 80% of the holdings due to its dominance and global acceptance. However, XRP and ADA could play a unique role, with Romero stating they might be used for in-kind tax payments or quasi-donations, hinting at potential government collaboration with Ripple and Cardano. Skepticism Over XRP and ADA’s Inclusion According to a CNBC report , despite excitement over Trump’s crypto reserve, some in the community question the inclusion of XRP and ADA. Gemini co-founder Taylor Winklevoss argued that only Bitcoin meets the criteria for a strategic reserve, while economist Peter Schiff also expressed doubts about the selection of altcoins.

He sees Bitcoin as a decentralized, gold-like asset. However, he said that adding other cryptocurrencies is seen as risky and a misuse of taxpayer money. Critics, including tech investor Joe Lonsdale, argue that the government shouldn’t be spending on speculative assets while running a massive deficit. Anthony Pompliano, a strong Trump supporter in the crypto space, criticized the move in his newsletter , arguing that Trump’s decision to include multiple cryptocurrencies in the U.S. reserve was influenced by the wrong people. He believes special interest groups and lobbyists convinced Trump to back riskier tokens under the guise of supporting “American-made” crypto projects, which he sees as a trap that goes against the original pro-Bitcoin agenda. In response, Crypto Czar David Sacks pushed back such claims , saying it’s too early to judge the plan. But others, including Naval Ravikant and Vinny Lingham, voiced strong opposition, saying taxpayers shouldn’t be used as liquidity for these assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Can BTC Hit $150K Despite Market Turmoil? , XRP Proponents Back Trump’s Strategy In contrast, XRP supporters welcome the move.

41146845,https://nulltx.com/?p=146431,1741096300,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Layer 2 Networks See Decline in Total Value Locked Amid Market Correction, but Optimism for Long-Term Growth Remains",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-layer-2-networks-see-decline-in-total-value-locked-amid-market-correction-but-optimism-for-long-term-growth-remains/,"Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks—scalable solutions for the Ethereum blockchain—have recently seen a significant downturn in Total Value Locked (TVL). Data from blockchain analytics platform L2Beat show that the combined TVL across Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks now sits at $34.43 billion. Over the last week, that number is down 10.9%, representing a short-term retracement in the Layer 2 ecosystem that reflects both some broader market trends and competitive dynamics within that system. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync aim to reduce Ethereum’s scalability problems by carrying out transactions off the main chain and maintaining Ethereum’s security. But their recent success and growth seem to have stalled as the total value locked in these platforms dropped in 2023 amid unfavorable market conditions and worries about intense Layer 2 competition. A Breakdown of TVL Declines in the Leading Layer 2 Networks When we examine the leading five Layer 2 systems as ranked by total value locked (TVL), we see a clear downward trend: all five of them are now holding far less in terms of TVL than they were just a few months prior. – Arbitrum One: With a TVL of $13.12 billion, Arbitrum has experienced a decline of 9.52%. Even so, it holds on to a commanding lead in TVL not just in the Layer 2 space, but across all of Ethereum, by virtue of an ecosystem that is not just deep but also very active. Base, the Layer 2 network created by Coinbase, currently exists with a total value locked that amounts to $11.9 billion, which looks to be dropping by the percentage of 10.1. Growing very quickly and very recently, Base has reached this number and is now starting to consolidate. While it would prefer to do so in an upward fashion, there are clearly downward pressures on the price. Clearly, that isn’t good for developers or for hoping to keep a rapid growth narrative going. – Optimism (OP Mainnet): With $4.63 billion in TVL, Optimism saw a sharper decline of 13.2%. As one of the most recognized Ethereum Layer 2 platforms, Optimism is still pressing ahead with its expansion plans. But like its Layer 2 rivals, and many projects in the crypto space, it’s not immune to market ups and downs. And what goes down in a bearish crypto market often has to do with how well a project is managing competition. – zkSync Era: zkSync Era, a Layer 2 solution based on zk-Rollups, has a TVL of $844.93 million, reflecting a 10.5% drop. Despite being one of the leading zk-Rollup platforms, zkSync faces challenges as the ecosystem continues to grow and scale, particularly as users assess its performance relative to other Layer 2 solutions. – Starknet: Starknet, which aims at scalability using zk-Rollups, has a total value locked (TVL) of $596.28 million, down 12.5%. Though it is still a hopeful fix for the Ethereum ecosystem, its performance lately shows how fierce the battle is among the competitors making Layer 2-Layer 1 tech better and cheaper. The decrease in total value locked across these Layer 2 networks can mostly be traced to the market-wide downturn. The last several weeks have seen the cryptocurrency market correct and head downward, and a falling tide tends to take all crypto boats with it. As the value of crypto assets decreases, so does the liquidity across blockchain networks, because who in their right mind is investing in or using blockchain technology right now? And with Layer 2 platforms, we have the added issue of their users being high-risk, high-reward platform hoppers, switching in and out between the various Layer 2 platforms to find the best deal and the lowest fees. It’s almost as if TVL is a want ad for plummeting platforms. Industry Update According to data from @l2beat , the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum Layer 2 networks currently stands at $34.43 billion, reflecting a 7-day decline of 10.9% TVL changes in the top 5 L2 networks: Arbitrum One: $13.12 billion (-9.52%) Base: $11.9 billion… pic.twitter.com/GHwHHaHeWO — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) March 2, 2025 What’s Next for Ethereum Layer 2 Networks? In spite of the short-term dip in TVL, there is considerable optimism for the long-term growth of Ethereum Layer 2 networks. A principal development likely to push these platforms forward is the imminent implementation of Blob transactions and EIP-4844—two huge upgrades intended to further route reductions in transaction fees on Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks. Blob transactions are expected to furnish more efficient storage of transaction data, leading to lower costs for users who interact with Layer 2 networks. Similar to this, EIP-4844—in a parallel effort to improve Ethereum’s scalability—promises to reduce gas fees significantly by organizing the storage of more complex datasets. These upgrades together are supposed to solve the Layer 1 Ethereum problem of growing gas fees and appear to be net positives for cost-conscious users of the network. These upgrades, when taken together, should relieve some of the present pressures on Layer 2 networks and allow the ecosystem to keep growing, and hopefully, keep expanding. As transaction costs fall, Layer 2 platforms should be able to attract more decentralized applications (DApps) and actual users that are in search of scalable, secure, and decentralized solutions. Furthermore, the ongoing development of Layer 2 solutions, including those that focus on zk-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups, will keep refining the technology and enhancing the overall user experience. The strides made in interoperability, liquidity management, and developer tools will probably set Layer 2 networks up very well as the backbone of Ethereum’s scalability strategy for the next several years. Conclusion: A Short-Term Setback for Long-Term Gain Although the recent devaluation of Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) may cause some market observers to doubt the short-term prospects of these decentralized network solutions, I am quite bullish on them—more specifically, I am particularly optimistic about the L2 protocols that work directly with the Ethereum mainnet because upcoming changes to Ethereum’s protocol layer itself promise to make the entire network, including these Layer 2 solutions, much more scalable, reliable, and usable. Rivalry within the Layer 2 ecosystem will stay intense, but the ongoing evolution of scalable, cost-effective solutions is bound to produce growth and innovation, providing benefits both to developers and to users. For Ethereum watchers, the current dip in total value locked (TVL) may well turn out to be a temporary slump in what is almost certain to be a protracted upswing for Ethereum Layer 2 networks.

Are AI Projects Like MIND of Pepe Booming in the Dip?,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/core-weave-to-go-public-is-crypto-ai-booming-in-the-dip/,"A sharp downturn has gripped the crypto market, with an almost 10% drop in the overall market cap within the last 24 hours. Leading cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana) have suffered over 10% price losses. Yet amid this volatility, investors and analysts believe the ongoing bull cycle isn’t yet over. AI-powered projects go against the broader market trend, including presale crypto MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . Bull Cycle or Bear Market? Anyone aware of the crypto market and active on social media will have seen the recent panic when prices dropped. Some users were reporting all-time lows on their investments. Despite short-term fluctuations, the broader trend remains bullish. According to Fidelity Investments , we are now 28 months into the bull cycle, which typically last for three years. Evidence that we are in a bull run can be seen in $BTC’s market cap, which is still at a higher point (even in the dip) than two years ago. BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts $BTC could drop to $70K before a potential surge to $250K, as he firmly believes we are in a bull cycle. Notably, this bullish outlook is based on his expectation that Trump’s proposed crypto reserve won’t materialize, though he hopes to be proven wrong. AI Prominence Surges An AI cloud provider, CoreWeave, which changed its business from crypto mining to AI six years ago, has filed to go public with an IPO (Initial Public Offering). Its value is estimated to be above $35B, which is unsurprising considering the increased demand for AI infrastructure in recent years. The benefits of AI are being seen across the world in multiple fields. What was once seen as a narrow niche is now a powerful tool used in daily life. The application of AI to crypto is no different. AI-driven projects like MIND of Pepe are poised for success. By offering unique insights into current trends and presales, MIND of Pepe attracts both seasoned and new investors. Besides, investing in presales is comparatively safe because they remain unaffected by market fluctuations (due to not being listed). Even listed AI tokens such as Story ($IP) have been up over 80% within the last month despite the broader market dip. This clearly demonstrates that AI tokens can defy turbulent market conditions. An Autonomous AI Agent Provides Valuable Market Insights Attracting Investors to the Presale MIND of Pepe makes decisions driven by data and constantly evolves, which means insights become more accurate and valuable over time. A fully autonomous agent, it interacts with X and other platforms to engage, grow, and provide exclusive insights to $MIND presale token holders. $MIND can also launch its own tokens available to its community.

HashKey Global has successfully integrated Ethereum (ETH) on the Base network, with deposit and withdrawal services now officially open. The platform now supports ETH transactions across three networks: ERC-20, Base ( BASE ), and Arbitrum ( ARB ). By integrating ETH support on Base, HashKey Global makes it easier and more cost-effective to move funds in and out of the exchange while interacting with the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. This move is part of the growing adoption of Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions by exchanges with the aim of alleviating the congestion and high fees that are characteristic of Ethereum’s mainnet. Exchanges like Binance, OKX, and KuCoin have been quick to integrate Layer 2 networks for Ethereum transactions. Binance started supporting Arbitrum and Optimism ( OP ) in 2021 to reduce the impact of high gas fees. Since then, the exchange has expanded its support to other Layer 2 solutions. OKX followed suit in 2021 by integrating Arbitrum. KuCoin also added Arbitrum support in 2021 and later extended its offerings to other Layer 2 networks.

February 2025 marked a significant stretch of the Aptos growth story. Here is a look at some of the major recent developments: – Stablecoin integrations: Aptos has seen the addition of three new stablecoins—Aptos USDC, USDP, and AUSD. These stablecoin additions bring major new opportunities for the Aptos ecosystem, from on-and-off-ramp possibilities to being able to interact with the various DeFi protocols being developed on the network. – P2P DeFi: One of the developing stories around Aptos is the major push the network is making into DeFi. Pioneering no-front-running trading protocol @oraimo_labs is building on Aptos, as is Gatchi Finance, which is creating a peer-to-peer money market. – Funding secured: Aptos Labs has continued to attract deep-pocketed investors and strategic partners. The latest funding round brought in $45 million led by venture capital firm Jumana Capital. During the fourth week of February, some major happenings within the Aptos ecosystem are worth pointing to. These events within Aptos demonstrate the increasing demand for scalability, security, and innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain applications. Stablecoin Growth and Ecosystem Expansion Aptos now backs three primary stablecoins—USDT, USDC, and USDe—that are crucial for keeping liquidity flowing and serving a large number of decentralized applications (dApps) and financial services. This stablecoin support across Aptos helps establish the blockchain as a more useful solution for deploying DeFi applications. Partnerships Fueling DeFi and Blockchain Innovation In February, Amnis Finance, a decentralized finance platform, made a partnership with Hyperfluid, a provider of next-gen liquidity solutions, which sent ripples through the crypto community. Users can now stake $APT tokens on Amnis Finance and earn rewards by providing liquidity to a newly created liquidity pair, $APT – $amAPT. This partnership drives even more liquidity into the newly emerging Aptos ecosystem. Furthermore, it allows users to participate in the larger DeFi landscape while maximizing their staking yield. Aptos has also partnered with Noctra AI, a top provider of AI-driven automation and security solutions for decentralized finance. As a Noctra partner, Aptos will have the opportunity to use the very powerful AI technology that Noctra specializes in for its ecosystems. The Noctra tech is all about optimization and intelligent automation, two things you want more of, not fewer, if you’re a blockchain network trying to get your act together in the DeFi world. Advancing DeFi and Blockchain Development with Strategic Investments The Aptos Foundation took a monumental stride toward strengthening the network’s DeFi capabilities with a $200 million commitment aimed at pushing decentralized finance forward. This funding will divert resources from the foundation and fill a gap that was needing to be filled since the Ethereum Foundation has always funded DeFi projects—that is, until now. Aptos started life as a project in the DeFi space, so this is sort of returning to its roots. One of the first big projects to dive into the DeFi space with that foundation funding now available is a company called MoveFlow, and it’s developing an on-chain payments platform. Payments, on-chain or otherwise, is one of the first things you need to get right if you want to build a financial infrastructure. Aptos has a very smart way (using a cryptocurrency called APT) to integrate MoveFlow into its ecosystem, and that will provide a level of service and speed that will blow your mind if you’re used to waiting for payments using Ethereum.

Bitwise Asset Management, a top-10 firm in the $60 billion industry of cryptocurrency investment products, has filed with the SEC to create a trust in Delaware for an ETF focused on the Aptos blockchain. If approved, this ETF would make Bitwise the first firm to offer a dedicated investment vehicle for Aptos and its native asset $APT. This type of fund could provide traditional investors a convenient way to gain exposure to the Aptos blockchain without directly acquiring tokens. At the same time, Kofi Finance has unveiled a remarkable liquid staking solution on Aptos, with the aim of merging optimal miner extractable value (MEV) rewards and flexible liquidity. This venture yokes Kofi Finance’s liquid staking on Aptos with an opportunity for its DeFi users to receive either $kAPT tokens or $stkAPT tokens. Ponder that, DeFi-centric reader. Both tokens are liquid staking derivatives, yet $kAPT provides a spicier, more ferocious DeFi experience than $stkAPT does. If by chance an investment strategy is behind a liquid staking experience on Aptos with $stkAPT instead of $kAPT, well then, Kofi Finance would probably be the investment vehicle to consider. Looking Ahead: The Future of Aptos in 2025 and Beyond February 2025 marks an extraordinary period for Aptos, with the rapidly developing network picking up a great deal of momentum among developers, users, and big institutional players. The growth of the stablecoin, key partnerships in DeFi, and an absolutely rock-solid commitment of investment capital from the Aptos Foundation really set a nice tone for 2025 as a very flourishing year ahead. And when you look at what kind of projects are coming into Aptos and what manner of increasing ecosystem they’re directing, one of the most promising to me is called MoveFlow, which is going to accommodate the With the appearance of new DeFi applications, enterprise solutions, and financial products on the Aptos network, its ecosystem is starting to resemble a full-scale financial services platform. More and more users should find themselves gravitating towards Aptos, with all its community offerings. And developers should also be interested. Thanks to the absence of block space market, and pretty much ideal conditions for them (an easy-to-use programming model, high system performance, and an API service that like very much), Aptos appears to be a suitable base for existing and new blockchain applications.

The whale, who has for months been betting that XRP would take a nosedive, has just poured an enormous $8 million in $USDC margin into the position to avoid liquidation. Yet the position is still showing a loss—one that has now exceeded $4.6 million—as the price of XRP continues to shoot upward. After #Trump 's executive order, a whale is rushing to close his $XRP short position and added 8M $USDC in margin to avoid liquidation. Currently, his 20x leveraged short $XRP position still has a loss of more than $4.6M. https://t.co/W6bdudZonN pic.twitter.com/8Kq5nRm7tS — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 2, 2025 The action comes as the price of XRP unexpectedly surges, boosted by Trump’s executive order and the positive vibe in the cryptocurrency market. The order, dealing with the US crypto scene, seems to have kicked off a rally across many digital assets, including XRP. But as this rally progresses, large XRP holders are divesting themselves of the asset, which is doing nothing to assuage the growing unease of various market players. XRP Whale Moves Amid Market Shifts The whale’s choice to add $8 million in margin to their $XRP short position is meaningful for two reasons: 1. It speaks to the gravity of the situation. 2. It means the whale’s bet was highly sensitive to market movements, amplifying both potential profits and losses. If you’re going to hold 20x leveraged short position on an asset, you’d better have a plan and be prepared to add significant margin when needed. Otherwise, your position risks going very much “underwater” (when an asset price moves in the opposite direction to what you expected and paid for it) and leading to a big liquidation. XRP has surged by over 500% since November 2024, but now its massive rally seems to have triggered a wave of selling from large holders—”whales”—who are cashing out at record levels. What does this mean for the price of XRP, and why are its large holders now liquidating their positions? Some speculate that—as the present price action suggests—XRP may be entering a “local distribution phase,” during which the token’s large holders seek to shed their positions. The Trump Executive Order’s Ripple Effect on XRP Trump’s executive order appears to have given a new boost to the world’s interest in cryptocurrencies. That interest has spilled over into a closer look at the order’s potential effects on XRP price action, and it has started to feel like a net positive for folks who are in XRP’s corner. This surge, however, is leading market participants to reassess their positions. As stated earlier, some large XRP holders have been selling, and the recent run-up in price seems to have intensified this behavior. The unloading of such large amounts of XRP by these so-called whales could be taken to signal that the price has reached a level where these holders are opting to take profits, possibly ahead of a price pullback. XRP in a Local Distribution Phase: What Does It Mean for Investors? The phrase “local distribution phase” in cryptocurrency markets means a time when big investors start to reduce their holdings, often after a big price run-up. We see this distribution very clearly in the price action of Bitcoin over the last couple of months. In these first days of September, for instance, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $25,000 after quite a spacious range of oscillation above the $30,000 mark. Whales taking profits threaten to push XRP down. In XRP’s case, the 500% rally from November 2024 has provided the perfect environment for whales to unload at a substantial profit. In the way that the perfect storm shifts the balance of nature, the executive order and broader market developments have contributed to the surge. $XRP whales are unloading at record levels! Large holders have been aggressively selling since the price rallied over 500% from November. $XRP seems to be in a local distribution phase right now. pic.twitter.com/NgaOoiZkWX — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 3, 2025 Yet, whales selling signal the opposite of what we’re looking for if we want XRP’s price to keep going up. This situation underscores the necessity of caution for investors. When XRP’s large holders are selling, the big hump on the distribution curve shifts to the left. Signaling that the near-term trajectory for this altcoin is uncertain, with indications that it might drop soon, is dangerous for those buying this in the hopes of a price rise. That makes it even more uncertain if Ripple’s recent uptrend (if you can call it that) will continue. The Future Outlook for XRP XRP’s destiny is interwoven with sentiment in the marketplace and the regulatory scene, especially in the United States. Trump’s executive order and the more general appearance of police and order in the regulatory landscape could determine if XRP’s recent uptick is the start of a new trend up or if XRP will get whacked again and head downward with more force. Currently, the market is quite unsettled. Big shareholders keep selling their XRP, and the whale who has been betting against the asset is seeing his losses pile up. For XRP, the next chore is to finish this local distribution phase and set the stage for another run at overcoming the overhead resistance found at the 30-cent level. Until then, the price will probably remain unstable between 24 and 30 cents. XRP holders must remain watchful and take into account the overall market situation and the conduct of big-time investors (often called “whales”) when considering how much and how quickly the price of XRP might change. That is because these big investors can—and do—move the market, for XRP and for other cryptocurrencies. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, this Trump rally was short-lived, and the inclusion of XRP, SOL and ADA in the reserve was met with intense criticism from the cryptocurrency industry. While industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that only Bitcoin should be included, Bitcoin technology firm Jan3 CEO Samson Mow warned Trump about his altcoin choices. Samson Mow warned that the inclusion of random altcoins in the US strategic reserve could lead to chaos in the market and turn the market into a speculative game. Mow noted that Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve plan has the potential to lead to significant change for the industry, but the addition of altcoins like XRP, SOL, ADA, or ETH could turn the reserve plan into a “pure speculation game.” He argued that allowing Trump to freely choose which altcoins to include in the reserve could serve as a giveaway to lobbyists and insiders. The famous CEO finally said that in order to protect the integrity of the reserve, proof-of-work (PoW)-based assets such as Litecoin (LTC) and Monero (XMR) should be prioritized in the reserve, apart from Bitcoin. “There are two possible outcomes regarding the US Strategic Bitcoin/Crypto Reserve: 1-The reserve is BTC and none of the altcoins mentioned will actually make it. 2-We will be rapidly moving towards unprecedented corruption. …… Trump's statement may have been aimed at gifting exit liquidity to Ripple or Cardano lobbyists or donors. At this point, if Trump could somehow add random altcoins to the national reserve, it would be very bad for the US. In addition to Bitcoin, Trump's Strategic Crypto Reserve could potentially include: Litecoin, Monero. And considering Elon's influence in the Trump administration, I'm sure he'll find a way to rationalize Dogecoin's inclusion.” *This is not investment advice.

Arthur Hayes Warns Of Recession Before Surge,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-kiss-of-death-arthur-hayes-recession/,"In his latest blog post, titled “KISS of Death,” former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes outlines a provocative thesis on the trajectory of Bitcoin and broader financial markets under the renewed presidency of Donald Trump. Hayes—who has long held bullish views on crypto—argues that a convergence of fiscal and monetary policies could catapult Bitcoin’s price to as high as $1 million during the Trump 2.0 era, but only after a period of recession-driven turmoil. Breaking Down Bitcoin’s “KISS Of Death” Hayes’s framework revolves around the “KISS” principle—Keep It Simple, Stupid—urging market participants to stay focused on the core driver of asset prices: liquidity. Rather than overreacting to sensational headlines, he contends that one should watch for shifts in the quantity and price of money (i.e., how much credit is created and at what interest rate). “One day, you buy and then quickly sell after digesting the next headline,” Hayes warns. “The market chops you in the process, and your stack quickly diminishes.” He recommends sticking to a simpler outlook: If the U.S. government prints significant amounts of money at lower rates, risk assets like Bitcoin can surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Historic Pattern—Is a Breakout Toward $100K Next? A key premise of Hayes’s analysis is that President Trump, a “real estate showman” by background, will debt finance his “America First” agenda rather than embrace austerity. Hayes contrasts Trump with Andrew Mellon—Treasury Secretary under Herbert Hoover—who once allegedly declared: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system.” Hayes argues that such a stance would be political suicide for a president seeking to be viewed as the 21st-century Franklin D. Roosevelt rather than Hoover. As Hayes puts it, “Trump wants to be considered the greatest President ever” and is therefore inclined to loosen credit conditions rather than tighten them. Hayes highlights Trump’s unconventional maneuver to slash federal spending and potentially trigger a recession, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to respond with rate cuts and fresh liquidity. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by high-profile entrepreneur Elon Musk, is portrayed as an aggressive effort to expose fraud and reduce waste in government programs. Hayes cites DOGE’s claims that Social Security payments may be going out to deceased individuals or unverified identities, supposedly costing hundreds of billions—or even a trillion—dollars a year. “Trump and DOGE are firing hundreds of thousands of government employees,” Hayes notes, referencing media reports citing elevated jobless claims in the Washington, D.C., area. By cutting federal budgets so drastically and so quickly, Trump could—in Hayes’s words—“cause a recession or convince the market that one is right around the corner.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sellers Incur Loss As SOPR Drops To 0.95 – A Sign Of Market Bottom? Once signs of recession appear, Hayes predicts Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will have little choice but to cut rates, end quantitative tightening (QT), and potentially restart quantitative easing (QE) to avert a widespread financial crisis. Powell, whom Hayes dubs a “turncoat traitor” (a reference to the Fed’s past rate cut during Kamala Harris’s campaign), is nonetheless bound by the Fed’s mandate to maintain economic stability. Hayes points to $2.08 trillion in US corporate debt and $10 trillion in US Treasury debt that must roll over in 2025. If the economy slows, rolling that debt over at high interest rates becomes unfeasible. In that scenario, the Fed’s only salvation is fresh money creation and lower rates. Hayes calculates that a full Fed response—encompassing several policy shifts—could result in as much as $2.74 to $3.24 trillion in new liquidity: Dropping the Federal Funds Rate from 4.25% to 0% could be equivalent to roughly $1.7 trillion of money printing, according to Hayes’s estimates. Currently, the Fed conducts $60 billion per month in QT. If QT ends by April 2025, Hayes sees a $540 billion liquidity injection relative to prior expectations. Additional Treasury purchases by the Fed or US commercial banks (the latter aided by a relaxation of the Supplemental Leverage Ratio) might add another $500 billion to $1 trillion in dollar credit. He compares this to the $4 trillion in stimulus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that Bitcoin jumped roughly 24x from its 2020 lows to 2021 highs in response to that liquidity wave, Hayes says even a more conservative 10x multiple could be in play. “For those who ask how we get to $1 million in Bitcoin during the Trump presidency, this is how,” he proclaims, linking massive credit creation with a sharply higher BTC price. Despite his bullish long-term forecast, Hayes believes Bitcoin’s immediate outlook may be rocky. Hayes sees potential for Bitcoin to revisit the $70,000 to $80,000 range in the short-term—levels that are markedly above the prior cycle’s all-time high but still below the current market. “If Bitcoin leads the market on the downside, it will also do so on the upside,” Hayes writes, positing that BTC often bottoms out before traditional equities. He cites the significant run-up to $110,000 around mid-January (Trump’s inauguration timeline) followed by a pullback to $78,000 in late February. “Bitcoin is screaming that a liquidity crisis is nigh, even though the U.S. stock market indices are still near their all-time highs,” he notes. “I firmly believe we are still in a bull cycle, and as such, the bottom at worst will be the previous cycle’s all-time high of $70,000,” Hayes says, underscoring his conviction that any major dips are opportunities to accumulate rather than panic-sell. In Hayes’s view, the “Kiss of Death” is not about Bitcoin’s demise but about the outdated fiat system struggling to contain spiraling debt loads and political brinkmanship. He argues that the short-term chaos in traditional markets—triggered by DOGE-driven spending cuts and a hesitant Fed—will ultimately pave the way for a new round of monetary expansion. The bottom line? Hayes insists that staying focused on liquidity is the best strategy: “Let politicians do politician things, stay in your lane, and buy Bitcoin.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,725.

The move now affects one of the most widely traded stablecoins, $USDT; another stablecoin that is very widely traded, $DAI; and a not insignificant stablecoin, $TUSD. The MiCA Regulation and Its Impact on Binance Users The forthcoming regulation of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) is set to assume a central position in determining the destiny of cryptocurrencies in that part of the world. Under the new rules, stablecoins that don’t measure up to MiCA’s standards will no longer be permitted for trading on Binance’s platform by users in the EEA. In response, the globally leading crypto exchange has announced that it will, well, un-announce that trading pairs with non-compliant stablecoins will be taken off its platform by the end of March 2025. Among the stablecoins affected by this decision are major assets like $USDT (Tether), $DAI (Dai), $TUSD (TrueUSD), $FDUSD (First Digital Dollar), $USDP (Pax Dollar), $AEUR, $UST (TerraUSD), $USTC (Terra Classic USD), and $PAXG (Paxos Gold). Users who hold or trade any of these non-compliant stablecoins are advised to convert them into MiCA-compliant stablecoins like $USDC, $EURI, or the regular euro (EUR) well before the cutoff date to avoid any disruption in trading. The communication also spelled out that users in the EEA can continue to hold, put into circulation, or take out of circulation any stablecoin that doesn’t fall under MiCA after the 31st of March, 2025. These are stablecoins that don’t meet MiCA’s freedom to provide services under the European Securities and Markets Authority’s definition of a financial instrument. However, those using Binance won’t be able to circulate those stablecoins on the platform anymore. A Smooth Transition for Binance Users To minimize any potential issues, Binance is advising users to convert their stablecoins that do not comply with regulations to MiCA-compliant options like USDC. The exchange set a deadline of March 31, 2025, at 23:59 UTC, for all non-compliant stablecoin pairs to be removed from the spot trading market. After that cutoff, users may find themselves in a trading jam if they can’t get access to their funds. Ahead of this switch, Binance is taking further actions to ensure that users with margin accounts come to no harm. It is no longer possible to trade in stablecoins that are not compliant with the AMF. These stablecoins have been identified. Any margin trading that does involve them must stop. This work must be completed by the morning of March 27, 2025. By then, all margin trading involving non-compliant stablecoins must have ceased. Affected accounts: Cross Margin, Isolated Margin, and anyone trying to hook up a non-compliant stablecoin to their margin trading. BINANCE TO DELIST ALL NON-MICA COMPLIANT STABLECOIN TRADING PAIRS IN THE EEA REGION – @Binance , a leading cryptocurrency platform, has announced changes to its stablecoin offerings for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). – The exchange's move comes in response to new… https://t.co/iTzaLwK2pb pic.twitter.com/oToVcZyGMe — BSCN (@BSCNews) March 3, 2025 Impact on Binance Earn, Loans, and Dual Investment Products The modifications that comply with MiCA are also anticipated to have an effect on users of Binance’s Earn, Loans, and Dual Investment services, who are participating in these services. The deadline of March 31, 2025, mandates that these users switch their holdings or collateral to compliant stablecoins, like USDC, to keep using these services. After the deadline, these users are able to sell stablecoins that are not compliant through Binance Convert, and can utilize these non-compliant stablecoins for any purpose that might require greater flexibility. Service in any other Binance product that is not compliant with MiCA will have limited use until compliance is achieved. Why This Change Is Happening Binance’s choice to remove stablecoins that do not comply with MiCA from its trading platform is part of an overall strategy in the EU of creating clear, understandable rules for crypto companies doing business in member states. MiCA—short for the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which is expected to be fully in force by 2025—aims to take a comprehensive swing at regulating not just cryptocurrencies but also crypto-service providers and issuers of so-called “cryptoassets” anywhere in the EU. In advance of the new regulations, Binance is making certain to align with them so as to avoid any issues in continuing to serve its users in the EEA. Its approach to these regulatory changes is entirely user-friendly and already showcases a commitment to ensuring it can serve its users in the EEA while continuing to abide by local laws. Stablecoins compliant with MiCA, like USDC and EURI, will still be able to be traded on Binance while the transition takes place. This ensures that users aren’t disrupted during the process and lets us continue to make compliant tokens necessary for crypto to work in Europe available. We aren’t making any sudden moves that would throw any of our users into an unexpected situation. What Users Need to Do Users in the EEA should take steps to convert any stablecoins that are not compliant with MiCA into options that are compliant, like USDC or EUR, before the March 31, 2025 deadline. To avoid any disruption, they should consider making these conversions as early as possible. There is also the feature on the platform Binance Convert that will allow users to sell leftover holdings in stablecoins that are not compliant with MiCA, providing some additional flexibility. Binance’s warning concerning margin accounts, along with the automatic conversion of assets, serves as a vital reminder for users to manage their positions before the cutoff date. It is also crucial for users of Binance Earn, Loans, or Dual Investment products to switch to MiCA-compliant options as soon as possible, lest any interruptions occur in their participatory rights. To sum up, Binance is now delisting stablecoin trading pairs not in accord with the European MiCA law—but only for EEA users, which is interesting. This seems to be a pretty big hint from the exchange that it is taking steps to comply with European law.

For the first time in what seems like an eternity, Cardano was worth over $1 again, and for a moment there, it almost felt like we were reliving the excitement of pre-2022 when the broader crypto market was full of green. Any increase in price for ADA is music to the ears of its holders, and we are more than happy to witness this long-overdue pump in Cardano’s price after a lethargic first half of 2023. Trump’s Announcement Ignites Cardano’s Price Surge On March 2, Trump unveiled his ambitious “US Crypto Reserve” plan, which has been described as a strategic initiative to position the U.S. as a global leader in the cryptocurrency space. One of the key highlights of this announcement was the inclusion of Cardano ($ADA) in the reserve, a move that immediately caught the attention of investors and market participants. Cardano’s price responded with an explosive 60% increase, pushing its value beyond the $1 mark for the first time in more than a month. This surge means a lot to the crypto community and for good reasons. Many in the community see it representing a strong vote of confidence in Cardano’s long-term prospects. Not only does this signal a growing institutional interest in the blockchain itself, but it also seems to reflect a potential pivot in how cryptocurrencies are seen by government entities. #SmartSignal $ADA @Cardano surges 60% after Trump’s ""US Crypto Reserve"" announcement, surpassing the $1 mark for the first time in over a month. Check it out on #BitgetSpot : https://t.co/8E6EsIyaXX pic.twitter.com/FOjgBabPfh — Bitget (@bitgetglobal) March 3, 2025 Including Cardano in the U.S. strategic reserve places it in a prominent position as a cryptocurrency with “store of value” potential—something many are taking as a positive sign of institutional acceptance. The statement has shed new light on the emerging story of the U.S. government adopting digital assets, illuminated by the recent establishment of the US Crypto Reserve. When you place certain digital currencies into this reserve, it begins to look as if you’re positioning them as federally recognized assets—especially when you consider that the reserve now includes cryptocurrencies like Cardano, which is seen as a potential rival to Ethereum. Cardano ETF Approval in 2025: The Odds Are in Favor A further development arising from Trump’s announcement is that Cardano moving toward an exchange-traded fund (ETF) becoming a reality seems more likely now than it did a day or so before Trump made his announcement. Bringing Cardano into the U.S. strategic reserve is part of a plan that Trump and his administration have. This apparently consists of taking a serious look at the potential digital assets have for being adopted by institutional players. So, naturally, there’s some speculative talk about how close we are now to a Cardano ETF. And in the crypto world, anything ETFs seem to get talkers going. UPDATE: Odds for Cardano $ADA ETF receiving SEC approval in 2025 rose to an all-time high of 70% on Polymarket At the beginning of the year, the odds were just 10%. pic.twitter.com/eaPDbmPW8X — Cardanians (CRDN) (@Cardanians_io) March 3, 2025 Polymarket’s recent data indicate that the probabilities have increased dramatically for Cardano’s ETF approval from the SEC in 2025, now sitting at an all-time high of 70%. This is quite the departure from sentiments held earlier this year when the odds of approval were languishing in the low 10% range. Cardano’s inclusion in the U.S. crypto reserve has certainly improved investors’ forecasts. And for many, there is now a palpable sense that the SEC, which has up until now played the role of crypto ETF gatekeeper, is about to hand Cardano’s ETF an approving thumbs-up. Should Cardano be granted an ETF green light, it would almost certainly rewrite the playbook for the cryptocurrency, giving institutional investors a quasi-Greek-lit pathway to ADA exposure that is both touchable and, in their world, relatable. The ETF route is indeed a roadway. And it is a way that a lot of people in the crypto space think should lead right into the lap of not very many. The increase in Cardano’s price, along with the increasing faith in the asset’s long-term viability, has made the cryptocurrency a prime contender for ETF approval. Investors and analysts are now looking forward to the April 10th deadline of the Cardano ETF application, which could be a make-or-break moment for the asset in terms of the path it takes in the future. Yesterdays announcement including ADA in the US strategic reserve makes the Apr 10th initial deadline for the Cardano ETF very interesting now.. I had been thinking it would be dragged out but could we see it approved without delay / extension..? pic.twitter.com/gdiALD4yyC — P₳ul (@cwpaulm) March 3, 2025 Why Cardano’s Growth is Significant The sharp increase in price and the swelling institutional interest of Cardano can only partially be explained by the enthusiasm of the broader crypto market. What is becoming increasingly clear to investors is that the blockchain on which Cardano runs has some singular features and capabilities that set it apart. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano functions on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism—an energy-efficient alternative to proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. And the Cardano network seems to be making strides not just in the energy department but also in the blockchain’s scalability, security, and the ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) that developers are building on top of it. More and more often of late, the price of ADA has been surging. This can only mean one thing: ever more people are recognizing Cardano’s technological advancements. And with good reason! The Cardano blockchain is not a static structure. It is an evolving organism. Right now, it is moving toward a future with more and more features—like smart contracts—built right into it. Ever since the price of ADA has been on the up-and-up, more and more development teams, projects, and investors seem to be migrating to Cardano. In addition, Cardano actively seeks worldwide acceptance by forming partnerships and collaborations in many areas, such as education, healthcare, and agriculture. Its diverse array of use cases instills greater confidence in the long-term sustainability of the network, which in turn makes Cardano an appealing investment asset for both retail and institutional investors. What’s Next for Cardano and Its Investors? Cardano’s price keeps moving up in the aftermath of Trump’s announcement, and now all eyes are on April 10th, 2023, the deadline for the Cardano ETF application. The SEC’s approval odds have never been higher—71% as of most recent estimates. Should the Cardano ETF get the green light, we might see the price surging to new all-time highs. How might we interpret these seemingly bullish signals? If anything, they indicate that Cardano is on a clear path toward greater institutional adoption. Should the ETF not get approved, then honestly, it might not matter, because Cardano being with or without an ETF is already an institutional adoption play. At the moment, Cardano’s investors are soaring on a 60% price increase. But as we look to the next several months, the true test for the asset will come with the SEC’s decision on the ETF. If Cardano’s ETF is approved, it likely will be a watershed moment for the asset. And if it really goes in the direction of that approval? Well, we might be talking about Cardano as an apparent leader in the crypto market. To conclude, Cardano has surged past the $1 mark and the odds of its ETF approval seem to be increasing. These are good signs, in my book, of the growing institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency space. With the U.S. government backing not going anywhere, and ETF approval looking more likely than ever, Cardano seems like a bet that is more safe than risky. The SEC is set to make a decision anytime now that could very well determine the next chapter in Cardano’s journey. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Merten questioned the inclusion of these altcoins, arguing that they don’t yet have enough real-world adoption or use cases to be considered vital for national security. Merten pointed out suspicious trading activity on exchanges, where large leveraged positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum were taken just before the announcement of the reserve. He raised concerns that this could suggest insider trading, where people with early knowledge of the announcement used that information to make a profit. While some people may view the crypto reserve as a good move for the industry, Merten believes it may actually be a way for insiders with investments in these cryptocurrencies to enrich themselves. He criticized the decision to include altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Cardano, suggesting that these coins do not hold the strategic importance that the government claims. “I don’t think we need to have an entire basket of random altcoins. This is not of strategic importance to the United States by any stretch of the imagination. We need to step back and really realize that while we may love crypto, this is just purely insider activity to drum up the assets that are held by the people who are in this administration,” he said. Merten also argued that instead of focusing on crypto, the government should be investing in companies with tangible value and impact, like Apple and Nvidia, which have a significant role in global markets. He expressed concern that this reserve could lead to taxpayers funding risky investments that mostly benefit the people with insider knowledge, describing it as “corruption in disguise.”",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|ALTCOIN|ADA|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 14:05:02

Sunday’s rally began fading on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins sliding back to pre-weekend levels. BTC slipped below $90,000, down almost 10% and trading at $83,700. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has declined nearly 15%, struggling to stay above $2,000. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 18% after surging on Sunday following Trump’s announcement, while Solana (SOL) is down nearly 20%. Cardano (ADA) , which had surged past $1 after its inclusion in the crypto reserve, is down almost 24% and trading at $0.811. Dogecoin (DOGE), Hedera (HBAR), Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines as bearish sentiment returned to the market after President Trump reaffirmed plans to impose tariffs against Canada and Mexico. Bitcoin (BTC) Dips 10% As Crypot Reserve Euphoria Fades Bitcoin (BTC) has been down nearly 10% over the past 24 hours as growing trade tensions and tariffs against Canada and Mexico have weighed on investor sentiment. BTV and other digital assets had surged after President Trump’s remarks about a national cryptocurrency reserve. However, feasibility concerns about the plan triggered a sharp decline. BTC kept declining until it slipped below $90,000, slipping to its current level of $84,190. ETH, ADA, SOL, and XRP also registered substantial declines. Forexlive manager Adam Button stated, “Everything is getting sold. There's a de-risking that's unfolding among crypto investors.” The downturn began after Trump reaffirmed tariffs against Canada and Mexico, both of which have vowed to retaliate. Button believes fears surrounding an impending trade war were intensified by concerns over US economic growth, expected to slow during the first quarter. Industry Leaders Not Happy With Inclusion Of ADA and XRP In Reserve Crypto industry leaders were not pleased with including XRP, ADA, and even SOL in the crypto strategic reserve. Industry experts questioned their inclusion, arguing that they lack developer activity and decentralization, as seen in BTC and ETH. Trump signed an executive order in January to explore a strategic digital asset reserve, with the language revolving around the potential creation of a digital asset stockpile. Trump is also set to host the inaugural White House Crypto Summit and is scheduled to deliver remarks to crypto founders, CEOs, and investors. Crypto Czar David Sacks will chair the summit. While the news set the value of the assets in question skyrocketing, it was also met with heavy criticism, with Castle Island Ventures General Partner Nic Carter, stating, “It's not the job of the government to run an ersatz crypto hedge fund. It's not their job to pick winners and losers.” According to Harrison Seletsky, director of business development at digital identity platform SPACE ID, the inclusion of SOL and ETH makes sense because of their robust and growing developer activity. However, he added that ADA and XRP are virtually ghost chains compared to ETH and SOL, with the total value locked and stablecoin capabilities on XRPL and Cardano being negligible compared to other ecosystem players. “In my eyes, it somewhat delegitimizes the whole idea of crypto reserve assets like industry mainstays bitcoin, ether, and Solana.” Two Prime Digital Assets CEO Alexander Blume called XRP, ADA, and SOL tech companies that happen to have a cryptocurrency. “They are very centrally controlled, and ownership is also highly concentrated. These products are constantly changing and adapting to the market whereas BTC is a decentralized product with no single group of owners or controllers and is more akin to gold.” White House AI And Crypto Czar Confirms Crypto Exit White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks has confirmed he sold all his cryptocurrency holdings before joining the Trump administration. Sacks is a well-known investor and entrepreneur who has played a significant role in the tech and finance sectors. He co-founded Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm that has invested in several technology startups and financial firms, including Bitwise Asset Management, which focuses on crypto investments. The confirmation came amid growing speculation about his crypto holdings and potential conflict of interest following his appointment. The decision to liquidate his crypto holdings was part of his efforts to comply with ethics regulations and avoid a conflict of interest. Sacks also addressed criticism from a Community Note on X, claiming he had indirect investments in crypto through Bitwise Asset Management. The Community Note stated, “David sold his direct holdings, but he still has large indirect holdings because he is an investor in Bitwise Asset Management.” However, Sacks responded to the note, stating, “This community note is a lie. I had a $74K position in the Bitwise ETF, which I sold on January 22. I do not have ‘large indirect holdings. I’ll provide an update at the end of the ethics process.” SEC To Hold First Crypto Task Force Meeting The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will hold the first meeting of its newly formed Crypto Task Force later this month. The roundtable, titled “How We Got Here and How We Get Out—Defining Security Status,” will take place on March 21 at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. It is part of a broader initiative called “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity.” “JUST IN: SEC Crypto Task Force to ""host a series of roundtables to discuss key areas of interest in the regulation of crypto assets.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) was back in the red on Monday as it gave up all of Sunday’s gains. BTC had surged on Sunday after President Donald Trump announced a proposal for a national strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies. As a result of the announcement, BTC surged over 9% on Sunday. Trump had said his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and ADA, with all the tokens rallying. However, the rally was short-lived as BTC and the other assets were back in the red on Monday. BTC is down over 9%, while ETH is down over 12%. XRP has also seen red with the price down nearly 13%, while SOL has declined almost 16%. ADA has seen the biggest decline, down 25%. The decision also attracted significant criticism, with Anthony Pompliano, founder and chief executive at Professional Capital Management, saying he did not favor a strategic crypto reserve in a letter to clients. Pompliano stated, “Even though Solana is our second largest crypto position, and various public equities I hold are heavily correlated to altcoins, I still think this decision on a wide-ranging crypto strategic reserve is an unforced error that will be regretted in the future.” He also warned the emerging policy appeared to be a random smattering of speculative tools that would enrich insiders and creators of these tokens at the expense of the US taxpayer. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss also expressed their reservations about the reserve, noting that only BTC met the bar as a store of value and reserve asset. Bitcoin (BTC) has faced significant selling pressure, barring Sunday’s rally. The flagship cryptocurrency started the previous week in the red, dropping nearly 5% to $91,622. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC plunged below $90,000 on its way to an intraday low of $85,984. The price recovered from this level but could not reclaim $90,000, ultimately settling at $88,654 after a decline of $88,654. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC dropped over 5% to $84,129. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, BTC recovered on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $87,045. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $84,657, registering a marginal increase. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA and $80,000 to a low of $78,173. Buyers finally stepped in at this level, and BTC recovered to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $84,362. Sentiment changed over the weekend as BTC rose just over 2% on Saturday and settled at $86,182. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday after Donald Trump’s announcement. As a result, BTC surged over 9% to reclaim $90,000 and move past the 20-day SMA to settle at $94,322. However, the euphoria faded on Monday, and BTC crashed nearly 9% to slip back below $90,000 and the 20-day SMA to $86,201. The current session sees sellers retain control, with the price down over 3% at $83,258. The RSI was rejected at the neutral level, indicating sellers still hold the upper hand. The MACD is also bearish, indicating BTC could see a further decline. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has dropped nearly 18% as Sunday’s rally lost momentum after President Donald Trump reaffirmed tariffs against Canada and Mexico would kick in on March 4. The announcement sent markets tanking, with the crypto market cap declining over 10%. ETH had reached an intraday high of $2,550 on Sunday but lost all the gains it made on Monday after markets turned bearish. ETH has been trading downwards since December 2024, when it briefly crossed $4,000. ETH started the previous week in the red, dropping nearly 11% to go below the 20-day SMA and settle at $2,517. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell below $2,500 on its way to an intraday low of $2,332.

Source: TradingView ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday, dropping just under 1% to $2,218. The price rallied on Sunday, rising nearly 14% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,520. However, the rally was short-lived as ETH plunged almost 15% on Monday after Trump reaffirmed tariffs on Canada and Mexico and settled at $2,149. The current session sees ETH down nearly 3% as sellers look to drive the price below $,2,000. The RIS is below the neutral zone, while the MACD indicated significant bearish pressure, suggesting the price could decline in the near term. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is also one of the assets named in the strategic reserve, sending its value soaring on Sunday. However, SOL gave up these gains almost immediately, dropping nearly 21% on Sunday as broader market sentiments and economic concerns hit investor confidence. SOL was bearish at the beginning of the previous week, dropping over 15% to slip below $150 and settle at $142. Despite the selling pressure, SOL registered an increase of 1.60%on Tuesday and moved to $144. Sellers returned to the market on Wednesday as SOL fell over 6%, going below $140 and settling at $135. The price recovered on Thursday, rising nearly 2% and settling at $137. Buyers retained control on Friday as SOL rose almost 8% to reclaim $140 and settle at $148. Source: TradingView Despite the positive sentiment, SOL was back in the red on Saturday, dropping just over 3% to $143. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday after President Trump’s announcement.

The current session sees DOGE down 3.52% and trading at $0.192 as sellers look to drive the price toward $0.80. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) was also named as one of the assets to be included in the crypto reserve, sending its price surging on Sunday. However, its rally fizzled out on Monday as it fell below key levels and moving averages. XRP fell below the 20-day SMA last Monday, dropping 11.51% to $2.28. The price fell to an intraday low of $2.06 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of nearly 2% and settle at $2.32.

With an increasing number of funds being blocked by exchanges due to AML checks, any cold wallet receiving USDT could face risks; verifying asset cleanliness is crucial. Table of Contents USDT blockchain precedents: lessons not to ignore Verifying the purity of cryptocurrency is a necessity The solution Recently, cases of funds being blocked by exchanges under the pretext of AML checks have become more frequent. Any cold wallet receiving USDT could be at risk. Users might deposit USDT from their wallet to an exchange, and suddenly, their funds get blocked due to an AML check. This leads to a long dispute with support, where the user has to prove that they are not involved in any illegal activities. Such disputes with customer support can last up to 6 months. Why deal with such problems? Users can check their USDT in advance for sanctions and risks using any service from this list . Traders will receive a detailed report on the contamination level of their assets, as well as recommendations on which exchanges might pose a risk for their funds. Additionally, they can subscribe to platform’s private channel , where they share strategies to multiply capital without risk. USDT blockchain precedents: lessons not to ignore Bitfinex exchange asset freeze in 2018 Bitfinex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, came under investigation in 2018. The US froze the exchange’s funds, including large amounts of USDT, due to suspected financial regulatory violations. This caused panic in the market and led to losses among users whose funds were linked to suspicious transactions. Confiscation of funds worth $30 million in 2021 In 2021, Tether Limited, the issuer of USDT, froze $30 million in funds related to suspicious transactions at the request of law enforcement agencies. In this case, even users who may not have been involved in illegal activity but were involved in the transaction chain were affected. These cases emphasize the importance of dealing with “clean” cryptocurrencies whose origin is not linked to illegal activity. Verifying the purity of cryptocurrency is a necessity The cryptocurrency market is increasingly facing regulation and scrutiny from regulators. Verifying the purity of USDT and other crypto assets is becoming a key step to ensure security and regulatory compliance. Ensuring security Verifying the purity of USDT helps to identify links to illegal activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing. Having a “tainted” cryptocurrency in a wallet can lead to the freezing or confiscation of funds. It is a way for companies and private investors to protect their assets and minimize risk. Regulatory compliance Many countries are tightening cryptocurrency regulations with strict anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Utilizing cryptocurrency verification services can help users comply with regulations and avoid fines, penalties, and blocked funds. This is especially important for companies operating in international jurisdictions. The solution In the context of growing risks and increased regulation, checking crypto-assets for AML compliance is a necessary step. The free AML Sreening Center service brings together the best-proven tools for transaction and wallet verification.

Together with the stock market , Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies crashed once again, with BTC trading below $85,000 on Wednesday. In particular, Jelle shared a Bitcoin chart pattern from 2020, which is similar to BTC’s price action since February 2025. Another memecoin analyst also shared a similar insight, saying people “are not prepared.” Notably, both charts show Bitcoin first reaching a market top and a consolidation phase until it breaks out. The breakout, then, leads to another top and smaller consolidation, crashing aggressively toward the previous resistance , now turning into support . This crash and resistance/support (R/S) level retest came, in 2020, in anticipation of a massive bounce upwards. Previously, it led Bitcoin from $10,000 up to $13,300.

If history repeats, buying Bitcoin now could end up being a profitable decision, eyeing the upward potential highlighted by the analysts. However, there are no guarantees that the 2025 chart will replicate the 2020 fractals. Actually, in 2020, the bounce resulted in a 33% surge, not the 100% surge suggested by simply mirroring the candlesticks. The memecoin analyst received harsh criticism in the comment section of his post, with one user asking if “Do [people] just search for random meaningless fractals in time that [sort of] match up and then post them?” Interestingly, Jelle responded to his own followers saying he has “no clue” and is “just observing,” when asked about what would be Bitcoin’s next movement. In other posts, the trading expert said he continues to exit his BTC position, gradually selling at each opportunity. Moreover, he explained that the current market outlook is within “insane volatility” and “not a market you want to trade.” https://twitter.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1896803823370588221 Buying or not this current crash is an individual decision that should be made responsibly.

Schiff didn’t mince words, labeling it the “biggest crypto rug pull of all time.” This explosive accusation has sent ripples through the digital asset community, sparking debates about transparency, insider trading, and the very nature of crypto strategic reserve initiatives. Why is Peter Schiff Calling Trump’s Crypto Reserve a ‘Rug Pull’? For those unfamiliar, a ‘rug pull’ in the crypto world is a devastating scam where developers abandon a project, often after pumping up its value, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Schiff’s dramatic accusation implies that Trump’s crypto strategic reserve announcement isn’t a genuine move towards digital asset adoption but rather a deceptive scheme designed to benefit insiders at the expense of ordinary investors. He took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his concerns, questioning the timing and motivations behind the announcement. Schiff’s main points of contention can be summarized as follows: Questioning Authorship and Foreknowledge: Schiff wants to know who exactly penned the two Truth Social posts from Trump regarding the crypto reserve. He also wonders who had advance notice of these posts before they went live. Insider Trading Allegations: This is the crux of Schiff’s ‘rug pull’ accusation. He suspects that individuals with prior knowledge of the announcement might have engaged in insider trading , profiting from trades in cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, SOL, BTC, and ETH before the public got wind of it. Demanding Investigation and Transparency: Schiff isn’t just throwing accusations; he’s demanding action. He’s urging Congress to launch a full-blown investigation. He wants a thorough review of communications – emails and messages – involving Trump’s staff, family, donors, and even Truth Social employees, all related to these crypto posts. In essence, Schiff is painting a picture of a potentially orchestrated event, where privileged information about a market-moving announcement was leaked, allowing some to capitalize before the average investor could react. This raises serious questions about market manipulation and fairness in the crypto space. Trump’s Crypto Reserve: A Bold Move or a Recipe for Disaster? On March 3rd, Trump’s Truth Social account became the epicenter of crypto speculation when two posts about a crypto reserve surfaced. While details were scant, the very mention of a “crypto strategic reserve” from a figure of Trump’s stature was enough to send ripples through the market. The posts, though brief, hinted at a significant development, immediately capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and critics alike. Here’s what we know based on the limited information available: Vague Announcement: The Truth Social posts lacked concrete details about the nature, size, or purpose of this “crypto strategic reserve.” This ambiguity itself fueled speculation and, according to critics like Schiff, created an environment ripe for potential manipulation. Market Reaction: As Schiff pointed out, the announcement coincided with movements in the prices of several cryptocurrencies. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the timing certainly raises eyebrows, especially in light of Schiff’s insider trading concerns. Community Concerns: The crypto community, while often welcoming of positive news, also reacted with a degree of caution and skepticism. Terms like “front-running” and “insider trading” quickly began trending in online crypto forums and social media discussions, mirroring Schiff’s anxieties. The lack of clarity surrounding Trump’s crypto reserve is a major point of contention. Is it a genuine attempt to strategically position the U.S. in the burgeoning digital economy? Or, as Schiff suggests, is it something far more nefarious? Is Insider Trading a Real Threat in Crypto Reserves? Peter Schiff’s accusations bring the specter of insider trading into sharp focus within the context of crypto reserves. But is this a legitimate concern? Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding yes. The relatively unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market, combined with the potential for significant price swings based on news and announcements, makes it particularly vulnerable to such practices. Consider these points regarding insider trading risks in crypto: Risk Factor Explanation Regulatory Gaps Compared to traditional financial markets, crypto regulation is still evolving. This creates loopholes and ambiguities that can be exploited for illicit activities like insider trading. Information Asymmetry In many crypto projects and announcements, information isn’t always disseminated equally. Insiders – those with early access to sensitive information – can gain an unfair advantage. Market Volatility The inherent volatility of crypto markets amplifies the potential profits from insider trading. Even a small piece of privileged information can lead to substantial gains (or losses avoided). Anonymity Concerns While blockchains offer a degree of transparency, tracing insider trading activities can be challenging due to the pseudonymous nature of many crypto transactions and the use of decentralized exchanges. Schiff’s call for a Congressional investigation is rooted in these very risks. He believes that a thorough probe is necessary to determine if insider trading or any other form of market manipulation occurred in connection with Trump’s crypto strategic reserve announcement. The outcome of such an investigation could have significant implications for the future regulation and perception of the crypto market. What are the Potential Implications of Schiff’s ‘Rug Pull’ Claims? The fallout from Peter Schiff’s explosive allegations could be far-reaching, regardless of whether an official investigation confirms his suspicions. Here are some potential implications: Increased Scrutiny on Crypto Initiatives: Schiff’s accusations, coming from a prominent financial figure, will likely intensify scrutiny on all crypto-related initiatives, especially those involving political figures or governments. This could lead to calls for greater transparency and regulatory oversight. Damage to Crypto’s Reputation: Even if unproven, the ‘rug pull’ label, particularly when associated with a high-profile name like Trump, can further fuel negative perceptions of the crypto market. It reinforces the narrative of crypto being a Wild West where scams and manipulation are rampant. Potential Regulatory Push: If investigations do uncover evidence of insider trading or market manipulation, it could serve as a catalyst for stricter crypto regulations. Lawmakers might feel compelled to act to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Impact on Trump’s Image (and Crypto Stance): The scandal could negatively impact Trump’s image, especially if an investigation finds wrongdoing. It could also influence his future stance on cryptocurrencies, potentially making him more cautious or even critical of the industry. Ultimately, the Peter Schiff-Donald Trump crypto reserve saga is a stark reminder of the ongoing tensions and debates surrounding digital assets. It highlights the urgent need for clarity, transparency, and robust regulatory frameworks to foster trust and prevent potential abuses in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion: A Waiting Game for Answers? Peter Schiff’s bold accusations have thrown a Molotov cocktail into the already volatile world of cryptocurrency. Whether his ‘rug pull’ claims against Trump’s crypto strategic reserve hold water remains to be seen. A Congressional investigation, as Schiff demands, could shed light on the truth. For now, the crypto community and the wider financial world are left to ponder the implications of these serious allegations and await further developments in what could become a landmark case for crypto regulation and accountability.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) turned normal portfolios into fortunes overnight in 2021. Now, analysts believe that another altcoin; Remittix (RTX) , can do that breathtaking rally all over again, fueled by changing regulatory landscapes and bullish market conditions. Could We See Another Rally Like Shiba Inu In 2021? As per Coinmarketcap , Shiba Inu is exchanging hands at $0.00001408, 1.31% up in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $8.27 billion and trading volume rising 201.93% to $459.28 million. uKastlFatu revealed Ethereum's April update would be another SHIB driver. If that materializes, some are of the opinion that we might witness a recurrence of Shiba Inu in 2021—a trend that triggered mainstream interest in meme coins. Source: Coinmarketcap Meme-based tokens are highly reliant on social media buzz and community. Shiba Inu capitalized on these elements by climbing the ranks, with many comparing it to Dogecoin in going viral. Yet, such projects can falter if utility is not apparent, so it remains to be seen if lightning strikes twice in the same place. XRP in the US Crypto Reserve: A Shiba Inu Like Rally Incoming? The newest update at Mitrade is that XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) are included by former President Trump's digital asset executive order as possible additions to a proposed US Crypto Reserve. While the reserve is not formal, the fact that XRP was mentioned has already sparked talk of regulation and adoption. Some lawmakers are in favor of a Bitcoin-only strategy, but Trump's proposal is focused on multiple tokens, which broadens the possibilities for the market. The possible institutional focus on some of the altcoins could drive the narrative of a rally similar to Shiba Inu in 2021, especially if mainstream endorsements are backed by new sources of liquidity. But regulatory certainty is still crucial. Without coherent policies, high-volume inflows may get held back, even for coins being discussed in government circles. Remittix: Positioned for a Rally Like Shiba Inu In 2021? While XRP and Shiba Inu hog the headlines, there's one more token that flies under the radar: Remittix. Priced at $0.0694, this PayFi-focused project has already garnered more than $13.4 million, with more than 513 million tokens sold. Remittix is no meme or speculative coin but is determined to combine blockchain technology with day-to-day financial services, addressing real-life problems in cross-border payments. Think of a freelance graphic designer in Southeast Asia who wants to invoice clients in Europe without paying exorbitant wire fees or waiting for tediously slow transfers. Remittix easily converts crypto-to-fiat, depositing funds directly into a bank account with clear, flat fees. This usability is far from hype-driven tokens. If sufficient individuals and businesses catch on to Remittix, some analysts anticipate that it could spark a rally like Shiba Inu in 2021 but backed by real-world use cases. PayFi unites crypto's speed and low expense with traditional finance's established constructs, promising a frictionless experience. Merchants could take digital assets as payment, settle them automatically into fiat, and avoid the volatility that discourages mainstream usage. From e-commerce platforms to remittance-focused NGOs, Remittix has wide industry appeal. With the worldwide volume of cross-border transactions, a service such as this could easily disrupt traditional banking channels. Traditional remittance channels have plenty of middlemen who insert fees and delays. Remittix's dashboard pledges to eliminate that friction, so it should be attractive to the unbanked, small businesses, and even enterprises. With an exponentially expanding user base, the token may see a run like Shiba Inu had in 2021—but one based on repeat transaction volumes instead of mere social media hype. Beyond the Meme: Real-World Use Fuels the Next Rally Shiba Inu's story in 2021 showed the speed at which a community-driven token might get into the limelight. But the next rally like Shiba Inu in 2021 could be different, with the focus less on memes and more on service tokens. As Trump's US Crypto Reserve discussions continue, and Shiba Inu eyes Ethereum's April upgrade, altcoin enthusiasts have to consider how utility affects long-term viability. Remittix is characterized by solving a real pain point—cross-border payments—providing a sounder foundation than tokens that are purely speculative. At the same time, XRP regulatory news can accomplish the same in setting a new precedent for mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Combined, they suggest that the wider crypto market ever more turns to solutions with tangible utility, yet meme-fuelled hype still has its strength as a potent propellant. Head to the Remittix presale to see if PayFi can be the one to spark the next rally like Shiba Inu in 2021 but on the back of actual utility. With governments pondering official crypto reserves and companies seeking optimized payment flows, Remittix could tap into an enormous market deprived of modernized finance.

With this, the price of XRP triggered a massive upswing and cleared a couple of resistance zones at $2.27 and $2.89. However, the bears seem to have capitulated the zones around $3, which triggered a rejection and the confirmation of tariffs on Canada & Mexico dragged the levels by more than 20%. Currently, the bulls are trying hard to elevate the levels above the previous day’s close, but the bears are offering significant pressure, keeping the price restricted below $2.35. So what’s next? Will the XRP price lose the pivotal support at $2 or reclaim the lost dominance and achieve immediate resistance? The price had broken above the lower highs and lows but after the rejection, the token seemed to have entered within the same pattern. The bears seem to have held a tight grip over the rally, which suggests flashing bearish signals for the crypto. Besides, an entry into the demand zone is expected to attract significant liquidity, which is much required to push the price beyond $2.8. However, the technicals have turned bearish, which suggests the lower targets zone between $2 and $1.96 have been activated. The daily chart of XRP suggests the bulls are defending the local support at $2.272 but in the wider perspective, the bears appear to be preparing for a massive price action. The price has reached the lower bands of the Gaussian channel, which has already turned bearish. A drop below the range may certify the price reaching the bottoms. Meanwhile, the MACD, which is in the negative range, is about to undergo a bearish crossover after witnessing a minor bullish flip. Therefore, the XRP price continues to remain under massive bearish influence and could eventually drop to $2 or levels slightly below the range. On the other hand, a rise above $2.5 may delay the bearish action but a surge above $2.8 could squash the bearish possibility. In recent times, the SEC has dropped investigations and lawsuits on multiple crypto platforms, which has raised speculations of a closure of the lawsuit with the SEC. However, the analysts and XRP proponents believe it may take another couple of months and hence till then, the price is believed to maintain a slow yet steady rally.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 15:32:07

The country’s authorities have previously agreed with the IMF not to accumulate Bitcoins under an Extended Fund Facility (EFF). El Salvador Load Up 19 BTC In New Purchasing Spree President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has confirmed an increase in the country’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, rising by 19 BTC in under a week. The latest purchase came as Bitcoin slipped under $80K at the tail end of February. El Salvador’s decision to buy the dip saw its splurge around $1.5 million for 19 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 6,100. At current prices, El Salvador’s BTC holdings are valued at around the $500 million mark. The country began accumulating BTC back in 2021 after elevating the cryptocurrency as a legal tender amid fierce opposition. The IMF has been El Salvador’s most vocal critique, pointing out potential pitfalls to its economy. With the approval of a Crypto Strategic Reserve by US President Donald Trump, the US could begin its own Bitcoin accumulation spree. Bitcoin’s Purchase Flouts IMF Requirements El Salvador’s Bitcoin purchase defies the IMF’s directive for the country to reduce its BTC exposure. The directive came under an Extended Fund Facility (EEF) arrangement valued at $1.4 billion over 40 months. Under the arrangement, El Salvador is expected to halt its Bitcoin purchases with the IMF stepping up monitoring for compliance. Furthermore, the arrangement will ban the creation of new publicly-owned entities from dabbling in Bitcoin activities. “Over the course of the program, the authorities have committed not to accumulate Bitcoins,” read the IMF report. “And not to issue nor guarantee any type of Bitcoin-indexed or denominated public debt implying a liability for the government.” El Salvador halted BTC purchases following negotiations with the IMF in February but appears to be making a reversal.

The presale of DTX Exchange successfully gathered $15.5 million from beyond 720,000 unique investors. They are also waiting to 2x their investments when the listing price goes to $0.36 from its current price of $0.18. On the other side, the Dogecoin price went down 32% while SHIB experienced a modest 2% increase thus making DTX more attractive to investors. Google Searches for DTX Exchange Spike As It Hits $15.5M in Presale Research trends on Google Search for DTX Exchange indicate that investor attention has shifted dramatically during this recent period. Market data shows that the rising trend represents genuine investor interest which supports statistics from the marketplace. The exchange successfully attracted presale investors who invested $15.5 million so far. Investors can immediately double their initial stake because DTX Exchange tokens are priced at $0.18 but will be listed at $0.36. The bonus period is active right now because of the high number of signups which provides users who enter the ""LIST2X"" code to 2x their initial deposit money. The special discount opportunity allows users to increase their initial capital to 4x its original value. It also maintains market interest by providing users access to high-end institutional trading features and decentralized trading capabilities from one unified platform. The trading platform features more than 120,000 investment options including crypto assets and stocks and ETFs and forex contracts. Security remains a priority so DTX Exchange submits itself to trusted professional audits like SolidProof to maintain safe operations. Many individuals eagerly anticipate the upcoming official launch of DTX during the next quarter. Early investor support demonstrates confidence in the promising future of the project because of its substantial expansion. Dogecoin Price Dips 32% in 30 Days - 720K+ Investors Choose DTX Over DOGE Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced decreased popularity during its current period of poor performance. During the past month the Dogecoin price experienced a 32% decline which led to an extended challenging period. Current investors avoid DOGE along with other meme-based platforms because they seek cryptocurrency solutions that deliver tangible benefits in real life. Source: Dogecoin Price, Monthly Chart, CoinMarketCap More than 720,000 investors selected DTX Exchange because they foresaw better prospects instead of using DOGE coins based on speculation. The real value combined with useful features of DTX attracts investors who choose it over other platforms. It provides users with an easy method to trade multiple assets through its convenient platform. This platform stands apart by delivering an easy trading journey through high security protocols combined with open transparency standards and safety measures. The previous wave of investors who pursued speculative DOGE gains now turn their attention to practical and stable investment solutions. The growing maturity of the crypto market leads more users to choose investments that have practical benefits in real life. The present market signs indicate that meme coins such as DOGE need to advance their capabilities to remain competitive or risk fading into obscurity. Investors place their confidence in transformative approaches that aim for enduring growth over the short-term speculative gains from which they previously based their decisions. SHIB Jumps Only 2% After Trump's Announcement for Crypto Reserve The announcements about Trump's crypto reserve caused Shiba Inu (SHIB) to only achieve a 2% growth during that period. Holders expressed disappointment with that minimal price rise because it indicated decreased meme coin enthusiasm. Value-seeking investors together with those seeking practical utility have started searching for alternate investment opportunities. Source: SHIB Vs. Dogecoin Price Comparison, CoinMarketCap That is one of the reasons why DTX Exchange received substantial investor interest because it connects institutional and retail investor requirements. Crypto and stocks among various assets at DTX allow investors to achieve better portfolio spread. The dual trading platform reaches users of different skill levels thus expanding its customer base. The modest 2% growth of SHIB fails to satisfy investors who were previously focused on popularity because they now seek investment options that deliver more than just media attention. Modern crypto investors seek more than exciting headlines when making cryptocurrency investments because they prefer technology-based practical solutions. Conclusion The rising investor interest in DTX Exchange reflects their preference for logical asset value instead of transitory market hype which affects Dogecoin price and SHIB. The platform attracts investors through its dependable structure together with clear operating framework and available diversity of tradeable elements. Presumably due to forthcoming release expectations investors maintain optimistic expectations about DTX.

Experts forecast that the Bitcoin price could reach $150,000 within the upcoming future which is strengthening market excitement. On the other hand, the ERC-20 coin DTX Exchange stands as a popular choice which attracts growing investor enthusiasm because of its fast rising popularity. The listing price for this coin is set to $0.36 which will 2x the ROI for its early investors. DTX Exchange a Viral ERC-20 Coin Hits 800% in Presale Gains The pre-sale of DTX Exchange attracted more than 720,000 investors who helped raise $15.5 million which activated an early bonus round because of high demand. The token price set at $0.18 demonstrates high confidence in the dual exchange platform because investors can expect a 2x return when the listing reaches $0.36. The Layer-1 blockchain of DTX Exchange enables secure transparent access to more than 120,000 assets that include crypto assets and stocks and ETFs and forex for all types of global traders. The combination of innovative features such as multi-asset leverage and 1000x trading with reliable operations enables DTX to challenge other DeFi platforms in the market. The combination of operational stability and strategic communication attracts retail investors together with institutional investors to suggest continued growth after the listing while crypto expands. Bitcoin Price Soars to $92.5K - Analyst Predicts $150K for BTC Amid Volatility The Bitcoin price reached $92,560 while approaching the $150,000 projection for 2025 set by analyst James Check primarily because institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity joined Bitcoin (BTC) and record ETFs absorbed triple the volume of monthly mined supply. Source: Bitcoin Price, Weekly BTC Chart, CoinMarketCap Predictions about the Bitcoin price come from analysts who warned about the Swissblock's risk index approaching in September 2024 potential decline period and the Grayscale ETF loss of $3.3 billion last year. Despite the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve plan and growing corporate involvement the current macroeconomic factors including trade barriers as well as yen currency market volatility may lead to price pressure. BTC investors maintain positive market expectations through their investments in altcoins Ethereum and Cardano as well as the continued growth of crypto beyond Bitcoin (BTC) functionality. One of the reasons why BTC investors are investing in DTX is because of the high price that BTC has and lower ROI. DTX Exchange Listing Price Set for $0.36 - 2x ROI Incoming DTX Exchange will start trading at $0.36 during its listing phase which will give presale investors a double return on their initial $0.18 purchase and users who enter through the ""LIST2X"" code will receive a total benefit of 4x. The 475 million token total supply creates limited availability and the platform provides trading access to 120,000+ assets including crypto assets and stocks alongside ETFs and forex using VulcanX blockchain technology at 200,000 TPS. The trading system enables fractional investments and offers institutional and retail users 1000x leverage through its audited Phoenix Wallet security solution. An emerging $15.5 million pre-sale amount together with over 720,000 members in the community signals strong belief in Phoenix's upcoming Q2 release date. DTX intends to expand globally through regulatory-compliant structures which offer liquidity pools that reduce trading price fluctuations after its listing. The market analysts draw parallels with Binance during 2017 which indicates that DTX Exchange may experience triple-digit growth when top exchange listings like Binance and Coinbase become available. EXMCorporation’s strategic stake and revenue programs entice investors to maintain their holdings over the long term while making DTX an effective scalable platform among decentralized finance solutions operating in the $100 billion hybrid trading segment. Conclusion The fast-rising Bitcoin price attracts substantial investor attention which makes DTX Exchange appear as a desirable alternative. DTX Exchange offers investors a powerful investment opportunity by implementing forward-thinking strategies and lucrative promotions alongside strong potential for expansion.

FTX’s unstaking activity coincides with its creditor repayment process, which began on February 18. The ongoing token unlocks could impact market sentiment, with more similar events expected in the coming months. Defunct crypto exchange FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research, have unstaked and distributed over 3 million Solana (SOL) tokens, marking their largest SOL unlock since November 2023. The move has renewed concerns over potential market impact as the firms continue their asset liquidations. FTX and Alameda Unstake $431.4M in Solana According to the Lookonchain report on March 4, the SOL tokens valued at approximately $431.4 million, were distributed across 37 wallets, sparking speculation about potential sales. Since the unstake, around 25,000 SOL (worth $3.3 million) has already been deposited on Binance, suggesting a portion of the assets may be sold on the open market. Spot On Chain highlighted that this latest unstake is part of a broader pattern observed since FTX’s collapse, with the firm unstaking and transferring large amounts of SOL at regular intervals. This is typically between the 12th and 15th of each month, with amounts reaching 170,000 SOL. FTX/Alameda unstaked and distributed 3.03M $SOL ($432.5M) to 37 wallets, likely for deposits to #Coinbase and #Binance ~3 hours ago! This is FTX/Alameda’s largest unstake since November 2023 and likely part of the 11.2M $SOL (~$1.5B) set to be unlocked in early March. Since… pic.twitter.com/VfTf5j50GG — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 4, 2025 According to blockchain analysts, the latest unstake is part of a larger portion of 11.2 million SOL (worth nearly $2.06 billion) set to be unlocked in early March. To date, FTX and Alameda have unstaked and liquidated approximately 7.83 million SOL since November 2023. Data indicates that around $986 million worth of SOL has been deposited to Coinbase and Binance at an average price of $125.8. FTX’s Court-Imposed Limits on Liquidations, Creditor Repayments, and Market Impact Despite the large unstake, FTX cannot conduct unrestricted asset sales due to court-imposed limitations. In September 2023, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court approved a liquidation plan that restricts FTX’s digital asset sales, allowing a maximum of $50 million in the first week and increasing to $100 million in the following weeks. I am seeing a lot of wrong information being spread about FTX liquidating their holdings They can only sell up to $200m a week of assets $SOL is their largest holding but most of their Solana is locked up in vesting and can’t be sold for years pic.twitter.com/9dFseAABOx — Johnny (@CryptoGodJohn) September 10, 2023 If the exchange wishes to sell beyond this limit, it must seek court approval to raise the cap to $200 million per week. FTX’s unstaking activity coincides with its creditor repayment process , which began on February 18. The firm has initiated the distribution of $1.2 billion to smaller claim holders, with the first phase targeting claims under $50,000. Larger creditors may receive up to 175% of their claims, but distributions are expected to be staggered throughout 2025. FTX’s reorganization plan, effective January 3, mandates that all creditor repayments be processed within 60 days of the effective date. The firm has partnered with crypto custodian BitGo to handle fund distributions, pegging payouts to November 2022 crypto prices. Since then, Solana has surged over 1000%, from $22 to recent highs above $280. Will the Market React? Historically, large token unlocks have influenced Solana’s price. In September 2024, when FTX unstaked over $1 billion in SOL , the token held steady near $137.77 and even reached an intraday high of $139.76. ​​ https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1834498508478693526 However, market sentiment remains different this time. A portion of the 24,799 SOL ($3.38M) has already been deposited on Binance , hinting at potential selling pressure. Furthermore, more unlocks are expected in April and beyond, raising concerns about continued volatility. Adding to the uncertainty, asset managers like Pantera Capital previously sought to acquire $250 million worth of SOL from FTX at a 39% discount, but no similar deals have been reported for the current unlocks.

This retaliatory measure, unveiled by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, marks a significant turning point in Canada-US trade relations and sends ripples of economic uncertainty across global markets. For cryptocurrency investors and market watchers, understanding the implications of such large-scale trade disputes is crucial, as they often trigger market volatility and shifts in investment strategies. Let’s delve into the details of this developing situation and explore what it means for the global economic landscape. Why Did Canada Impose These Canada Tariffs ? The move comes as a direct response to ongoing U.S. trade actions that Canada views as unfair and detrimental to its economic interests. Prime Minister Trudeau, in his announcement on March 3rd, explicitly stated that these Canada tariffs , effective from March 4th, are a direct consequence of Washington’s trade policies. He emphasized that these measures will remain in place until the U.S. withdraws its contentious trade actions. This firm stance underscores Canada’s resolve to protect its economic sovereignty and interests in the face of what it perceives as unwarranted trade aggression. What Exactly is US Trade Retaliation Triggering? While the exact U.S. trade actions prompting this US trade retaliation were not explicitly detailed in the initial reports, it is widely understood that they relate to ongoing disputes over various trade practices and potentially specific sectors. Canada’s imposition of tariffs can be seen as a calculated counter-measure, aiming to exert pressure on the U.S. to reconsider its trade policies. This tit-for-tat approach is a classic example of escalating trade tensions, often referred to as a trade war, which can have far-reaching consequences beyond just the involved nations. The Scale of Global Trade Tensions : $107 Billion Impact The sheer magnitude of these global trade tensions is staggering. Imposing 25% tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) worth of goods is not a trivial matter. This represents a significant portion of trade between the two nations and signals a serious disruption in established trade flows. Consider the implications: Increased Costs for Consumers: Tariffs essentially act as taxes on imported goods. These increased costs are often passed down to consumers, leading to higher prices for a wide range of products in Canada. Impact on Businesses: Both Canadian and American businesses involved in cross-border trade will face immediate challenges. Canadian importers will pay more for US goods, and conversely, US exporters may find their products less competitive in the Canadian market. Potential for Further Escalation: Trudeau’s statement that Canada might consider ‘non-tariff measures if necessary’ hints at the potential for this trade dispute to worsen. This could involve quotas, regulatory barriers, or other actions that further impede trade. Economic Uncertainty and Market Reactions Such significant trade actions invariably inject economic uncertainty into the global market. Investors and businesses alike dislike uncertainty, as it makes planning and forecasting more difficult. In the context of cryptocurrency markets, which are already known for their volatility, broader economic uncertainties can amplify price swings. Here’s how: Risk-Off Sentiment: Trade wars often trigger a ‘risk-off’ sentiment in financial markets. Investors may become more cautious and move away from assets perceived as risky, including cryptocurrencies, at least in the short term. Currency Fluctuations: Trade tensions can lead to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The Canadian dollar and the US dollar, along with other currencies involved in international trade, could see increased volatility. This can indirectly impact cryptocurrency valuations, especially for cryptocurrencies paired with these fiat currencies. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains, leading to delays, increased costs, and potentially reduced production. While the direct impact on the crypto industry might be less immediate, broader economic disruptions can affect investor sentiment and overall market confidence. Navigating Market Volatility in Times of Trade Wars For those involved in cryptocurrency and other financial markets, navigating periods of market volatility triggered by trade disputes requires a strategic approach. Here are some considerations: Strategy Description Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in the Canada-US trade situation and broader global economic news. Real-time information is crucial for making informed decisions. Diversification: Diversifying your investment portfolio across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risk during periods of market uncertainty. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, to protect your capital during volatile market conditions. Long-Term Perspective: Maintain a long-term perspective. Trade disputes are often cyclical, and markets tend to recover over time. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Global Trade? Canada’s imposition of tariffs on US goods marks a significant and concerning escalation in global trade tensions . The $107 billion impact is substantial, and the potential for further retaliatory measures looms large. For cryptocurrency markets and the broader financial world, this development introduces a new layer of economic uncertainty and the likelihood of increased market volatility . Understanding the dynamics of these trade disputes and their potential ramifications is now more critical than ever for investors and market participants worldwide. The situation is fluid, and continuous monitoring of developments will be essential to navigate the evolving global economic landscape.

While proponents envision it as a forward-thinking move to secure America’s position in the evolving financial landscape, concerns are mounting about the composition of such a reserve. Recently, Bitcoin technology firm Jan3 CEO Samson Mow issued a stark warning: including altcoins in this strategic reserve could be a recipe for disaster, potentially triggering significant altcoins market chaos . Will Altcoins in a Strategic Reserve Ignite Market Chaos? According to a Bitcoin.com News report highlighted on X, Mow didn’t mince words. He suggested that while former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for a crypto strategic reserve holds promise, diluting it with altcoins like XRP, SOL, ADA, or ETH would transform it into a “pure speculation game.” This raises a critical question: is the inclusion of altcoins in a strategic reserve a prudent step, or a gamble that could backfire spectacularly? Mow’s argument centers on the inherent nature of different cryptocurrencies. He emphasizes that not all digital assets are created equal, particularly when considering their suitability for a strategic reserve aimed at long-term stability and national interest. Let’s delve deeper into why Mow and many others believe that loading up a strategic reserve with altcoins is a risky proposition. The Perils of Altcoin Speculation in a Strategic Reserve Mow’s core concern isn’t just about market volatility; it’s about the very purpose of a strategic reserve. Strategic reserves, traditionally used for commodities like oil, are meant to provide stability and security during times of crisis. Introducing highly speculative and less established altcoins into this mix, he argues, fundamentally undermines this objective. Increased Volatility: Altcoins, by their nature, are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. Their market caps are smaller, making them susceptible to larger price swings based on market sentiment, news, and even social media trends. A strategic reserve filled with these assets would itself become a source of instability, rather than a pillar of strength. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for many altcoins remains murky. Legal classifications and compliance requirements are still being developed, creating significant uncertainty. Holding large quantities of assets with uncertain regulatory futures within a strategic reserve could expose the U.S. to unforeseen legal and financial risks. Centralization Concerns: Many altcoins are more centralized than Bitcoin, meaning a smaller group of individuals or entities control a significant portion of the supply or network operations. This centralization introduces vulnerabilities and potential points of failure that are less prevalent in decentralized, proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Lobbying and Insider Influence: Mow directly points out the risk of political influence. Allowing political figures to handpick altcoins for the reserve opens the door to lobbying and insider dealing. Imagine the pressure from various altcoin projects to be included – this could turn the strategic reserve into a political tool rather than a sound financial strategy. Why Prioritize Proof-of-Work Crypto for Stability? Mow advocates for prioritizing proof-of-work assets like BTC, LTC, and XMR. But what makes proof-of-work cryptocurrencies a more sensible choice for a strategic reserve? The answer lies in their fundamental characteristics: Decentralization and Security: Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are inherently decentralized. Their security is derived from a vast, distributed network of miners, making them incredibly resistant to censorship and manipulation. This robust security is crucial for a strategic reserve meant to withstand various economic and geopolitical pressures. Established Track Record: Bitcoin, in particular, boasts a long and proven track record. It has weathered numerous market cycles, geopolitical events, and technological challenges, demonstrating its resilience and enduring value proposition. This historical data provides a level of confidence that newer altcoins simply cannot match. Sound Monetary Policy: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins provides a predictable and sound monetary policy. This scarcity, coupled with its decentralized nature, positions Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation – qualities highly desirable in a strategic reserve asset. Global Acceptance: Bitcoin enjoys widespread global recognition and adoption. It’s traded on exchanges worldwide and is increasingly accepted by businesses and institutions. This global liquidity and acceptance make Bitcoin a readily accessible and easily deployable asset within a strategic reserve. Bitcoin vs Altcoins : A Strategic Reserve Showdown The debate boils down to a fundamental difference in philosophy and risk tolerance. Is a strategic reserve meant to be a speculative investment portfolio, or a bastion of stability in turbulent times? The table below highlights the key distinctions between Bitcoin and altcoins in the context of a strategic reserve: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Altcoins (e.g., XRP, ETH, SOL, ADA) Market Volatility Lower (relative to altcoins) Higher Decentralization Highly Decentralized Varying degrees of centralization Regulatory Clarity Relatively more clarity More regulatory uncertainty Track Record Long and Proven Shorter, less established Monetary Policy Fixed Supply (21 million) Varying, often inflationary Security Robust Proof-of-Work Varying security models, some less proven Speculative Nature Lower Higher Suitability for Strategic Reserve Higher (for stability) Lower (introduces speculation & volatility) Navigating Crypto Market Volatility: A Strategic Approach The cryptocurrency market is known for its inherent crypto market volatility . This volatility is part of its appeal for many investors seeking high-growth opportunities. However, when it comes to a strategic reserve, the priorities shift from maximizing returns to ensuring stability and security. A strategic reserve isn’t about chasing the next 100x altcoin; it’s about safeguarding national economic interests. Including altcoins in a strategic reserve would inevitably inject more volatility and speculation. While some may argue for diversification, true diversification in a strategic context should prioritize assets with different risk profiles and low correlation. In the crypto space, altcoins are often highly correlated with Bitcoin and even more susceptible to market swings. Therefore, adding them may amplify, rather than mitigate, risk. The Power of Proof of Work Crypto: Foundation for a Sound Reserve Samson Mow’s emphasis on proof of work crypto is not just about technological preference; it’s about building a strategic reserve on a solid foundation. Proof-of-work, while sometimes criticized for its energy consumption, provides a battle-tested mechanism for achieving decentralization and security. This robust foundation is essential for any asset intended for long-term strategic holding. By focusing on proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Monero (XMR), the U.S. could create a strategic reserve that is: Resilient: Built on decentralized and secure networks. Predictable: Based on sound monetary policies (in the case of Bitcoin and Litecoin). Globally Accepted: Easily accessible and transferable on a global scale. Less Susceptible to Manipulation: Due to their decentralized nature and established market presence. Conclusion: Strategic Reserve or Speculative Gamble? The decision of what to include in a U.S. crypto strategic reserve is not merely a technical one; it’s a strategic choice with potentially far-reaching consequences. Samson Mow’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that diluting the reserve with altcoins could transform it from a tool for stability into a source of altcoins market chaos and speculation. Prioritizing robust, decentralized, and proven assets like Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies is paramount to ensure the reserve serves its intended purpose: safeguarding national economic interests in the digital age.

Just days ago, BTC surged to a high of $95,000, fueled by renewed institutional interest following a groundbreaking announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump. Source: TradingView Trump’s declaration of a strategic crypto reserve , which includes Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), XRP , Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), initially sent the market into a frenzy, pushing BTC to $90K+ high. However, the surge left a significant gap in the CME Bitcoin futures market, which historically acts as a magnet for price corrections. As anticipated, Bitcoin retraced to $83,500 in the Asian trading hours on Tuesday, filling the gap entirely. This drop triggered a cascade of liquidations, wiping out over $900 million in bullish bets on crypto-tracked futures in the past 24 hours. In just three days, the market saw over $1.5 billion in liquidations, marking one of the most aggressive reversals in recent months. Nearly $400 million in long positions on Bitcoin alone were forcefully closed, mainly during late U.S. and early Asian trading hours, exacerbating the downward momentum. In fact, according to Ali Martinez , over 25,000 BTC, valued at over $2 billion, were withdrawn from exchanges. Over the past two weeks, more than 25,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges! pic.twitter.com/bxiSpHuXid — Ali (@ali_charts) March 4, 2025 These market instabilities have led to increased market fear, with the Greed and Fear Index showing levels close to “Extreme Fear.” This level of fear was last seen in the last quarter of 2022, following the fall of Terra Luna and FTX. Source: CoinMarketCap The market’s sharp decline was further fueled by Trump’s official implementation of a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico , alongside a 20% tariff on China. Crypto Markets in Freefall as Global Trade War Fears Mount The cryptocurrency market has entered a phase of extreme turbulence, mirroring traditional financial markets, as the Trump administration’s trade policies continue to rattle investor confidence. Bitcoin, which had been trading above $90,000 just days before , suffered a drastic pullback and plunged below $84,000. Ethereum (ETH) and other major altcoins were not spared. ETH dropped over 11%, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) suffered double-digit losses. The timing of Bitcoin’s drop aligns with increasing uncertainty surrounding global trade relations. Trump’s confirmation of fresh tariffs on key trading partners has escalated fears of a full-scale trade war, prompting investors to abandon riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to data from Watcher.Guru , over $1.07 billion in liquidations occurred within 24 hours, marking one of the most significant market wipeouts in recent months. JUST IN: $1,070,000,000 liquidated from the cryptocurrency market in the past 24 hours. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 4, 2025 Adding to the bearish sentiment, The Kobeissi Letter reported that only 3% of investors now view Bitcoin as a hedge against a trade war. Furthermore, just 3% of respondents said that Bitcoin would preform best in a full-blown trade war. This is 12 percentage points less than the US Dollar and 55 percentage points less than gold. The reality is that markets no longer view crypto as a hedge during uncertainty. pic.twitter.com/D36DdbxjcI — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 4, 2025 This is a dramatic shift from previous market cycles, where Bitcoin was often considered a safe haven during economic uncertainty. Instead, capital has flowed into traditional safe-haven assets such as gold, which has seen a notable uptick in demand. Global equity markets have also suffered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 649.67 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded sharp declines. Technology stocks, particularly Nvidia (NVDA), suffered significant losses. Despite reporting record revenues of $39.3 billion, NVDA dipped below its February 3rd post-DeepSeek low. In retaliation to the U.S. tariffs, Canada and Mexico announced immediate countermeasures . China and Canada strike back at US tariffs with retaliatory tariffs, intensifying economic uncertainty and shaking investor sentiment. #TradeTensions #GlobalMarkets https://t.co/j8sD6VWc8n — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 4, 2025 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau imposed 25% tariffs on $107 billion worth of U.S. goods, including a first wave of $21 billion in tariffs set to take effect immediately.

Bitcoin Faces Critical Technical Levels as Analysts Eye Further Downside As Bitcoin continues to experience extreme volatility, market analysts are closely monitoring key technical levels to determine the next move. The recent price action has closed two significant CME price gaps: $92,800 and $94,000 and $78,000 and $80,700. While some see these closures as a sign of stabilization, others warn that the market remains vulnerable to further downside. Technical expert Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin’s latest correction represents a 28.5% drawdown, one of the most significant declines in the current market cycle. #BTC Bitcoin has completely filled the massive CME Gap between $84650 and ~$93300 (light blue box) $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/b9nSLawLSU pic.twitter.com/FYCllzukW9 — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 3, 2025 Historically, similar drawdowns have provided strong buying opportunities, but the current macroeconomic situation may delay a potential recovery. With Trump’s tariffs in full effect and global markets in turmoil, uncertainty remains at an all-time high. On-chain analyst Miles Deutscher highlighted that if Bitcoin fails to hold above the $80,000 level, it could open the door for a further decline toward $77,930, corresponding to an unfilled CME futures gap from early November. Retail $BTC holdings have been on the decline while large investor holdings have been ticking up. There is a transfer going on from smaller individuals to big players and ETFs as $BTC becomes more institutionalized. pic.twitter.com/Jdg35pUWTr — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 4, 2025 Market participants are also closely monitoring Bitcoin’s dominance, which currently stands at 58%, to gauge the broader sentiment across the crypto sector. Meme coins and smaller-cap assets have suffered even greater declines, further exacerbating the market-wide selloff. Looking forward, before we can move from our current extreme fear, Bitcoin bulls must reclaim critical resistance levels above $90,000 to restore confidence in the market. However, the road to recovery remains uncertain, with uncertainty looming large, global trade tensions escalating, and investor sentiment shifting.

Crypto markets bounced last weekend as President Donald Trump teased a U.S. crypto reserve featuring five of the top digital assets by market cap, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Investors deployed over $330 billion across cryptocurrencies in hours due to the news. Yet, outflows surpassed $600 billion 24 hours later and cryptos returned all the gains from Trump’s announcement. Despite the market drawdown, Lee said Bitcoin will end 2025 higher than $150,000. BTC changed hands under $83,000 as of writing, slightly recovering from the day’s low around $81,900. You might also like: Bitcoin revisits $85k as crypto reserve gains fade More pain before Bitcoin bottoms Speaking with CNBC, Lee predicted that a BTC market bottom may form as early as this week. Market bottoms are levels at which assets usually bounce from and are regarded as springboards for upward momentum. Although Lee’s forecast adopted a long-term view, the pro-BTC investor expects short-term volatility will contribute to finding a bottom. This cyclical bottoming phase could send BTC down to $62,000 in March, Lee opined. Bitcoin would fall more than 24% from current prices if Lee’s scenario played out. Also, this outcome would expand BTC’s decline from its all-time high to over 50%, marking one of the largest drawdowns in the asset’s history and setting a four-month low. BTC’s potential 24% drop per Fundstrat’s Tom Lee’s prediction | Source: TradingView Based on historical data, the chances of this happening are nearly 50/50. Between 2013 and 2024, BTC closed March with losses six times and turned gains five times. Some analysts agree that BTC and the broader crypto markets may suffer from risk-off sentiment due to economic uncertainty. Trade wars broke out as President Trump issued tariffs against Canada, Mexico, China, and other nation-states. Lee said this week’s U.S. job data could cushion fears and spark investor confidence. Notably, BTC saw a modest uptick after last week’s Core PCE data before dipping again.

At press time, DOGE trades at $0.18 after a 14% drop in 24 hours. As the market sentiment turns into fear, can a proposal by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson help Dogecoin price to rally 5x? Cardano Founder Offers to Help Musk with DOGE Payments Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has offered to help Elon Musk with a roadmap to integrate DOGE payments on X. In a recent post, Hoskinson noted that if DOGE were to follow the “Bitcoin 2 roadmap,” it could become the standard currency at the X platform. Hoskinson went ahead to tease the Dogecoin community saying that he would help upgrade the blockchain to support the Grok AI model and process DOGE payments. “Come on Dogecoin, you know you want a little retrofit, Little bit of sharded useful proof of work to run that expensive Grok. Some state channels for ultra-low-cost payments for tipping X posts… I’ll even throw in some quantum resistance” he said. Musk has previously teased the idea of DOGE payments on X. However, these plans have never been realized. Nevertheless, Musk has already endorsed the meme coin as a means of payment at Tesla, and if the same were replicated on X, it could spark a bullish rally. Dogecoin Price Analysis – Can DOGE Rally 5x? Dogecoin price appears ready to make a 5x rally after completing a rounding bottom pattern. After witnessing a parabolic rally in late 2024, DOGE breached resistance at the neckline of this pattern and flipped it into support. Dogecoin is retreating to retest this support after selling pressure across the broader market pushed the prices lower. If it can successfully defend it, it could stir a 266% price rally to $0.65. At this point, DOGE price will have recorded an over 5x gain from its current price. The CMF indicator is positive despite the crypto market retreating , making it likely that buyers can defend this support if the selling pressure cools. The ADX line is also tipping south showing weakening momentum. This setup suggests that the Dogecoin price can successfully defend this support level. DOGE/USDT: 1-week Chart Despite this bullish Dogecoin price prediction , its ability to bounce from this support level again is contingent on the broader crypto market recovering. However, if Elon Musk were to integrate DOGE payments on X as proposed by the Cardano founder, it could stir significant gains for the altcoin.

Trump announced on March 2 that the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets was directed to include XRP, Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, and Ethereum in the crypto strategic reserve. Australian government declines to establish a strategic crypto reserve Australia’s government has revealed that it will not establish a cryptocurrency reserve, despite Donald Trump initiating efforts for the latter just days earlier. The President announced yesterday that the United States was moving ahead with plans to establish a strategic crypto reserve in BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and ADA. A spokesperson for the Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services Minister, Stephen Jones, stated that the country’s government is focused on regulating virtual currencies. The spokesperson also acknowledged that the Australian government had no plans to start investing public money in crypto in the near term. “The Albanese government has consulted on our proposed framework to build a fit-for-purpose digital asset regulatory regime, and we continue to work closely with industry. The Albanese government knows that blockchain and digital assets present big opportunities for our economy, our financial sector and innovation. -Australian Government Spokesperson. The President believes that a U.S. crypto reserve “will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.” He also added that he will make sure the United States is the “Crypto Capital of the World.” Trump’s announcement that a strategic crypto reserve would include other cryptocurrencies sent crypto prices soaring. ADA surged by almost 70% on the day, SOL rose by almost 20%, XRP was up 28%, and ETH and BTC jumped 11% and 8%, respectively. At the time of publication, the spike has now died down with most cryptocurrencies tumbling today, with BTC dropping over 9% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum is also down by over 10% during the same period, XRP plummeted by 9.67%, while Solana and ADA are both down by almost 15%. Australian executives display skepticism towards a strategic crypto reserve Tom Matthews, head of corporate affairs at Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, acknowledged that while the idea for a reserve was popular, it can also be “fraught with complexity.” He also believes that there is a potential for concentration risk with some tokens if the idea for a reserve is not managed properly. Mathews also argued that crypto price volatility is a major problem if one of the main goals of a nation’s strategic reserve is to hedge against crises. He also highlighted that he was eager to see where the political traction will come from concerning the potential reserve. The exchange’s executive speculated a more likely scenario will be the emergence of a long-only sovereign wealth fund that holds digital assets. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong disclosed that the best option for the crypto reserve would be to make it Bitcoin only. Samira Tollo, CTO of Australian crypto exchange Elbaite, believes that Trump’s motives for including ADA are questionable because it represents just 1% of market share. She posted that the President was creating mass “Hopium” and “it’s clear from this announcement that his incentives lie elsewhere.” Joe Lonsdale, the founder of AI-based data analytics firm Palantir referred to the scheme as a grift and protested that his tax dollars shouldn’t be used for purchasing crypto. He said that taxation was theft and should be kept to a minimum. Lonsdale acknowledged that “it’s wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it’s also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes.” Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center CEO Brendan Thomas highlighted in December that the Anti-Money Laundering regulator was shifting its focus to the virtual asset industry in 2025. During the same period, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission also released a consultation paper on proposed guidance for digital currencies. The consultation paper placed many virtual assets under the category of financial products and required firms dealing in crypto to be licensed.

The total market cap slipped below $3 trillion, settling at $2.77 trillion, a 9% decline. Trading volume also decreased by 14% to $177 billion. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP initially surged after Trump’s announcement of a crypto reserve on Sunday. However, the market reversed sharply as new tariffs on Mexico and Canada took effect. Trump’s trade policies and growing recession fears led to heavy sell-offs. Bitcoin faced downward pressure due to CME gaps and institutional liquidations crashing by 10%. Altcoin, like ETH, has decreased by 15% and XRP by 17%, following the trend. Crypto Prices Dip as BTC Fails to Hold Above $85K Support Bitcoin price dropped over 10% today from a peak of $93,664. Earlier, Bitcoin saw gains as institutional demand grew after U.S. President Donald Trump revealed a crypto reserve. However, the market momentum shifted as bearish sentiment intensified, leading to a sharp decline in value. Despite the surge, the CME Bitcoin futures chart showed a notable gap, suggesting a potential price drop. This gap, known as a CME gap, typically signals a price correction as it is often revisited. BTC price hovered at $83,973, indicating a downtrend in the past 24 hours, making it the lowest point this month. Will ETH Price Break Below $2k Support Level? Over the last 24 hours, Ethereum price has seen a notable decrease, hovering below the $2,200 support level following other crypto coins. This follows a brief rally, where Ether surged by 15% after the announcement of the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve on Sunday. However, despite its inclusion in the reserve, ETH faces continued sell-offs amidst broader market uncertainty. Crypto prices across the board have been fluctuating, and altcoins are also seeing similar price struggles. If this trend persists, ETH could dip below $2,000. XRP Price Sees Major Fluctuations XRP is now trading at $2.35, reflecting a 17% drop within the past 24 hours. Ripple price climbed by more than 20%% after being included in the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. However, this surge was short-lived. Current market data shows XRP has maintained a sideway position because investors maintain a cautious stance due to price swings. Numerous whales have surged their purchases of XRP during the past 24 hours, reaching nearly 1 billion XRP. The total amount of XRP held in whale wallets reached approximately 1 billion during a 24-hour timespan. The increased buying from Whale wallets indicates powerful market demand that might influence price trends. The upward price movement becomes more probable when purchase activity intensifies because it decreases market sellers. What’s Next for Altcoins? BTC price must stabilize above $82,500 to halt further declines. If Bitcoin’s downtrend pauses, altcoins could regain momentum. Otherwise, most altcoins may continue to struggle, except ETH, SOL, XRP, and ADA, which remain on Trump’s reserve list.

The crypto market maker is exploring opening new offices in both New York and Singapore, Lancia said. The firm is regulated in the U.K., Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands, and has plans to expand its licensing under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA came into effect on Dec. 30 last year. Portofino has made a number of senior hires in recent months. Dipak Shah has joined the company as its head of over-the-counter (OTC) trading, based in London. Shah joined from Japanese investment bank Nomura, where he was employed as head of FX options trading. He previously worked at Wall Street banks Citi (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS). ""While clients and liquidity provision remain our number one priority we have and want to make investments in trading and technology talent to build and scale our business,"" Shah said in emailed comments. Portofino wants to be a dominant player across its three core business segments: electronic market making, OTC trading and token services. ""We have already hired many high calibre individuals in London, with further expansion planned in Asia and New York in terms of trading personnel,"" Shah added. Portofino was founded by two former Citadel Securities leaders Leonard Lancia and Alex Casimo in 2021. It raised $50 million in equity funding in late 2022. The firm was responsible for over $100 billion in trading volume in 2024, it said. The company is rebuilding after suffering a number of departures last year, as reported by CoinDesk.

This Ethereum price level might attract increased trading activity as traders will capitalize on the lower entry points. February has been ruthless for the crypto market, and ETH has suffered from a massive $1.5B hack that triggered the Ethereum price decline. DTX Exchange is the new altcoin on the block. With the falling Ethereum price creating a grim outlook for the broader market, DTX Exchange is the silver lining for investors who fear the impending crypto crash. DTX Exchange is a hybrid trading platform offering users over 120,000 financial instruments. It is the DeFi project that will transform the capital trading markets by integrating them with blockchain and decentralization. Ethereum Price Recovery Efforts Meet Strong Resistance The Ethereum price is attempting a recovery, but it faces strong resistance, and chances are ETH will soon touch a price below the $2,000 mark. The Ethereum price currently trades around $2,100 but dropped below $2,000 on the 27th of February. An increase in ETH trading volume accompanied the drop, with a spike in whale transactions. Since ETH is the second most important crypto token, the market has been heavily invested since the Ethereum price took a significant dip. If the ETH price breaches $2,000 again, it could signal further downside pressure and have more serious implications for the future of the Ethereum price. ETH faces increased volatility, and traders are actively seeking liquidity and hoping to capitalize on the dip. The market sentiment has shifted towards caution as the technical indicators do not show signs of recovery. Experts say that ETH is oversold, and the price is seeing a correction, as the Ethereum price should be lower than it is now. If ETH can manage to stay above $2,000, it could rise to $3,500, but if selling pressure continues, it will fall more before a recovery. DTX Exchange Offers Last Chance in Final Stage DTX Exchange is positioning itself as a market disruptor as it will focus on addressing the inefficiencies of legacy trading platforms. The primary concerns have been liquidity issues and security, and with a blockchain-based platform, DTX Exchange will offer high liquidity pools and institutional-grade security. Solid Proof has validated the DTX Exchange’s promise for security and reliability, and it also has a no-KYC policy that will maintain user anonymity. DTX will combine the best of both worlds and with the transparency of decentralized exchanges it will offer a lightning-fast, efficient and accessible trading infrastructure. DTX Exchange is built on the proprietary VulcanX Blockchain and its test net run has achieved an unbelievable speed of 200,000 transactions per second. This means traders will finally be able to achieve trades and transactions in real time. DTX Exchange offers 120,000 assets including equities, stocks, bonds, forex, crypto derivatives and tokenized real-world assets. It has a non-custodial model with which traders will be able to retain full control of its assets. Key Takeaways The hybrid approach of the DTX Exchange eliminates counterparty risk while offering fast trade execution and an intuitive trading experience. It eliminates the vulnerabilities of centralized exchanges while creating the perfect infrastructure for the modern trader who needs high-performance tools. DTX Exchange will empower traders to make more informed trading decisions while reducing risk and saving time. The platform makes a strong case for investment because of its strong fundamentals and high upside potential after listing. DTX tokens, currently available for $0.18 in the final round, will surge to $0.36 after listing. This minimum increase of 200% offers an enticing upside in challenging market conditions.

This steep plunge comes after US President Donald Trump confirmed yesterday that planned tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China were going ahead, and after China and Canada retaliated with tariffs of their own . The fall also comes after Trump’s crypto and AI advisor, David Sacks, confirmed he had dumped all of his Solana (and Bitcoin and Ethereum) holdings prior to taking his position on January 20. While this could equal a large amount of Solana, Sacks’ trade didn’t seem to hurt the SOL price at the time, with the coin more dependent on an improvement in global economic conditions for its recovery. Trump’s Crypto Czar Dumps All Bitcoin & Solana Holdings – Time to Panic? Responding to a Financial Times article which broke the news, Sacks confirmed yesterday that he and his firm, Craft Ventures, have sold their SOL, BTC and ETH. Correct. I sold all my cryptocurrency (including BTC, ETH, and SOL) prior to the start of the administration. https://t.co/dN6nuGQUtu — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) March 3, 2025 A sale of holdings may seem bearish at first glance, but the real issue with Sacks and his holdings is that they may impose a conflict of interest on Trump’s crypto tsar. That is, his prior holdings in Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum may have motivated him to propose policies for his own benefit, and for the benefit of his portfolio. Ridding himself of his crypto is therefore a good step, although as you can see from the X context above, his firm still invested in Bitwise, which operates a Bitcoin ETF , an Ethereum ETF , and which has filed to list a Solana ETF (and also a joint Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF ). As such, there arguably remains a conflict of interest, although you could also argue that this is good for crypto, since it may encourage Sacks – and by extension Trump – to push crypto-friendly policies. Yet you wouldn’t notice this judging by today’s Solana chart, which shows the altcoin continue to struggle with very low momentum. Source: TradingView Its 30-day average (orange) is dropping further below the 200-day (blue), while its RSI (purple) has fallen below 40 again after a temporary bounce yesterday. Solana has now been in an oversold position for just over a month, a judging by previous dips it should be rebounding very soon. However, with a trade war now potentially starting, it may end up being several months before we see consistent rallies. Do I think Trump is leading us into a recession through his tariffs, posturing and erratic leadership? Yes. Yes I do. — Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) March 4, 2025 Assuming that Trump steps back from the brink and potentially negotiates the removal of tariffs, we could see the Solana price return to $200 in the next quarter, and hit $300 by Q4. New Alts Can Help Reduce Impact of Bear Market As weak as Solana looks right now, there are options for traders if they want to make above-average profits. There are several newer alts that look particularly promising, including a handful of presale tokens that already raised big amounts, suggesting that they could rally big once they list. One of these is Solaxy (SOLX), a Solana-based layer-two network that has now raised a very bullish $24.8 million in its ICO. Solaxy is the market’s first fully fledged Solana L2, and as such it will provide Solana users with lower fees and faster transaction speeds. It will help reduce the delays and dropped transactions that can still impair Solana’s performance, while it will also enable instant bridging between itself and its parent chain. Compatibility with other chains will also come over time, giving it a wide reach and potentially making it a major hub for meme tokens and DeFi. While its sale will end soon, you can still buy SOLX early by going to the Solaxy website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. SOLX is currently selling at $0.001652, although this price will rise later today and will continue to rise for the duration of the sale. As such, traders should move quickly, particularly if SOLX rockets upon listing in the next few weeks.

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped 9.3% over the past 24 hours and back below the $3 trillion mark. It currently stands at $2.83 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $207 billion – still higher than the $120bn-$180bn we’ve been seeing lately. Only two of the top 100 coins per market cap are up today. Fasttoken (FTN) and DeXe (DEXE) increased by 3.4%, 1.3%, and 0.9% to $1.75, $4.03, and $18.39, respectively. The biggest drop in this category is Sonic (S)’s 22% to $0.5154, followed by Ondo (ONDO)’s 21% to $0.8952. As for the top 10 coins, all are red today. Half of them have even recorded double-digit drops. The highest among these is 15.2% seen by Cardano (ADA) , now trading at $0.818. It’s closely followed by Solana (SOL) , which decreased by 14.2% to $135. The smallest decrease in this category is TRON (TRX)’s 2.4%, trading at $0.2364. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) fell 8.7% to $82,721, and Ethereum (ETH) dropped 10.3%, currently changing hands at $2,059. Trump’s Strategic Reserve Announcement Triggers Market Volatility – Derive.xyz The market experienced major volatility following the recent announcement by US President Donald Trump, according to Sean Dawson, Head of Research at the decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform Derive.xyz . Just days ago, Trump announced a US Federal strategic reserve that would include BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and ADA. All five of these coins jumped after the announcement. However, the rally was short-lived, Dawson said in an emailed comment. “Concerns about the lack of details in Trump’s proposal began to surface” and “key figures expressed concerns about non-BTC assets” like ADA being included in the reserve. The subsequent uncertainty led to a price correction, he said. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata BTC’s 7-day implied volatility jumped from 47% to 70%, while the 30-day volatility increased from 47% to 55%. “After the rally, volatility settled briefly but then spiked again as prices dipped,” Dawson writes. Meanwhile, the chance of ETH falling below $1,700 by the end of June has increased to 20%, and the chance of BTC dropping below $65,000 in the same period remains steady at 17%. “This market behavior highlights that while announcements like Trump’s strategic reserve can spark short-term excitement, the lack of clarity and follow-through can lead to rapid corrections,” Dawson said. “Volatility will likely remain high as traders navigate the uncertain year ahead.” You might also like Trump Crypto Reserve ‘Ridiculous’ and ‘Messed Up,’ Experts Say Libre Integrates with Injective to Launch a Wide Range of Products Libre , a fully on-chain infrastructure for regulated real-world assets ( RWA ), has announced the launch of its Web3 protocol for fund issuance and distribution on the Injective blockchain.

Tuần qua, BTC chao đảo cực mạnh, rơi tự do 18.4% xuống $78,617 trước khi bật lại. Nguyên nhân chính dẫn đến sự sụt giảm này là dòng tiền chảy ra kỷ lục từ các quỹ ETF Bitcoin , đạt đỉnh hơn $1.1 tỷ vào ngày 25/2, trong bối cảnh dòng vốn tổ chức suy yếu. Kể từ đáy tháng 11/2022 sau sự sụp đổ của FTX, các đợt điều chỉnh trong thị trường giá lên của Bitcoin thường dao động từ 18-22%, nhưng lần sụt giảm trong tháng 2 từ mức đỉnh lịch sử $109,590 vào tháng 1 đã mở rộng lên 28.3% – một trong những đợt giảm mạnh nhất kể từ khi thị trường giá xuống kết thúc. Biểu đồ tuần BTC/USD. (Nguồn: Bitfinex) Nhưng kịch căng vẫn chưa dừng lại! Ngày 2/3, Donald Trump bất ngờ công bố kế hoạch lập quỹ dự trữ crypto, tạo ra sự đảo chiều mạnh mẽ với mức tăng 20% từ đáy cục bộ và hơn 12% chỉ trong một ngày. Tuy nhiên, đợt bán tháo sau đó đã kéo Bitcoin trở lại quanh mức $92,000. Khi thông tin về quỹ crypto của Mỹ vẫn chưa rõ ràng, xu hướng BTC trong những tuần tới sẽ phụ thuộc lớn vào bối cảnh vĩ mô, đặc biệt là S&P 500. Nếu không có dòng tiền tổ chức quay lại, đà tăng bền vững có thể sẽ khá mong manh. Bức tranh kinh tế Mỹ tiếp tục đối mặt với nhiều thách thức. Lạm phát kéo dài, niềm tin tiêu dùng giảm, tăng trưởng chậm lại – tất cả đang gây áp lực lên Fed. Dữ liệu PCE tháng 1 cho thấy lạm phát tăng 2.5% so với cùng kỳ, vượt mục tiêu 2% của Fed. Dù chi tiêu hộ gia đình giảm sau kỳ nghỉ lễ, thu nhập cá nhân lại tăng 0.9% , giữ áp lực lạm phát ở mức cao. Thêm vào đó, chi phí dịch vụ và thuế nhập khẩu mới cũng có thể khiến Fed khó lòng cắt giảm lãi suất trong thời gian tới. Biến động chỉ số giá PCE hàng tháng (Nguồn: US Bureau of Economic Analysis) Tâm lý tiêu dùng cũng đang chạm đáy! Chỉ số niềm tin tiêu dùng tháng 2 giảm còn 98.3 – mức giảm mạnh nhất trong 3.5 năm qua. Thị trường lao động kém khả quan, nhiều người gặp khó trong tìm việc làm, và kỳ vọng về cơ hội việc làm mới cũng ít dần. Giá thực phẩm, nhà ở leo thang cùng các chính sách thương mại không chắc chắn đang khiến người dân ngày càng lo lắng hơn. Trong khi đó, kinh tế Mỹ chỉ tăng trưởng 2.3% trong quý 4/2024, chậm lại so với 3.1% của quý trước. Nguyên nhân chính? Thời tiết mùa đông khắc nghiệt, doanh số bán lẻ giảm, chính sách thương mại bất ổn. Mặc dù xuất khẩu và chi tiêu chính phủ vẫn hỗ trợ nền kinh tế, nhưng tiêu dùng và đầu tư kinh doanh lại suy yếu . Thâm hụt thương mại đạt kỷ lục $153.3 tỷ trong tháng 1, cho thấy nền kinh tế Mỹ vẫn đang đối mặt với nhiều thách thức. Nếu không có những điều chỉnh chính sách quan trọng, tăng trưởng đầu năm 2025 có thể tiếp tục ảm đạm. GDP thực tế, phần trăm thay đổi so với quý trước Thông báo của Trump về Kho dự trữ Crypto Chiến lược của Mỹ cho biết sẽ bao gồm các tiền điện tử lớn, như Bitcoin và Ethereum, tiếp sau lệnh hành pháp tháng Một của ông để làm rõ quy định về tiền điện tử đồng thời cấm tiền tệ kỹ thuật số của ngân hàng trung ương (CBDC). Động thái này xác nhận sự thay đổi lớn trong cách tiếp cận của chính phủ đối với tài sản kỹ thuật số, củng cố vị thế của Mỹ là quốc gia dẫn đầu toàn cầu về tiền điện tử trước Hội nghị thượng đỉnh Crypto của Nhà Trắng vào ngày 7 tháng 3. Cùng lúc đó, MetaMask đã thông báo kế hoạch tích hợp Bitcoin và Solana vào ví của mình. Người dùng sẽ sớm có thể tương tác với hai mạng này mà không cần thêm ví khác. Solana – nổi lên nhờ cơn sốt memecoin – sẽ được hỗ trợ từ tháng 5, còn Bitcoin dự kiến sẽ có mặt trong quý 3/2024. SEC vừa khẳng định hầu hết memecoin không thuộc phạm vi luật chứng khoán liên bang, vì chúng không tạo ra thu nhập hay phụ thuộc vào quản lý tập trung. Nhưng nếu dự án nào giả danh memecoin để lách luật hay có dấu hiệu lừa đảo, SEC vẫn sẽ mạnh tay xử lý. Điều này giúp mang lại sự rõ ràng trong quy định, nhưng cũng nhấn mạnh rủi ro của những dự án “lùa gà”. Trong khi đó, SEC tiếp tục trì hoãn quyết định về việc cho phép Cboe niêm yết hợp đồng quyền chọn cho ETF Ethereum, đẩy hạn chót sang tháng 5. Một quyết định tương tự với yêu cầu của Nasdaq ISE về quỹ iShares Ethereum Trust của BlackRock dự kiến sẽ có vào tháng 4. Nếu được thông qua, quyền chọn cho ETF ETH có thể là bước tiến lớn trong việc thu hút dòng tiền tổ chức, nhất là khi các spot ETH ETF đã thu hút hơn $11 tỷ tài sản ròng kể từ giữa năm 2024.

While investors are wondering whether the decline will continue, Ali Martinez, one of the well-known analysts of the cryptocurrency market, shared his expectations for BTC and XRP. The analyst warned that XRP is at risk of a major drop to $1. The analyst said that the bearish prediction is based on a head-and-shoulders pattern that has formed on XRP’s daily chart. Noting that $2 forms the neck of the pattern and acts as a strong support level, the analyst said that the decline in the last 24 hours forms a shoulder of the pattern. The analyst lastly said that a possible breakdown below $2 in XRP could trigger a decline and the price could drop to $1. What is the Critical Level for Bitcoin? The analyst also shared his Bitcoin analysis apart from XRP. Stating that the 50-week moving average has historically been important for the Bitcoin price, the analyst said that this level acts as a magnet for trend changes. Stating that this level for Bitcoin is $75,500, the analyst predicted that a possible recovery could occur from this level. *This is not investment advice.

41150854,https://finbold.com/?p=239853,1741103962,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"Two cryptocurrencies like XRP to turn $100 into $1,000 in 2025",https://finbold.com/two-cryptocurrencies-like-xrp-to-turn-100-into-1000-in-2025/,"In the opening days of March, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant degree of volatility. President Trump’s announcement of a crypto strategic reserve spurred on a sharp increase in digital asset prices on March 2. However, just a day later, the imposition of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China sent a shockwave throughout financial markets, as investors and traders rushed to lock in their profits amid a risk asset selloff . XRP has proven surprisingly resistant to these new challenges. On both a year-to-date (YTD) basis and in the last week, the token has outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ). XRP’s continued success proves that its focus on low-cost, high-speed transactions has secured both the confidence of investors and tangible, real-world utility. With that said, XRP is far from the only digital asset that has focused on utility. In fact, investing in some lesser-known competitors could reward investors with superior gains. Today, we’ll be taking a look at two cryptocurrencies like XRP — and why they’re on a solid track to deliver outsized returns in 2025. Stellar (XLM) Stellar ( XLM ) has historically mirrored XRP’s price action quite closely — but as of late, its price swings have been a tad more intense. However, this added degree of volatility is not necessarily a bad thing — at present, the cryptocurrency’s relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 36, inching toward oversold territory. Back in mid-February, Finbold’s artificial intelligence (AI) price prediction tool , leveraging various models, set an average price target of $0.330 for XLM for March 1. The prediction was almost right on the money — Stellar reached that price a day later, on March 2, and subsequently surged all the way up to $0.36052. The cryptocurrency did feel the sting of the recent market-wide pullback — by press time, XLM was trading at a price of $0.29038, after a 19.45% pullback. In the last 7 days, prices have increased by 6%, although year-to-date losses still stand at 16.97%. XLM price 1-week chart. Source: Finbold In spite of recent challenges, XLM remains in a strong position for a rebound and further growth in 2025. On February 19, Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon announced that the network is ‘feature complete’ for the next decade, and that the focus going forward would be on scaling. While the output of AI models (even advanced ones) cannot replace due diligence and personal research, it’s worth noting that OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicted that, under favorable conditions, XLM could reach prices as high as $1.75 to $2 by late 2025. If met, those forecasts would equate to a 502.65% and 588.75% rally, respectively. For readers interested in a more human touch, crypto analyst Javon Marks outlined a case for a rally to $0.681 in mid-January, as covered by Finbold . Marks is still confident that there is enough momentum for that price target to be reached. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera ( HBAR ), which also boasts high transaction speeds and low costs, is also an appealing alternative to XRP. Despite being launched 6 years after XRP, HBAR has managed to become a popular blockchain solution for numerous businesses because of its enterprise-grade governance model. The affordable token has seen prices decrease by 17.16% since the start of the year. At press time on March 4, HBAR was changing hands at a price of $0.23507, after a 29.65% surge on the weekly chart. Year-to-date losses stood at 16.63% at the time of writing. HBAR price 1-week chart. Source: Finbold In addition, Canary Capital filed for a spot Hedera exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) back in November, showcasing a significant degree of institutional interest in the token, not only in terms of utility, but as a speculative asset. Hedera’s relative strength index stands at an even-keeled 47 — indicating the absence of a strong trend. In late December, AI models set a price target of $0.50 to $0.75 for HBAR, citing the myriad use cases that Hedera secured in the realm of real-world asset tokenization (RWA). Those price targets imply a 112.70% and 219.05% upside compared to current prices.

Table of Contents Rollblock presale inflows reach new peak amid bullish sentiment XRP faces mixed market sentiment amid sluggish price action Cardano loses its gains as bears gain control Rollblock’s presale gathers momentum for next price surge The crypto market is heating up after a major announcement about the US strategic crypto reserve. XRP and Cardano saw dramatic price movements following the news, while Ethereum whales quietly accumulated a rising GameFi utility project – Rollblock. Rollblock’s presale has already attracted record-breaking inflows and strong investor interest in record time. Could this be the next big breakout in blockchain gaming? You might also like: Solana in consolidation as analysts expect Rollblock to make great returns Rollblock presale inflows reach new peak amid bullish sentiment Rollblock (RBLK) is recording massive capital inflows with its web3-powered GameFi ecosystem. Rollblock hosts over 7,000 exclusive games, all of which are backed on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain. Within a few months of its presale launch, Rollblock has already attracted over 50,000 early adopters and raised over $10.8 million with strong community and whale backing. Rollblock already witnessed over 10,000 new signups during February and analysts are anticipating an even bigger number for March. Every game in Rollblock’s ecosystem is licensed and regulated by the Anjouan E-gaming Authority. Unlike traditional platforms that have secret backdoors for bet manipulation, Rollblock uses a fully audited smart contract to process wagers and payouts with complete encryption. Rollblock recently integrated Google Pay, Apple Pay and Mastercard to make the signup process easier. New users can now deposit fiat currency to accumulate RBLK and start playing to win massive in-game payouts. RBLK holders can also lock their tokens for a predefined period to secure staking rewards with up to 30% APYs. These rewards are paid through Rollblock’s revenue sharing model which includes using up to 30% of the platform’s weekly revenue to repurchase RBLK on the open market. Of these, 60% are burned forever to increase scarcity, and the remaining 40% are used to fund the staking rewards. Currently, RBLK is selling for $0.06 during stage 10 of its presale. RBLK has already witnessed a 500% price surge during its presale, making analysts predict even bigger rallies as the limited token supply runs out. XRP faces mixed market sentiment amid sluggish price action XRP experienced a brief rally to $2.94 after Trump announced that the token would be a part of the newly established US strategic crypto reserve. Despite the bullish outlook, XRP failed to break out of its ascending triangle pattern as it faced rejection near the upper trendline. This pullback suggests a potential retest of the triangle’s lower boundary at $2.50 as traders liquidated their positions after the latest breakout attempt. Amid this mixed sentiment, analysts are anticipating an official end to the Ripple v. SEC case soon. According to James Murphy, a crypto legal advisor, Ripple might be delaying the dismissal to negotiate a better deal. If the case is dismissed and certain aspects of the ruling get vacated forever, XRP could witness new opportunities in 2025, including a potential XRP spot-ETF. At the time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.29 following an intraday decrease of 18%. XRP’s Momentum Indicator also shows bearish dominance, confirming the ongoing downward trend. Cardano loses its gains as bears gain control Cardano emerged as one of the biggest winners after Trump’s announcement, achieving its falling wedge breakout target and surging nearly 50% in a rapid rally toward $1.13. However, the sharp rise didn’t last for long as profit-takers stepped into the market. This decline comes after Cardano’s Relative Strength Index surpassed 70 which signals overbought conditions and a likely short-term correction. Cardano is currently selling for $0.7939 following an intraday decrease of 25%. Despite the pullback, Cardano is trading above its key Exponential Moving Averages on the ADA/USDT daily chart. If Cardano can hold above the critical support level at $0.75, ADA bulls may gain enough momentum to attempt another rally toward the $0.90 level. However, more profit-taking could extend Cardano’s crash to the $0.70 pivot level. Rollblock’s presale gathers momentum for next price surge As the crypto market navigates volatility, XRP and Cardano investors brace for the next big move that will make or break the future of these tokens. Meanwhile, Rollblock is gaining attention from Ethereum whales with its rapid adoption and deflationary tokenomics. With a presale price of just $0.06 and a 500% surge already recorded, the window to get in early is closing fast. Analysts are anticipating another price surge for RBLK within the next few days, making now the ideal time to invest and capitalize on the March Mayhem 30% referral bonus!

The analyzed indicator reveals an upward trend when prices move down due to DOGE having the potential to rise 208% if it breaks past the $0.22 resistance line. A combination of changing market sentiment with Fibonacci retracement levels points toward DOGE reaching $3 according to projections about its long-term value growth. An alternative cryptocurrency presents strong opportunities to surpass Dogecoin during the short-term market shift. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) proceeds into its second presale phase at $0.015 as market sentiment grows substantially because it ensures 400% profit and research analysts predict an 8,000% price increase following the listing. Dogecoin encounters multiple technological barriers The recent rise of Dogecoin to $0.20 during its 10% jump reflects market-wide elements that boosted Bitcoin for one day. The technical analysis community considers $0.18 to be the primary critical threshold for Dogecoin’s future market trends. Elevated goals for Dogecoin price movement could be achieved because its resistance position maintains continuity which points to $0.25 as an eventual target according to Fibonacci extension predictions. Technical indicators point toward moderate bullish signals because the RSI currently stands at 45 even though this measurement does not eliminate significant trading unpredictability. Market mood together with ETF developments create unpredictable price situations for the meme coin. For Dogecoin to reach $3 it needs to overcome different resistance obstacles while surpassing growth levels experienced by structured new token initiatives. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Outshines Speculative Plays Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become the new focus of investors who combine lending protocols with strategic tokenomics in a DeFi project. The second presale phase succeeded in generating $2 million through the acquisition of 3,800 tokens priced at $0.015. The initial participants joining MUTM will receive a 33% price increase when token values reach $0.02 in the upcoming phase. Revenue-driven buybacks function together with the initial listing price at $0.06 to give investors a direct path to potentially doubling their investment. Market analysts predict that MUTM will surpass $1.20 after launch because of its overcollateralized lending approach and mtTokens that generate interest as the token prices rise. Mutuum Finance provides a unique dual benefit that supports both long-term loyalty with its system rewards but also gives instant benefits to participants during the presale phase. Sustainable Growth Mechanisms Fuel MUTM’s Demand Mutuum Finance prevents speculative issues because it bases its value on genuine DeFi platforms. The mtTokens system works through user deposits of ETH or DAI where they obtain interest-bearing tokens that operate on multiple trading platforms. Peer-to-peer lending functionality enables the utility expansion of meme coins including Dogecoin through attraction of various borrowers. Platform revenue drives the buy-and-distribute system that buys MUTM tokens to provide them to staking participants. This system drives continuous market demand by controlling sales pressure which ensures ongoing sustainable development. The fast pace of phase two token sales leads to a decreasing period for token buyers to secure their tokens for the lowest possible cost. The anticipated $0.06 starting price and following price changes stimulate rapid purchases of MUTM from both present and future buyers. The sentiment tracker for Dogecoin serves as the initial access point for Mutuum Finance users to obtain high returns through DeFi protocols. The mutuum finance presale institution features a 900% price increase projection whereas doe users gain access to limited presale and launch cycles that create potential exponential returns. The project introduces a system that distributes $100,000 worth of prizes to attract early participants since this combined mechanism features both timing-oriented rewards and monetary payments. Fresh statistics in the crypto market confirm that profit-centered innovative blockchain systems achieve position as prime investment properties. Investing in Mutuum Finance through the pre-sale period ahead of their closing deadline will result in substantial investment returns for 2025. Take advantage of the present opportunity to buy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before phase two runs out of tokens. Many individuals invest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens by accessing the official platform at $0.015 to benefit from the proposed 400% increase in value.

While Bitcoin is down by over 10% on Tuesday, the rest of the crypto market cap has slid below $2.8 trillion. Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX, argues that Trump’s economic strategy could have a significant impact on Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Debt-Fueled Policies Could Ignite a Bitcoin Rally In his latest blog post , Hayes said that Trump’s approach to financing his “America First” policies will involve extensive debt issuance, which would require the Federal Reserve to increase money supply and lower interest rates. He noted that such conditions have been historically favorable for Bitcoin. Hayes also outlined how Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury Secretary, aims to restructure US debt by extending maturities and reducing yields. He sees this as a “soft default” that lowers real debt burdens. This, combined with Trump’s push to cut government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), may induce a recession, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to pivot toward monetary easing. The Fed, led by Jerome Powell, would then be expected to cut rates, halt quantitative tightening, and potentially restart quantitative easing – injecting trillions into the financial system. $1 Million Target Historically, aggressive monetary expansion has been bullish for Bitcoin. Hayes estimates that potential liquidity injections ranging between $2.74 trillion and $3.24 trillion could trigger a Bitcoin rally similar to the post-COVID surge, where the asset’s price multiplied 24 times despite the current struggle . Given BTC’s larger market capitalization today, Hayes projected a more conservative but still significant 10x increase, which could drive its price toward $1 million during Trump’s presidency. Bitcoin’s trajectory, according to Hayes, hinges on the interplay between Trump’s fiscal policies and the Federal Reserve’s response – both of which could set the stage for another major crypto bull run.

The proposal includes a structured AAVE buyback plan, redistribution of excess revenue, and upgrades to liquidity management. If approved, these changes will be implemented through a formal governance process. Aave DAO Governance Proposal and Key Objectives According to a release , Aave DAO has put forward a proposal focusing on optimizing the tokenomics of AAVE. The proposed measures include a structured AAVE buyback program, termination of the LEND token migration, and improvements to secondary liquidity management. The initiative aims to strengthen the financial structure of the protocol while ensuring sustainable growth. The proposal also introduces the Aave Finance Committee, which will be responsible for overseeing financial decisions and liquidity strategies. The committee will manage a weekly AAVE buyback program starting at $1 million, with provisions for expansion depending on financial conditions. If approved, the changes will progress through Snapshot voting before execution by the Aave Finance Committee. AAVE Buyback and Redistribution of Excess Revenue A key aspect of the proposal is the introduction of a “buy back and distribute” mechanism. Initially, Aave DAO plans to repurchase $1 million worth of AAVE each week. The buyback scale may increase based on the protocol’s financial performance. This strategy aims to enhance value for AAVE holders while improving overall liquidity. Additionally, the proposal outlines a new system for distributing excess revenue generated by the protocol. Instead of the previous model, Aave DAO suggests reallocating rewards in assets such as wETH, USDC, USDT, and AAVE. This approach is designed to ensure that stakers benefit directly from the protocol’s revenue stream. Introduction of Anti-GHO and Secondary Liquidity Upgrades The governance proposal also introduces Anti-GHO, a new non-transferable ERC20 token. Anti-GHO will be distributed to AAVE and StkBPT stakers, replacing the current GHO discount model. This adjustment is intended to create a more balanced and sustainable incentive system for users participating in the ecosystem. Moreover, the proposal outlines a plan to improve AAVE’s secondary liquidity management. The objective is to reduce the annual liquidity costs of approximately $27 million by transitioning towards a more efficient liquidity model. The new model will integrate staking mechanisms and active liquidity management to enhance stability while reducing costs. AAVE Price Jumps Following Announcement Following the release of the governance proposal, AAVE’s price experienced a notable increase. The token surged from approximately $174 to over $187, marking a rise of over 7%. As of press time, AAVE price is trading at around $186.69, reflecting a daily increase of 3.25%. AAVE/USD price chart (source: TradingView) According to the market trend, AAVE price is currently attempting to stabilize near the $180 support level. However, the AAVE price remains in a bearish trend, with resistance levels identified at $200 and $240. Despite this, technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) suggest that selling pressure is easing, potentially leading to a price rebound in the short term. In the meantime, Aave DAO’S next steps involve gathering community feedback before advancing to the Snapshot voting stage. If approved, the proposal will move to an on-chain governance vote before final execution.

However, I count myself among the few holdouts who don’t see the development as positive for either Bitcoin or the U.S. government itself. Here’s eight reasons why I don’t support the policy. What is easily done is easily undone If Bitcoiners want a reserve to last, they should want Trump to seek Congressional authorization for a purchase (as is customary for any large outlay). If it is done solely by executive fiat, the next administration will not feel bound by the policy and could trivially reverse it (and nuke the market in the process). If Bitcoiners sincerely believe it benefits the U.S. to acquire bitcoin and hold it for a long period of time, then they would have no issue insisting that the government pass a law authorizing spending for the Reserve, rather than having Trump enact the policy unilaterally. The fact that many Bitcoiners are hoping that Trump makes the policy without asking Congress for approval shows that they are chasing a short-term pump, rather than actually being sincere about the long-term value of the Reserve for the U.S. A future Democratic administration will have no qualms about immediately divesting the Reserve. The global reserve issuer should not disrupt itself The U.S. is the issuer of the global reserve currency. We still don’t know how the Crypto Reserve will be positioned – as simply an investment fund, or something more inherent to the dollar such as a new commodity-based currency system like the old gold standard. If the Crypto Reserve is contemplated as providing a new backing for the dollar, I believe this will cause significant unease in dollar and Treasury markets. Effectively, the government will be signaling that it believes it no longer has faith in the dollar system as it currently exists, and a radical change is needed. I imagine that this would cause already-high rates to rise, as the market starts to wonder whether the U.S. is contemplating a default on its debt. The government should be focused on shoring up investors’ faith in its ability to sustain its debt obligations by pursuing pro-growth and deficit-reducing policies, not toying with the entire structure of the dollar system. Many Bitcoiners don’t buy this line of reasoning and simply want to accelerate the collapse of the dollar. I view this as a kind of financial terrorism. I don’t believe in financial accelerationism nor do I think bitcoin – or any other cryptoasset – is ready to serve as the backing of a new commodity standard for the dollar. The U.S. already has plenty of exposure to Bitcoin American funds and individuals hold more Bitcoin than the citizens of any other country on the planet – almost certainly by a large margin. The U.S. government already benefits from this state of affairs. When Bitcoin goes up, those Americans who realize their gains owe taxes to the government – either 20% or 40% of their gains based on how long they have held the position. This is a meaningful point not to be overlooked. The U.S. already benefits when Bitcoin goes up, through tax realizations – more than any other country. In light of this, do we really need to pick a massive fight and insist that the U.S. government gain direct exposure for these assets, too? No one is pushing for the U.S. government to acquire Apple or NVIDIA stock. Why Bitcoin? There is no “strategic” value in a crypto reserve Generally, assets and commodities that the U.S. acquires at the government level are things that might be required in a pinch, and have to be accumulated ahead of time. The Petroleum Reserve is a good example, as oil is clearly an essential commodity, and in a crisis, we might not be able to acquire all the oil that we need. We also maintain reserves of other sorts of strategic assets, such as medical supplies and equipment, rare earth minerals, helium, metals like uranium and tungsten, and agricultural commodities. These all have a clear and obvious purpose: creating a reserve that can be dipped into in a time of emergency. We also stockpile foreign FX, in case we need to make interventions into currency markets, although these interventions are increasingly rare. There is no obvious strategic use for bitcoin (and certainly not Cardano or Ripple). Ordinary Americans do not need a “supply” of bitcoin or any other cryptoasset to support their quality of life. This might change if the entire financial system runs on a blockchain and we need the tokens for gas (the one analogous ""industrial” use I could think of), but that’s not the state-of-play today. The only “strategic” use for bitcoin is simply going “long” the asset at the state level and selling it later, but you could accomplish this with any other financial asset. There’s nothing unique about bitcoin (or any other cryptoasset) in this regard. Of course, if you’re going to ultimately back the dollar with bitcoin in some kind of neo gold standard, then it would have a strategic use (in which case you should refer back to point #2). But I don’t think that is the intent right now. A Crypto Reserve dilutes the value proposition of Bitcoin Mixing Bitcoin in with rival cryptoassets Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and XRP and giving them all an equal government imprimatur devalues Bitcoin and makes it look undifferentiated from these assets. Bitcoin is the only one of the bunch with a credible supply schedule and genuine decentralization at the protocol level. A crypto reserve confuses the issue and devalues Bitcoin in the public eye. Principled Bitcoiners should push for an all-or-nothing approach; either just Bitcoin, or no reserve. Bitcoin does not need the government I wonder what early libertarian Bitcoiners from 2012-16 would think of 2025 Bitcoiners pushing for the government to backstop the value of their coins. Beyond the confusing ideological evolution that the Bitcoin community has undergone, another point remains. Bitcoin has been one of the best performing investments in history, monetizing from nothing in 2009/10 to trillions of dollars in aggregate value in 2025. It has done all of this without government support, and, indeed, in many cases, despite overt hostility from powerful nation-states. A Crypto Reserve would transform bitcoin from an apolitical asset into the plaything of the government, subject to Washington’s political cycles. Bitcoiners were never ones to hitch their wagon to the government, and they shouldn’t start now. It would turn Americans against Bitcoiners Only a fraction (somewhere between 5-20%) of Americans own bitcoin, and even fewer own other cryptoassets. Many Bitcoiners are extremely wealthy due to their historical investments in the coin and others. At a time when government spending is under the microscope, using taxpayer dollars – regardless of how mechanically they are apportioned – to bolster the price of Bitcoin and other cryptoassets will be politically unpopular. Biden’s proposed student loan amnesty was met with great resistance, despite potentially applying to 43 million borrowers. Bitcoiners are a smaller bunch and even less in need of financial support from the government. This policy would undoubtedly cause an unnecessary backlash in broader society against the crypto community. It looks self-interested It’s no secret that Trump and his cabinet and inner circle have ownership in various cryptoassets. Trump himself has launched, or is affiliated with: an NFT project built on ETH, more than one memecoin built on Solana, and, of course, World Liberty Financial which holds an array of crypto assets. What we need from Trump is reasonable crypto policy, and based on his appointments at Treasury, Commerce, SEC, CFTC, OCC and others, it looks like he is delivering that. However, using government resources to directly increase the value of coins that Trump (and many in his inner circle) hold leaves a sour taste. Most of us in the crypto industry have simply been asking for reasonable policy and fair rules of the road so that we can do business in the U.S. Trump is proposing going much further than this and using taxpayer dollars to speculate on the coins themselves, potentially enriching himself and his associates. To Trump’s critics, this appears corrupt. It also makes the remainder of Trump’s pro-crypto policymaking and regulatory efforts look self-interested, rather than letting it stand on its own as good policy. A future administration could choose to throw the baby out with the bathwater, reversing all the progress the U.S. has made on crypto. The existence of the Reserve gives future regressive efforts an easy moral justification.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-04 16:07:53

Don’t be the one who “wished they got in early.” The mission is live. The presale is active. Pepe coin faces critical support amid price decline Pepe has seen a recent decline in its price. Over the past week, the price dropped by -11.60%. In the past month, it fell by -40.30%. However, over the last six months, the price is up by 13.59%. Currently, PEPE is trading between $0.0000075843 and $0.0000097533. The nearest support level is at $0.0000063326. If the price falls below this, it could signal further declines. The nearest resistance is at $0.0000106706. Breaking above this could indicate a potential price increase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.92. This suggests that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. It indicates a neutral position, leaving room for the price to move in either direction. Given the significant price drops over the past week and month, PEPE may face challenges in rising above the resistance level. To reach the resistance at $0.0000106706 from the current price, it would need to increase by approximately 41%. Conversely, if it falls to the support level at $0.0000063326, it would represent a decrease of about 19%. Conclusion Although PEPE and other meme coins have gained significant attention, their short-term potential appears limited. In contrast, Codename:Pepe sets itself apart by leveraging genuine artificial intelligence to help investors maximize profits in the meme coin market. By focusing on community-driven initiatives and AI-powered trading strategies, Codename:Pepe offers a unique opportunity for substantial gains. Its intelligent analysis and automated trading capabilities position it as a promising prospect in the current bullish climate.

Solana, in particular, shed over 45% due to the bearish sentiment that followed Trump's tariff war, pushing investors to search for better prospects. However, the Solana news shows telltale signs of a rebound, especially with the recent announcement of a strategic crypto reserve. Meanwhile, Panshibi has emerged as the dark horse amid the chaos with its propositions and AI meme revolution, making a compelling case for the best crypto to buy this year. After surging by 150% within a fortnight of its ICO launch, analysts believe this new crypto could deliver over 550% price gains in March. Let's dig in! Panshibi spearheads the March madness: A 550% price surge is on the horizon. While Solana’s resurgence is a noteworthy scene in the market sphere, its huge market cap and volatility make it less likely to deliver sizable gains for investors. However, Panshibi is crunching the numbers to bring massive ROI to its holders. The project has achieved really impressive numbers, an astronomical rise in demand, over $1.2M raised, and three stages already sold out, outperforming market giants like Solana in the same time frame. Analysts predict that the ongoing Panshibi presale will spearhead March Madness. The meme token is set to deliver a structured growth in value of about 550% before its official launch. This opportunity is for early investors hoping to profit from this controlled growth while the Solana price prediction continues to battle volatile market swings. So, what exactly does Panshibi bring to the table? Panshibi: Panda-themed token with true purpose Panshibi is a new meme token inspired by pandas, a symbol of cultural significance in Asia. The latest project aims to create a community-driven ecosystem that blends meme culture with tangible utility. Its highly engaging Social-Fi ecosystem allows market participants to earn rewards and embark on AI-driven quests and challenges. This interactive approach elevates community engagement to a new level while providing holders with additional incentives beyond traditional investment returns. Additionally, early investors gain access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club, which offers a range of benefits, such as priority entry into future projects and some amazing giveaways. Finally, among its offerings is a high APY staking model for holders of the native token, $SHIBI. This model offers annual percentage yields of up to 1,200%, enabling investors to grow their holdings over time while encouraging the ecosystem's long-term growth. Solana News: Solana’s path to $200 looks feasible as US crypto reserve fuels momentum Solana has been feeling the heat of the abrupt change in macroeconomic trends. Trump's tariff war pushed the PoH altcoin to a five-month low of $125. However, this week came with a decisive rebound from the gut-wrenching lows. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Solana recently experienced a sharp 24% rally to its current psychological zone of $180. This move coincides with US President Donald Trump's hint at the possibility of a strategic crypto reserve. Trump disclosed the plan in a Sunday post on Truth Social, his social media platform. In the post, he indicated that a presidential working group had been directed to advance the creation of the reserve. In addition to Solana, OG tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Cardano jumped within hours of the announcement. This bull run has captured the attention of traders around the globe, most of whom were left out of the speculative move. Ali Martinez identified a breakout from a descending parallel channel that could push Solana's price to $213. Trump's pro-crypto moves and speculation around a potential ETF approval have shot up investors' optimism and institutional interest. Conclusion While the Solana news hints at a further spike to $200 in March, the spotlight shines on Panshibi’s 550% price rally, which is primed to happen sooner than expected. Beyond price gains, the new meme-driven crypto presale integrates Social-Fi and AI elements, allowing token holders to compete in quests for rewards. Investors are already flocking to this new project, which has amassed over $1.2 million in investment in a little over one month.

A new system called Anti-GHO would replace the current GHO discount model, allowing stakers to reduce debt or earn rewards. The proposal suggests adjustments to AAVE’s secondary liquidity incentives to maintain efficiency while lowering costs. A buyback program is also included, with governance allocating funds to purchase AAVE from the market and direct it to the ecosystem reserve. Aave governance has introduced a proposal to update its tokenomics, focusing on AAVE staking rewards, revenue redistribution, secondary liquidity management, and the deprecation of LEND. After half a decade of hard work, with the ACI, we're proud to present the updated Aavenomics proposal to the Aave DAO. We consider it the most important proposal in our history, feel free to have a read and provide feedback. Just Use Aave. https://t.co/nBhr5Q6hQB — Marc “Billy” Zeller (@lemiscate) March 4, 2025 A governance post published by Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) founder Marc Zeller on March 4 details the first phase of implementing the Aavenomics update. Governance Proposal Seeks to Implement Aavenomics Update The proposal follows the previous update approved in August 2024 and introduces structural changes affecting AAVE holders and liquidity providers. According to the post, Aave’s market share has increased every quarter for the past two years. The protocol has also built up significant cash reserves, allowing it to finance updates without depending on token-based incentives. The proposal includes the creation of an Aave Finance Committee (AFC), a governance-backed entity tasked with treasury management and revenue allocation. The AFC would oversee funds held in Aave’s collector contracts and manage liquidity targets. Aave’s Financial Position and Proposed Adjustments A key element of the plan introduces Anti-GHO, a non-transferable ERC20 token designed to replace the existing GHO discount model. Anti-GHO would be distributed to AAVE and StkBPT stakers and could be either burned at a 1:1 ratio against GHO debt or converted into StkGHO. The protocol’s financial reserves have increased since the Aavenomics approval, despite a downturn in interest rates. The proposal states that the protocol maintains dominance in lending revenue, allowing it to fund incentives with stable assets rather than issuing native tokens. The post notes that competing platforms have limited cash reserves and rely on token-based incentives. Aave’s ability to offer incentives in stable assets, rather than relying on native token emissions, is positioned as an advantage in the current market environment. A revision to the secondary liquidity incentives is also proposed. The current system allocates approximately $27 million per year toward maintaining secondary market liquidity. The proposal argues that an alternative approach could sustain liquidity while reducing costs. A buyback and distribution program is also part of the update. Under this model, governance would allocate funds to purchase AAVE on secondary markets. The plan suggests an initial $1 million per week buyback for six months, with adjustments based on treasury reports and overall budget considerations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): What is the purpose behind Anti-GHO token adoption? Stakers will have more freedom with GHO’s discount mechanism given by Aave’s revamping effort through Anti-GHO tokens. Rather than being fixed to a discount system, these tokens can be either burned to lower GHO debt or turned into StkGHO, which makes staking more flexible and could enhance participation. Who or what is the Aave Finance Committee (AFC)? The Aave Finance Committee (AFC) will have the responsibility of supervising the treasury, giving strategy to liquidity objectives and budget spendings on security and growth of the protocol. The committee’s consolidation of financial authority is intended to expedite decision making as well as revenue allocation in aid of Aave’s strategic objectives. In what way does the buyback and distribution program affect the value of AAVE? Aave’s buyback program aims at lowering the circulating supply of AAVE tokens in the market. As AAVE gets repurchased from the secondary markets, its value may increase due to reduced supply which also benefits long term holders who wish to sell the token. Why is there any benefit to the change in structure of the secondary liquidity incentive? The aim is to achieve an equality in liquidity with decreased incentive spending, if not increasing, dependin. The restructuring incentive strategy to liquidity providers is expected to improve capital efficiency and thus help strengthen the protocol’s over.

The current price ranges between $0.1992 and $0.26, showing market volatility. Technical indicators suggest possible future movements. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are $0.22 and $0.21, indicating consolidation. The RSI is at 48.15, close to neutral. The Stochastic is 14.29, suggesting the coin might be oversold. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.001379, hinting at potential upward momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.28. Breaking this could see a rally toward $0.3475, a potential increase of over 25%. On the downside, support lies at $0.16. Falling below this might push the price toward $0.0959, a decline of more than 30%. The coin’s direction depends on market sentiment and buying pressure. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced significant price changes recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 8.73%, while the past month saw a decrease of 25.34%. However, looking at the last six months, SHIB’s price increased by 7.87%. These fluctuations indicate a volatile market for the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. The current price of SHIB ranges between $0.00001357 and $0.00001613. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00001712, and the nearest support level is at $0.00001200. If the price breaks above the resistance level, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.00001968, presenting potential gains.

The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00001427, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.00001399. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.75, suggesting that SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 14.25, which may indicate oversold conditions and a potential price rebound. The MACD level is negative at -5.896e-9, reflecting bearish momentum. Based on these indicators, SHIB’s price could either rebound from current support levels or continue its downward trend.

Official Trump has slipped below $12.50, but some analysts believe a resurgence could be on the horizon. The Major Collapse The brief pump in the cryptocurrency sector on March 2 and the early hours of March 3 was abruptly suspended by another huge correction . The massive volatility was likely caused by Donald Trump’s actions. First, the American president confirmed that his administration will move forward with the plans to establish a strategic crypto reserve that will include leading assets like BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, and SOL. The involved cryptocurrencies and the entire market reacted more than positively to the news. On March 4, though, some of the previously announced trade tariffs came into effect . From today, the US will slam Canada and Mexico by 25% on most imported stocks, while Canadian energy will be the subject of a 10% duty. The escalating trade war had a negative effect on the financial markets and the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled below $83,000, while Ethereum (ETH) sank to a 16-month low. The meme coin sector was not spared and is also covered in red. Trump-themed memes, such as Official Trump (TRUMP), MAGA (TRUMP), MAGA: Fight for Trump (TRUMPCOIN), and others are among the biggest losers, nosediving by double digits in the past 24 hours. It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned tokens were at the forefront of gains over the past several months. Official Trump peaked above $72 hours after its launch in January this year, whereas its market capitalization skyrocketed to a whopping $14.5 billion. Thus, it briefly became the second-biggest meme coin, trailing only behind Dogecoin (DOGE). Currently, the asset trades at less than $12.50, representing an 82% collapse from the all-time high and an 18% decline on a 24-hour basis. TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko MAGA (TRUMP) was among the market’s top performers last summer. In June 2024, its price exploded beyond $17, while the market cap neared $800 million. Over the past months, it has been on an evident downtrend, and as of the moment of writing these lines, it hovers at a mere $0.32 (a 98% crash from the peak level). The huge pullback of these assets showcases the volatile nature of the meme coin sector, which can cause crucial losses to inexperienced investors. Those about to enter the ecosystem should do proper research beforehand and invest only as much as they are ready to lose. Meanwhile, these particular tokens related to Donald Trump are expected to witness additional volatility in the near future since they often react to announcements or actions taken by America’s leader. Is TRUMP’s Comeback in the Cards? Despite TRUMP’s recent negative performance, some industry participants believe a comeback is not out of the question. The X user CryptoELITES set $25 and $45 as short-term targets, envisioning an eventual rally to as high as $75. Others, on the other hand, have previously criticized the asset’s existence. Balaji Srinivasan (the former CTO of Coinbase) claimed that such tokens only damage the reputation of the crypto sector instead of legitimizing it. The American billionaire Mark Cuban shared a similar thesis, opining that the introduction of Trump’s meme coin is nothing but harmful to the industry. “This is the biggest bunch of self-serving Bullsh*t I have ever heard. In your world, there is no ownership. Just speculation,” he said.

While Solana news has captured attention, investors are looking beyond SOL for bigger gains. Panshibi (SHIBI) , the latest meme coin sensation, is nearing the end of its presale with predictions of a 100x explosion post-launch. With only days left before prices rise, early investors are scrambling to secure their SHIBI tokens. Solana Eyes $200 After Breaking Key Resistance Levels Solana (SOL) just got a major boost after U.S. President Donald Trump’s bombshell announcement sent shockwaves through the crypto space. Following his statement about the potential inclusion of cryptocurrencies in a national reserve strategy, Solana’s price skyrocketed by 25%, breaking through recent resistance levels. Investors who had been hesitant are now jumping back in, betting that this political shift could accelerate institutional adoption of SOL. Before this surge, Solana had been struggling to maintain stability, with its price swinging between $140 and $178 . A sharp dip below $150 in late February had traders on edge, but the market quickly rebounded as bargain hunters rushed to scoop up SOL at discounted prices. By February 28, the token had already recovered 16%, and momentum hasn’t slowed since. Analysts now expect Solana to retest the $200 mark if the buying pressure continues. Beyond the political catalyst, Solana’s technical indicators have also played a role in this rally. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hit its lowest level since 2023, signaling an oversold condition that traders interpreted as a buying opportunity. Institutional investors have also increased their exposure to SOL, believing that the blockchain’s speed and low fees will continue to make it a dominant player in DeFi. Solana Recovers But Panshibi Steals The Spotlight With Its Explosive Growth While Solana regains ground, a new contender is quietly stealing the spotlight. Panshibi(SHIBI) , the panda-powered meme coin, is shaking up the market with a presale that’s rapidly selling out. With just days left before its price jumps, investors are scrambling to lock in their positions before SHIBI becomes the next viral sensation. Unlike typical meme coins that ride on hype alone, Panshibi is bringing innovation to the space. With a staking model offering up to 1,200% APY, SHIBI holders can earn serious passive income while being part of an expanding ecosystem. Security is airtight, with a full audit from Coinsult and a liquidity lock for 10 years. These features ensure long-term stability, preventing the usual rug-pull concerns that plague many meme projects. With over $1.2 million raised in its presale and a price still at a bargain $0.005, Panshibi’smomentum is undeniable. As each stage sells out, the price edges closer to its anticipated launch valuation of $0.026, promising early investors an instant 5x gain before it even hits major exchanges. Analysts predict a potential 100x explosion post-listing, fueled by its strong community and strategic market positioning. Solana And Panshibi Lead The Market With Explosive Growth Potential Solana news has reinvigorated the broader crypto market, but Panshibi is offering something even more compelling: a fresh narrative, real-world impact, and the kind of gains that meme coin investors dream of. As SHIBI’s presale nears its final few weeks, those looking for the next big opportunity are acting fast. With major exchange listings and NFT integrations on the roadmap, Panshibi could be the next unstoppable force in the crypto space. For investors seeking a blend of viral appeal, strong fundamentals, and massive growth potential, Panshibi is the clear choice. With time running out and prices set to increase, securing a spot in this presale might just be the smartest move of 2025.

Observing a handful of positive trends, key figures have outlined their bullish expectations for Bitcoin in March. Pseudonymous crypto trader and investor DaanCrypto highlights Bitcoin’s chances at making a full comeback. “With BTC at $80K, the upside potential will be more attractive to sidelined capital again. E.g. The $150K level is something that has been discussed a lot. That’s almost a 100% gain from this point. Compared to a ~50% move just a week earlier.” He wrote. The risk/Reward ratio is also notably promising, courtesy of the recent market dump. As Dan remarks, assets are 20% cheaper. Long-term holders are expected to increase their investments, while a new entry point opens up for newbies. Affirming the bullish sentiments, analyst Miles Deutscher reminds the market that March has historically been an excellent month for Bitcoin, adding that the asset typically averages a 13.12% around this time. “This makes it [March] the third strongest month of the year after October and November. Seasonality should be taken with a grain of salt, but it’s still something to consider.” Deutscher wrote. Bitcoin sustains momentum above $85,000 as market optimism heightens On February 28, Bitcoin sustained heavy losses as the asset plunged below the $80,000 price mark. Some market players received the new development as a bottom signal, as liquidations surpassed $680 million. It bears mentioning that Bitcoin had previously recorded massive losses in March, as prices fell by 17.5%, marking the largest monthly loss recorded since 2022. The asset hit a three-month low of $78,273 before retesting previous support levels. After finding support at $78,100 last week, the bulls pushed prices up to $90,320, a crucial point that sent the asset to a $94,204 high before it experienced a mild downward reversal. Bitcoin has successfully secured 10% in daily gains. With daily trading volume soaring up by 193.33%, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $85,412, a few thousand dollars away from its all-time high of $109,114.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-04 17:49:56

He reprimanded China’s business model, saying it is centered on exports, which is unacceptable in his country. In a Fox News interview, United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the government is set on lowering interest rates. The US dollar remains under selling pressure even after the government official’s statement. Bessent says the government is set on bringing rates down US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed his optimism about President Donald Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on foreign nations. Bessent commented on the stock markets as investors reacted to Trump’s implementation of the tariffs on Tuesday against Mexico and Canada. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says, ""We're set on bringing interest rates down."" pic.twitter.com/1E64nwl50V — Radar 𝘸​ Archie🚨 (@RadarHits) March 4, 2025 Bessent highlighted that Wall Street had done well and it would continue doing great. He, however, noted that they had to focus on small businesses and consumers. The Treasury Secretary insisted that they had to rebalance the economy to achieve this. Bessent argued there would be a transitional period that would last two months after the tariff’s implementation. He suggested it would only last briefly as China’s manufacturers would absorb the tariffs. The government official added that China’s model was unacceptable and mainly centered around exports. Bessent argued that the market selloff was temporary and that the prices would not increase in the long term. He reiterated that with Canada and Mexico, the US economy was in the middle of a transition, noting that Honda’s move to Indiana was a great start. On Tuesday, Trump implemented his trade tariffs against Mexico and Canada, imposing 25% taxes on all imports. The president revealed the tariffs were meant to force the two US neighbor states to curb fentanyl trafficking and immigration. Trump noted that he wanted to eliminate America’s trade imbalances and encourage more factories to relocate to the country. The US stock market responded to his announcement on Monday, with the S&P 500 index registering a 2% decline. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed his optimism on the tariffs, noting that they could boost US manufacturing and attract foreign investment. He said that computer chipmaker TSMC had expanded its investment in the US due to the 25% tariffs. In February, Trump announced that he would impose an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, double the 20% tariff imposed on the country’s goods in January. The president delayed the implementation of the tariffs for a month, citing concessions from Canada and Mexico. Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Trump’s statement, saying they were implementing measures to curb immigration and trafficking on its borders. Economists warn Trump’s tariffs could disrupt businesses On Monday, Trump announced that there was “no more room” for Mexico and Canada to evade the tariffs. Trudeau commented there was no justification for Trump’s tariffs since US citizens would also pay more for gas and groceries. He added that Americans could also lose thousands of jobs as a result. The prime minister insisted the tariffs would disrupt the trading relationship between the countries and violate the trade agreement negotiated by Trump in his last term. Trudeau announced that Canada would also impose a 25% trade tariff on American goods worth $155 billion Canadian ($107 billion) in the next 21 days. He added that the country would begin with tariffs on goods worth $30 billion. Bessent highlighted that Mexico had offered to impose 20% taxes on all imports from China during its negotiations with the US. Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, commented that the tariffs would disrupt businesses in terms of their supply chains and their ability to conduct their operations effectively. He predicted inflationary impacts that would be disruptive in the long run. Trump also announced he planned to introduce reciprocal tariffs in April to match the rate charged by other countries, including any subsidies and VAT.

Meanwhile, gold cemented its status as a traditional safe haven asset, rising to $2,915 an ounce today, approaching last week's record high of $2,950. While gold's rise signals investors' growing demand for stability amid economic uncertainty, analysts argue that Bitcoin has yet to fulfill its role as a reliable hedge. “Bitcoin has never really been a safe haven asset, merely an aspirational asset,” Uldis Teraudklans, Chief Revenue Officer at Paybis, said in a statement. “Nevertheless, the promise remains and every cycle critics revisit this so-called ‘failure,’ but my perspective is that BTC has consistently been a risk asset.” Teraudklans also suggested that BTC’s long-term trajectory could still lead it to safe haven status, but only when its market cap rivals that of gold can its role as a reliable hedge be fully appreciated. Related News: Bitcoin Price Decline Dominates, Ethereum Saw Below $ 2,000 - What Causes the Decline? Here is the Latest Situation André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise, also noted Bitcoin’s short-term volatility. “In the very short term, Bitcoin appears to be most sensitive to changes in the global growth outlook, which has certainly deteriorated recently,” Dragosch said. “However, in the medium to long term, BTC remains a major contender for the world’s next reserve asset and should also benefit from the return of easy monetary policy should a U.S. recession truly occur.” The Trump administration’s tariff policies have further added to market uncertainty. Recent announcements include tariffs on goods from China, global tariffs on aluminum and steel, and threats of 25% tariffs on EU imports. “US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcement has shaken markets and increased economic uncertainty,” said BullionByPost General Manager Pete Walden. “Gold, the ultimate safe-haven asset, has benefited tremendously as investors seek protection from uncertainty.” *This is not investment advice.

The SEC has dropped several big-name crypto enforcement actions this year, including lawsuits against Coinbase , Kraken , MetaMask and investigations into Robinhood and OpenSea . Attorney James “MetaLawMan” Murphy theorizes that the SEC’s unexplained delay in dismissing the Ripple case could be because the firm “is negotiating hard to get the SEC to agree to vacate some or all of Judge Torres’ decision.” The SEC first sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. In 2023, District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged. The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sales of XRP directly to institutional buyers were securities offerings. The crypto legal expert Jeremy Hogan agrees with Murphy’s theory, noting that the delay in dismissing the case is likely due to the injunction in Torres’ ruling. “The court enjoined Ripple from (basically) making sales directly to customers. There are workarounds for that, but obviously Ripple would rather not have the injunction at all! So, assuming the SEC is willing to work on this with them, the issue is this: once a court issues an injunction, the parties themselves can’t simply agree between them to disregard the injunction! Trust me, many men have gotten in legal trouble by thinking that since they got back with their girlfriend, they could ignore the restraining order (a type of injunction) against being within 200 feet of her. So, how do you dissolve an injunction? It’s not simple, which is why I think the case doesn’t resolve until April-May whereas all these other cases have already been dismissed.” Hogan also explains what he thinks Ripple needs to do to get the injunction dissolved. “Ripple only has one shot at getting the injunction dissolved with the trial court so it will have to draft a very carefully worded motion. That takes time and the SEC will basically have to sign off on it – more complication. Once that is agreed to, both parties stip to dismiss their appeals and then Ripple files its motion with the trial court. And then the judge has to rule on the motion which can also take some time. That’s how I see it playing out and that’s why I think May is the month – although I could see the appeals being dismissed in April, prior to Ripple’s brief due date.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Priced at just $0.18, DTX could stand out with the potential to match Dogecoin’s impressive 2,500% rally. As its presale nears completion, early investors have a limited opportunity to secure DTX before its value surges from $0.18 to $0.36, delivering an instant 2X return. With market sentiment shifting toward high-growth assets, DTX Exchange is emerging as a compelling investment for 2025. Can DTX Exchange Replicate Dogecoin’s 2,500% Rally in 2025? While the Dogecoin price faces volatility, investors are eyeing DTX Exchange as a potential high-growth alternative. With its final presale round nearing completion, DTX is currently priced at $0.18, but its listing price is set at $0.36, offering early investors an immediate 2X gain. This means a $100 investment in DTX today can double to $200 upon listing on major exchanges. However, experts think DTX could potentially rival Dogecoin’s 2,500% rally considering the tremendous growth that makes it a compelling opportunity for 2025. With $15.2 million already raised, its growth potential looks strong. For DTX to achieve a 2,500% gain, it would only need a tiny fraction of Dogecoin’s 31B market cap, around 7%, which is less than one-tenth of DOGE’s current valuation. One standout feature of DTX is the VulcanX blockchain, which, based on recent testnet results, can process 200,000 transactions per second. This high-speed capability could ensure seamless trade execution, even during peak market activity, eliminating delays for users. DTX Exchange prioritizes security with quantum-proof technology to protect user assets. Passing SOLIDProof’s KYC process further reinforces its safety for trading. In addition, the platform will grant access to 120,000 asset classes, including crypto, forex, ETFs, and more. This vast selection enables traders to diversify their portfolios and minimize risk exposure across different markets. Meme Coin Market Decline: Impact on the Dogecoin Price The meme coin market, including Dogecoin, peaked at $137 billion in December 2024 but plunged 59% to $56.2 billion due to scandals like Libra coin’s collapse. As of February 27, 2025, Dogecoin trades at $0.20. Over the past month, the DOGE token faced over 36% decline, driven by market factors such as a major security breach, where hackers drained $1.4 billion from Bybit’s cold wallet, triggering increased selling pressure. Source: CoinMarketCap Overall, Dogecoin continues to navigate a complex market landscape, balancing between increased institutional adoption and the inherent volatility of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, DTX, with its utility-driven ecosystem and advanced blockchain, could offer a stronger, more sustainable investment than meme coins like Dogecoin. Analysts predict the $0.18 ERC-20 token could surpass Dogecoin’s 2,500% rally. How Ethereum’s Upgrades Could Shaping Its Future As press time, the Ethereum price stands around $2,330, reflecting over 4% decrease from the previous close. Despite this downturn, the Ethereum price remains a key focus for investors as the ecosystem demonstrates resilience through strategic developments. Source: CoinMarketCap On February 3, validators approved an increase in Ethereum’s gas limit, the first adjustment since 2021, aiming to enhance scalability and transaction efficiency. This decision could positively impact the Ethereum price by improving network efficiency. Additionally, the Pectra upgrade in early 2025 includes 20 EIPs to enhance scalability, security, and user experience. Analysts predict it could impact the Ethereum price, boosting investor confidence. As anticipation grows, the Ethereum price may see significant movement. With these developments, market observers are closely watching the Ethereum price for signs of stability and growth in the coming months. However, DTX, an ERC-20 token, offers a high-speed blockchain, diverse assets, and a guaranteed 2X gain opportunity, making it an excellent option for investors seeking big gains. Conclusion With Dogecoin facing market volatility and the Ethereum price remaining a key focus amid network upgrades and market shifts, DTX’s potential for a 2,500% rally stands out as a compelling opportunity for investors seeking substantial gains in 2025. With the presale ending soon, investors can secure DTX Exchange at $0.18 before it jumps to $0.36 for an instant 2X return. The bonus phase adds to its appeal amid market shifts.

With increasing adoption in DeFi and beyond, LINK’s price action is reflecting strong investor confidence. Meanwhile, the Stellar price has jumped 9%, bouncing off key support and sparking discussions about its next move. With the market as volatile as ever, many are looking for a more steady way to earn. That’s why mobile mining is gaining traction, and the BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s X1 Miner App is at the forefront.

No expensive rigs, no energy-intensive setups—just a straightforward way to earn. Chainlink Surge Signals Growing Demand for Oracle Solutions The recent Chainlink surge highlights the growing importance of decentralised oracle solutions in the crypto market. These solutions act as bridges between blockchain networks and real-world data, enabling smart contracts to interact with external information securely and reliably. Chainlink, with its secure and tamper-proof oracle services, has positioned itself as a leader in this space. Its native token, LINK, currently holds the 13th spot by market capitalisation, trading at $14.86. Investor interest has intensified, with trading volume rising by 34.49% in just 24 hours. This Chainlink surge reflects increasing confidence in its long-term potential, as innovations like off-chain computation and cross-chain interoperability continue to enhance its real-world utility. Stellar Price Gains 9% as Market Sentiment Turns Bullish The recent Stellar price increase of 9% highlights growing investor interest as the cryptocurrency rebounds from key support at $0.286. This upward movement follows a 17% rise over the past two days, reinforcing positive market sentiment. The altcoin’s trading volume has surged by 66%, reflecting strong participation and liquidity. However, resistance at $0.348 remains a crucial hurdle, with traders watching closely for a breakout. If the Stellar price continues its current trajectory and surpasses resistance levels, it may pave the way for sustained bullish momentum in the near term. 500K+ Users Join BlockDAG’s X1 App for Passive Income The crypto market can be unpredictable, as seen with the recent Stellar and Chainlink surge. Prices move fast, creating both opportunities and uncertainty. That’s why many crypto enthusiasts are turning to mining—mobile mining in particular. Why? Because it offers a way to earn without worrying about price swings or expensive hardware. BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App makes this even easier, letting users mine BDAG with just a tap once a day. No costly setups, no complicated processes. This ease-of-use has brought in over 500K+ people to the app, helping them earn passively straight from their smartphones. Users can mine 20 BDAG per day through the X1 App, making it an accessible way to accumulate crypto with minimal effort. In a market where volatility can make investing unpredictable, this passive earning model provides a steady way to build holdings. With its low-risk, energy-efficient approach, it’s easy to see why many consider the X1 Miner as the best crypto mining app for both iOS and Android . The BDAG coins mined through the X1 App aren’t just numbers on a screen—they hold real potential. BDAG’s presale has already raised over $200.5 million, with more than 18.7 billion coins. Starting at $0.001 in Batch 1, BDAG has climbed to $0.0248 in the ongoing Batch 27, recording a massive 2380% price surge. Some projections suggest it will reach $1 this year, making every mined BDAG even more valuable over time. As adoption of X1’s mobile mining model continues to grow, so does interest in BDAG itself. Looking Ahead As the Chainlink surge reflects growing demand for oracle solutions, LINK’s innovations in off-chain computation and cross-chain interoperability could drive further adoption. Meanwhile, the Stellar price jump signals strong investor interest, though breaking key resistance will determine its next move. With market uncertainty still a factor, many are turning to more stable earning opportunities—and BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App is leading the charge. Over 500K users are already earning BDAG effortlessly. With its presale raising $200.5M and prices up 2380% since Batch 1, BlockDAG remains one of the most profitable altcoins in the market today. Once BDAG reaches its $1 projections, today’s mined coins could be worth far more—making it the best crypto mining app today.

Ripple fans are calling this one of the biggest wins with XRP right up there with Bitcoin and Ethereum in institutional portfolios. While XRP ETF is making headlines, another ERC-20 token DTX Exchange is quietly killing it with a 540% surge in 2 months. With distinct features and institutional backing, DTX Exchange might be the 2025 winner. XRP ETF Approval on the Horizon Approval of an XRP Spot ETF would be historic for Ripple and its stakeholders. Financial institutions are bracing themselves for regulators' possible green light, which can unlock billions of institutional funds, Bybit says. An ETF would then make it even easier for institutional investors to get access to XRP without having to undergo direct crypto custody. Even as this is bullish for XRP, some are warning that most of this is likely already in the price. Further, perpetual regulatory risks concerning Ripple's battle with the SEC linger to put a shadow on the long-term prospects. Hence, whales and wealthy investors are scanning the horizon for the next giant crypto upsurge, away from XRP. DTX Exchange: The ERC-20 Coin That's Dominating As XRP waits for approval of an ETF, DTX Exchange has been creating a stir with its highly developed decentralized exchange platform. While most exchanges use a centralized strategy, DTX uses a decentralized one, offering users security and transparency. It cuts out intermediaries, where traders can directly own their assets. Over 700,000 wallet holders and $15.5 million in presale traction already are part of the hybrid DTX Exchange initiative. DTX is a utility token specifically developed to fuel a decentralized trading platform where customers can trade tokenized assets such as equities, commodities, forex, and ETFs. This distinctive capability bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance by giving investors exposure to multiple markets under a single umbrella. Compared to centralized exchanges, DTX is completely non-custodial, and users own their assets fully. Smart contracts automate trades, making transactions quicker and eliminating counterparty risks. DTX Exchange is also set for dual exchange listings, becoming more accessible and sought after. Users can also stake DTX tokens to earn passive income, promoting long-term holding. With a history of 540% returns and a projected listing value far beyond its presale amount, DTX has the ability to be among the top cryptocurrencies of 2025. DTX Exchange Shining Brightly 540% Profits According to the most recent updates, DTX Exchange has already surged 540% in the past two months and is one of the best-performing altcoins of 2025. Despite the sudden surge in value, experts opine that the token still has enough space to keep growing. At a current presale price of just $0.18 and an estimated listing price of $0.36, early investors could double their money on launch. Investors looking for high-growth potential in 2025 are already queuing up for DTX. The increasing adoption of the platform, combined with its new-school vision for decentralized trading, obviously puts it ahead of old-timers such as XRP. Conclusion While XRP's ETF approval is noteworthy, DTX Exchange has already demonstrated the ability to deliver behemoth returns. Its decentralized exchange architecture, AI technology, and dual listing on exchanges position it well to be 2025's top-performing asset. Make the most of this chance before the DTX platform launches. Invest in the top crypto of 2025 using the promo code 'LIST2X' to receive 100% bonus tokens on all deposits.

This case has been a source of conflict for some time. According to reports, it is focused on content posted by SINA that Sun claimed was harmful and damaging to his reputation. Justin Sun To Get Apology From SINA According to the filing, the court decided that SINA must remove all harmful content linked to the case. The court also ordered SINA to publish a public apology to Sun for 72 hours on their platform, admitting the damage caused by the false statements. This ruling shows how important it is to protect people’s reputations in the growing online world, especially for well-known figures in tech and cryptocurrency. Additionally, the court ordered SINA to pay Sun 20,000 RMB for emotional distress, with extra fees related to the case. This brought SINA’s total financial fee to over 30,000 RMB. As online platforms increasingly influence public opinion, the Beijing Internet Court’s ruling highlights the importance of accountability in the digital space. China Takes Stance Against Blockchain Cybercrimes Meanwhile, China’s highest prosecutorial authority, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate (SPP), announced measures to address the escalating cybercrimes . The SPP’s action comes in response to a surge in online fraud, cyber violence, and personal information infringement. The SPP report outlined eight instances where prosecutorial bodies enforced laws to combat cybercrimes and advocated for comprehensive cyberspace management . This move comes as blockchain cybercrimes have increased significantly, with criminals leveraging cryptocurrencies to launder money, posing challenges to authorities. As such, Zhang Xiaojin, director of the Fourth Procuratorate of the SPP, cautioned citizens and digital space participants about investment scams prevalent in the local crypto economy. China’s Crackdown on Digital Assets China’s strict enforcement against digital asset-related offenses contrasts with Hong Kong’s adoption of crypto-friendly regulations designed to standardize the digital asset ecosystem. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) addressed cryptocurrency regulation and decentralized finance (DeFi) in its financial stability report. The report also emphasized the importance of global regulatory coordination in overseeing the industry. In 2021, the PBoC announced stringent measures, including a ban on virtually all crypto transactions and mining activities. The measures helped curb crypto adoption in mainland China despite remaining a significant crypto-mining hub.

This comes from the shocking news of Bybit losing $1.4 billion in ETH to NK’s Lazarus Group. With Ethereum signals likely staying bearish for the foreseeable future, massive sell-offs are likely to continue. SUI and promising newcomer DTX Exchange are stepping up as key assets that could drive market recovery. The asset, currently in its bonus presale round, has already raised an impressive $15.3 million. Likewise, its listing price is set at $0.36, double the current price of $0.18, which could draw in investors looking for potential 2x profits on their acquisitions. Ethereum Price Continues to Struggle—What’s Behind the Decline? ETH has, without a doubt, been one of the most dominant names concerning all things crypto in finance. Regardless of its no.2 status on the DeFi hierarchy, the Ethereum price has remained under pressure, with weak bullish rallies failing to push it past $2,500. To put it simply, the network has had a rough couple of weeks. Source: Ethereum Price, Monthly Chart, CoinMarketCap The recent fall in Ethereum price levels has elicited a sense of shock among many, yet it is largely viewed as a typical occurrence within the volatile crypto market. And the spike that we see in the above chart was created because of the news from Trump about a US crypto reserve. There have been several points in the past in which famously bad dips in the Ethereum price were indeed followed by bullish rallies. However, it is important to note that it remains unclear whether this pattern will repeat itself in ETH’s situation. For example, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and, say, a $1.4 billion hack could sway the market. Historically, when the Ethereum price struggles, investors usually look toward promising altcoins for potential gains, which is exactly what's happening with SUI and DTX Exchange. As macroeconomic conditions remain volatile, many investors are hesitant to pour liquidity back into ETH, opting instead for promising presales and alternative assets. SUI Leads the Charge in Market Recovery While the Ethereum price remains in limbo, the SUI token has taken center stage as one of the fastest-growing layer-1 blockchain solutions. Phantom Wallet’s Suinami beta support integration and renewed trader interest have helped boost price levels to $2.81 compared to its $2.54 position yesterday. Source: Current SUI Price, CoinMarketCap SUI has attracted a wave of new investors looking for alternatives to bearish Ethereum indications, thanks to its high-speed processing and low transaction costs. More and more developers are shifting towards its scalable infrastructure and efficient smart contract execution, helping the project position itself as a serious competitor to Ethereum. Unlike ETH, which still charges crazily high gas fees, SUI’s efficient architecture allows for faster and cheaper transactions. With recent Ethereum price struggles, SUI’s steady climb suggests that a shift in blockchain adoption may be underway. Could this be a sign that ETH is slowly getting knocked off its perch? DTX Exchange Presale Going Sky High: The Best ICO of 2025 DTX Exchange establishes itself as a distinguished Ethereum alternative through its capability to provide users with trading opportunities for 120,000+ financial assets. DTX Exchange provides trading capabilities beyond ETH due to its ability to offer an excess of 120,000 financial assets that include stocks together with forex and ETFs. An opportunity exists in the DTX bonus presale that sells tokens at $0.18 to allow investors double their initial investment when the token listing price reaches $0.36. Those who bought DTX for just $0.02 during the presale phases are set to achieve returns of 800% as the tokens rise to $0.36 when the listing takes place. DTX demonstrates better scalability together with faster transaction processing because it solves ETH's issue of network congestion. The testnet of DTX holds 200,000 TPS capacity and has been endorsed by SolidProof. DTX possesses ample capability to outperform SUI and other blockchains in terms of speedy transaction execution speed. DTX Exchange would provide institutional-quality features which would differentiate it from ETH. Large-scale traders implementing up to 1000x liquidity would find this platform suitable because of its ability to serve their needs for advanced leverage and deep market access. DTX Exchange stands as the primary choice for anyone who needs a replacement system to the Ethereum network ecosystem. In Summary The Ethereum price demonstrates a bearish trend but SUI together with DTX Exchange show alternative blockchain projects are increasing momentum. DataXion Exchange provides traders with hybrid multizone capabilities while SUI Blockchain System appeals to developers seeking an ETH substitute through its innovative capabilities and lower transaction fees and speed. With its presale momentum, $15.4 million raised, and 100% bonus opportunity, DTX Exchange could be the biggest success story of 2025.

Notably, stablecoins are a key focus point for this month, with two key events scheduled to clarify the use and broader significance of stablecoins in the United States. On March 6th, the CFTC and the White House will hold a CEO forum to discuss the significance of stablecoins as collateral in the futures market and the position of tokenized assets in the broader market. Following the introduction of the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill in February, the Senate Banking Committee is set to vote collectively from February 10th to 14th, 2025. Both events have the potential to influence market stability as bullish and bearish reactions from investors and traders depend on a favorable outcome. The first White House Crypto Summit with President Donald Trump is also scheduled for March 7th. Prominent crypto CEOs, founders, and investors are expected to attend. With Trump making notable pro-crypto remarks recently, market participants are optimistic for the weeks ahead. On March 21st, the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) will host a roundtable to spearhead crypto regulation and policymaking conversations. This comes not long after the regulator integrated crypto task force members to discuss solutions to existing crypto regulatory concerns. As noted by a market analyst , historical patterns for Bitcoin have reflected a 13.12% return for market players, making it one of the strongest months of the year after October and November.

In such situations, the positive rounds usually attract a significant volume onto the platform, which is seen with AAVE. The trading volume over the platform surged notably by over 65%, reaching close to $595 million. With this, the AAVE price reclaims $200, which is believed to elevate the token above the bearish influence. AAVE DAO Proposes a Buyback Plan In a recent update, AAVE DAO introduced a major governance proposal that aims to strengthen the revenue model. The excess revenue is expected to be redistributed, and upgrades for the liquidity management have also been proposed. The approval for these proposals and implementation could be through a formal process. It’s here: the Aavenomics implementation—proposed by @AaveChan This proposal reshapes revenue distribution, updates tokenomics, and outlines an economic framework for Aave's future. https://t.co/1dNSyrrUSH — Aave (@aave) March 4, 2025 According to the new proposal, AAVE DAO plans to buy back $1 million AAVE weekly by introducing a buyback and distributing excess revenue. This is expected to enhance the protocol’s financial performance and overall liquidity. Besides, the proposal also includes the termination of the LEND token migration, ensuring a strong financial structure with sustained growth. Will the AAVE Price Reach $300? The AAVE price had slipped below the crucial support zone as the bears held a tight grip over the rally in the last few days of February. Although the bulls tried hard to nullify the bearish influence, the crypto market crash dragged the levels close to $180. However, the recent announcement of a new buyback plan seems to have induced a significant buying volume onto the token. However, the price is still required to surpass major turbulence, which may validate a rise from the bearish influence. As seen in the above chart, the AAVE price is trading within an expanding channel, holding the ascending trend line as a strong support. However, the token has yet to rise above the broken support, while the MACD & CMF continue to remain uncertain, which raises some concerns over the next price action. The MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover, but the levels remain within the negative range. Besides, the CMF has rebounded and risen above 0 but has not yet surged above 0.14 since the start of the year. Therefore, the AAVE price is required to surge and achieve the interim resistance at $227 initially and later at $280, which could fade the bearish clouds hovering over the token. With this, the price could reclaim $300 and head towards new yearly highs.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|AAVE|BUSINESS|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 18:06:25

However, SOL has dropped 51% from the last all-time high and has lost nearly all of the gains from the election rally. Experts cite the broader market sell-off and the recent revelation of the Libra rug pull scam as the key factors behind this drop. The bottom line is that the Solana price has tanked in the past few months, and investors who have suffered massive losses are looking for fresh alternatives. While long-term holders remain cautious about this downward trend, DOJ investors are diversifying into potential options like DTX Exchange. DTX is the first hybrid platform and is currently poised for its platform launch, concluding a final bonus presale stage. Since the early funding stages, the project has demonstrated steady growth and has the potential to offer a 2x return at its listing price of $0.36. DTX Token Hits $0.18: Last Opportunity to Participate? There are very few projects that can disrupt a whole sector; among them is the novel hybrid trading platform, DTX Exchange (DTX) . This project has attracted massive investor demand due to its innovative platform and incredible features. To date, the DTX token presale has raised $15.45 million and has introduced a bonus presale round with tokens available at $0.18. With over 57% of the tokens sold in the last round, experts believe that this could be the last chance for retail investors. DTX Exchange is the first platform that combines the best of CEX and DEX, allowing users to trade over 120,000 financial instruments, including fiat, stocks, crypto, and gold. The recently launched non-custodial Phoenix Wallet acts as an all-in-one tool to manage a wide range of assets and protect them from any hiccups. With this wallet, users have full control over their funds and can access them anytime, anywhere they want without needing any KYC checks. Furthermore, an easy opportunity for 2x profit on investment from the current presale price to its listing on exchanges makes the DTX Exchange particularly interesting to investors seeking safety and long-term high growth. Can Solana Price Form a Reversal? The Solana price has lost over 31% in market cap in the last 30 days as investors continue liquidating their SOL positions. Investor confidence in the coin has dropped significantly, as there is much less positive news about its ecosystem development. Last week, the Solana price saw its biggest drop after January, falling from $169.65 to $125.36. Courtesy: TradingView Recently, the Solana price has reached the psychological support level of $125. The SOL market volume is at $5.83 billion, with 24-hour data showing an increase of 7%. Some analysts feel that this could be the best opportunity for revival as this support has always been a strong bounce zone. Some believe that the recent news around CME group’s plans to launch Solana (SOL) futures on March 17 could have a positive impact on Solana price. The new contracts, pending regulatory approval, will let traders manage Solana price risk with two contract sizes: 25 SOL and 500 SOL, according to a press release on Friday. However, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped nearly 50%, falling from its peak of $12.191 billion to $6.939 billion. Data from DeFiLlama shows that SOL is gradually losing relevance in the current crypto market cycle. Key Takeaways While Solana price continues to show bearish momentum despite market recovery, expert investors are diversifying into futuristic projects like DTX Exchange , which have strong fundamentals and community backing. With its presale creating substantial momentum, over 750,650 investors have already joined the platform. With confirmed listing gains of over 200%, investors entering now can use the code ‘LIST2X’ to get a 100% bonus on any token deposits for even higher gains.

It is true that Cardano’s DeFi updates and Grayscale’s interest do give a bit of hope but at this point, no one knows if it will remain stable or fall back to its November 2024 lows. A new ERC-20 token called DTX Exchange has entered the market and is drawing attention due to the claims that it will increase by 10,000%. DTX is selling for $0.18 in its last bonus pre-sale but has already managed to raise $15.6 million, with over 66% of the bonus round sold out. The token doubles to $0.36 once launched enabling early buyers to profit off of it instantly. For those who do not wish to invest in ADA, DTX is a great option that has potential to give quicker and higher profits. DTX Exchange: A $0.18 Coin Aiming for 10,000% Upside As ADA struggles to maintain vital support, DTX Exchange seems to be following a divergent route. Currently, DTX is priced at $0.18 but has already raised $15.6 million in presale funding, having sold 66% of its bonus round. While Cardano tries to optimize DeFi solutions on its own, DTX merges multiple markets including crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs on the VulcanX blockchain, boasting of 200,000 transactions per second. The combination of this cross-asset approach and zero commissions is what sets DTX Exchange apart from many single-chain tokens. Furthermore, DTX Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization put DTX at the forefront to capture institutional investors wanting fractional ownership of traditionally off-limit assets. Cardano Price Struggles to Stay Above $0.60 Cardano Price currently shows some signs of weakness after a +13.1% move to $0.88 in the last 24 hours, but as the price of ADA goes down, the trading volume has increased 29.72% to $7.5 billion. This higher volume raises questions on whether ADA will able to maintain this bullish trajectory. Source: CryptoMarketCap Even considering the advances visible, Cardano Price still remains at risk if the wider market turns negative. If ADA falls beneath the important $0.80 level of support, then its subsequent increase could be postponed for some time. Comparing the Potential Gains Cardano’s Direction Proposals from Grayscale could result in a potential ADA ETF, which could automatically result in price appreciation. Governance improvements, including the Plomin upgrade and bridging solutions, could lead to adoption. Nonetheless, plunging below the $0.80 mark would be disappointing for many and would require holders of ADA to be more patient before witnessing robust profits. Chances with DTX Exchange Launch At launch, DTX is automatically set to increase from $0.18 to $0.36, thus making it 2x. By using “LIST2X,” anyone can double their token balance, allowing the users to increase their 2x to 4x. A longer-term estimation implies that it will be possible for DTX to gain 10,000%, which is a whopping 100x from $0.18, should it manage to capture even a fraction of the major crypto market caps such as Cardano. Concerns regarding new projects have been solidified with the security audits by SolidProof. Without a doubt, DTX's credibility has been reinforced. Now you can trade with more than a thousand ETFs and 1000x Leverage while investing a mere one hundred dollars. Cardano Price vs. DTX Exchange If Cardano Price can defend the $0.80 support level, then it is likely to recover especially if ADA ETF rumors actually come to fruition. However, for those looking for quick profits, DTX Exchange still remains at $0.18 and offers a guaranteed 2x return upon listing at $0.36. Beyond that first boost, DTX has many profitable features like 475 million token supply, copy trading, automated investing for beginners, and easy to use platforms for advanced traders. The Phoenix Wallet that has over 275,000 downloads makes it easy to use crypto, stocks, and forex together all in one app. While ADA tries to survive the volatility, DTX has the potential to hit life changing profits if it reaches the target that many believe is possible, some even say 10,000%. With the presale’s last stage almost sold out, this is probably the last opportunity for people to secure their backing for DTX before it takes off. Conclusion Due to Grayscale’s Smart Contract Fund giving ADA an 18.23% allocation, in addition to other upgrades, there has been a growing institutional interest that is bolstering the resilience of Cardano Price. However, there is still uncertainty if Cardano Price drops under $0.60, which would reset the timer on when ADA can achieve its next major rally. In contrast, DTX Exchange has the potential to turn a $0.18 ERC-20 token into something worth 10,000% in the years to come after launching and achieving the goal of multiplying four times over.

As Trump’s 25% across-the-board tariffs on its US neighbors go into effect today, Mexico is set to announce its countermeasures. Mexico’s president , Sheinbaum, says they are “responding with tariff and non-tariff measures” to the 25% tariffs imposed by the US. Their plans will be announced on Sunday. Mexico is one of the biggest US trade partners. The 25% duties will affect more than $918 billion worth of US imports from Canada and Mexico. Canada has already fought back with a package of tariffs on $107 billion of US products, some immediate. In addition, as of today, Trump’s second move doubled the rate of tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%. In return, China has responded with up to 15% duties on US farm goods such as chicken and pork, to start on Monday. This means three nations against one. Trump believes that America can stand alone economically. However, the response that markets are giving, especially to American companies, does not show that. The United States is fighting its top trade partners Since he was elected president in November, the president has focused on China, Canada, and Mexico. He has threatened to put high tariffs on their goods if they don’t lower the unacceptable amounts of drugs coming into the US. China was immediately hit with 10% tariffs. However, Canada and Mexico were given a 30-day grace period. China has not shown interest in hearing the US out. China’s finance ministry said in a statement, “The US’s unilateral tariff increase damages the multilateral trading system, increases the burden on US companies and consumers, and undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.” Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has announced Canada would target US beer, wine, bourbon, home appliances, and Florida orange juice. If Trump’s tariffs remain in effect for an additional 21 days, tariffs will be imposed on an additional $86.2 billion of US goods. Trudeau said, “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship.” He also added that they would violate the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement signed by Trump during his first term. However, according to Trump, higher tariffs on goods coming into the US from other countries are seen as a way to make America great again. This is by getting political and economic concessions from allies and rivals on the world stage. The change will impact trillion-dollar trade and raise prices for everything from cars to medicine. It will also make it harder for the US to get along with its main trading partners. The US Census Bureau says that they will be worth $2.9 trillion in 2024, with more than 40% of that amount coming from China, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico, China, and Canada were the United States’ top three trade partners in 2024. Source: US Census Bureau Mexico and other trade partners feel the heat Imported items are very important to the American economy. The types of goods that are brought into the US most frequently are machinery-related goods, electronics, and car parts. A big chunk of these goods come from Canada, China, and Mexico. This means that prices for everything from new cars to smartphones to bicycles could soon go up. The US has a trade deficit, which means it imports more goods than it exports. Tariffs could help close that gap by making foreign goods more expensive and encouraging Americans to buy goods made in the US. Even the fear of tariffs might be able to do some of that by encouraging manufacturers to move their operations to other places. The processes will not necessarily be moved to the United States, though. Tariffs will make consumer goods more expensive, but Trump has hinted that he might lower or get rid of the personal income tax with the money from the tariffs. That could help people who are having a hard time because of sky-high debts and rising prices of things like milk and eggs. But most of the trillions of dollars that the government got last year came from income taxes. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell to their lowest levels in a month. In addition, after major declines in US markets on Monday, Asian markets were also down. The Nikkei was down by 1.6%, the TWII index was down by 0.5%, and the Hang Seng was down by 0.3% in Hong Kong.

Crypto staking coins are digital currencies that utilize the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method. Staking means locking up some of your coins to support blockchain operations and earn rewards. Unlike traditional mining, staking is energy-efficient and easy for anyone to participate in. When you stake your tokens, you're actively helping to validate and secure blockchain transactions. In exchange for this contribution, you earn passive rewards, typically in the form of additional tokens. For instance, many staking coins offer returns ranging from 4% to 12% annually. Staking provides an opportunity for passive income, potentially boosting your holdings' overall value. Think of it like earning interest on a high-yield savings account, but often with greater potential returns . It's important to use reliable staking platforms and understand any lock-up periods or associated risks. How Does Staking Crypto Work? Staking crypto involves depositing your tokens into a specific network to help maintain its operations. Here's a simplified breakdown: Select a staking platform: Choose a trusted wallet or crypto exchange supporting your preferred staking coin. Deposit tokens: Lock up a specific amount of your tokens into the network’s staking pool. Support transaction validation: Your tokens assist in confirming blockchain transactions, helping ensure accuracy and security across the network. Enhance network security: Your participation aids in preventing fraudulent activities, maintaining overall blockchain integrity. Receive rewards: Earn staking rewards regularly, typically paid in additional coins. For example, staking 100 tokens at a 5% annual reward rate would earn you an additional 5 tokens over the year. This makes staking an attractive method for generating passive income. Always remain mindful of lock-up durations and market volatility, as token values can fluctuate during staking periods. What Are the Risks of Staking Crypto? Crypto staking can be a profitable way to earn passive income, but it's important to recognize it comes with risks. Key factors include market volatility, mandatory lock-up periods, and potential technical issues that might threaten your assets or returns. Being aware of these factors helps you make better-informed staking decisions. Platform Risks Varying safety, liquidity, and stability across platforms. Risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, insufficient security, and governance issues. Lock-up periods limit quick response to market changes. Research platform reputation, user feedback, and security measures. Protocol Risks Different blockchains carry varying security and stability levels. Newer blockchains may lack proven security histories. Risks include software bugs, updates, and governance disputes. Prioritize protocols with solid track records and community support. Slashing Risks Penalties occur if validators violate network rules (e.g., downtime, validating incorrect transactions). Can result in partial or total loss of staked assets. Choose validators carefully based on historical performance and reliability. Liquidity Risks Staked assets are often locked for defined periods, limiting accessibility. Locked funds restrict ability to react quickly in volatile markets. Be aware of ""unbonding"" periods that can delay asset access for days or weeks. Align staking choices with financial flexibility and market strategy. Conclusion: What Is the Best Crypto to Stake in 2025? Crypto staking remains one of my favorite ways to earn passive income. Other cryptocurrencies that already have strong communities, stable ecosystems, and attractive staking returns, are safe choices. But if you're looking for something fresh and exciting, Dawgz AI stands out as a promising newcomer currently gaining traction in its presale. Always remember staking isn't risk-free - market swings, validator penalties, and platform reliability matter. A pro tip: diversifying your staking portfolio by adding innovative projects like Dawgz AI can boost returns and balance risks effectively.

Yet many wonder if this momentum can hold, especially as whales look for new places to park their money. Meanwhile, SHIB dipped 9.39% despite Shiba Inu’s Duel Mode push to burn tokens. With both Solana Price and Shiba Inu facing uncertainty, a newcomer called DTX Exchange , priced at just $0.18, could be the next big hit. DTX is almost sold out of its bonus presale stage, guaranteeing a 2x jump to $0.36 on launch day and raising over $15.5 million so far. DTX Exchange: A $0.18 Standout While Solana Price and SHIB battle their own challenges, DTX Exchange is quietly raising the bar for crypto-and-tradfi convergence. Powered by the VulcanX blockchain at 200,000 TPS, DTX delivers zero-commission trading across crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs, all under one roof. Right now, in its final presale at just $0.18, DTX has already pulled in $15.5 million, with 66% of the bonus round locked up. Early adopters score a guaranteed 2x jump to $0.36, and using code “LIST2X” you can even 4x those gains. If you’re sick of Solana Price swings and endless SHIB burns, this is your last chance to grab DTX before it potentially takes off. Time’s running out, seize the opportunity now! Solana Price vs. DTX Exchange Presale If layer-two implementation and futures ETFs are trending, there is a good reason to believe that Solana Price might go higher. Some traders, however, fond of instant profits right on day one, are turning Solana’s rival DTX Exchange very interesting at $0.18. The moment DTX gets listed, it automatically goes to $0.36, so traders get a 100% profit as soon as they start trading. This is nothing compared to the slow SHIB token burn or the endless yo-yo of Solana; it is not difficult to understand why everyone is talking about DTX Exchange. SolidProof audits, over one thousand ETFs, copy trading, automated investments tools, all on 200,000 TPS blockchain with over 1,000x leverage at 475 million token supply makes an incredible impression. Little doubt the last presale is close to sell out while fans of Shiba Inu and Solana Price watch from the sidelines. Solana Prospective Gains vs Prospective Problems The increase in Solana Price recently looks propitious due to the CME Group launching Solana futures contracts and the expected reduction of SOL token inflation from 4.5% to 0.87%. While these developments provide a short-term boost to Solana price, some analysts caution that the movement of the investor class refers to the ‘whales’ within the cryptocurrency community, coupled with possible unstacking events, could lead to abrupt price volatility. Source: CryptoMarketCap With all eyes on Solana's next ETF development, its ability to actually scale within the ecosystem is still a question mark. The Mobius layer-2 solution launch is encouraging, but real-world adoption remains to be seen. For traders looking for rapid profits, Solana Price is volatile and can be risky. Market Uncertainty and Shiba Inu Burn Frenzy SHIB made dashes into headlines due to Shiba Inu’s Duel Mode, which seeks to make card battles more interactive through token burns. Aiming to burn 10 billion tokens every day could, in theory, reduce the supply of Shiba Inu, which will increase its price if enough players jump on board. Source: CryptoMarketCap But the circulation supply of the token at 589.25 trillion is still massive, and a price movement of 9.39% signals that not everything is as it seems. While many can argue that Shiba Inu will succeed and its innovative burn mechanics will work, many investors are losing patience and branching out to altcoins that have faster returns. Conclusion The gradual rise in Solana price paired with the reduction of massive supply by SHIB means the crypto market is highly volatile. While it is possible Shiba Inu could meet its burn targets and Solana manages to capture and establish a regulated market, it comes with its own set of challenges and takes time. To me, the most interesting and unique presale project with a versatile trading environment and active community that incentivizes getting its DTX Exchange into the spotlight. In case you are following the important indicators, keep in mind this $0.18 coin that is very quietly preparing for the next big breakout, is actually the most revolutionary play out there.

In Canada, the rise of crypto casinos is creating new opportunities and challenges for gamers. What Are Crypto Casinos and How Do They Work? Crypto casinos function like traditional online casinos but without games. They accept cryptocurrency for payments. Players deposit, play, and withdraw with digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. This is a sharp contrast with traditional casinos that use fiat currencies and conventional banking methods. The use of blockchain technology in crypto casinos provides a transparency, security, and fairness advantage. Unlike conventional casinos where transactions happen through banks or payment processors, the role of cryptocurrency in online casinos works by using decentralized networks and does not require the need for intermediaries. Several crypto casinos also provide provably fair gaming where players can verify that bets are random and fair using cryptographic methods. Withdrawal speeds and payout rates are also important for players looking for high-payout casinos. If you're looking to compare online crypto casinos, read more here to find the best one that works for you. The Growing Popularity of Crypto Casinos in Canada It's not surprising that the Canadian crypto-gambling market is booming. The country's progressive stance on digital currencies and established online gaming industry have provided a solid ground for the evolution of cryptocurrency in gambling. According to the Canadian Gaming Association , about 60% of Canadian adults currently gamble and this explosion of online gamblers has demanded more innovative payment solutions - cryptocurrencies have filled that need. In addition, research shows that younger demographics like Millennials and Gen Z use digital currencies for online transactions more often. They naturally look at cryptocurrencies in online casinos as alternatives to traditional betting platforms as they become more interested in decentralized finance (DeFi). Statistics also indicate greater cryptocurrency ownership among Canadians. A 2023 Bank of Canada study found that 13% of Canadians own Bitcoin - a number expected to grow in the coming years. The knock-on effect is that more gaming operators are starting to accept cryptocurrency payments to tap into this growing market. The Benefits of Playing at Crypto Casinos Numerous advantages make crypto casinos attractive to Canadian players: 1. Fast Transactions and Withdrawals The most important benefit of crypto casinos is the speed of transactions. Unlike traditional online casinos that rely on banks and withdrawals can take days, crypto casinos process transactions almost instantly. For instance, the transfers of bitcoin and ether usually take only minutes and players get their winnings quicker. 2. Anonymity and Privacy Many online players value privacy when gambling and traditional casinos require personal and financial details, whereas online crypto casinos accept transactions only through a digital wallet address. This lowers your chances for identity theft & increases your anonymity. 3. Lower Fees & Better Payout Rates Because the transactions do not involve intermediaries, cryptocurrencies charge much lower transaction fees than traditional banking. Furthermore, some crypto casinos with low overhead costs pay better payout rates than others that cater to players looking for maximum returns. 4. Accessibility for Canadian Players Gambling regulations and banking restrictions can sometimes be tricky for Canadian players. The solution - Cryptocurrencies bypass restrictions that exist on traditional gambling platforms. This has therefore led to more Canadians knowing about crypto casinos before they start playing. Challenges & Risks of CryptoCasinos Despite the many benefits of crypto casinos, of course, they also pose some risks. What you need to know about crypto casino challenges before you start crypto gambling is the following: 1. Security Concerns Just how secure are crypto casinos? Blockchain technology itself is secure, but crypto casinos are still susceptible to cyberattacks and hacking attempts. Playing on reputable platforms with robust security measures like two-factor authentication and cold wallet storage for funds is important for players. 2. Volatile Cryptocurrency Prices Like fiat currencies cryptocurrencies are volatile. Winnings are subject to extreme fluctuations in value due to market conditions. So a player who wins 1 Bitcoin today might lose that much if the cryptocurrency market crashes. 3. Lack of Regulation A major risk with crypto casinos lies in the absence of clear regulation. Some licensed online casinos accept cryptocurrency but many operate in the grey area without oversight. Players must investigate platforms thoroughly and select casinos licensed by reputable gambling authorities. 4. Irreversible Transactions Bitcoin transactions are irreversible - unlike credit card chargebacks. This means a player sending funds to an illegitimate or fraudulent platform can barely recover lost funds. Players should only use reviewed and reputable cryptocurrency casinos to avoid this mistake. Future of Crypto Casinos in Canada: What to Expect by 2025? Several developments in the industry are likely to shape the future of crypto gaming and crypto casinos in Canada going forward: 1. Regulatory Changes The biggest change expected in the Canadian crypto-gambling sector is regulation. We can expect clearer guidelines and better security as government agencies try to balance online gambling and cryptocurrency. 2. Technological Innovations 2025 crypto predictions say that technological advances will determine the future of online crypto casinos.

The crypto company co-founded by legendary bitcoin (BTC) developer Adam Back plans to launch a fund that underwrites Bitcoin-backed loans and one that allows for crypto borrowing with U.S. dollars as collateral while a third fund would deploy hedge fund strategies, according to a tweet. Bloomberg reported earlier that the company had secured several billion dollars in funding to launch these funds, citing anonymous sources. The crypto lending business had been hit hard after the collapse of former crypto exchange FTX, whose falsified balance sheets and in the end, inability to pay back money lent to them, resulted in several bankruptcies of then-reputable crypto lenders. The three funds will go live in April with additional external capital starting to be accepted in July. The two lending funds will be available for borrowing.

South Africa Reserve Bank(SARB) governor’s question, “Why not strategic beef reserve?” at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos may have been rhetorical, but Lesetja Kganyago’s seemingly sarcastic remark about “strategic bitcoin reserves” inadvertently underscored the need for Africa to rethink its economic strategies in the face of global financial shifts. In a world increasingly defined by digital transformation, the concept of money and value storage is evolving rapidly. Africa is no stranger to commodity-based economies. From oil to gold, beef to cocoa, the continent has long relied on natural resources for economic sustenance. However, these commodities are fraught with challenges. Global commodity prices are highly susceptible to market fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. For instance, the price of beef can swing dramatically due to disease outbreaks or trade restrictions, just the way the value of fiat currencies swings and remains unpredictable when traded against digital assets like bitcoin due to regional financial policies and currency devaluation. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) , beef prices have experienced volatility of up to 30% year-over-year due to factors like foot-and-mouth disease and export bans. Image Source : FAO Even though Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, responded to Kganyago’s question with a compelling argument: Bitcoin is not just a better form of money than gold, it is also more portable, divisible, and utility-driven. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has outperformed every major asset class, cementing its position as a superior store of value. For Africa, a continent often marginalized in the global financial system, a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could be the key to unlocking economic independence, fostering innovation, and securing long-term prosperity. How? It’s time to be factual and realistic in our comparison. Bitcoin exists digitally and requires no physical storage, commodities like beef and mutton are perishable and costly to maintain. The World Bank estimates that post-harvest losses for agricultural products in Africa amount to $48 billion annually, highlighting the inefficiencies of commodity-based reserves. While commodities have intrinsic value, their utility is restricted to specific industries. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a global, borderless asset with applications in finance, technology, and beyond while its unique properties make it an ideal candidate for a strategic reserve asset. With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely or beef with endless reproductive mechanisms. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has grown from less than 1 billion in 2013 to over 1 trillion in 2025, demonstrating its rapid adoption and value appreciation. Image Source : CoinMarketCap WHY BITCOIN OVER BEEF ? Bitcoin can be transferred across borders in minutes and divided into smaller units (satoshis), making it more practical than gold or beef. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has delivered an average annual return of over 200%, outperforming gold, stocks, and real estate. A study by Fidelity Investments found that Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns are superior to traditional assets, making it an attractive option for long-term wealth preservation. Globally, nations are beginning to recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset. El Salvador made history in 2021 by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, while countries like Switzerland and Singapore have integrated Bitcoin into their financial systems. This is 2025 and The United States “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” Bill is already in the pipeline. According to a 2023 report by Chainalysis, Africa is one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets, with Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa leading in adoption. Bitcoin’s deflationary nature makes it an effective hedge against inflation, which has plagued many African economies. For example, Nigeria’s inflation rate hit 34.80% in 2024, eroding the value of the Naira. A Bitcoin reserve could protect national wealth from such devaluation. By allocating just 1% of its reserves to Bitcoin, Africa could unlock billions in value. For instance, if the continent’s combined foreign reserves of 500 billion included 5 billion in Bitcoin, a 10x appreciation in Bitcoin’s value would yield $50 billion in returns. Unlike beef production, which contributes to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions, Bitcoin mining can be powered by renewable energy. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, 58.5% of global Bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy as of 2021. Africa’s vast solar and hydroelectric potential makes it an ideal location for sustainable Bitcoin mining operations. Storing and managing Bitcoin reserves is far more cost-effective than maintaining commodity reserves. There are no storage costs, no risk of spoilage, and no need for complex logistics. Image Source : Central Bank of Nigeria. El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender provides valuable insights for Africa. Despite initial skepticism, Bitcoin has boosted tourism and foreign investment in El Salvador. According to the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador, tourism revenue increased by 30% in the first year following Bitcoin adoption. Over 70% of Salvadorans previously lacked access to banking services. Bitcoin has enabled millions to participate in the global economy. By reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar, El Salvador has taken a bold step toward financial independence. Many African nations rely heavily on the U.S. dollar for trade and reserves, leaving them vulnerable to external economic policies. Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative, reducing reliance on traditional financial systems. By establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Africa can secure its economic future, protect its wealth from inflation, and position itself as a global leader in the digital economy. The time has come for Africa to move beyond outdated economic models and embrace the future of money. As Brian Armstrong aptly stated, Bitcoin is not just a better form of money; it is the foundation of a new financial paradigm. For Africa, the choice is clear: Bitcoin, not beef, is the path to prosperity. Bitcoin represents a transformative asset class that offers unparalleled advantages over traditional commodities like beef or mutton. This is a guest post by Heritage Falodun.

According to Bybit’s proposal , the fees were generated when North Korea’s Lazarus Group swapped stolen stETH for ETH using Paraswap. The transaction was carried out in eight separate transactions following the February 21 attack. These funds were automatically collected as standard protocol fees and later wrapped into wETH. Bybit proposal highlights new details The Paraswap proposal presents new technical insights regarding how the February 21 Bybit hack was carried out. Bybit specifically emphasized how the stolen funds were laundered through decentralized exchanges. Source: Paraswap The transaction consisted of eight individual Ethereum transaction hashes where the hacker traded stolen stETH for ETH on Paraswap.”These funds were originated when the hacker swapped stETH for ETH on ParaSwap,” states the proposal. They referenced transaction IDs that can be verified on-chain. Based on the latest report by Zhou, the hackers used THORChain to swap ETH for BTC, 361,255 ETH (or approximately $900 million) to be exact. This means that 72% of the stolen funds were moved through this cross-chain protocol. The remainder were moved through OKX’s web3 wallet (8%) and ExCH (16%), the latter sum being characterized as having “gone dark.” Zhou explained that 83% of the pilfered and converted money to Bitcoin is now distributed in 6,954 wallets, with each containing 1.71 BTC. Community debate comes up regarding precedent and DeFi principles The Bybit proposal has initiated a governance discussion among the Paraswap community. Members have begun to put forward opposing opinions on whether refunding the fees aligns with fundamental DeFi philosophy. Some are in favor of the moral argument of refunding money in the context of a hack, while others are concerned that this sets bad precedents for protocol self-governance. One user pointed out a conflict between the principles of decentralization and solidarity: “From an ethical standpoint, returning the 44.67 wETH to Bybit can be seen as an act of solidarity and good faith, strengthening trust between centralized and decentralized platforms.” But the same user warned that “from the perspective of decentralization and cypherpunk principles, this restitution could be problematic.” Some of the governance stakeholders inquired about how the community would deal with such incidents in the future. They suggested that a policy be made and not deal with each case on a case-by-case basis. One of the users asked for proof that the proposal was actually made by Bybit. The community has asked the Paraswap Foundation and Laita Labs to confirm whether there has been any official communication with Bybit. Nevertheless, at the time of writing it is not certain if the communication has been done by the official Bybit exchange. The community has called on the Paraswap Foundation and Laita Labs to confirm whether any official communications with Bybit have happened. However, at press time it is unclear whether the communication has been made by the official Bybit exchange. Paraswap named as one of the top 3 players by Ben According to Ben Zhou’s status update, the exchange has implemented a bounty program that has already achieved partial success in freezing stolen assets. “$2,178,797 USDT has been paid out to 11 bounty hunters,” Zhou reported. Interestingly, Paraswap is named among the “top 3 players” helping Bybit freeze compromised funds. This shows that the protocol has already assisted in recovery efforts separate from the current fee return request. 3.4.25 Executive Summary on Hacked Funds: Total hacked funds of USD 1.4bn around 500k ETH, 77% are still traceable, 20% has gone dark, 3% have been frozen.

Zhou has indicated that this week and next week are decisive for fund freezing since the funds will begin clearing at exchanges, OTC, and P2P. Bybit’s proposal to Paraswap stipulates certain “goals and means” of the return of the requested funds. The exchange suggested that, upon approval, the funds are to be immediately frozen from any DAO distribution processes and then transferred into the recovery wallet. The exchange also responded to the community’s verification concerns: “To ensure the address being sent belongs to the Bybit team, separate communication will be shared from an official communication channel.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

41157645,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136703,1741116091,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Metaplanet’s Bold $87.1M Bitcoin Boost: Stock Acquisition Fuels Crypto Expansion,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-stock-acquisition-bitcoin/,"In a powerful display of conviction in digital assets, Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company, has just announced a significant financial maneuver aimed at amplifying its Bitcoin (BTC) portfolio. The company’s latest strategic move involves the exercise of stock acquisition rights, successfully raising a substantial $87.1 million. This injection of capital underscores Metaplanet’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a core investment strategy. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it means for the crypto landscape. Decoding Metaplanet’s Stock Acquisition Rights Exercise Metaplanet’s recent announcement on X (formerly Twitter) has sent ripples through the financial and cryptocurrency communities. But what exactly does exercising stock acquisition rights mean, and how does it translate to $87.1 million in funding? Let’s break it down: Stock Acquisition Rights: Think of these as options to purchase company shares at a predetermined price. They are often issued to investors or employees. Series 13 and 14: Metaplanet exercised rights from its 13th and 14th series of stock acquisition rights. Units and Shares: They exercised 30,090 units from the 13th series, resulting in 3,009,000 shares, and 9,070 units from the 14th series, yielding 907,000 shares. Share Value: Each share was valued at 3,310 yen. Total Funds Raised: Multiplying the total shares (3,916,000) by the share value (3,310 yen) gives us 12.96 billion yen, which translates to approximately $87.1 million (USD). Essentially, Metaplanet offered the opportunity for holders of these stock acquisition rights to convert them into actual company shares at a set price. This process not only dilutes existing shares slightly but also brings fresh capital into the company’s coffers. And in Metaplanet’s case, this fresh capital is earmarked for Bitcoin. Why is Metaplanet Investing Heavily in Bitcoin? Metaplanet’s dedication to Bitcoin is not a new phenomenon. The company has been vocal about its belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a key component of its treasury strategy. But why Bitcoin, and why now? Store of Value: In an era of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold – a hedge against traditional market volatility. Diversification: For companies like Metaplanet, allocating a portion of their treasury to Bitcoin can diversify their holdings beyond traditional assets like cash and bonds. Long-Term Vision: Metaplanet’s actions suggest a long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin. They aren’t just dabbling; they are making a significant commitment. Following MicroStrategy’s Lead?: Metaplanet’s strategy bears resemblance to MicroStrategy, another publicly listed company that has famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This approach has garnered attention and, for some, validation within the corporate world. By actively seeking to increase its Bitcoin holdings, Metaplanet is signaling a strong conviction in the future of cryptocurrency and its potential to outperform traditional assets over time. This bold move could inspire other publicly listed companies to explore similar strategies. The Impact of $87.1M BTC Funding on Metaplanet and the Market What are the potential ramifications of this $87.1 million Bitcoin injection? Let’s consider the impacts: Impact Area Potential Effects Metaplanet’s Balance Sheet Significantly strengthened Bitcoin reserves, potentially increasing the company’s appeal to investors who are bullish on crypto. Shareholder Value Depending on Bitcoin’s performance, this move could enhance shareholder value in the long run. However, short-term volatility in the crypto market could also impact stock prices. Bitcoin Market While $87.1 million is not a massive sum in the overall Bitcoin market, it contributes to the growing institutional adoption narrative and can have a positive psychological impact. It signals continued corporate interest in BTC. Japanese Market Metaplanet’s actions could encourage other Japanese companies to consider Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategy, potentially fostering a more crypto-friendly corporate environment in Japan. It’s important to note that investing in Bitcoin, especially for publicly traded companies, comes with scrutiny and potential risks associated with market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. However, Metaplanet appears to be navigating these challenges with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities of Bitcoin Investment While Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Investment strategy is undoubtedly exciting for crypto enthusiasts, it’s crucial to acknowledge both the potential benefits and the inherent challenges: Benefits: Potential for High Returns: Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant price appreciation, offering the potential for substantial returns compared to traditional assets. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust cryptography offer a level of security and autonomy that traditional financial systems may lack. Inflation Hedge: As mentioned, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation, preserving value in times of economic uncertainty. First-MMover Advantage: Companies like Metaplanet, adopting Bitcoin early, could gain a first-mover advantage as institutional adoption grows. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which can lead to significant fluctuations in the value of Metaplanet’s holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, and changes in regulations could impact Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy. Custodial Risks: Securely storing and managing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust custodial solutions and expertise. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings and reporting them on financial statements can be complex and requires adherence to evolving accounting standards. Metaplanet’s continued investment suggests they are confident in navigating these challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities that Bitcoin presents. Their commitment serves as a compelling case study for other companies considering similar moves. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Metaplanet’s Move? Metaplanet’s Japanese Company Bitcoin strategy offers valuable lessons for investors, businesses, and crypto enthusiasts alike: Consider Bitcoin for Diversification: Even if not to the extent of Metaplanet, businesses can explore allocating a small portion of their treasury to Bitcoin for diversification purposes. Long-Term Perspective is Key: Bitcoin investment is best approached with a long-term horizon, weathering short-term volatility for potential long-term gains. Due Diligence is Essential: Thoroughly research and understand the risks and regulatory landscape before investing in Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. Follow Institutional Trends: Pay attention to institutional adoption trends as they can provide valuable insights into the evolving role of crypto in the financial world. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s $87.1M Bet Signals Growing Institutional Crypto Confidence Metaplanet’s successful exercise of stock acquisition rights to raise $87.1 million for further Bitcoin Investment is a powerful signal. It demonstrates a growing confidence in Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate and strategic treasury reserve. This move by a publicly listed Japanese Company Bitcoin proponent highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and could pave the way for more corporate entities to embrace digital assets in the future. As Metaplanet continues its Bitcoin journey, the world will be watching closely to see the results of this bold and potentially transformative financial strategy.

Privacy Balancing privacy with transparency and regulatory compliance is a key challenge. The design is expected to incorporate privacy-enhancing technologies. Security Robust security measures are paramount to protect the digital shekel system from cyber threats and ensure the integrity of transactions. Scalability The system must be scalable to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently and reliably, catering to the entire Israeli economy. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? Like any major financial innovation, the digital shekel comes with both potential benefits and challenges. Understanding these is crucial for assessing its long-term impact. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Payment Efficiency: Faster and cheaper transactions, both domestically and potentially internationally. Increased Financial Stability: A well-designed CBDC could strengthen the financial system and reduce risks associated with private digital currencies. Improved Monetary Policy Implementation: CBDCs could provide central banks with new tools for implementing monetary policy. Reduced Cash Handling Costs: Lower costs associated with printing, distributing, and managing physical cash. Potential Challenges: Cybersecurity Risks: CBDC systems are attractive targets for cyberattacks, requiring robust security infrastructure. Privacy Concerns: Balancing the need for transparency with the public’s right to privacy is a delicate act. Disintermediation Risks: CBDCs could potentially disintermediate commercial banks, requiring careful design to mitigate negative impacts. Adoption Hurdles: Ensuring widespread adoption by both consumers and businesses will be critical for the success of the digital shekel . The Road Ahead: What to Expect? The release of the preliminary design is just the beginning of a long journey for the digital currency Israel is considering. The Bank of Israel has emphasized that this is a starting point for discussion and feedback. Here’s what you can expect in the coming years: Public Consultation: Expect opportunities for public feedback and engagement on the design and features of the digital shekel .

Let’s understand the significance of such substantial BTC holdings : Treasury Reserve: Holding a large amount of Bitcoin positions MARA as a significant holder of this digital asset. This reserve can act as a treasury asset, potentially appreciating in value over time and serving as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Financial Strength: Substantial BTC holdings enhance MARA’s balance sheet, demonstrating financial strength and stability. This can improve the company’s creditworthiness and access to capital markets. Strategic Flexibility: A large Bitcoin reserve provides strategic flexibility. MARA can use these holdings for various purposes, such as funding future operations, strategic investments, or participating in Bitcoin-related financial activities.

As AI chatbots like ChatGPT become the go-to for information, businesses face a pivotal challenge: adapting their online presence for a world increasingly navigated by AI. Enter Scrunch AI, a pioneering platform designed to empower enterprises to not just exist, but excel in this new frontier of AI Search . Imagine a landscape where AI agents and crawlers become your primary website visitors – Scrunch AI is here to ensure you’re not just ready, but thriving. Navigating the AI Search Revolution: Why Traditional SEO Isn’t Enough The game has changed. Relying solely on traditional SEO tactics focused on human search queries is becoming increasingly inadequate. Here’s why: AI-Driven Information Retrieval: Users are increasingly turning to AI Chatbots for direct answers, bypassing traditional search engine results pages (SERPs). This means your website needs to be optimized for AI consumption, not just human browsing.

From Frustration to Innovation: The Genesis of Scrunch AI Chris Andrew, co-founder and CEO of Scrunch AI, experienced this shift in online behavior firsthand. As a former chief product officer at Hearsay Systems, Andrew noticed a personal change: “I realized I was visiting fewer websites. I was expecting an answer from ChatGPT instead of 20 links from Google.” This realization sparked an idea – if browsing itself is being outsourced to AI, the entire customer journey is poised for transformation. Validating this concept with CMOs, Andrew discovered a growing awareness of high-quality referral traffic originating from AI Search engines. However, a critical challenge emerged: inconsistent results for identical prompts across different AI Search platforms. This inconsistency highlighted a fundamental truth: a company’s online narrative is no longer solely self-defined. It’s a blend of self-presentation, third-party information, and competitive positioning – a complex equation demanding constant monitoring and strategic management. Scrunch AI’s Journey: From Startup to Funding Success Launched in Fall 2023 by Andrew and co-founder Robert MacCloy, Scrunch AI quickly transitioned from concept to reality, launching its product in November 2024. The platform’s value proposition resonated strongly, attracting 25 enterprise clients, including industry giants like Lenovo and BairesDev, alongside institutions like Penn State University. This early traction fueled a successful $4 million seed round led by Mayfield, with notable angel investors including Clara Shih, TJ Parker, and Bryant Chou. This funding injection will propel Scrunch AI’s product development, further solidifying its position as a leader in the AI Search optimization space. Standing Out in a Growing Market: The Scrunch AI Advantage While Scrunch AI isn’t alone in recognizing the burgeoning need for AI Search optimization, its unique approach sets it apart.

However, Scrunch AI distinguishes itself by: Customer Journey Focus: Scrunch AI goes beyond surface-level search result monitoring. It delves into the entire customer journey as perceived by AI agents, providing a holistic view of online presence . Agent-Centric Approach: Scrunch AI prioritizes optimization not just for human-AI interactions but, crucially, for AI-to-website interactions. This forward-thinking strategy anticipates a future where AI agents are primary web navigators. Andrew emphasizes this agent-centric vision: “I think people were like, ‘How do we use AI to make our website better?’ And my mindset was like, ‘Your website’s going to need to be for an agent or crawler in the future.’” This foresight is resonating with enterprise clients who recognize that brand perception is increasingly shaped by AI Chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Siri, and Google AI Overviews. Embrace the AI Search Future with Scrunch AI The rise of AI Search is not just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in how information is accessed and consumed online. For businesses, adapting to this change is no longer optional – it’s essential for maintaining and enhancing their online presence . Scrunch AI provides the tools and insights necessary to navigate this new landscape, ensuring your company not only appears in AI Search results but shines.

Pundits say Ethereum could be on a death march toward $1,000 in a steep decline that has left speculators scratching their heads. Ethereum Price Could Be Headed To $1,000 Ethereum (ETH) woes appear to be worsening following a dip in prices below $2,000 since December 2023. Ethereum price touched $1,996 before staging a valiant climb back to $2,135, triggering concerns over its future direction. On-chain data is grim for the largest altcoin with several indicators pointing toward a downward trend. Ethereum’s weekly RSI is at its lowest ebb for the first time since 2022 at 35.84. Similar RSI levels in 2022 saw the asset price fall even further by a staggering -60%. Analysts say that the Ethereum price could fall to $1,000 given similar market conditions in 2022. The slip below $2000 follows an earlier dip below $2,200, leaving its parallel channel which experts say could induce correction to $1,600. Ethereum’s triple-top pattern in its weekly chart is indicative of a 60% decline as bears have a field day. A 60% decline at current levels will see Ethereum price dip below the $1,000 mark. Ethereum Is On Course To Record Its Worst Q1 The largest altcoin has endured a wave of negative sentiments since the start of 2025. Ethereum price has fallen by nearly 40% from its high of $3,300 at the start of the year. A drop to $1,600 will see Ethereum record its worst Q1 performance , dwarfing the lows of the first quarter of 2024. US Ethereum ETFs recorded massive outflows while ETHA share price shed 38.59% since the start of the year. While institutional interest around ETH sinks, the asset’s proposed inclusion into the US Crypto Strategic Reserve did little to stave off the massive decline. Despite the grim outlook, some pundits say the decline presents a buying opportunity for long-term investors. “We are going into the undervaluation zone,” said the pseudonymous Venturefounder on X (formerly Twitter).

In a March 4 statement on X, Winklevoss claimed that regulatory enforcement actions have been weaponized to stifle crypto innovation. He argued that agencies are being used against digital assets for political purposes, calling for legal protections to prevent politically motivated enforcement actions. Any future crypto legislation must make it very hard to weaponize federal agencies against crypto. Crypto needs rules, not because investors lack protection but because builders and companies lack protection — we need a firewall against federal regulatory attacks. This should be… — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) March 4, 2025 Winklevoss criticized Senator Elizabeth Warren, alleging that she has influenced the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to undermine the crypto sector through excessive enforcement actions. He warned that Warren could extend similar influence over the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other financial watchdogs in the future. He expressed concerns that agencies such as the SEC and CFTC could be leveraged by political figures to push an anti-crypto agenda. Drawing parallels with Warren’s past actions against banks and fintech companies, he emphasized the need for a “zero trust model” in dealing with regulators. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s previous anti-crypto actions , including her most recent scrutiny of Tether’s banking relationships with President Donald Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, are indicative of a broader pattern that could extend to other financial regulatory bodies, Winklevoss fears. You might also like: Mexican Billionaire Ricardo Salinas allocates 70% of his portfolio to Bitcoin Concerns over regulatory influence and enforcement bias Winklevoss also voiced distrust toward financial regulators, claiming that anti-crypto policymakers have infiltrated regulatory agencies and are using their power to push political agendas rather than ensure fair oversight. He specifically referenced SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who previously served as CFTC chairman from 2009 to 2014, suggesting that regulatory agencies could be influenced by political ideologies, posing risks to crypto entrepreneurs and businesses. This perspective aligns with broader industry sentiments regarding regulatory scrutiny. For instance, the SEC’s recent decision to drop its case against Gemini and a host of other crypto platforms was seen as a positive development by Winklevoss, who has previously criticized regulatory actions against crypto platforms. Additionally, Gemini’s recent achievement of securing in-principle approval for an Investment Firm License in Malta signifies the company’s commitment to complying with international regulatory standards, further emphasizing the importance of clear and fair regulations. Moreover, Winklevoss’s stance mirrors the crypto industry’s broader concerns about potential “debanking” practices targeting crypto-related businesses.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Eye $1: Who Will Get There First?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-cardano-bulls-push-ada-price-to-3-before-may-dogecoin-doge-and-mutuum-finance-mutm-eye-1-who-will-get-there-first/,"Current across the crypto market shows three tokens fighting to achieve major achievements. The recent 12.54 billion ADA purchase by whales makes Cardano (ADA) maintain its position at $0.63. Dogecoin (DOGE) defends $0.20 as an essential support point that analysts expect to launch a 208% price increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) challenges the market dynamic through its presale which exceeded $2 million while moving into phase two at $0.015 price point for 300% expected returns upon launch. The pursuit of highest market dominance becomes more competitive as ADA aims for $3, DOGE pursues $1 and MUTM demonstrates potential for rapid market expansion. Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity Sparks $1 Ambition ADA experienced a successful recovery phase that pushed its price from $0.50 to $0.63 which resulted in increased optimistic market sentiment. ADA needs substantial upward momentum to overcome the $0.70 resistance level while large holders continue to build their combined holdings to 12.54 billion ADA. Technical indicators present contradictory evidence where neutrality emerges from an RSI value of 41 while MACD histogram narrowing points towards possible momentum development. Expert analysts predict Cardano will reach $1 by March 2025 providing the market continues to buy heavily and improves overall. The path to ADA reaching $3 by May requires whales to forcefully fight against selling pressure and establish a 375% price hike that depends on extraordinary market drivers. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin Eyes $1 Amid Consolidation Dogecoin exhibits an illusory state of stability since volatility preparations simmer under the current $0.20 price point. A descending channel pattern indicates potential upward movement for DOGE which should reach $0.25 after surpassing $0.22 and could reach $1 in the future. Growing optimism in the market has pushed the RSI to a value of 45 while doubts persist in the background. Bitcoins 10% weekly gain coupled with ETF developments create positive market momentum but Dogecoin needs 300% growth to reach its first dollar target because its popularity stems from being a meme coin. The rise in value due to speculative excitement could fail to overcome resistance levels which causes Dogecoin to lose ground to utility-oriented competitors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Momentum Fuels 400% Launch Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) eclipses speculative hype with a decentralized lending model generating real-world utility. Phase two of its presale continues toward $0.015 after collecting $2 million from 3,800 investors. The initial group who participates during phase three production at $0.02 benefits with a 33.3% profit increase while the $0.06 final listing rate provides 300% returns. The buy-and-distribute mechanism of MUTM distributes revenue from its platform directly to both token buyers and stakers to maintain constant demand. Analysts anticipate MUTM tokens will reach $5 after launch because of the mtTokens mechanism and overcollateralized loan system and peer-to-peer lending functionality. The tokenomics design behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) works to prevent price fluctuations that Dance and Dogecoin experience. The swift conclusion of the presale demonstrates the heightened sense of urgency because token investors who acquire early positions better than eventual exchange listing dates as well as automatic buy pressure. Stage two distribution channels will run out every day thus reducing the chance for new users to join. Utility Trumps Speculation in the Race to $1 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses DeFi innovations to support its growth while remaining independent of market sentiment and whale activities that affect Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE). The $3 target price for ADA remains out of reach due to no institutional investors and the temporary nature of Dogecoin’s $1 goal. MUTM stands out from other tokens because its presale growth relies heavily on practical applications and sound token attributes to become the leading choice for huge market increases. The approaching capacity in phase two forces investors between targeting hypothetical market peaks or investing in a project built for lasting growth. Secure MUTM coins at $0.015 before phase three starts since the price will increase subsequently. Investors need to take advantage of the presale portal despite declining inventory because it offers 300% return potential.

The agreement includes measures to end public participation in the Chivo wallet by July 2025 and to establish a management framework for government-held Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Law has also been amended, making Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for private entities. The IMF described Bitcoin usage in the country as existing in a 'confined' manner, with negligible tax payments and limited public trust due to high price volatility. Despite these restrictions, El Salvador recently purchased an additional 5 Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 6,100 BTC, valued at approximately $600 million.

This request has caused a big debate in the decentralized finance (DeFi). Some people think ParaSwap should return the money, while others say it is not responsible for the hacker’s actions. If the DAO agrees, it could set a legal precedent that may change how DeFi platforms handle stolen funds. A Tough Choice for ParaSwap DAO Bybit believes that since the money came from a hacker, it should be returned. The stolen funds were part of the $1.46 billion theft linked to Lazarus Group , the allegedly North Korea-backed hackers. However, the matter is complicated. ParaSwap DAO earned the fees through smart contracts, which means the transactions were technically legitimate. If the protocol agrees to return the funds, it could set a risky precedent. Other exchanges might start demanding refunds in similar cases, raising concerns about how DAOs handle such situations in the future. Some in the DeFi community argue that “code is law.” This means transactions executed on-chain should remain final, even if they involve stolen funds. Can Bybit And PanSwap Meet In A Middle Ground? Some people think ParaSwap DAO should not return all the money. Instead, they suggest keeping 10% and giving back the rest as a goodwill gesture. This could help Bybit regain some of its lost funds while protecting DAOs from being forced to return swap fees in future hacks. In a statement, Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, said most of the stolen money is nearly untraceable . This came after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that the attackers sent the funds to many blockchain addresses, making it hard to track and recover. This was one of the biggest crypto hacks ever, and Bybit is still struggling to recover its losses. All Eyes on ParaSwap ParaSwap’s decision could have long-lasting effects on the DeFi sector. If it returns the crypto fees, more people might ask for refunds in the future. It shows that smart contract transactions cannot be changed if they refuse. This debate shows how hard it is to balance security, fairness, and decentralization in crypto.

Saylor Forecasts $10 Million Per Bitcoin Currently valued at about $2 trillion, Saylor believes Bitcoin’s trajectory will see it grow to $20 trillion and eventually hit the $200 trillion mark, translating to an approximate price of $10 million per BTC based on its capped supply of 21 million coins. Saylor attributes this potential growth to a global shift in capital investment, stating, “That capital is coming from overseas… from China, from Russia, from Europe, from Africa, from Asia, from the 20th century to the 21st century.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Out—10% Surge Sparks Bullish Momentum His forecast comes against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s recent announcement regarding the creation of a Crypto Strategic Reserve, which would include BTC alongside Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), which ignited a heated debate within financial and crypto circles. While Saylor acknowledges the appeal of a Bitcoin-only reserve, he supports Trump’s broader strategy that encompasses multiple cryptocurrencies. He emphasized, “There’s no way to interpret this other than this is bullish for Bitcoin and is bullish for the entire US crypto industry.” Although some conservatives, such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, have advocated for more restrictive, Bitcoin-centric policies, Saylor noted that the president’s approach allows for a more inclusive economic policy. Saylor Dismisses Volatility Concerns When asked about his involvement with the White House, Saylor confirmed he has been in discussions with various lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, as well as members of the Cabinet and administration. “For the last four and a half years, I’ve been talking about Bitcoin to anybody, anywhere in the world, every day,” Michael Saylor stated during his interview, highlighting his commitment to promoting the cryptocurrency. Saylor argues that establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide the United States with significant economic advantages, including the potential to alleviate the national debt. Saylor posits, “If the United States takes a position in the emerging crypto economy, if it buys up 10, 20% of the Bitcoin network, we’re going to pay off the national debt. And so why wouldn’t that be in the interest of the United States?” Related Reading: Dogecoin Will Start A Move To $4 If Current Demand Holds – Can Bulls Step In? Addressing concerns about Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, Saylor pointed to its historical long-term gains, asserting, “I don’t think anybody’s ever lost money in the Bitcoin network holding for four years. Presumably, you want to buy Bitcoin, you want to hold it for 100 years.” The proposal for a US Crypto Reserve is still in its infancy, and Saylor indicated that its success will depend heavily on legislative decisions made in the coming months. “There are a dozen people on it: the head of the Treasury, the SEC, the CFTC, Commerce, the Attorney General, the President… both the Republicans and the Democrats,” he noted, emphasizing the diverse range of opinions that will influence the outcome. At the time of writing, BTC has found support at around $83,869 after posting losses of 7% and 6% over the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

This revelation came through a post on X (formerly Twitter), adding fuel to an already heated debate surrounding cryptocurrency and political influence. But what exactly prompted this disclosure, and what does it mean for the ongoing discussions about crypto regulation and potential conflicts of interest? David Sacks Crypto Divestment: The X Disclosure The saga unfolded on social media when American political commentator Krystal Ball directed a pointed query towards David Sacks on X. Ball’s criticism centered around concerns about a proposed crypto reserve plan involving President Donald Trump, alleging it could be a scheme to divert taxpayer funds for personal gain. She labeled it a potential “world historic heist,” a strong accusation that caught the attention of many. In response to this direct criticism, Sacks took to X to defend himself and clarify his financial positions. In a move that surprised some in the crypto community, he disclosed that he had already sold his investment in Multicoin Capital. This shocking disclosure was intended to counter any implications that he might be personally profiting from current crypto market dynamics or any potential future crypto reserve initiatives. Sacks specifically mentioned selling his shares in BITW, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, on January 22nd, for a total of $74,000. This detail was crucial to his defense, as it directly addressed the accusations of personal financial gain and aimed to demonstrate transparency regarding his crypto-related investments. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”David Sacks Crypto Divestment”] David Sacks’ X disclosure regarding his crypto investments sparked a significant debate. Multicoin Capital Investment: What Was Sold? To fully grasp the significance of David Sacks’ disclosure, it’s important to understand what Multicoin Capital is and what BITW represents. Multicoin Capital is a well-known investment firm that focuses exclusively on the crypto space. They invest in a variety of crypto assets and blockchain-related companies, making them a significant player in the digital asset ecosystem. An investment from Multicoin Capital is often seen as a strong endorsement within the crypto industry. BITW, or the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, is a passively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to track the performance of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It provides investors with diversified exposure to the leading digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Selling shares in BITW effectively means divesting from a broad basket of leading cryptocurrencies, reflecting a significant move away from direct crypto market exposure at that time. Here’s a quick look at what BITW represents: Diversification: Exposure to the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Accessibility: Traded on traditional stock exchanges, making crypto investment accessible to a wider audience. Passive Management: Tracks an index, reducing the need for active trading decisions. Crypto Controversy and Krystal Ball’s Criticism The backdrop to this crypto controversy is the ongoing debate about the role of cryptocurrency in the financial system and the potential for government involvement. Krystal Ball’s criticism wasn’t just directed at David Sacks, but also at the broader idea of a “crypto reserve” being proposed in political circles. Her “heist” accusation highlights a deep-seated skepticism about the motives behind such initiatives, particularly when prominent figures with crypto investments are involved. Ball’s concerns touch upon several critical points: Taxpayer Money: The idea of using taxpayer money to fund a crypto reserve raises questions about public resource allocation. Potential Conflicts of Interest: Individuals with significant crypto holdings potentially benefiting from policy changes. Transparency and Accountability: The need for clear oversight and accountability in any government-related crypto initiatives. While Sacks’ disclosure of his crypto divestment aims to address conflict-of-interest concerns, the broader debate about crypto policy and regulation remains very much alive. BITW Investment and the Timing of the Sale The timing of David Sacks’ BITW investment sale – January 22nd – is noteworthy. While the specific reasons for his divestment at that particular date are not explicitly stated, it raises questions about market conditions and his investment strategy at the time. January 2022 was a period of volatility in the crypto markets, with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experiencing significant price swings. Selling BITW shares at $74,000 suggests a strategic decision was made amidst this market uncertainty. Whether it was driven by risk aversion, portfolio rebalancing, or other factors, the timing adds another layer of intrigue to the disclosure. Understanding the context of the market conditions around January 2022 can provide further insights into the rationale behind this BITW investment decision. Here’s a simplified timeline: Date Event Significance January 22nd David Sacks sells BITW shares Divestment from crypto market index fund Recent Krystal Ball criticizes crypto reserve plan Triggers Sacks’ disclosure Ongoing Debate about crypto policy and regulation Broader context for the disclosure Crypto Reserve Plan: The Bigger Picture The controversy surrounding David Sacks’ crypto reserve plan disclosure is intertwined with larger discussions about the future of cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. The idea of a national crypto reserve, while still vague in its details, sparks significant debate within the crypto community and beyond. Proponents argue it could foster innovation and position the US as a leader in the digital asset space. Critics, like Krystal Ball, express concerns about potential misuse of funds and undue influence from crypto industry insiders. Key questions surrounding the crypto reserve plan include: Purpose: What would be the specific objectives of a crypto reserve? Funding: How would such a reserve be funded, and what safeguards would be in place? Governance: Who would manage and oversee the crypto reserve? Impact: What would be the broader economic and societal impacts of such a plan? David Sacks’ disclosure, while focused on his personal investments, highlights the complexities and sensitivities surrounding crypto policy at the intersection of finance, technology, and politics. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing scrutiny and the need for transparency as the crypto industry continues to evolve and seek greater integration with mainstream financial and political systems. Conclusion: Transparency in the Crypto Age David Sacks’ public disclosure of his Multicoin Capital investment divestment is a significant event in the ongoing crypto narrative. While it was prompted by criticism and aimed to defend his position, it also underscores the growing importance of transparency and accountability in the crypto space, particularly for individuals operating at the intersection of technology, finance, and public policy. As the debate about crypto regulation and initiatives like crypto reserves intensifies, openness and clear communication will be crucial for building trust and fostering constructive dialogue.

Think of it as a new paradigm for digital ownership and creativity. Here’s why blockchain is a game-changer for IP: Let’s elaborate on these benefits in a more detailed manner: Benefit Description Impact on Creators Transparency & Provenance Blockchain provides an immutable record of IP creation and ownership. Every transaction and modification is recorded on a public ledger, ensuring transparency. Creators can definitively prove ownership and track the history of their IP, reducing disputes and enhancing trust. Decentralized Control Unlike traditional IP systems, blockchain allows creators to maintain greater control over their IP without relying on central authorities. Creators gain autonomy in managing and distributing their IP, fostering innovation and reducing reliance on intermediaries. Efficient Monetization Smart contracts on the blockchain can automate IP licensing and royalty payments, making monetization more efficient and reducing transaction costs. Creators can directly monetize their IP and receive royalties transparently and efficiently, opening up new revenue streams. Global Accessibility Blockchain is inherently global, making IP management and licensing accessible across borders without complex legal frameworks. Creators can easily manage and monetize their IP on a global scale, reaching wider audiences and markets. Enhanced Security Blockchain’s cryptographic security protects IP from unauthorized access, tampering, and infringement. Creators benefit from robust security measures to safeguard their IP assets, reducing the risk of piracy and unauthorized use. How Will Oxford University’s Expertise Enhance AI Agent Negotiation? Oxford University’s involvement is critical to the success of this initiative. Their researchers are at the forefront of AI, particularly in areas like multi-agent systems, negotiation strategies, and natural language processing. Here’s how their expertise will be instrumental: Advanced Negotiation Algorithms: Oxford’s AI experts will contribute to developing sophisticated algorithms that enable AI agents to negotiate effectively. This includes strategies for reaching agreements, resolving conflicts, and optimizing outcomes in various scenarios. Improved Communication Clarity: Miscommunication can be a major hurdle in AI agent interactions.

AI agents vary greatly in their design, capabilities, and communication styles. Creating a framework that accommodates this diversity is a significant technical challenge. Ensuring Security and Privacy: As AI agents communicate and exchange data, ensuring security and privacy is crucial. The framework must incorporate robust security measures to protect against malicious actors and data breaches. Adoption and Standardization: Even with a technically sound framework, widespread adoption is not guaranteed. Convincing different AI developers and organizations to adopt the Agent TCP/IP framework will require significant effort and collaboration across the industry. Ethical and Governance Frameworks: Interoperable AI agents raise complex ethical and governance questions. Who is responsible when agents from different systems interact and potentially cause harm? Establishing clear ethical guidelines and governance frameworks is essential. Balancing Innovation and Standardization: Standardization can sometimes stifle innovation. The challenge will be to create a framework that provides a common foundation while still allowing for innovation and differentiation in AI agent development.

41158252,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=686798,1741116905,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41158252.jpeg,Why is Ripple’s XRP SEC case still ongoing amid the dismissal spree?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-ripples-xrp-sec-case-still-ongoing/,"Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a court battle that has gone on for more than four years now. We can argue that since 2020, there’s never been a moment in time that the XRP community has felt the case will come to a close more than this year. But why hasn’t the lawsuit been dismissed, yet other institutions like Coinbase, Kraken, and OpenSea are in the clear? Here’s why. Since US President Donald Trump made his official comeback to the White House, the SEC has been slowly walking away from its aggressive enforcement approach toward the cryptocurrency industry, which was seen under the Biden administration, led by former chair the infamous Gary Gensler. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg The agency pursued several lawsuits against major crypto firms like Ripple Labs, Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, claiming these platforms violated securities laws. But there could be light at the end of the pitch-black tunnel; the Trump administration loves crypto. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who now leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, recently issued a statement that criticized the previous administration’s reliance on “regulation by enforcement.” She reckoned that “blurry regulatory laws” harmed the American public, stifled the growth of the crypto industry, and “impeded the ability of the Commission’s skilled and dedicated professional staff” to exhaust their expertise in finding a common ground where everyone is satisfied. Still, even though several cases have been thrown out the window, Ripple is still looking for a way to escape the clutch of the financial regulator. And just like members of the XRP family, we are all waiting for the SEC to give us a clear reason why. The SEC vs Ripple: Four years and counting The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, filed in December 2020, alleges that the company illegally raised funds through XRP sales without registering the asset as a security. It also accuses Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen of personally profiting from unregistered XRP sales, amounting to $600 million. The financial watchdog also propounded that Ripple distributed billions of XRP in exchange for services, further violating securities laws. Injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits with interest, civil penalties, failure to provide investor disclosures; to say the SEC fired at Ripple on all fronts is an understatement. In 2023, however, the road became a little clearer when US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple, stating that blind bid-ask sales of XRP did not constitute securities transactions. But the SEC did not want to let this go without a word, as in one of its final actions under Gary Gensler, the agency appealed the ruling on January 15, 2025. Why is the SEC quiet on Ripple? The US financial watchdog has dismissed several cases in recent weeks, some crypto advocates are speaking of an internal resistance within the agency preventing the conclusion of Ripple’s case. On Monday, former SEC Office of Internet Enforcement Chief John Reed Stark said that the speed reversal of crypto enforcement actions could be a good thing for Ripple. “ So this is how the SEC dies. The rapid-fire demolition of the SEC’s crypto-enforcement program continues. SEC investigations of Uniswap & OpenSea officially closed. Dropping of the SEC’s Ripple appeal next up for sure, ” Stark stated. Other legal experts see Ripple pushing for a more favorable settlement, making them in no hurry to see the case end. Through a post on X, Attorney James Murphy speculated that Ripple could be negotiating to vacate Judge Torres’ ruling. “ The Torres decision was unquestionably GREAT for $XRP holders, BUT the finding of securities law violations and the injunction (with attendant ‘bad boy’ provisions) are not so great for Ripple. This is particularly true if Ripple is considering a future exempt securities offering or IPO, ” he wrote. Murphy also predicted the SEC might be willing to accept a settlement where both sides dismiss their appeals and Ripple pays the $125 million fine. Still, he noted that Ripple may be holding out for a better deal. Why? Because the digital asset company could be feeling hard done by facing the heat from regulators, while other organizations like the Ethereum Foundation, operated much more freely. Will Ripple’s connections to the Trump Administration be enough? Ripple has undoubtedly crawled its way to Washington, moving away from the allegations that they supported former Vice President Kamala Harris against President Trump. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has dinner with President Trump. Source/ X The company’s executives have actively sought favor with the new White House leadership, with CEO Brad Garlinghouse meeting Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on January 8. The company seems to be in good spirits with Trump, who is now back in office moving strings to add XRP into his proposed US crypto strategic stockpile. In a Truth Social post made on Sunday, he doubled down his support for digital assets. “ A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! ” Trump wrote . The US President nominated former commissioner Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chair, and the general expectation is that he will bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry at large. Some agency officials could be waiting for new leadership and what influence Trump will have on Atkins, before making a final decision on the case. The SEC might be rolling back its previous enforcement actions, but the mere fact that no action has been taken on matters Ripple, we don’t know when the financial regulator will let go of the lawsuit.",OP-ED|SEC|XRP,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ADA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-04 19:35:05

A significant development is unfolding in Washington that could drastically alter the landscape of digital asset regulation in the US. White House Crypto and AI Advisor David Sacks has thrown his weight behind the movement to repeal the controversial IRS broker rule. This rule, which has sparked widespread debate and concern within the DeFi space, is now facing a crucial Senate vote. Let’s dive into what this means for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, and builder. Why is the IRS Crypto Rule Causing Such a Stir? The proposed IRS crypto rule , often referred to as the ‘broker rule,’ mandates stringent reporting requirements for entities deemed as brokers in the digital asset ecosystem. While seemingly intended to enhance tax compliance, its broad definition of ‘broker’ has sent ripples of anxiety through the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Many argue that the rule’s ambiguity could inadvertently ensnare DeFi protocols, developers, and even individual users in a web of complex and potentially unworkable compliance obligations. Here’s a breakdown of the core concerns: Overly Broad Definition of ‘Broker’: The rule’s language is perceived as too vague, potentially classifying DeFi platforms, wallet providers, and other non-custodial entities as brokers, even though they may not have the necessary information or capabilities to comply with traditional broker reporting requirements. Impact on DeFi Innovation: The burdensome compliance demands could stifle innovation within the rapidly evolving DeFi space. Projects might be forced to relocate overseas or cease operations altogether to avoid regulatory hurdles. Privacy Concerns: Critics worry that the rule could lead to excessive data collection and erosion of user privacy within the crypto ecosystem. Technical Challenges: Implementing the reporting requirements for decentralized and often pseudonymous DeFi protocols presents significant technical challenges. David Sacks Crypto Stance: A Beacon of Hope? Enter David Sacks, the White House Crypto and AI Advisor, who, according to Eleanor Terrett’s report on X, has publicly endorsed the rollback of this contentious IRS crypto rule . Sacks’ support is a significant development, lending considerable weight to the repeal efforts. His position signals a potential shift in White House thinking towards a more balanced and innovation-friendly approach to crypto regulation. For many in the crypto community, Sacks’ backing represents a beacon of hope, suggesting that policymakers are beginning to understand the nuances and unique challenges of the digital asset space. Senate Vote: What’s at Stake for Crypto Tax Regulation? The Senate is poised to vote on the repeal of the IRS crypto rule this week. This vote is a pivotal moment for the future of crypto tax regulation in the United States. The outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the industry, influencing everything from DeFi development and adoption to investor sentiment and capital flows. A successful repeal would be widely celebrated by the crypto community, viewed as a victory for sensible regulation and a commitment to fostering innovation. Conversely, failure to repeal could solidify a regulatory framework perceived as overly restrictive and detrimental to the growth of the digital asset economy. Here’s what’s at stake: Outcome of Senate Vote Potential Impact on Crypto Industry Repeal of IRS Broker Rule Boost to DeFi innovation and growth Reduced compliance burden for crypto businesses Positive market sentiment and increased investment Greater clarity and certainty in crypto regulation Failure to Repeal Stifled DeFi innovation and potential exodus of projects Increased compliance costs and complexity Negative market sentiment and potential capital flight Regulatory uncertainty and chilling effect on crypto adoption Decoding DeFi Regulation: Navigating the Complexities The debate surrounding the IRS crypto rule underscores the broader challenges of DeFi regulation . Decentralized Finance, by its very nature, operates outside the traditional financial system, presenting unique regulatory hurdles. Policymakers are grappling with how to apply existing financial regulations to this novel technology while fostering innovation and protecting consumers. Finding the right balance is crucial. Key considerations for effective DeFi regulation include: Clarity and Specificity: Regulations must be clear, specific, and tailored to the unique characteristics of DeFi, avoiding overly broad or ambiguous language. Risk-Based Approach: Regulation should focus on mitigating genuine risks, such as illicit finance and consumer protection, without unnecessarily stifling innovation. Industry Collaboration: Regulators should engage in ongoing dialogue and collaboration with the crypto industry to understand the technology and develop practical, effective regulations. International Coordination: Given the global nature of crypto, international cooperation is essential to avoid regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. White House Crypto Policy: A Glimpse into the Future David Sacks’ stance on the IRS crypto rule offers a valuable insight into the evolving White House crypto policy . His support for repeal suggests a potential shift towards a more pragmatic and innovation-centric approach. This could signal a broader trend within the Biden administration to create a regulatory environment that fosters responsible crypto innovation while addressing legitimate concerns. The upcoming Senate vote will be a key indicator of the direction of US crypto policy and its commitment to remaining a leader in the digital asset revolution. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto The Senate vote on the IRS broker rule is more than just a procedural step; it’s a defining moment for the crypto industry in the United States. With White House Advisor David Sacks championing the repeal, the stage is set for a potentially transformative outcome. Whether the Senate votes to roll back this controversial rule remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the future of crypto tax regulation and the trajectory of DeFi regulation are hanging in the balance.

This move has caused a lot of speculation, pushing Ethereum (ETH) closer to the $3500 mark as investors want to profit from this opportunity. Meanwhile, a new AI crypto is making waves and attracting retail and institutional investors. With a 125x rally potential, this AI crypto could be the next big crypto. FloppyPepe (FPPE) could outperform Ethereum (ETH) in the coming months despite Ethereum ETF upgrades. ETH Rally To $3500: The Ethereum ETF Effect ETH has experienced a recent price movement increase mainly due to the increasing likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Following the success of the Bitcoin ETF, investors are now moving to the Ethereum ETF, expecting the same price growth. Also, the recent proposal by CBOE and 21Shares to include staking in the Ethereum ETF has increased bullish sentiments. If approved, investors will earn passive rewards while holding the ETF. While the addition of Ethereum ETF helps ETH retain its spot as a top token in the crypto space, FloppyPepe (FPPE), an AI meme coin, is gaining momentum as the next major token for investors looking for massive returns.

According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, North Korean state-sponsored hackers stole approximately $1.4 billion in ETH from Bybit, bridging a significant portion of the assets to Bitcoin. Says Zhou, “Total hacked funds of USD 1.4bn around 500k ETH, 77% are still traceable, 20% has gone dark, 3% have been frozen.” The Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking collective, cracked Bybit’s Ethereum wallets last month in what is believed to be the biggest heist in history. To turn the stolen ETH into BTC, Zhou says that they mostly used THORchain, a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol that allows for the exchange of assets between various chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and the BNB Chain. Zhou says the next two weeks will be critical for freezing the stolen funds at crypto exchanges. “- 83% (417,348 ETH, ~$1B) have been converted into BTC with 6,954 wallets (Average 1.71 btc each). This and the coming week is critical for fund freezing as the funds will start to clear at exchanges, otc and p2p. Hacker mostly used THORChain to clear ETH to BTC – 361,255 ETH or $0.9B, which is 72% was through Thor, which we can trace. – 79,655 ETH ~16% of the funds went dark through ExCH still waiting for update. – 40,233 ETH or $100M, which is 8% was through OKX web3 proxy. Out of them, 16,680 ETH we can trace 23,553 ETH or $65M (~5%) is untraceable which require info from OKX web3 wallet.” ByBit has launched lazarusbounty.com to track stolen funds and offer rewards for assistance in recovery efforts.

Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the undisputed leader of the meme coin sector, maintaining its position as one of the most widely recognized cryptocurrencies. Originally created as just a joke in 2013, Dogecoin’s growth has been nothing short of remarkable, but the main question on everyone's lips is ‘how high can Dogecoin really go?’ Meanwhile, the general meme coin industry has seen a huge surge in popularity in recent years. While early meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB) relied mostly on community engagement, new cryptos are integrating advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and decentralized utilities. The meme coin sector now holds a market cap in the tens of billions, showing that these once-dismissed assets are now a legitimate part of the crypto space. Key Facts About Dogecoin and Meme Coins Before we get started, here are some useful facts to know about Dogecoin and the meme coin market as a whole. Dogecoin Market Cap: Over $28 billion Dogecoin All-Time High (ATH): $0.7376 in May 2021 Meme Coin Industry Market Cap: Over $40 billion New Trends in Meme Coins: AI integration, staking, and real-world applications. Dogecoin Price Analysis: The Critical Resistance Level To Cause A 10x Rise Dogecoin currently trades at $0.2035 (at the time of writing), and crypto analysts are watching a key resistance level near $0.25. Breaking through this barrier could pave the way for DOGE to test $0.50 , a level not seen since the last bull run. Beyond that, if momentum and broader crypto market conditions align, Dogecoin could surge to $2.00, representing a 10x increase from its current price. So, the next time someone asks you ‘Is Dogecoin ever going to hit $1?’ - you can explain this to them. Key Resistance and Support Levels: Resistance: $0.25, $0.50, $1.00 Support: $0.15, $0.10 If Dogecoin can break above the $0.25 point with significant volume and strong buying pressure, it could enter a new rally phase, leading to huge gains once again. The Next Big Meme Coin? Introducing FloppyPepe (FPPE) While Dogecoin is well-known and established in the crypto world, newer meme coins are entering the market with unique utilities. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is one such project gaining significant attention right now. Unlike traditional meme coins, FloppyPepe integrates AI-driven utilities, staking rewards, and a decentralized Meme DAO, allowing their community to participate in decision-making. FloppyPepe has also set an ambitious goal, to create the world’s largest meme wall once they reach a $100M market cap, symbolizing the power of memes in crypto culture. Also, something else that is really cool about the project is that every transaction supports wildlife conservation, making it a meme coin with real-world impact. There are not many cryptos out there that can say that. FPPE is currently trading at $0.0000002, and the project is targeting a 1000x increase, which would position it as one of the most successful launches in the meme coin sector. Dogecoin vs. FloppyPepe: Which Is the Better Investment? Feature Dogecoin (DOGE) FloppyPepe (FPPE) Blockchain Ethereum & Binance Smart Chain (Wrapped) Ethereum Market Cap Potential High (Established, Multi-Billion) High (Early-stage, High Growth Potential) Current Price $0.2035 $0.0000002 Potential Growth 10x 1000x Utility Primarily transactional Staking, AI Video & Meme Generation, Meme DAO Community Involvement Strong and established Rapidly growing Deflationary Mechanism No Yes (Token Burn) AI Integration No Yes (AI Agents) Real-World Impact Minimal Supports Wildlife Conservation Will Dogecoin Break That Resistance Level? Dogecoin will always be a top dog in the meme coin market, and a 10x rise is not out of the question for DOGE, especially if the market conditions align. That being said, there is certainly a new appetite growing for more utility-based meme coins like FloppyPeppe (FPPE). By incorporating meme culture with AI utilities, staking, and strong community engagement, FPPE stands a very strong chance of hitting that 1000x growth. With FloppyPepe’s growing potential, it presents an exciting opportunity for investors looking for the next breakout project in the meme coin market. Act Fast: 60% Bonus on FloppyPepe Presale!

With the AI crypto market projected to reach $66 billion by 2025, investors are searching for projects that merge technology with engaging use cases. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a project that blends meme culture with advanced AI utilities. Unlike a majority of meme coins on the market currently that rely mainly on hype, FloppyPepe’s system is cleverly designed for both entertainment and longevity. FloppyPepe’s Unique AI Features: Meme-o-Matic & FloppyX Two core technologies that are enhancing FloppyPepe’s popularity are Meme-o-Matic and FloppyX. Meme-o-Matic is an AI-driven meme generator which allows users to create their own shareable memes tailored to current trends, Meanwhile, FloppyX is the tech that is used to generate real-time video content, reacting to cultural and market shifts. These two tools work together to make sure that FloppyPepe stays culturally relevant as well as offering features that go beyond the typical meme coin features. Tokenomics Built for Long-Term Growth What separates FloppyPepe from fleeting meme coins is its deflationary tokenomics. with a total supply of 120 trillion tokens, the project incorporates mechanisms that reward long-term holders.

However, digital assets staged a rebound later in the day, buoyed by bullish price action across global stock markets, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is up 0.7% on the day after plunging as much as 2% shortly after the open. Bitcoin rebounded above $88,000 after trading as low as $81,400. Ether briefly traded under $2,000 for the first time since November 2023. XRP gained 3%, while SOL is down 2% in the past 24 hours.

The sudden decline sparked widespread panic and anger across crypto-focused social media channels and has prompted concerns about a potential repeat of the 2022 bear market, according to Santiment’s latest insight. However, optimism briefly resurfaced over the weekend after US President Donald Trump announced the creation of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve, which aims to strengthen the country’s digital finance. The reserve is part of an initiative stemming from an executive order signed in January 2025, which established a task force to develop national cryptocurrency regulations within six months. The market initially responded positively, with Bitcoin and other digital assets surging on expectations of institutional support and regulatory clarity. However, this optimism was short-lived, as a sharp reversal on Monday erased gains and reignited concerns about the initiative’s future. Fear and Frustration Dominate Crypto Social Media A key point of contention among investors is the selection process for assets included in the reserve, particularly the inclusion of XRP, SOL, and ADA. With little information on how the reserve will function, how it will be funded, or its integration into the broader financial system, speculation has dominated discourse. The lack of clarity has led to a mix of skepticism and humor across the crypto community as traders await further details. The upcoming White House Crypto Summit is expected to provide more insights, potentially shaping the regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. Until then, the announcement appears to have played out as a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, Santiment noted . Adding to market volatility, Monday’s sell-off coincided with a significant downturn in traditional equities, as the S&P 500 recorded a 1.8% decline—one of the largest single-day drops in the past year. The correlation between crypto and traditional markets suggests that macroeconomic factors also influence price movements. The company further noted that social sentiment would likely dictate short-term price direction, with recent high-price mentions potentially signaling a market top. On the other hand, discussions of lower Bitcoin targets ($70K-$75K) could indicate a bottom forming as retail investors capitulate. Despite the current wave of “grief and frustration,” historical trends suggest that such extreme negativity often precedes market recoveries. Opportunity Amidst Chaos? A similar sentiment was echoed by CryptoQuant amidst turbulent market conditions, particularly in Bitcoin’s derivatives activity and investor sentiment. According to the report, the Open Interest Change (7D) plummeted by 14.42% on March 1st, which indicated a sharp decline in speculative positions. Such a decrease is often associated with market corrections, potential capitulation, or a reset in trader positioning, which can create buying opportunities during downturns. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has experienced a drastic shift as it dropped from 72 (extreme greed) on February 4th to 26 (fear), reflecting growing investor caution. Historically, extreme greed levels above 70 have signaled market tops, while fear-driven declines often precede rebounds as per CryptoQuant. The concerns over US government-held crypto reserves and upcoming regulatory discussions continue to impact the market. CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that while sentiment remains fragile, the combination of declining open interest and fear-driven selling may present strategic entry points for long-term investors.

Sacks says he also owned a $74,000 position in a Bitwise exchange-traded fund, which he sold on January 22nd, two days after Trump’s inauguration. Sacks previously served as PayPal’s chief operating officer (COO) and is a high-profile venture capitalist who has invested in Airbnb, Palantir, Postmates, Reddit, Slack, SpaceX, Twitter, Uber and other big-name tech companies. He’s also sunk capital into crypto projects, including participating in a $10 million Series A round for the decentralized exchange (DEX) dYdX ( DYDX ) in 2018 via his growth fund Craft Ventures. The Financial Times, citing “a person with knowledge of the matter,” reports that Craft Ventures still holds stakes in “a small number” of crypto startups, though the firm also sold off its direct crypto holdings. Trump confirmed over the weekend that the US will establish a “crypto strategic reserve,” noting that it is primed to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP , Solana and Cardano ( ADA ). Trump framed the reserve as a response to what he called “corrupt attacks” on the crypto industry by the Biden Administration, emphasizing his goal to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

He also added that he has allocated the remaining 30% of his portfolio to Gold. The entrepreneur, whose net worth is estimated to be roughly $5.8 billion, is a known Bitcoin proponent who on several occasions showed support for the digital asset. The Mexican billionaire disclosed in 2021 that he was working to make his bank the first in Mexico to accept BTC. Salinas allocates 70% of his investment portfolio to BTC Ricardo Salinas revealed in an interview with Bloomberg that he has allocated 70% of his investment portfolio in BTC. The outspoken billionaire also said that 30% of his investment portfolio was in gold and gold miners. Mexico’s third-richest individual said that he doesn’t possess stakes in bonds, and the only stocks he owned were those that belong to his group of companies. “I’ve got about 70% in Bitcoin-related exposure and 30% in gold and gold miners. I don’t have a single bond and I don’t have any other stocks except my own.” – Ricardo Salinas . He also highlighted that the 70% figure was notably far above the 10% he had allocated to the digital asset back in 2020. The CEO of TV Azteca, Mexico’s number two TV broadcaster, is also facing several tax cases with the Mexican government. The government has accused Salinas of owing over 63 billion pesos ($3 billion) in taxes, which has initiated court cases between both parties. Ricardo Salinas Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg The Mexican businessman denied the allegations by the government and argued that there might be an error. He maintained that the computation of his alleged back taxes was due to an accounting error that resulted in his double billing. The billionaire is now contesting the penalties that he accrued while the case is ongoing. Salinas acknowledged that he was willing to pay his dues, but he would not pay them twice. Salinas plans to delist Grupo Elektra The Mexican entrepreneur also revealed that he plans to delist Grupo Elektra, his flagship company. He highlighted that the move came after years of fighting to defend the share price of the flagship and a months-long trading halt in 2024. Salinas also argued that the delisting would enable him to run his company as he sees fit and without any public pressure. Elektra noted that the move was aimed to reorganize and strengthen the company’s extensive and diverse assets and “to find tools to maximize its real value.” He also revealed that he’ll get the delisting done by around May, in part because only 0.3% of shares remain outstanding. The company was widely covered by analysts in the wake of Salinas’ 2012 battle with Mexico’s stock exchange. At the time, the exchange wanted to remove the firm’s stock from the benchmark IPC index due to allegations that the company was manipulating the amount of floating shares in the market. The firm won a court order to guarantee its position, which locked in sustained flows from exchange-traded funds. Elektra’s stock price surged over the following years, reaching an all-time high of 1,631 pesos in June of 2021. At the time, the firm was the country’s most expensive by far even though trading volumes were a fraction of other companies. Luciano Pascoe, the head of Salinas’ news network ADN 40 and a spokesman for Grupo Salinas, said that the decision to exit the Mexican stock market was a “very brave decision.” He also argued that speculation had been putting the firm below its real value for a long time and that was why it left the stock market. Pascoe believes that the company was in a more solid position for a more prosperous future. The Mexican businessman posted a video on his personal blog where he avoided directly addressing the delisting and thanked his employees for a “great year.” He said that despite a complicated environment and despite the thousands of problems that always exist, “we move ahead.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

President Donald Trump’s initiation of a global trade war—with steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China—has sent shockwaves through global markets. As these policies led to billions wiped out overnight and unprecedented market volatility, even digital assets like Ethereum have felt the impact, dropping significantly from their previous highs. The ensuing chaos has heightened concerns over risk assets, with crypto markets losing billions in market cap in just 24 hours. This turbulence raises critical questions about whether current setbacks for cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum are short-lived corrections or the start of a broader trend. In this article, we delve into the current market trends, examining the effects of geopolitical pressures on crypto prices and exploring whether these digital currencies might stage a comeback. Discover which digital coins could be primed for growth, offering potential opportunities amidst the global economic storm. Ripple XRP: Volatility and a 6-Month Surge XRP experienced a 19% decline over the last month, reflecting a period of volatility. In contrast, the asset has enjoyed a dramatic 316% increase over the past six months, showcasing significant long-term strength. A slight recovery of 1.7% in the last week indicates a potential for short-term positioning within a market that has displayed considerable price swings. The established range between $1.60 and $2.88 highlights both the risk and opportunity that XRP presents for investors. Currently, trading is focused within a defined range, with key resistance levels at $3.61 and a stronger ceiling at $4.89. Support is identified near $1.06, where bears are currently applying some pressure. Technical indicators reflect slight negative momentum, highlighted by an RSI reading of 45.53, suggesting the absence of a strong bullish trend. Traders may look to the $3.61 level for potential breakout opportunities or may consider accumulating shares around the $1.06 support level as the market seeks clarity. Ethereum Price Analysis Amid Bearish Pressure Ethereum prices dropped by 32.65% over the past month and fell 14.43% over the last six months. The decline reflects steady weakening that has kept traders alert for shifts in momentum. Price fluctuations during this period underscored market uncertainty and emphasized the need for cautious strategies as momentum indicators turned negative, while the overall trend remained lower. The current price range lies between $1766 and $3020, with a key support level at $1294 and resistance around $3804. Bearish signals dominate with a momentum indicator of -667.82, an RSI near 33.30, and overall negative recommendations, suggesting a lack of a clear upward trend. Traders might consider short-term positions within these levels, watching for potential breakdowns below support or failed attempts to breach resistance. Conclusion XRP and ETH are going through a tough time. The market dip could be a short-term issue or a sign of deeper trouble. Investors should keep an eye on market trends and news. Both coins have shown resilience in the past. This phase could be a buying opportunity or a signal to wait and watch. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining the direction of these assets.

Buffeted about by Trump's tariff threats for weeks, stocks and crypto initially were sharply lower today as the levies against Mexico, Canada and China actually went into effect. Dip-buyers emerged late in the U.S. morning, though, and with a bit more than an hour to go before the close of stock trading, the Nasdaq is sporting a 0.7% advance on the session. The S&P 500 has narrowed a large early loss to just 0.25%. Trading just above $88,000, bitcoin is now ahead 1.5% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) continues to underperform, flat over that time frame at $2,171. Tuesday's action continues a wild 10-day ride for bitcoin, which plunged more than 20% in about a six-day period from Feb. 21 to just above $78,000, only to rebound more than 20% to about $95,000 over the following three days before tumbling anew yesterday and this morning to the $81,000 level. A check of crypto-related stocks today finds Strategy (MSTR) ahead 11%, Coinbase (COIN) up 4% and Marathon Holdings (MARA) with a 5% gain. Green shoots? It's been a difficult few weeks for risk assets, but the downturn may also be creating the conditions for an eventual rebound. It wasn't long ago when markets had all but written off the chance for any Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 and the 10-year Treasury yield was threatening to rise above 5%. The tariffs, though, have combined with some weakish economic data and the tumble in markets to change that calculus . Interest rate traders have now fully priced in three or more Fed rate cuts this year, with the first move coming as soon as May. The 10-year Treasury yield, in turn, has pulled back to 4.15% from 4.80% at the time of the Trump inauguration six weeks ago.",Markets|Bitcoin|Nasdaq,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-04 19:54:03

Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, expects the cryptocurrency to do “better than $150,000” by the end of 2025. Related Reading: BTC Repeats Historic Pattern—Is a Breakout Toward $100K Next? His latest comments come as Bitcoin struggles with recent volatility but remains a popular investment choice among institutional and retail traders. The co-founder of Fundstrat expressed his opinions on CNBC’s Squawk Box, referencing a variety of favorable fundamentals for the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Volatility And Market Movements In recent months, the top coin has had a lot of ups and downs. In February 2025, the top cryptocurrency saw a nearly 24% decline, which caused some investors to lose faith. In spite of this, the current price of Bitcoin is nearly $84,500. During the day, it fluctuated between a high of $90,400 and a low of $82,500. Lee, nevertheless, is unconcerned with the fluctuations and thinks that BTC’s long-term prospects surpass its short-term declines. JUST IN: Expect Bitcoin go higher than $150,000 this year, says Fundstrat’s Tom Lee pic.twitter.com/z0mGAPe16b — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) March 3, 2025 Institutional Support And Broader Adoption Growing participation of significant financial actors is one of the main causes of Lee’s confidence. Companies like Citadel have entered the crypto space to give Bitcoin more legitimacy. The alpha coin’s use case gets stronger for future expansion the more conventional institutions interact with digital assets. “I think Bitcoin makes a beeline back towards its long-term trend line, which is probably $82,000 in the near term, $150,000 before year-end,” says @fundstrat‘s Tom Lee as $BTC closes in on its all-time high. pic.twitter.com/g4p6VOTECx — Last Call (@LastCallCNBC) March 5, 2024 Other financial behemoths also show great optimism for Bitcoin. Both Bitwise and Standard Chartered project Bitcoin to reach $200,000 in 2025. Such forecasts support Lee’s point of view and confirm that Bitcoin still has lots of space to expand. Government Influence On Bitcoin’s Future Regulatory decisions could also play a role in Bitcoin’s performance this year. United States President Donald Trump recently declared his intention to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. This action suggests that the government is becoming more interested in digital assets, which could affect market sentiment and raise prices. At the same time, regulatory uncertainty still influences changes in the price of Bitcoin. Even if institutional usage is growing, market observers will closely monitor any changes to regulations that may have an impact on the future of cryptocurrencies.

He says that there are often short, unpredictable bursts of growth for the coin. He says it’s dangerous to try to time the market. Instead, it might be smarter to hold on to Bitcoin for a long time. Bitcoin’s price isn’t stable at all, but buyers are still interested in it because it has a history of strong recovery. If Lee is right, 2025 could be another big year for the biggest coin in the world.

ETH Price Crashes 12% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, seems to be struggling and is poised for a massive price drop due to a notable decline in the past 24 hours. On March 4, 2025, with a 12% price drop, Ether has breached one of its crucial support levels, which it had been holding since December 2023. Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level This breakdown has partially shifted market sentiment toward the bearish side. According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears bearish as it has fallen below the crucial support level of $2,200. Following this breakdown, the altcoin has cleared its path for a further price decline. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ETH closes a daily candle below the $2,065 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 26% to reach the next support at $1,500 in the coming days. With a continuous price decline, ETH has fallen far from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating that the asset is in a downtrend. Bullish On-Chain Metrics Despite the bearish price action and continues price drop, whales and long-term seems to be accumulating the token, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass and the blockchain-based transactions tracker Lookonchain. Whales’ Buy $10.40 Million Worth of ETH In a recent post on X (Previously Twitter) Lookonchain noted that a crypto whale know as 7 siblings has once again spent $10.36 million and has purchased a 4,993 ETH at an average price of $2,075.

Amid a global trade war sparked by Trump's heavy tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, markets have been thrown into chaos with billions wiped out overnight. This turbulence has intensified the search for promising digital assets as traditional markets tumble. With investors seeking safe havens in the midst of widespread volatility, attention is shifting to alternative cryptocurrencies. This article delves into three promising coins—Pepe, SUI, and Stacks—that could offer potential growth despite the economic storm. Their low entry costs and unique value propositions make them attractive in an environment where every dollar counts. Discover which coins are poised to rise and why they might be worth considering during these uncertain times. Pepe Price Trends and Key Levels Analysis The coin dropped by around 43% over the last month, with a moderate 6-month decline of nearly 6% and a recent one-week dip of 12%. Price action over these periods has shown marked weakness in the short term while maintaining a less steep retreat over half a year. Past performance reflects a volatile phase characterized by sharp monthly losses alongside a more tempered longer-term move. Current trading ranges between approximately $0.00000534 and $0.00001239. Resistance is seen around $0.00001686 and $0.00002390, with support near $0.00000278. Bears appear to control the market in the near term, as momentum and indicator readings point to slight oversold conditions. Watching for a bounce off support and a break above the lower resistance could provide potential entry points. Sui Price Action: 6-Month Surge Amid a 1-Month Bearish Correction Past month performance shows a steep decline of about 34% coupled with a recent one-week drop of roughly 13%, reflecting immediate selling pressure. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a significant surge of approximately 204%, highlighting strong long-term gains amidst short-term setbacks. Current prices trade between about $2.11 and $3.83 with key levels marked by nearest support near $1.40 and resistance around 4.84 dollars. Bears currently dominate with negative momentum and a low RSI near 36, suggesting a lack of clear upward trend. Traders might consider watching for a bounce at support or test resistance as potential entry points. Stacks (STX): Sharp Decline with Critical Support Levels in Focus STX saw a significant decline of 43.42% over the past month and a total drop of 52.99% in the last six months, highlighting a strong bearish trend. The price has consistently trended downward, accompanied by notable weekly pullbacks, reflecting a market sentiment that remains cautious about further declines and is testing lower support levels. Current prices are fluctuating between $0.58 and $1.21, with key support identified at $0.32 and nearest resistance at $1.60. Bears currently have the upper hand, while technical indicators like the RSI at 31.81 suggest oversold conditions. Traders may consider hunting for entry points near the support level, looking for potential signs of a price recovery. Conclusion PEPE , SUI , and STX present attractive opportunities at current lower prices. Each has unique features and potential for growth in the crypto market. PEPE offers a community-driven approach, SUI focuses on advancing blockchain technology, and STX enhances Bitcoin's functionality. Investing in these tokens now could provide significant returns as their value increases. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin traded for $82,300 at 11:40am ET on Tuesday, before rallying above $88,300 within the next three hours. It trades for $88,000 at writing time. Per a report from Seeking Alpha published at noon, Fink said that “the world is fine” despite US tariffs that are spooking markets. “It’s not as bad as it was in the ’60s in the United States,” he said at the RBC Capital Markets Global Financial Institutions Conference, claiming that investors should buy if there’s a big dip.”People are pausing, consumers are pausing, businesses are pausing.” Two to three years out, Fink predicted that technology – especially AI – will prove very deflationary. “I believe we’re getting set up for a big economic boom,” he added. “Trends are going to be net positive in the long run for the United States.” Fink’s statement follows a recent report from BlackRock highlighting Bitcoin inelastic supply, and how “if every millionaire in the US asked their financial advisor to get them 1 bitcoin, there wouldn’t be enough.” BTC has osscilated between $80,000 and $93,000 for the past three days, with much volatility triggered after President Trump confirmed that he plans for a multi-asset Crypto Strategic Reserve, including BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, and XRP.

""'This all stops in April.' 'This all stops in June.' 'This all stops in December.' No, it’s not stopping,"" Bukele posted on X on Tuesday afternoon. ""If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most 'bitcoiners' abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining."" Bukele's social media post came shortly after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published more details about its $3.5 billion deal with the Latin American nation. The IMF claimed as part of the loan package to have imposed a prohibition of ""voluntary accumulation of bitcoin by the public sector."" Perhaps in response to the IMF posting, or perhaps not, El Salvador late Monday night disclosed the purchase of 19 bitcoin over the previous seven days and then on Tuesday afternoon disclosed the purchase of one additional token on top of that. The IMF news drew a number online howls by bitcoiners, including from Samson Mow, who has at least previously been close to President Bukele. ""No more #Bitcoin buys for El Salvador,"" said Mow earlier on Tuesday . ""The buys will all stop within a few months,"" he said later after the country did indeed make an additional purchase. The Salvadoran government currently holds 6,101.15 bitcoin, worth roughly $530 million at bitcoin's current price of around $88,000.

With massive developments, strategic partnerships, and rising adoption, these three stand out in the sea of digital assets. While Monero remains a top privacy coin and Helium is disrupting IoT, Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain with its real-world asset tokenization and cutting-edge non-custodial multi-chain wallet. So what makes these three the best cryptos to join for the long term ? Let’s break it down. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain with Real-World Use Cases Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain by making asset tokenization a reality. With its advanced non-custodial multi-chain wallet and partnerships with 1inch and SWFT Blockchain, it’s positioning itself as the ultimate DeFi solution. The partnership with SWFT Blockchain enhances the Qubetics Wallet, offering seamless, cross-chain transactions with unmatched security. Users can manage a wide range of cryptocurrencies in one secure platform, with advanced encryption ensuring top-tier protection. Meanwhile, the 1inch integration enables Qubetics users to trade across multiple decentralized exchanges effortlessly. This means optimized pricing, deeper liquidity, and an intuitive user experience—all within a single platform. The Qubetics crypto presale is in its 24th stage, with over 495 million tokens sold to 22,100+ holders, raising more than $14.5 million. At $0.0976 per token, this might be one of the most promising opportunities right now. The numbers speak for themselves. Analysts predict that the current $TICS price of $0.0976 could skyrocket post-presale, reaching $0.25, delivering a 155% ROI. And if Qubetics hits $1 after the presale, that’s a 923% gain. Some projections even suggest a $10-$15 price point after the mainnet launch, which would mean a staggering 15,255% ROI. With over 22,100 holders already on board, Qubetics isn’t just another name in crypto—it’s a movement reshaping digital finance. Monero (XMR): The King of Privacy Coins Monero has long been the go-to privacy coin, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have transparent ledgers, Monero offers untraceable transactions, making it the top choice for those prioritizing financial privacy. Monero’s adaptive block size, stealth addresses, and ring signatures make it one of the most secure cryptos in circulation. And with a growing user base, it remains a strong contender for those looking for an alternative to mainstream digital assets. With recent price surges and an increasing demand for privacy in financial transactions, Monero continues to be one of the best cryptos to join for the long term. Helium (HNT): Powering the Future of IoT Helium is another rising star, revolutionizing the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. The Helium Network allows users to provide wireless coverage and earn HNT rewards in return. By utilizing blockchain technology, Helium is creating a decentralized and cost-effective way to power IoT devices globally. With major brands and businesses integrating Helium into their operations, the demand for HNT tokens has soared. Companies looking for reliable and low-cost IoT solutions are turning to Helium, making it a key player in the Web3 revolution. Its unique Proof-of-Coverage mechanism ensures network reliability while rewarding participants fairly. As IoT devices become more essential in everyday life, Helium’s network will likely see widespread adoption, making HNT one of the best cryptos to join for the long term. Qubetics Partners with SWFT Blockchain for Next-Gen Wallet Innovation Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain is setting a new benchmark in DeFi. The Qubetics Wallet, now powered by SWFT Blockchain’s technology, offers unmatched cross-chain functionality, allowing lightning-fast swaps between multiple blockchains. This isn’t just about speed—it’s about security, too. SWFT Blockchain’s encryption protocols make the Qubetics Wallet one of the safest on the market. Whether managing assets or swapping tokens, users can expect an efficient and secure experience. This collaboration cements Qubetics’ position as a game-changer in the DeFi space, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with decentralized finance. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term in 2025 Qubetics , Monero, and Helium are all making waves for different reasons. Qubetics is reshaping digital finance with real-world asset tokenization and a powerful non-custodial multi-chain wallet. Monero continues to dominate the privacy coin sector, while Helium is leading the way in decentralized IoT solutions. For those looking at long-term crypto opportunities, these three projects offer innovation, utility, and serious growth potential. With the Qubetics presale in its final stages, now might be the last chance to grab $TICS before prices surge.

Lukashenko was speaking on March 4 at the government meeting at which Alexei Kushnarenko was appointed to the top energy position. “We have an excess of electricity. Let them make this cryptocurrency and so on. You see the way the world is going. Especially the largest economy in the world,” Lukashenko said at the meeting with a nod to the U.S. proposed cryptocurrency reserve. Lukashenko is bullish on Belarusian crypto mining “Maybe we should do it ourselves. Why do we attract some investors, sell them electricity? Although I don’t rule it out. But you have to do it yourself. There are such proposals,” Lukashenko said . He ordered the minister to “step over the bureaucracy” and report on what needs to be done to encourage the crypto industry. Lukashenko was reelected in January and is assembling his government now. Belarus has a surplus of power thanks to the launch of the second unit of the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant in May 2023. The construction of a second nuclear power plant has also been under discussion . The power grid was still an issue though, Lukashenko noted at the March 4 government meeting, referring to the wind storm that killed six and left 330 towns and villages in southern Belarus without power. Belarusian interest in crypto mining is not new Interest in crypto is not new in Belarus. Former energy minister and current deputy prime minister Viktor Karankevich announced in December 2023 that crypto mining farms were already active in the country. Interest in crypto mining was increasing among Russian and Chinese investors and the power system was ready to handle it. The reaction to foreign investors’ interest was slow-paced. In December 2024, Deputy Energy Minister Denis Moroz said there was lively interest in crypto mining in Belarus, which already consumed 120 MW. Meetings were being held with investors and consultants. “We see huge prospects, there are many requests. I think that we will see the implementation of new projects in the near future,” Moroz said. Crypto industry investors can enjoy favorable rates on energy due to their high consumption. Belarus to have a CBDC? Lukashenko said in January that Belarus may create its own national cryptocurrency. Experts and the government were already looking into it. “It suits us to make payments in cryptocurrency. We are working on a cryptocurrency in Belarus. We have extra electric energy. We are making the best of it,” he said . According to the Russian information service RBC, Belarusian citizens have legally owned and traded cryptocurrencies since 2017. In September, Lukashenko signed a decree banning the use of foreign crypto platforms for peer-to-peer transactions as a way to avoid scams. Trading on those platforms was not banned. Crypto firms in Belarus are required to be residents of the Belarus High Technology Park. The country’s largest bank, state-owned Belarusbank, teamed up with park resident WhiteBird in 2020 to offer crypto services. Park residents are given preferential tax treatment. Russian financial group Finam declared its interest in opening crypto services in Belarus in December 2023. It is not clear if those plans ever came to fruition.

While the President did not directly mandate that these assets be included in ETFs, his proposal to add them to a strategic reserve was seen by the market as an indirect endorsement. Analysts suggest Trump’s support could ease regulatory concerns and strengthen applications for ETFs based on these altcoins. “The inclusion of XRP in a strategic reserve strengthens the case for XRP ETF applications by helping to address some of the key regulatory concerns,” Jonathan de Wet, chief investment officer at crypto trading firm Zerocap, said in an interview. But some industry experts are urging caution. Trump’s proposal, which would prioritize Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as reserve assets, lacks a clear timeline and would likely require congressional approval before being implemented. Related News: This Altcoin Gets Proposed For ""The Most Important Update In Its History"", The Price Suddenly Turns Green While The Entire Market Is In The Red “We assume some sort of bill needs to pass Congress, and in my view it’s very unlikely that the reserve will look exactly as proposed,” said Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares. Zach Burks, CEO of NFT marketplace Mintable, dismissed the significance of Trump’s comments, arguing that XRP and Cardano have little strategic value to the U.S. government. “They are nothing compared to the strategic gold reserves that the U.S. holds,” Burks said. Despite regulatory uncertainty, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing ETF applications for XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Trump’s strong support for crypto and his own initiatives in the sector, including a memecoin project, have fueled expectations that these ETFs could eventually gain approval. Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer at Bitpace, a crypto payment gateway, believes Trump’s push for a strategic reserve will positively impact ETF approvals. “The reserve call should accelerate approvals for ETFs like Solana and XRP,” Habibi said. Despite the short-term volatility, analysts suggest that a resurgence in Bitcoin and potential SEC-approved altcoin ETFs could lead to renewed institutional interest and price gains for these assets. “In an optimistic scenario, I think XRP and Solana will garner more institutional interest and likely attract higher fund flows,” Nolan said. *This is not investment advice.

The Cardano price was last around $0.93, over 20% up from its earlier lows and re-igniting hopes that the cryptocurrency could soon retest the highs it hit above $1.30 last December. Broader risk appetite in financial markets took a substantial turn for the better on Tuesday, despite Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, which just came into force. Positive rhetoric from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy regarding the possibility of signing a minerals deal with the USA that could soon end the Ukraine/Russia war could be bolstering sentiment. I would like to reiterate Ukraine’s commitment to peace. None of us wants an endless war. Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under… — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) March 4, 2025 Perhaps more important could be the market’s growing confidence that the Fed will deliver more rate cuts this year to protect against any incoming protracted US economic malaise. Per the CME Fed Watch tool , the market’s base case now appears to be for three rate cuts this year, as opposed to bets for only one or even zero just weeks ago. Whatever the reason for the turnaround, Cardano is looking very bullish right now. Its Sunday surge on Trump’s crypto reserve announcement saw it break above a medium-term downtrend. And Tuesday’s rebound from intraday lows, when the Cardano price was retesting this former downtrend, is a strong technical signal that the bulls have regained control of this market. Chart analysis now suggests a strong likelihood that the Cardano price’s next move will be back toward its late 2024 highs in the $1.30 area. How High Can the Cardano Price Go in 2025? Whilst Tuesday has in the end turned into a macro risk-on day, macro risks remain elevated with Trump still intent on pursuing trade wars, and a US economic slowdown still very much on the horizon as D.O.G.E austerity reduces fiscal stimulus. This remains a very complicated macro backdrop for crypto traders to navigate, with a lot of two-way volatility likely. That said, the outlook for the Cardano price remains tilted very much to the upside, and not just because of the aforementioned technical buy signal. The Trump admin appears intent on including Cardano, alongside other “made in America” cryptos like Solana and XRP , in its crypto reserve. JUST IN: CARDANO $ADA STRATEGIC RESERVE pic.twitter.com/CCuIHMNmXJ — TapTools (@TapTools) March 2, 2025 This represents a major upside wild card for Cardano, as does the potential for the US Treasury to adopt Cardano as its decentralized and transparent payment ledger. Couple this with the high likelihood that spot Cardano ETFs receive approval in 2025, and it’s obvious that 2025 could be a record year of adoption for the crypto. Moreover, Cardano’s push to become the go-to Bitcoin DeFi side-chain could also be a major narrative.

Wainwright & Co. analyst Mike Colonnese. In a research note to investors dated March 4, Colonnese argued the sharp pullback in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and mining stocks as temporary, while maintaining a bullish long-term outlook for BTC. Bitcoin’s recovery Tuesday afternoon means the largest coin by market cap is down around 5.6% in 2025, while Bitcoin mining stocks have plummeted by around 25%. Colonnese attributes the selling pressure to macroeconomic issues, rather than fundamental weaknesses in the crypto sector. “Tariffs, sticky inflation, a hawkish Fed, and austerity measures the government is taking through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have worked together to create a risk-off environment for equities and cryptocurrencies,” he noted. With these macroeconomic headwinds persisting, the analyst believes in a “neutral-to-cautious stance” on Bitcoin in the short term. However, the underperformance in mining stocks represents an attractive entry point for investors to take advantage of.

While mining stocks could indeed face further downside pressure, the current level offers significant upside for investors looking for leveraged exposure to Bitcoin ahead of its next bullish phase. The analyst maintained his 2025 Bitcoin price target of $225,000, implying significant potential for both Bitcoin and mining stocks.

The initiative, which Trump shared details about on Sunday, would involve the government holding a reserve of digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). Critics raised concerns that individuals within the administration with ties to these assets could stand to gain from the move. Sacks, a venture capitalist with previous crypto investments, quickly became a focal point of the controversy. Over the weekend and into Monday, he responded on X (formerly Twitter), rejecting accusations that he had a financial interest in the policy. He stated that he had divested from all of his personal crypto-related holdings before joining the administration, including his stake in Multicoin Capital, a crypto-focused investment firm. One lingering question, however, was whether Craft Ventures — Sacks’ venture capital firm — had retained its investment in Bitwise, a crypto index fund manager that Sacks helped fund back in 2017. Bitwise’s investment products include an ETF that holds all the assets mentioned in Trump’s strategic reserve plan, raising concerns that it could benefit from the government’s crypto purchases. On Tuesday, a source close to Craft Ventures confirmed to CoinDesk that the fund exited its position into Bitwise prior to the start of the President's second administration. The Craft Ventures website was also updated on Tuesday to reflect that it had exited its Bitwise investment in January 2025. Craft Ventures, Bitwise and Sacks have yet to comment publicly on the apparent exit. The source close to Craft Ventures told CoinDesk that the firm has not commented publicly so as not to disrupt Sacks' government clearance process, which is currently ongoing. In his social media defense, Sacks dismissed the entire controversy. “The accusation that people who are already very successful in business go into government to make more money is a lazy and stupid narrative,” he wrote . “As I’ve learned, serving in government involves substantial disruption and divestiture of one’s business interests.” The debate over Trump’s proposed reserve continues to divide the crypto community . Some of the president’s crypto supporters argue that a Bitcoin-only reserve would be preferable, while others question whether the government should be involved in digital asset holdings at all — arguing that government intervention in the crypto space contradicts the industry's decentralized ideals. Conflict of interest questions also continue to swirl around the president, himself.

One such leap comes from Cohere for AI, which has just unleashed Aya Vision AI , a groundbreaking multimodal AI model that they boldly claim is ‘best-in-class’. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy investors, understanding advancements in AI, especially open-source initiatives, is crucial as these technologies could reshape industries and investment landscapes. What Makes Aya Vision AI a Game Changer? Cohere for AI, the nonprofit research arm of AI startup Cohere, has introduced Aya Vision, an ‘open’ multimodal AI model designed to bridge the performance gap across languages in understanding both text and images. This isn’t just another AI model; it’s a strategic move towards democratizing advanced technology. Here’s why Aya Vision is making waves: Multilingual Mastery: Aya Vision operates in 23 major languages, breaking down language barriers in AI applications. This is critical in our globalized world, mirroring the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies. Versatile Visual Understanding: It excels at tasks like generating image captions, answering questions about photos, translating text within images, and summarizing visual content. Think about analyzing global market trends visually represented in charts, regardless of the language they are presented in. Accessibility via WhatsApp: Cohere is making Aya Vision freely accessible through WhatsApp, broadening its reach to researchers and developers worldwide. This mirrors the open and accessible ethos of many blockchain projects. Open Source Commitment: Available under a Creative Commons 4.0 license via Hugging Face, Aya Vision encourages community-driven innovation, a principle deeply rooted in the open-source and crypto communities. Why is Multimodal AI Important for the Future? Multimodal AI Models like Aya Vision are significant because they process and understand different types of data – in this case, text and images – in conjunction. This capability is becoming increasingly crucial for real-world applications. Imagine: Enhanced Data Analysis: Analyzing news articles with accompanying charts or infographics in multiple languages to gauge market sentiment more accurately. Improved Global Communication: Facilitating seamless communication and information exchange across different linguistic and cultural contexts within the crypto space. More Intuitive User Interfaces: Creating more natural and user-friendly interfaces for blockchain applications that respond to both visual and textual inputs. Cohere highlights that Aya Vision AI directly addresses the existing gap in AI performance across different languages, especially in tasks involving both text and images. This focus on inclusivity and global applicability resonates strongly with the decentralized and international nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Aya Vision 32B vs. 8B: What’s the Difference? Aya Vision comes in two versions, catering to different needs and computational resources: Feature Aya Vision 32B Aya Vision 8B Complexity More sophisticated, higher parameter count (32 billion) Less complex, lower parameter count (8 billion) Performance Outperforms models twice its size, including Meta’s Llama-3.2 90B Vision on certain benchmarks. Sets a ‘new frontier’ in visual AI . Outperforms models ten times its size on some evaluations. Highly efficient. Use Cases Demanding tasks requiring top-tier performance and accuracy. Applications where efficiency and speed are prioritized, or in resource-constrained environments. Commercial Use Not permitted under the Creative Commons 4.0 license with Cohere’s acceptable use addendum. For research and non-commercial applications only. Not permitted under the Creative Commons 4.0 license with Cohere’s acceptable use addendum. For research and non-commercial applications only. Both models are available on Hugging Face under a Creative Commons 4.0 license, emphasizing their accessibility to the research community. However, it’s important to note that commercial applications are currently restricted. The Power of Synthetic Data in Training Visual AI A fascinating aspect of Aya Vision’s development is its training methodology. Cohere utilized synthetic annotations – AI-generated labels for data – to train the model. This approach is gaining traction in the AI world as the availability of real-world data becomes limited. Gartner estimates that a significant portion of data used for AI projects is now synthetically created. Benefits of Synthetic Data: Resource Efficiency: Cohere achieved competitive performance with Aya Vision while using fewer computational resources, showcasing the efficiency of synthetic data. Accessibility for Researchers: This efficiency is particularly beneficial for researchers with limited access to extensive computing power, democratizing AI development further. Overcoming Data Scarcity: Synthetic data provides a way to train powerful visual AI models even when real-world datasets are scarce or expensive to acquire. While synthetic data offers numerous advantages, it also presents challenges, such as potential biases embedded in the synthetic data generation process. However, its increasing adoption highlights its crucial role in advancing AI, especially in resource-constrained environments. Addressing the AI Evaluation Crisis with AyaVisionBench Cohere didn’t just release Aya Vision; they also introduced AyaVisionBench, a new benchmark suite. This is critical because the AI industry is facing what’s termed an ‘evaluation crisis’. Traditional benchmarks often provide aggregate scores that don’t accurately reflect a model’s real-world proficiency. AyaVisionBench aims to rectify this by: Probing Vision-Language Skills: It’s designed to rigorously test a model’s abilities in vision-language tasks, like identifying differences between images or converting screenshots to code. Providing a Robust Framework: Offering a more ‘broad and challenging’ framework for evaluating cross-lingual and multimodal AI model understanding. Pushing Multilingual Evaluation Forward: Making the evaluation set available to the research community to foster advancements in multilingual multimodal evaluations. By focusing on more nuanced and real-world relevant evaluations, AyaVisionBench represents a step towards more meaningful assessments of AI capabilities, ensuring that progress in open source AI is measured against practical applications and diverse linguistic contexts. Conclusion: A Vision for a More Inclusive AI Future Cohere’s Aya Vision is more than just a new AI benchmark ; it’s a statement about the future of AI development. By prioritizing multilingual capabilities, open access, and efficient training methods, Cohere is paving the way for a more inclusive and accessible AI landscape. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, this signifies the growing convergence of AI and decentralized technologies, promising exciting new possibilities for innovation and global collaboration. As Aya Vision continues to evolve and inspire further research, we can anticipate a future where AI truly understands and serves a diverse, global audience.

41161535,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136838,1741123665,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Shocking ETH Price Drop: Ethereum Plummets Below $2,000 For First Time Since November 2023",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-drop-below-2000/,"Get ready for a jolt in the crypto world! If you’ve been keeping a close watch on the market, you’ve likely noticed some significant shifts. Today, we’re diving deep into a rather concerning development for Ethereum enthusiasts: the ETH price has experienced a dramatic plunge, falling below the critical $2,000 mark. This is a level we haven’t seen since November 2023, sending ripples of concern and speculation throughout the crypto community. Let’s unpack what’s happening, why it matters, and what this could mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader digital asset landscape. Why is the Ethereum Price Experiencing This Shocking Drop? The crypto market is known for its volatility, but even seasoned investors can feel a tremor when a major player like Ethereum experiences a significant downturn. The ETH price drop below $2,000 isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a noteworthy event that warrants a closer examination. Several factors could be contributing to this current market pressure: Broader Market Correction: The entire crypto market has been experiencing a period of correction. Bitcoin, often seen as the bellwether of the crypto space, has also faced downward pressure. When Bitcoin sneezes, altcoins like Ethereum often catch a cold. This interconnectedness means that overall market sentiment and macroeconomic factors impacting Bitcoin can directly influence the ETH price. Profit-Taking After Rallies: Ethereum, along with many other cryptocurrencies, saw substantial gains in the lead-up to early 2024. Periods of rapid growth are often followed by profit-taking, where investors sell off their holdings to secure gains. This selling pressure can contribute to a price decline. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fluid and often uncertain. News or announcements regarding stricter regulations or potential crackdowns in major economies can spook investors and lead to sell-offs. Concerns about SEC actions or global regulatory alignment can weigh heavily on market sentiment. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability can impact all markets, including crypto. When traditional markets face uncertainty, investors may reduce exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to decreased demand and price drops. Ethereum-Specific Factors: While broader market trends play a significant role, Ethereum itself is not immune to its own set of factors. Concerns about network congestion, gas fees, or the pace of Ethereum 2.0 development (though progress is being made) can sometimes influence investor sentiment. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the data is clear: Ethereum (ETH) has indeed breached the $2,000 threshold, a level that has acted as a significant psychological and technical support in recent times. As of the latest update, ETH is trading at approximately $2,026.3, reflecting a substantial 11.29% decrease in value over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. This significant ETH price drop underscores the severity of the current market movement. Understanding the Significance of the $2,000 Ethereum Below $2000 Level Why is the $2,000 mark so important for Ethereum? It’s not just a round number; it represents a confluence of factors that make it a crucial level to watch: Psychological Support: Round numbers often act as psychological support and resistance levels in trading. $2,000 has been a level where buyers have previously stepped in, viewing it as a good entry point. Breaking below this level can trigger further selling as this psychological support is breached. Technical Support: From a technical analysis perspective, $2,000 has often served as a support level on ETH price charts. A break below this level can signal a potential shift in market momentum from bullish to bearish, at least in the short to medium term. Investor Sentiment: Falling below such a key level can negatively impact investor sentiment. It can lead to increased fear and uncertainty, potentially triggering more sell-offs and further downward pressure on the ETH price. Margin Calls and Liquidations: For traders using leverage, a significant price drop below key support levels can trigger margin calls and liquidations, further exacerbating the downward price movement. Navigating the Crypto Market: What Does This ETH Price Drop Mean for You? For crypto investors, especially those holding Ethereum, this ETH price drop can be unsettling. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective and consider both the challenges and potential opportunities that such market corrections present. Challenges: Portfolio Value Decline: The most immediate impact is the reduction in the value of your Ethereum holdings. Seeing your portfolio value decrease can be emotionally challenging, especially for newer investors. Increased Market Volatility: Periods of price drops are often accompanied by increased volatility. This means price swings can be more dramatic and unpredictable, making trading and investment decisions more complex. Potential for Further Downside: While no one can predict the future with certainty, breaking below a key support level like $2,000 can open the door for further potential downside. It’s important to be prepared for the possibility of continued market weakness. Opportunities: Potential Buying Opportunity?: For long-term investors who believe in the fundamentals of Ethereum and its future potential, a significant price drop can present a buying opportunity. Buying the dip, as it’s often called, can be a strategy to accumulate more ETH at a lower price point. However, this approach requires careful consideration and risk assessment. Re-evaluation of Investment Strategy: Market corrections provide a valuable opportunity to re-evaluate your investment strategy. Are your risk management practices adequate? Is your portfolio diversification appropriate? Are you investing based on solid research and conviction, or are you driven by short-term market hype? Learning and Growth: Market downturns are excellent learning experiences. They test your emotional resilience and provide insights into market dynamics. By analyzing market behavior during these periods, you can become a more informed and resilient investor. Actionable Insights: How to Respond to the ETH Price Drop So, what should you do in response to this ETH price drop? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional reactions can lead to poor investment decisions. Avoid panic selling based on short-term price movements. If you have a long-term investment horizon and believe in Ethereum’s fundamentals, short-term volatility should be viewed in context. Review Your Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio risk is aligned with your risk tolerance. Consider using stop-loss orders if appropriate for your trading strategy (though be mindful of potential stop-loss hunting in volatile markets). Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Stay informed about the factors influencing the crypto market and Ethereum specifically. Read reputable news sources, analyze on-chain data, and understand the technology and ecosystem developments. Don’t rely solely on social media hype or fear-mongering. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe this price drop is a potential buying opportunity, consider using dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. DCA can help mitigate the risk of trying to time the market bottom. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. Bear markets and corrections are a natural part of the cycle. Focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and the broader crypto space rather than getting fixated on short-term price fluctuations. The Future Outlook: Will Ethereum Recover from This Price Drop? Predicting the future of any market, especially the volatile crypto market, is inherently uncertain. However, Ethereum remains a fundamentally strong project with a vibrant ecosystem, a large developer community, and significant real-world use cases. The ongoing development of Ethereum 2.0, aimed at improving scalability and sustainability, is a major long-term catalyst. Whether the ETH price will recover quickly or face further downside in the short term remains to be seen. Market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and broader crypto trends will all play a role. However, for those who believe in the long-term vision of Ethereum and the potential of blockchain technology, this price drop could ultimately prove to be a temporary setback in a larger growth trajectory. The key is to stay informed, manage risk effectively, and maintain a long-term perspective in the face of market volatility. Conclusion: Navigating the Volatile Waters of Ethereum Price Action The recent ETH price drop below $2,000 is undoubtedly a significant event, serving as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While concerning, it also presents a crucial moment for investors to reassess, strategize, and potentially capitalize on opportunities. By understanding the underlying factors driving this market correction, maintaining a calm and rational approach, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, you can navigate these turbulent waters and position yourself for the future of Ethereum and the evolving world of digital assets. The crypto journey is rarely a smooth ride, but with knowledge, resilience, and a strategic mindset, you can weather the storms and potentially reap the rewards of this innovative and transformative space.

She further mentioned what needs to happen for XRP to avoid dropping to this price target. XRP Price Could Drop To $1.5 If This Happens In an X post , CasiTrades revealed that the XRP price could drop to $1.5 if it fails to break and hold above the $2.42 price level. This came as she noted that XRP is attempting to reclaim the consolidation pattern it broke down from. The crypto analyst further remarked that XRP needs to break and hold the trendline at $2.42 as support to keep the bullish momentum alive. She added that it is very critical for this to happen or a retest of $2 or $1.54 could be in play. CasiTrades’ analysis comes just as crypto analyst Egrag Crypto predicted that the XRP price could reach $30 by May this year. The analyst alluded to historical trends to prove why the crypto could reach this price target. Analysis Of The Current Price Action CasiTrades also gave an in-depth analysis of the current XRP price action. She noted that the crypto has seen a retracement of the move that followed Donald Trump’s announcement that XRP will be included in the crypto strategic reserve . However, the crypto analyst added that the overall market structure remained valid. CasiTrades also stated that XRP held above W1 territory and did not make a new low. She remarked that the bigger picture still supports a wave 4 correction playing out, targeting a new high. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst revealed that bullish divergences across timeframes are still intact and that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is maintaining its uptrend from the $2 low. In line with this, CasiTrades stated that the next upside targets are $2.70 and $3.05. She noted that these are crucial levels before market participants can consider talking about new all-time highs (ATHs) for the XRP price. In the meantime, if XRP fails to hold above $2.42, CasiTrades stated that the crypto could see a test of $2.20, which is a key subwave support level. A deeper retracement could take XRP back towards $2 or $1.54 if sellers take control. However, the crypto analyst said that she is still favoring the bullish scenario until there is a clear invalidation. According to CasiTrades, the market is looking for buyer confirmation and this $2.42 level will decide if the XRP price moves higher from here of if there is need for more correction.

41161563,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136839,1741123793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent DeFi Regulation Fight: Senator Lummis Battles IRS Rule to Protect Crypto Innovation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/senator-lummis-irs-defi-rule/,"Is the future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) at a crossroads in the United States? Senator Cynthia Lummis is raising alarms about a new IRS rule targeting DeFi, igniting a crucial debate over regulatory overreach and the future of crypto innovation. Let’s dive into why Senator Lummis is taking a stand and what this means for the burgeoning world of DeFi. Why is Senator Lummis Fighting the IRS DeFi Rule? Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for responsible crypto regulation and a senator representing Wyoming – a state known for its progressive stance on digital assets – has openly criticized the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for its new rule concerning DeFi. Her concerns are rooted in the belief that the IRS is fundamentally misinterpreting the nature of decentralized technology. In a recent statement on X, Senator Lummis articulated her position clearly: [blockquote] “The IRS’s DeFi rule misinterprets decentralized technology and risks pushing crypto innovation overseas. Wyoming is leading the way on digital asset regulation, and we need regulatory clarity, not federal overreach. I support @SenTedCruz’s effort to repeal this rule.” – Senator Cynthia Lummis [/blockquote] This statement encapsulates the core of the issue: Senator Lummis believes the IRS rule is not only misguided in its understanding of DeFi but also poses a significant threat to the United States’ competitive edge in the global crypto landscape. She emphasizes that instead of fostering innovation through clear and thoughtful regulation, the IRS rule leans towards federal overreach, potentially stifling growth and driving businesses away. Decoding the IRS DeFi Rule: What’s the Controversy? To understand Senator Lummis’s strong stance, it’s important to grasp what the contentious IRS rule entails. While the specifics can be complex, the crux of the issue revolves around how the IRS is attempting to apply traditional financial regulations to the decentralized and often pseudonymous world of DeFi. Key concerns include: Mischaracterization of DeFi: Critics argue that the IRS rule fails to recognize the fundamental differences between centralized financial institutions and decentralized protocols. DeFi, by its nature, often operates without intermediaries, making it challenging to apply regulations designed for entities with clear lines of control and responsibility. Privacy Concerns: Many DeFi transactions occur on public blockchains, but the participants may not always be easily identifiable in the traditional sense. The IRS rule, in its attempt to ensure tax compliance, could potentially infringe on the privacy of DeFi users and developers. Innovation Chill: The most significant concern, as highlighted by Senator Lummis, is that overly burdensome or poorly conceived regulations can stifle innovation. Startups and developers might choose to operate in jurisdictions with more favorable regulatory environments, leading to a brain drain and loss of economic opportunity for the U.S. Complexity and Compliance Burden: DeFi protocols can be incredibly intricate, involving smart contracts and automated processes. Applying rigid, traditional tax rules to these dynamic systems can create immense complexity and compliance burdens for users and developers alike. Wyoming’s Proactive Approach to Digital Asset Regulation: A Model for the Nation? Senator Lummis proudly points to Wyoming as a leader in digital asset regulation. Wyoming has indeed been at the forefront of creating a legal framework that acknowledges and supports the growth of the crypto industry. What makes Wyoming’s approach noteworthy? Feature Wyoming’s Approach Traditional Regulatory Approach Focus Innovation-friendly, clarity-driven Precautionary, control-oriented Legislation Specific laws tailored for digital assets Applying existing laws, often ambiguously Engagement Proactive dialogue with industry stakeholders Reactive, enforcement-focused Outcome Attracting crypto businesses, fostering growth Potential chilling effect on innovation Wyoming’s success demonstrates that it is possible to create a regulatory environment that both protects consumers and encourages innovation in the digital asset space. Senator Lummis advocates for a similar approach at the federal level, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity rather than heavy-handed federal overreach. Senator Cruz Joins the Fight: Support for Repealing the IRS Rule Senator Ted Cruz has stepped into the fray, joining Senator Lummis in her opposition to the IRS DeFi rule. Senator Lummis announced her support for Senator Cruz’s efforts to repeal the rule, signaling a bipartisan concern over the IRS’s approach. This collaboration highlights the growing recognition in Congress that ill-conceived crypto regulations can have detrimental consequences for the U.S. economy and its technological leadership. The move to repeal the IRS rule is a significant development. It indicates that lawmakers are starting to listen to the concerns of the crypto industry and understand the potential pitfalls of overly restrictive regulations. Whether this repeal effort will be successful remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly adds momentum to the ongoing conversation about responsible and effective crypto regulation. What’s Next for DeFi Regulation and Crypto Innovation? The debate surrounding the IRS DeFi rule and Senator Lummis’s opposition underscores a fundamental tension in the crypto world: how to balance the need for regulatory oversight with the desire to foster innovation and maintain the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies. Moving forward, several key aspects will be crucial: Industry Engagement: Regulators need to engage in meaningful dialogue with the crypto industry to understand the nuances of DeFi and develop rules that are both effective and practical. Clarity over Overreach: The focus should be on providing clear guidelines and frameworks rather than imposing overly broad or restrictive rules that stifle innovation. Tailored Regulations: Recognizing that DeFi is fundamentally different from traditional finance, regulations need to be tailored to the specific characteristics of decentralized technologies. Global Competitiveness: Policymakers must consider the global landscape and ensure that the U.S. does not become an unfavorable jurisdiction for crypto innovation. Conclusion: A Crucial Moment for DeFi’s Future Senator Lummis’s criticism of the IRS DeFi rule and her support for its repeal represent a pivotal moment for the future of DeFi regulation in the United States. Her stance reflects a growing concern that poorly designed regulations could inadvertently harm the very innovation they seek to govern. The fight for sensible and balanced crypto regulation is far from over, but voices like Senator Lummis’s are crucial in ensuring that the U.S. remains a hub for crypto innovation rather than pushing it overseas. The coming months will be critical in determining the trajectory of DeFi regulation and its impact on the broader crypto ecosystem.

To read full editions, subscribe . As markets continue to react to the latest tariff announcements, President Trump is preparing to give his first joint Congressional address this evening. We expect his speech will primarily defend the new levies placed on Mexico, Canada and China. Other timely topics he may touch on include the federal budget, which, if Congress fails to pass in the next 10 days, will spur a government shutdown. We also wouldn’t be surprised if he gets on the defensive about that Oval Office conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky. “TOMORROW WILL BE BIG. I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS!” the president wrote in a Truth Social post last night. As if anyone had any expectations he would refrain from sharing his candid thoughts and feelings. It’s unlikely that Trump will mention either the tumbling stock market or cryptocurrencies. If he does get into the economy, we expect him to mention investments in US-made AI and technology initiatives, such as Apple’s $500 billion commitment. I’d be surprised if Trump comments on the crypto reserve he first announced over the weekend, but it’s possible he does, especially since he’s likely going to need Congressional approval to get it up and running. His speech comes days ahead of the White House’s inaugural crypto summit , which will kick off on Friday. The guest list has so far been kept under wraps, but federal officials attending include AI and crypto czar David Sacks and digital asset working group executive director Bo Hines.

Increased volatility has driven sharp price swings, with LTC plunging from $130 to $100 in a matter of hours. This steep decline has raised concerns among investors as Litecoin struggles to maintain key support levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Sets $0.43 Target Market uncertainty has left Litecoin trading at a crucial level, with bulls trying to defend $100 amid persistent selling pressure. The failure to hold above higher price ranges suggests a weakened bullish structure, increasing the risk of further declines. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis highlighting that this is the third time Litecoin has thrown back to the $100 level. Historically, repeated retests of key support zones increase the likelihood of a breakdown, adding to the bearish sentiment surrounding LTC. If the $100 level fails to hold, Litecoin could face a deeper correction, aligning with the broader market downturn. Traders are now closely watching Litecoin’s next move to determine whether it can stabilize or if another wave of selling will push it lower. With volatility dominating the market, LTC remains at a pivotal moment that could dictate its price action in the coming weeks. Litecoin Keeps Holding The Range Litecoin is currently trading between key liquidity levels after months of volatility and uncertainty in the market. Despite its turbulent price action, LTC has shown relative strength in recent weeks, managing to hold key support levels. However, it continues to struggle against significant resistance, preventing a clear trend from forming. The main issue facing Litecoin is its inability to break above supply levels, keeping price action in a tight range. While bulls have attempted to push LTC higher, sellers at major resistance levels have repeatedly stalled momentum. Without a decisive breakout, Litecoin remains stuck in a consolidation phase, leaving traders unsure of its next move. BigCheds’ technical analysis highlighted that another high-timeframe (HTF) throwback to the $100 range followed a $130 supply level rejection. This marks the third time Litecoin has tested the $100 support zone, a level that has been crucial in preventing deeper declines. If LTC fails to hold this area, it could trigger a more extended correction. A breakout above $130 or a breakdown below $100 will likely determine Litecoin’s next major move. Until then, traders remain cautious as price action continues to signal uncertainty and indecision. The coming days will be critical in deciding whether LTC can reclaim higher levels or face another wave of selling pressure.

Price Action Details: Key Levels To Hold Litecoin is currently trading at $102 after a massive drop from the $130 mark, leaving bulls in a critical position to defend key levels. The recent decline has pushed LTC to the lower boundary of its trading range, testing crucial support that has held multiple times in recent months. So far, price action has respected both supply and demand zones, with resistance around $130-$140 and support near $100. This channel structure has defined Litecoin’s movement, keeping it within a clear range-bound pattern. Bulls must now hold the current level to sustain this channel thesis, preventing further downside. eIf Litecoin confirms a breakout above $130, it could signal the start of a new bullish trend, pushing LTC toward higher levels. However, a break below $100 would indicate a loss of demand, likely triggering a deeper correction and increasing selling pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will Start A Move To $4 If Current Demand Holds – Can Bulls Step In? For now, traders are closely watching whether LTC will hold or break its current support zone. The next major move will likely come from a decisive breakout in either direction, setting the stage for Litecoin’s trend in the coming weeks.

41161643,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136840,1741123899,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Belarus’ Bold Plan: Harnessing Excess Energy for Crypto Mining Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/belarus-excess-energy-crypto-mining/,"In a surprising turn of events, Belarus is stepping into the cryptocurrency arena with a unique strategy. President Alexander Lukashenko has officially given the green light to develop crypto mining operations within the nation, leveraging a resource that many countries often overlook: excess energy . But what does this mean for Belarus and the global crypto landscape? Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing development. Why Belarus is Eyeing Crypto Mining? Belarus’ decision to embrace crypto mining isn’t arbitrary. It’s a calculated move driven by several compelling factors. President Lukashenko, as reported by BelTA, views excess energy not just as a byproduct, but as a valuable asset. Imagine having surplus electricity that could be transformed into revenue. This is precisely the opportunity Belarus is seizing. Here’s a breakdown of the key motivations: Revenue Generation: Lukashenko explicitly stated that crypto mining is seen as a significant revenue stream for the country. In a world increasingly leaning towards digital finance, this could be a smart economic diversification strategy. Utilizing Surplus Electricity: Belarus, known for its industrial base and energy infrastructure, sometimes generates more electricity than it immediately needs. Instead of letting this excess energy go to waste, channeling it into energy-intensive crypto mining operations makes economic sense. Following Global Trends: The reference to “U.S. crypto adoption trends” suggests Belarus is observing the growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies globally. By entering the crypto mining space, Belarus positions itself to benefit from this expanding market. Attracting Investment: Belarus is already recognized for its low energy costs, a major draw for crypto mining ventures. This directive could further enhance its appeal to international crypto investors, potentially boosting foreign investment and technological growth within the country. Belarus: A Budding Hub for Cryptocurrency? Belarus has been quietly building a reputation as a region with favorable conditions for cryptocurrency related activities. Several factors contribute to this emerging status: Low Energy Costs: As highlighted in the initial report and by Cointelegraph, Belarus boasts relatively low electricity prices compared to many other nations. Energy cost is a critical factor in the profitability of crypto mining , making Belarus an attractive location. Government Support: President Lukashenko’s directive signals strong government backing for the cryptocurrency sector, specifically crypto mining . This political support can create a more stable and predictable regulatory environment, encouraging investment and development. Strategic Location: Belarus’ geographical location in Eastern Europe could serve as a bridge between Europe and Asia, potentially facilitating international collaborations and market access within the cryptocurrency space. The Benefits of Utilizing Excess Energy for Crypto Mining The concept of using excess energy for crypto mining presents a win-win scenario with several advantages: Economic Efficiency: Transforming otherwise underutilized excess energy into a valuable commodity like cryptocurrency is a highly efficient economic strategy. It maximizes the return on existing energy infrastructure investments. Reduced Energy Waste: Instead of curtailing or wasting excess energy , crypto mining provides a productive outlet. This can lead to better energy grid management and potentially reduce environmental impact compared to other methods of energy disposal. Attracting Tech Innovation: Promoting crypto mining can attract tech companies, skilled professionals, and innovation in related fields like blockchain technology and data center management to Belarus. Diversification of Economy: Entering the cryptocurrency sector diversifies Belarus’ economy, reducing reliance on traditional industries and opening up new avenues for growth and international trade in digital assets . Challenges and Considerations for Belarus’ Crypto Mining Venture While the prospects are promising, Belarus needs to navigate potential challenges to ensure the success of its crypto mining initiative: Regulatory Clarity: Clear and comprehensive regulations around cryptocurrency and crypto mining are crucial. The government needs to establish a legal framework that fosters innovation while addressing potential risks like money laundering and illicit activities. Infrastructure Development: While Belarus has energy infrastructure, scaling up for large-scale crypto mining might require further investment in data centers, cooling systems, and high-speed internet connectivity. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Belarus needs to be prepared for price fluctuations and market cycles that could impact the profitability of crypto mining operations. Environmental Concerns: While utilizing excess energy is a positive step, Belarus should also consider the overall environmental footprint of crypto mining , encouraging energy-efficient practices and exploring renewable energy sources to power these operations in the long term.

El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office confirmed the purchase on March 4 in a post on X. 🇸🇻El Salvador buys another bitcoin for strategic reserve. pic.twitter.com/pyWepGk8bL — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) March 4, 2025 This move aligns with El Salvador ’s “1 BTC a day” accumulation strategy, aimed at economic diversification and serving as a hedge against traditional financial systems. The purchase also signals the government’s continued confidence in Bitcoin ( BTC ), despite recent market volatility. “It’s not stopping,” President Bukele commented on X following the acquisition.

Recently, the country modified its Bitcoin law, making the cryptocurrency’s use voluntary rather than mandatory. The adjustment was part of efforts to secure IMF support and maintain fiscal stability in the eyes of international lenders. Despite the policy changes, El Salvador continues to bolster its Bitcoin reserves as a key part of its long-term economic strategy. As of March 4, the country has added 46 BTC in the past 30 days, worth approximately $3.97 million, data from the National Bitcoin Office chart shows. This underscores El Salvador’s belief in the potential of Bitcoin to become a store of value and a driver of economic growth. The country’s Bitcoin City project , which won global recognition in 2023, is aimed at creating a hub for cryptocurrency innovation and continues to implement measures to make the country more Bitcoin-friendly.

The legal complaint filed in October, 2024, claimed that the firm acted as an unlicensed dealer of securities and has sold securities worth over $2 billion. US SEC Withdraws Charges Against Cumberland DRW In a recent filing, the US SEC agreed to drop its enforcement case against Cumberland DRW. The decision is pending approval from most of the commission’s three-panel members. The agency had previously accused the firm of acting as an unregistered securities dealer. The lawsuit, filed in October 2024, alleged that Cumberland DRW sold more than $2 billion in unregistered securities. The SEC named several tokens, including Polygon (POL), Solana (SOL), Cosmos (ATOM), Algorand (ALGO), and Filecoin (FIL), as securities. Consequently, the firm dismissed the allegation and affirmed that it had attempted to meet regulatory standards. Following the announcement, Cumberland DRW released a statement expressing its commitment to regulatory dialogue. The crypto trading platform added, “As a firm deeply committed to the principles of integrity and transparency, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the SEC to help shape a future where technological advancements and regulatory clarity go hand in hand, ensuring that the U.S. remains at the forefront of global financial innovation.” Enforcement Reversal Under New Leadership The decision to drop the case against Cumberland DRW follows a series of abandoned enforcement actions by the US SEC. Since Acting Chair Mark Uyeda took office, the agency has withdrawn cases against multiple crypto firms. These include Coinbase, ConsenSys, and Kraken lawsuit . The SEC has also shut down investigations in several firms, among them Gemini, OpenSea, Robinhood Crypto, and Yuga Labs. Such change of stance is a clear pointed towards a differing approach towards the crypto regulation from the agency. Cumberland DRW was one of the many enforcement actions that was taken under prior leadership of the SEC. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Pierce revealed members of the newly created Crypto Task Force. These officials are; a Chief of staff, Chief Counsel, Chief Policy advisor and Chief Operations’ officer, complemented by 10 senior advisors from the division of the SEC. Regulatory Adjustments in Crypto Enforcement The US SEC’s decision to drop the case against Cumberland DRW marks another shift in its stance on crypto regulation. The agency’s previous enforcement actions had drawn criticism from industry leaders and legal experts. Under the new leadership, the US SEC appears to be reconsidering its strategy toward digital assets. More so, the continued legal actions and settlements by the U.S. SEC have led to speculation that the commission might be nearing a resolution in the Ripple lawsuit . With recent cases against other crypto firms being dropped, industry observers believe the SEC may reconsider its stance on XRP. Ripple awaits the SEC’s decision by April 16, 2025, as the broader crypto market monitors the case impact.

The token reached its lowest level since April 2023, dashing the recent hopes of a recovery. Ethereum (ETH) keeps sliding, with a recent short-term dip on Binance. The asset slid to $1,993, the lowest price since April 2023. ETH is now back to bear market territory, despite expectations for a favorable performance in Q1. ETH dipped to $1,993 on Binance, later recovering above $2,000 with renewed whale buying. | Source: Binance E TH fell along with the rest of the market, though it also faced its own set of pressures. The asset slid further down to 0.025 BTC, also delaying a breakout against the leading coin. Soon after dipping under $2,000, ETH recovered to $2,138,65. The bounce is yet to prove a shift in attitudes, as the crypto market still trades on fear. During the latest price dip, there were again multiple theories on the price action. The main reason was the overall weak sentiment for altcoins. Crypto also tracked stock markets with another slide, responding to the newly enforced trading tariffs according to President Trump’s plan. ETH open interest falls to last November’s levels The current ETH price action happens with an open interest of $9.8B. ETH round-tripped the US elections narrative, with open interest peaking above $16B in December. Interest in ETH is simply slower as traders see the asset as a long-term loss. ETH is also sliding along with the rest of the altcoin market. The loss of token value also means fewer users of the Ethereum chain and general doubts about its future utility. ETH fell as the Altcoin Season Index slid to its lower range of 22 points. Later, the index recovered to 24 points , but most formerly hot assets have already gone through deep drawdowns and traders remain cautious. ETH is traditionally considered the driver of an altcoin season, but the fatigue from meme trading and overall volatility on the markets brings additional caution for traders. ETH is also an exception, as most other assets have a shift to bullish sentiment. Both retail and smart money turned bearish on ETH in the past day. $ETH Sentiment CROWD = Bearish 🟥 MP | #SmartMoney = Bearish 🟥 #Ethereum Check out sentiment and other crypto stats at https://t.co/HQDyBNuzek #Crypto #Marketprophit pic.twitter.com/iHxnNi1dWV — Market Prophit (@MarketProphit) March 4, 2025 In the past year, ETH also fell after its long-term vision was challenged. The token remained inflationary, while the Ethereum Foundation did not build tools for scaling. Traffic and liquidity also shifted to L2 chains. Ethereum’s main utility was to carry Tether (USDT) and offer a platform for Uniswap’s main activity. Holding ETH was also needed to secure the network and serve as collateral, though those functions are already filled by older whales. Sellers may be deliberately wrecking ETH Another theory is that ETH is pressured by spot selling, with the goal of liquidating any remaining long positions. Despite the price drop, over 74% of ETH positions are long. Liquidity has been building up all the way down to $1,900. ETH also made a rapid recovery, which squeezed out short positions above $2,000. However, the risk of long liquidations remains high. ETH seems attractive at the $2,000 price range, especially if a long-term rally is still expected. Whale buying continues, though even smart money has been stuck due to unexpected crashes. We caught a TRAPPED whale—yes, even whales get stuck! This whale, who previously bought low, sold high, and made $33.67M on $ETH , is now struggling. After adding positions and getting #trapped , they just bought another 2,000 ETH ($4.1M) to try and lower their average price. pic.twitter.com/JYK9i6m0XJ — EyeOnChain 🔶 (@EyeOnChain) March 4, 2025 Smaller whales are also buying the dip , for purchases of up to $10M. ETH may be seen as shaky, but accumulation continues, for whales that can afford to wait for a breakout. Another theory is that Trump’s World Liberty Fi may be capable of swaying the markets. In February, the fund moved most of its ETH out of its wallets and may have prepared to sell. Currently, sellers can also re-buy at a lower price. The ETH dip also allows whales to cover loans. ETH also saw selling pressure from the Bybit hacker, who managed to swap out nearly 500K ETH within days. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The IMF had included restrictions on further government Bitcoin purchases as part of a $3.5 billion financing deal, but Bukele made it clear that his administration has no plans to stop accumulating the cryptocurrency. Bukele Rejects IMF’s Bitcoin Restrictions The IMF’s agreement with El Salvador includes specific measures to limit government involvement with Bitcoin, including a ban on new acquisitions. However, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele dismissed these restrictions, posting on social media that Bitcoin purchases would continue. “This all stops in April. stops in June. This all stops in December. No, it’s not stopping,” Bukele wrote on X. He also added, “Proof of work > proof of whining,” suggesting that his government remains committed to its Bitcoin strategy despite external pressure. The IMF’s financing deal, worth $3.5 billion, includes measures aimed at regulating the country’s Bitcoin use. One clause states that the public sector is prohibited from “voluntary accumulation of Bitcoin.” However, shortly after the IMF published this information, El Salvador announced new Bitcoin purchases, adding 19 BTC over the past week and an additional token the following day. El Salvador Continues Bitcoin Accumulation Despite the IMF’s conditions, El Salvador has continued to expand its Bitcoin reserves . Data indicates that the government now holds approximately 6,101 BTC, valued at around $530 million at current market prices. El Salvador has been purchasing one Bitcoin daily since November 2022. The latest acquisition follows multiple previous purchases made in January and February, even after the IMF agreement was finalized. The government’s actions suggest a strong commitment to its Bitcoin strategy regardless of external regulations. Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy and a strong advocate for Bitcoin, also weighed in on the situation. Replying President Nayib Bukele’s post, Saylor wrote, “Bitcoin adoption is unstoppable,” showing his support for El Salvador’s ongoing Bitcoin strategy. IMF’s New Rules on Bitcoin Transactions The IMF’s agreement also includes broader regulatory measures related to Bitcoin. As part of the deal, the government is required to publish all wallet addresses used for Bitcoin transactions. Additionally, audited financial statements must be released for crypto-related government entities. Another key requirement is the liquidation of the Fidebitcoin trust fund by July 2025, which was originally established to support Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. The government is also expected to withdraw from direct involvement in the Chivo Wallet system, the country’s official Bitcoin payment platform. Further amendments to the Bitcoin Law are also being introduced. These changes aim to make Bitcoin acceptance voluntary rather than mandatory for businesses. This marks a shift from El Salvador’s initial stance when it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. El Salvador’s Broader Tech and Economic Strategy While Bitcoin remains a key part of their financial strategy, the country is also expanding its focus on technology and economic development. Bukele recently held discussions with prominent investors, including Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen of a16z, regarding artificial intelligence (AI) investments. The government is considering tax incentives and regulatory frameworks to attract tech companies to the country following US footsteps under President Donald Trump who are hosting a crypto summit to ease the growth of the crypto sector. Consequently, Bukele’s administration aims to position El Salvador as a hub for innovation in Latin America while maintaining its Bitcoin strategy. Despite pressure from the IMF, El Salvador’s leadership appears determined to continue its Bitcoin acquisitions while also seeking economic growth through new technology investments.

The announcement comes amid a government restructuring, with Lukashenko also citing the need to modernize Belarus’ 5,700-kilometer power grid to meet growing energy demands. In a recent statement, Lukashenko acknowledged the growing global interest in cryptocurrencies and accepted requests from those seeking opportunities in the sector. “Look at this mining. More and more people are turning to me. If it's profitable for us, let's do it. We have excess electricity. Let them produce these cryptocurrencies and the like,” he said.

Yesterday they announced that they will keep cryptocurrencies in reserves.” The Belarusian leader proposed a dual approach: attracting investors to buy electricity for mining operations, and also considering state-led mining initiatives. “So there will be demand for them. Maybe we should do it ourselves. We will attract some investors, sell them electricity, I do not rule out that. But we need to do it ourselves. There are such proposals.

While the agency has not disclosed the specific reasoning behind its decision, the move aligns with a broader shift in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. NFTs Not Securities The inquiry began in October 2022 and sought to determine whether Yuga Labs’ NFT offerings, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection and the distribution of ApeCoin, violated federal securities laws. The SEC’s decision not to pursue charges more than two years later marks a significant milestone for the NFT space. In a statement on X, Yuga Labs called it a “huge win” for the industry and for creators driving the digital asset ecosystem forward. “After 3+ years, the SEC has officially closed its investigation into Yuga Labs. This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward. NFTs are not securities.” In recent weeks, the regulatory watchdog has either dropped or suspended investigations into major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Binance, Robinhood, Gemini , OpenSea, and Uniswap . The SEC has also disbanded its previous crypto division and introduced a new Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, signaling a potential recalibration of its regulatory stance. Bored Apes’ floor price on OpenSea briefly hit 13.9 ETH on Monday. After a minor dip, however, the current price has settled at 13.75 ETH. NFT Market The NFT market faced significant challenges in 2024 as trading volumes fell to $1.5 billion by the third quarter. However, a partial rebound in the fourth quarter pushed volumes back up to $2.6 billion. This volatility was accompanied by a decline in total sales compared to 2023, indicating that NFTs were sold at higher prices, possibly influenced by rising token values such as ETH. By year-end, the overall trading volume had dropped by 19%, while sales numbers declined by 18%. Despite the short-term plunging values, the global NFT market is expected to grow by $84.13 billion between 2025 and 2029, according to Technavio’s recent study . This growth is projected at an annual rate of 30.3%. The increasing demand for digital art and interest from major brands are key factors driving this expansion but uncertainty surrounding NFTs remains a challenge for the market.

The North Korean hacking group, Lazarus Group, was identified as the perpetrator after injecting malicious code into SafeWallet, a third-party wallet platform used by Bybit. The hackers have successfully laundered all of the stolen ETH, a process that took just 10 days. They primarily used THORChain to convert 83% of the stolen ETH, amounting to about $1 billion, into Bitcoin (BTC), which was then distributed across 6,954 wallets. Bybit has restored a 1:1 backing of client assets following the attack. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou reported that 77% of the stolen funds remain traceable on the blockchain, despite the laundering efforts. However, 20% of the funds, approximately $280 million, have become untraceable, and 3% have been frozen. The exchange has engaged in efforts to freeze the remaining funds, offering bounties to blockchain investigators, including ZachXBT, to aid in the recovery process.

If approved, the product would represent one of the first US-listed Dogecoin-focused exchange-traded funds, offering regulated access to a token that began as an internet parody but has evolved into a multibillion-dollar digital asset. Dogecoin ETF Gets One Step Closer On March 3, the New York Stock Exchange subsidiary submitted a formal proposal—known as a 19b-4—asking the SEC to consider rule changes that would allow for Bitwise’s ETF to be listed under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E, which governs Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The filing states: “Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘Act’ or ‘34 Act’) and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, NYSE Arca, Inc. (‘NYSE Arca’ or ‘Exchange’), proposes to list and trade shares of the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF (the ‘Trust’) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E (Commodity-Based Trust Shares).” Bitwise initially signaled its intentions in late January by filing an S-1 registration form with the SEC, outlining its plan to launch a Dogecoin ETF. Now, the 19b-4 filing is the next critical step in the regulatory process, enabling the SEC to begin a formal review period. One of the standout elements of Bitwise’s proposal is the institutional infrastructure behind it. Coinbase Custody is poised to serve as the custodian for the fund’s DOGE holdings, safeguarding the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) is expected to oversee cash custody, administration, and record-keeping, ensuring traditional financial mechanisms are in place. The ETF is designed to use cash creations and redemptions, meaning investors would not be able to contribute or receive DOGE directly. According to the filing, the fund will track the price of Dogecoin using the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, a pricing benchmark that calculates a daily Net Asset Value (NAV) closely reflective of the token’s market value. Bitwise is not alone in pursuing a Dogecoin ETF. Grayscale and Rex Shares have also submitted proposals for similar products. Notably, Grayscale’s DOGE ETF filing has already been acknowledged by the SEC, marking a significant milestone in the path toward possible approval. For Grayscale, the official “acknowledgement” triggers a formal countdown for the regulator to review and make decisions, placing a potential final decision window around mid-October. As the SEC weighs these proposals, market observers have become increasingly optimistic that 2025 could see the approval of a Dogecoin ETF. According to prediction markets, odds have climbed substantially in recent weeks. Bloomberg analysts have also weighed in, indicating the chance of any Dogecoin ETF approval could be as high as 75%. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin ETF|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-04 22:00:02
