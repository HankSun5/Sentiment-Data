Qubetics Joins the Ranks of Top Crypto Assets with a Decentralized VPN Solution,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoins-success-story-repeats-qubetics-joins-the-ranks-of-top-crypto-assets-with-a-decentralized-vpn-solution/,"Bitcoin’s early days were marked by skepticism, uncertainty, and unparalleled opportunity. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009, there was no formal initial coin offering (ICO) or structured fundraising. Bitcoin could be mined with basic computer hardware, and early adopters acquired thousands of coins at virtually no cost. Over the years, Bitcoin’s rise has been nothing short of historic, transforming from an obscure digital experiment into a trillion-dollar asset. Those who recognized its potential early on have seen life-changing returns, as Bitcoin solidified its place among the top crypto assets . While Bitcoin’s best accumulation phase has long passed, the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities with strong long-term potential. Qubetics is one such project making strides in blockchain technology, introducing a decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) that enhances security, privacy, and unrestricted access to the internet. As concerns over digital surveillance and centralized control grow, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the top crypto assets to watch. Bitcoin: The Pioneer of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin emerged as a groundbreaking financial innovation, introducing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminated intermediaries. Unlike modern crypto projects that launch through ICOs or private sales, Bitcoin’s distribution was solely through mining. Those who mined or purchased Bitcoin in its earliest years had access to an asset that would later redefine digital finance. Over time, Bitcoin gained mainstream recognition as the most secure and decentralized network, driving its value from fractions of a cent to all-time highs exceeding $60,000. Bitcoin’s appeal has been strengthened by its limited supply of 21 million coins, censorship resistance, and adoption as a store of value. Institutional investors, corporations, and even governments have integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. However, with its current market maturity, Bitcoin has become more of a long-term asset than an emerging opportunity. Investors seeking projects with high upside potential are turning to the next wave of blockchain innovation, looking for the top crypto assets that offer real-world solutions. Qubetics: A New Opportunity in the Crypto Market Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency project. It is addressing a critical challenge that previous blockchain solutions have overlooked—online privacy. Traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have long been the go-to solution for internet users seeking security and anonymity. However, centralized VPN providers control user data, creating vulnerabilities where governments, hackers, or corporations can intercept or restrict access. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing network infrastructure. Instead of relying on central servers, Qubetics distributes traffic across a blockchain-based network of nodes, ensuring that no single authority has control over user data. This enhances privacy, protects against surveillance, and prevents censorship. Users can browse the internet freely without concerns over restricted access or data tracking. In an era where digital privacy is under constant threat, a decentralized approach to VPN technology positions Qubetics as a solution-driven project within the blockchain industry. With Qubetics integrating dVPN technology into its ecosystem, it is setting itself apart as a project with tangible use cases. As global internet restrictions increase and governments tighten control over digital access, demand for decentralized privacy solutions is expected to rise. Investors searching for top crypto assets with real-world applications are recognizing the significance of Qubetics and its potential in reshaping online security. Qubetics Crypto Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity The earliest opportunities to invest in Qubetics have already passed, and the project has gained momentum among investors. The whitelist stage required no upfront investment, allowing early participants exclusive access. The first presale round introduced $TICS at just $0.01, offering an entry point for those who recognized its potential early. Currently, in its 24th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0976, with over $14.5 million raised and more than 495 million tokens sold to 22,000 holders. Projections indicate that by the presale’s conclusion, $TICS could reach $0.25, offering an ROI of 156% at today’s price. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return jumps to 924%, and at $10 following the mainnet launch, early investors could see a staggering 10,137% ROI. Qubetics’ performance in this crypto presale signals strong investor confidence. With demand growing and privacy-focused blockchain applications gaining traction, its potential for long-term success continues to attract attention. As decentralized solutions become a necessity, the adoption of Qubetics’ technology could drive substantial value appreciation. Conclusion Bitcoin revolutionized finance, creating a decentralized digital asset that disrupted traditional financial systems. However, as Bitcoin transitions into a store of value, new blockchain projects are emerging with innovative applications that solve real-world problems. Qubetics is among the top crypto assets introducing meaningful advancements, particularly with its decentralized VPN, which challenges the vulnerabilities of centralized internet security solutions. As blockchain technology evolves, projects that provide practical utility will stand out in the market. Qubetics’ ongoing crypto presale presents an opportunity for early investors to gain exposure to a project that could shape the future of online privacy. With increasing demand for decentralized services, Qubetics is positioning itself as an investment worth serious consideration.

US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has assembled a dream team cutting across several departments and units of the securities watchdog. US SEC Confirms Crypto Task Force Members The SEC’s newly minted Crypto Task Force is raring to go following the confirmation of team members by Pierce. The US SEC Commissioner disclosed the team’s composition in a press release , hinting at a varied selection process. Pierce stated that the team comprises staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and several divisions within the SEC. Led by Pierce, the Commissioner had a free rein to select the task force members. “The Crypto Task Force exhibits deep expertise and an enthusiastic commitment to identifying -with the help of other talented staff across the Commission and interested members of the public – workable solutions to difficult crypto regulatory problems. The 15-man team comprises a Chief of Staff, a Chief Counsel, a Chief Policy Advisor, and a Chief of Operations. The remaining ranks are made up of 10 senior advisors drawn from various units within the US SEC. The Team Will Solve The Hardest Regulatory Issues Within days of assuming office, Acting US SEC Chair Mark Uyeda launched the Crypto Task Force to give the agency new direction. The agency is tasked with establishing the criteria for determining whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. Weeks after the announcement of the task force, the SEC disclosed that memecoins are not securities , urging the public to remain wary of scams. Pierce has hailed the new direction of the task force while criticizing regulation by enforcement during the Gensler era. The task force will be the main advisory body to the SEC on crypto-related matters. As a show of commitment, the Commission has dismissed Kraken’s case , ditching its actions against Coinbase and Gemini as well.

Kraken emphasized the importance of fact-based regulation and expressed optimism about collaborating with policymakers to create clearer rules. Changes in leadership at the SEC and White House appear to be driving a broader policy shift, offering relief to crypto firms previously targeted by enforcement actions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to a statement from the company. The case will be dropped with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Kraken will not admit to any wrongdoing, pay penalties, or change its business operations. SEC Ends Legal Fight Against Kraken, No Fines or Business Changes The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 , alleging it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, clearing agency, and dealer. The regulator also accused the company of commingling customer and corporate funds. Kraken contested the charges, leading a federal judge to rule the case had enough merit to proceed to trial. However, the exchange maintained that the lawsuit misrepresented its business and called the allegations politically motivated. But in a blog post released on March 3 , the company described the regulator’s case as baseless and politically motivated, doubling down on their claim that “Regulatory actions must be based on facts, not political agendas.” Kraken described the lawsuit as a misguided effort that misrepresented its business practices. “The SEC’s lawsuit, which mischaracterized our consistent business model, was always without merit,” the company said. https://t.co/4Ow50mZWhv pic.twitter.com/aURU02ZHU0 — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) March 3, 2025 The SEC’s move to dismiss the case comes amid a broader shift in regulatory attitudes toward the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. Kraken expressed optimism that the decision to drop the lawsuit may signal the end of an era marked by contentious legal battles between federal agencies and digital asset platforms, , pointing to leadership changes in Washington as a key factor. “We appreciate the new leadership both at the White House and the Commission that led to this change,” said a representative from the crypto platform. The company said it remains committed to working with policymakers to develop transparent regulations that support consumer protection while allowing for technological advancement. Now, pending approval from the SEC’s commissioners, Kraken says the charges will be dropped. Trump-Era SEC Policy Shift: Crypto Firms See Legal Relief Kraken’s victory marks a turning point in the SEC’s approach to crypto enforcement. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the agency pursued lawsuits against major crypto firms, arguing that most digital assets were unregistered securities. Critics condemned this “regulation by enforcement” strategy, saying it stifled innovation and pushed businesses offshore while other countries established clearer rules. Now, the SEC is taking a different path. Since the change in leadership, the agency has dropped multiple lawsuits and investigations, including cases against Consensys , Uniswap , Robinhood , and OpenSea. On February 27, it officially dismissed its case against Coinbase , further signaling a retreat from aggressive enforcement. Great news! After years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week)… pic.twitter.com/IlnoBs7N6n — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 21, 2025 This shift aligns with President Donald Trump’s broader regulatory approach. His nominee for SEC chair, Paul Atkins , is known for his pro-crypto stance, suggesting a massive change from Gensler’s approach. While Atkins awaits confirmation, acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has already begun scaling back enforcement efforts. According to a February report, the SEC has created the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) to fight crypto fraud rather than enforcing sweeping industry crackdowns. In a separate but related development, Coinbase is demanding answers from the SEC. The exchange has filed an FOIA request seeking details on the costs of the SEC’s crypto enforcement actions. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wants transparency on the amount of taxpayer money spent on investigations, lawsuits, and third-party contractors. After years of uncertainty under an enforcement-first approach that pushed innovation overseas, the digital assets industry now faces the prospect of a more balanced framework that could allow American crypto businesses to compete globally while still maintaining necessary consumer protections. This pivot raises important questions about how regulatory agencies should approach emerging technologies. As this new chapter unfolds, the challenge will be striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring market integrity; a balance that, if achieved, could position the U.S. well in a novel yet increasingly crucial sector of the global financial system.

Nasdaq Stock Market LLC made the filing on behalf of the firm as the firm pushes to expand its crypto product list. Grayscale Hedera ETF is Not New Per the filing, Grayscale plans to list the ETF product to track the underlying price of HBAR, the native currency of the Hedera blockchain. The 19b-4 is a crucial filing in the approval process for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) product. If approved, qualified investors can gain exposure to HBAR without directly holding the asset. If approved, the Hedera ETF product will trade on the Nasdaq exchange, like other funds from Grayscale investments. Key details tied to the fund, like the chosen custodian, were not disclosed. However, subsequent filings might confirm the custodian as Coinbase Custody, which the firm tapped for its GBTC and ETHE products. The Grayscale push for Hedera ETF has been spotted as early as January. Over the past few weeks, Canary Capital has pioneered the push for an HBAR ETF with the SEC . This implies that the Grayscale Hedera ETF product will not be the first of its kind. Grayscale Taking Frontline ETF Approach Over the past few weeks, Grayscale Investments has kept up with the crypto trust and ETF filings. To take a frontline position in the crypto ETF push, it has filed for the Cardano ETF , Solana ETF, and XRP ETF, amongst others. Meanwhile, the firm’s confidence in securing approvals hinges on its history with the US SEC. Grayscale won the lawsuit that compelled the markets regulator to revise its decision on Bitcoin ETF applications. Following this directive for review, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF products for trading in January 2024. Spot Ethereum ETF products followed shortly. As one of the largest issuers of these products, Grayscale has created a ready market to boost its push for more altcoin ETFs. US SEC and Crypto ETF Growth Beyond Grayscale, other asset managers are also pushing for crypto ETF approvals with the SEC. To stretch the regulator’s potential flexibility, asset managers like Rex-Osprey and Tuttle Capital have filings for Dogecoin ETF. Popular memecoins like TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK have ETF proposals to track prices. While Bloomberg has issued approval odds for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs, the chances of memecoin ETFs remain uncertain. The regulator is generally more open to the crypto market, as shown in the recently closed Kraken lawsuit . Whether this will translate to more crypto ETF approvals remains to be seen.

And some have suggested Moscow’s recent crypto pivot may be behind the Central Bank’s sudden decision. The Central Bank previously said that its nationwide rollout would take place on July 1, 2025. But in its most recent statements, the bank has announced that the launch will no longer take place as scheduled. Why Has Russia ‘Indefinitely Delayed’ Its CBDC Launch? And it has made no mention of a new launch date, leaving media commentators and analysts confused about the bank’s reasoning. Elvira Nabiullina, the Russian Central Bank Governor. (Source: RBC/Screenshot) Elvira Nabiullina, the Central Bank Governor, told Russian media outlets that Moscow will now “move on with the mass implementation of the digital ruble somewhat later than originally planned.” She added that the Central Bank would take a closer look at the results of its ongoing pilot. And she said that the bank wanted to hold new “consultation” sessions with commercial banks. Nabiullina further suggested that further talks were needed on the “economic model” that is “most attractive to banks’ clients, businesses, and people [in general].” These statements appear to suggest that the Central Bank is prepared – at least to some extent – to go back to the drawing board with some aspects of its CBDC. A Russian Central Bank employee. (Source: Telekanal Afontovo/Dzen/Screenshot) The Crypto Factor The Central Bank’s apparent lack of clarity on the matter has left media outlets with no recourse other than to speculate on the reasons for the delay. One of Russia’s top authorities on CBDCs, Insight Advocates, wrote in a social media post : “It is possible that the delay is due to a change in the Central Bank’s position on the use of cryptocurrencies in international settlements. It is possible that the digital ruble project will resume after inflation stabilizes and tests on new cross-border payment technology are complete.” The Central Bank has traditionally been vehemently opposed to crypto adoption. Nabiullina has repeatedly called for a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia . She has been the nation’s most vocal champion of CBDCs. She claims they will let Russia do business with its international partners, unheeded by Western sanctions. However, in recent times her voice has been drowned out by Russian pro-crypto advocates. Many people claim that while CBDC-powered trade is a long way off, crypto provides a powerful anti-sanctions solution that many international partners are ready to use. Reluctantly, Nabiullina has had to soften her stance on crypto, particularly after President Vladimir Putin embraced the crypto mining sector last year. Russia has been able to keep loading crude onto ships, but it’s having greater difficulty getting it off again, writes @JLeeEnergy https://t.co/4LkKCDlnYf — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 3, 2025 Trouble at the Central Bank? In an article from the IT-focused media outlet Comnews , the journalist Ivan Ivanov wrote: “The launch of the digital ruble has been postponed indefinitely. The head of the Central Bank claims that the reason is the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of medium and small banks. But perhaps this is only half of the truth.” He added that it was clear that “something has gone wrong.” Ivanov said the “main reason” was likely “the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of banks and businesses.” The journalist added: “To be honest, commerical banks are not interested in the digital ruble. It requires them – at their own expense – to build and integrate a new system that will not bring them any profits. It […] is profitable and even logical for them to try to delay the process for as long as possible.” Ivanov added that most people are “still unclear as to why exactly the digital ruble is needed.” Some of Russia’s biggest banks have previously dragged their feet on digital ruble pilot work. Most notably, the nation’s main banking association has repeatedly called for a delay . Sberbank, arguably the country’s biggest banking and IT player, was also notable by its absence in the first phase of the pilot, which launched in August 2023. In January this year, the same bank also called for a delay that would see the digital ruble launch in 2026 . Ivanov, meanwhile, noted that “despite denials,” a “persistent rumor that Nabiullina wants to leave her post” continues to circulate. Nabiullina has headed the Russian Central Bank since 2013. Prior too this, she served as the nation’s Minister of Economic Development under both Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev. She is known to be one of Putin’s closest political allies.

Official sources have been cagey about the CBDC delay thus far, suggesting that “feedback from partner banks” has “indicated a need for additional technical improvements.” However, Insight Advocates wrote that the ever-changing “international situation” could be another concern, adding: “In the context of sanctions pressure and the threat of restrictions from the United States against BRICS nations, the Russian authorities could begin testing cross-border settlements in digital national currencies.” Currently, only China has the technical capability to carry out cross-border CBDC transactions, Insight Advocates wrote, and “Russia may need more time to develop these capabilities.” The post Confusion Reigns as Russia CBDC Launch Is ‘Delayed Indefinitely’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|CBDC|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-03 23:30:00

His explanation on X sheds light on the trend that has caught the interest of the cryptocurrency community, especially as memecoins gain more popularity. XRPL Memecoin and XRP Price Schwartz explained that while memecoins do not directly affect XRP’s core utility, they can influence XRP’s price because of speculation in the market. Many investors view memecoins as high-risk, high-reward opportunities, often driven by social media trends and popular influencers. This means that sudden increases in interest or trading for certain memecoins can spark more activity on the XRP Ledger, which may then influence the overall market dynamics. Schwartz also pointed out that XRP’s price matches memecoins because of market feelings and speculation. When XRPL memecoin suddenly rises, it can make traders feel they are missing out, leading investors to pay more attention to XRP. As more people trade XRP, its price can increase. However, this rise doesn’t necessarily reflect XRP’s actual value. Furthermore, the Ripple CTO mentioned that speculative trading can cause short-term price changes for XRP, but this does not show its long-term value. He also explained that if the price of XRP goes up, it can lead to a rise in the memecoin’s price. This rise in the memecoin can generate profits, even if no profits are taken from XRP. Ripple CTO on XRP’s Value In an online exchange, David Schwartz passionately defended XRP Ledger against a critic’s claim that it operates as a “zero-sum game.” Ripple’s CTO actively engaged with the critic, dispelling misconceptions and highlighting XRP’s intrinsic value and utility. He countered the criticism by explaining the fundamental operation of the XRPL, portraying it as a platform facilitating seamless XRP transfers and issued assets. The Ripple executive emphasized that users willingly pay transaction fees for the valuable service, asserting that the benefits outweighed the associated costs. Schwartz affirmed that the XRPL is not solely a tool for transferring value but a sophisticated platform supporting various financial activities. Institutional Confidence Grows With XRP Meanwhile, institutional investors are interested in XRP. Ripple’s 2024 third-quarter market report hints at rising interest and suggests that institutional adoption has risen. Notably, 21Shares, Bitwise Invest, and Canary Funds have all filed for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Grayscale Investments has launched an XRP Trust and wishes to gain the regulatory body’s approval to convert its multi-asset fund into an ETF. These moves show that investors see value in XRP as a critical tool for guaranteeing global liquidity .

Schiff’s demand follows controversial posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, which allegedly contributed to a pump and dump scheme. Schiff is calling for transparency regarding the authorship of these posts, the individuals who had prior knowledge of them, and the financial transactions linked to the incident. Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Blasts Trump Over Alleged Crypto Pump and Dump Peter Schiff has raised concerns about the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices following two posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account. Schiff claims the posts were strategically timed to manipulate the market, benefiting individuals who had advance knowledge of their release. He has called for a full congressional investigation to determine who was involved. The economist has specifically questioned the authorship of the Truth Social posts. Peter Schiff believes certain individuals may have used insider knowledge to invest in cryptos such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) before selling at inflated prices. He urged lawmakers to trace financial transactions linked to the alleged scheme. More so, the Bitcoin critic is demanding access to emails and text messages from Trump’s staff, family, and employees. He aims to investigate any coordination behind the crypto-related posts on Truth Social. Peter Schiff added, “Donald Trump, the first crypto President, just helped pull off the biggest crypto rug pull of all time. A Congressional investigation is now warranted.” Schiff Questions Insider Trading Schiff has urged authorities to examine whether individuals close to Donald Trump benefited financially from the crypto market movements. He is calling for an investigation into who purchased digital assets before the posts were made public. The Bitcoin critic wants investigators to determine how much money was invested by those with prior knowledge of the posts and the exact timing of any subsequent sales. Schiff claims that if insider trading occurred, it would constitute a major financial scandal. The Bitcoin critic said, “We also need all emails or text messages that involve any members of the President’s staff, his or their family or friends, his campaign donors, or Truth Social employees, that relate to either of the two Sunday Truth Social posts.” Bitcoin Critic Rejects Support for BTC Reserve Meanwhile, Peter Schiff recently distanced himself from previous comments that appeared to support a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He now claims that Bitcoin enthusiasts misrepresented his statements to manipulate public perception. The economist has accused Bitcoin promoters of spreading false information to inflate BTC prices. Schiff insists that his remarks were taken out of context and that he never endorsed Bitcoin as a reserve asset. He has criticized what he calls “fraudulent tactics” used by Bitcoin supporters to influence the market. Despite Peter Schiff’s allegations, the Donald Trump administration has continued to push its crypto agenda. In a recent CoinGape report, US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce confirmed the members of the newly formed Crypto Task Force, signaling a shift in regulatory approach. The 15-member team includes staff from various SEC divisions, focusing on developing clear guidelines for the crypto industry.

A powerful directive from Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has ignited the conversation around Vietnam crypto regulation . The nation’s leader has called for the urgent establishment of a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, setting a deadline for the end of this very month. This decisive move signals a potential turning point for digital assets in Vietnam, a country with a rapidly growing tech-savvy population. Why is a Crypto Legal Framework Suddenly a Priority in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s instruction underscores the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies’ influence on the global financial landscape. For Vietnam, establishing a crypto legal framework isn’t just about keeping pace with global trends; it’s about strategically positioning itself in the burgeoning digital economy. Several factors are likely driving this urgency: Preventing Illicit Activities: Without clear regulations, the cryptocurrency space can be vulnerable to money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities. A legal framework aims to mitigate these risks and protect citizens. Harnessing Innovation: Vietnam has a vibrant tech sector and a youthful, digitally engaged population. A well-defined regulatory environment can foster innovation and attract investment in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Economic Growth: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have the potential to unlock new avenues for economic growth, including fintech innovation, cross-border payments, and new business models. Investor Protection: Clear rules provide clarity and protection for individuals and businesses engaging with cryptocurrencies, fostering trust and wider cryptocurrency Vietnam adoption. What Challenges Lie Ahead in Crafting Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations? While the Prime Minister’s directive is a significant step, creating a comprehensive and effective crypto legal framework is a complex undertaking. The Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) face several hurdles: Challenge Description Defining Cryptocurrencies: Classifying cryptocurrencies – are they currencies, commodities, or securities? – is crucial for determining applicable regulations. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulations must be robust enough to mitigate risks without stifling innovation and the growth of the crypto sector. International Best Practices: Learning from and adapting regulatory approaches from other countries while tailoring them to Vietnam’s specific context is essential. Enforcement and Compliance: Establishing mechanisms for effective enforcement and ensuring compliance with the new regulations will be critical for success. Public Awareness and Education: Educating the public about cryptocurrency risks and regulations is vital for responsible adoption and preventing scams. The Role of Pham Minh Chinh in Shaping Vietnam’s Crypto Future Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh crypto initiative demonstrates a proactive approach to embracing emerging technologies. His direct involvement signals the government’s commitment to navigating the complexities of the digital asset space. This top-down approach can accelerate the regulatory process and ensure inter-agency cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). His leadership could be instrumental in shaping a regulatory environment that fosters both innovation and responsible growth within the Vietnamese crypto ecosystem. What Could Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations Look Like? Examples from Around the Globe While the specifics of Vietnam’s regulations remain to be seen, we can look at examples from other countries to get an idea of potential approaches: South Korea: Known for its comprehensive approach, South Korea regulates crypto exchanges, requires KYC/AML compliance, and taxes crypto profits. Singapore: Emphasizes a balanced approach, promoting innovation while implementing AML/CFT regulations and consumer protection measures. United States: Takes a fragmented approach with various agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN) overseeing different aspects of the crypto market. European Union: Developing MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation to create a harmonized framework across member states. Vietnam could potentially draw inspiration from these models, adopting a blend of approaches that best suits its economic and regulatory context. It is likely that the framework will address areas such as: Licensing and registration for crypto exchanges and service providers. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Taxation of cryptocurrency transactions and holdings. Consumer protection measures to safeguard investors. Regulations on stablecoins and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Adoption in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s directive is a bullish signal for crypto adoption Vietnam . A clear legal framework, while potentially introducing stricter rules, will ultimately legitimize the cryptocurrency industry and foster greater trust and participation. Here’s what you should consider: For Crypto Investors in Vietnam: Stay informed about the upcoming regulations. Compliance will be key, so be prepared for potential KYC requirements and tax implications. For Crypto Businesses: Vietnam is becoming an increasingly attractive market. A clear regulatory framework will provide the certainty needed to invest and expand operations in the country. For the Vietnamese Government: A well-designed regulatory framework can position Vietnam as a regional leader in fintech innovation and attract foreign investment. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Vietnam’s Digital Economy Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh’s urgent call for a crypto legal framework marks a pivotal moment for Vietnam’s engagement with the digital asset revolution. While the specifics are yet to unfold, this decisive action signals a proactive and forward-thinking approach. By embracing regulation, Vietnam is not just catching up with global trends but actively shaping its future in the digital economy. The coming month will be crucial in defining the contours of this framework and its long-term impact on Vietnam’s crypto landscape. This bold move has the potential to unlock significant opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and greater financial inclusion in Vietnam, making it a nation to watch in the global crypto space.

41122507,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136357,1741046383,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Power Shift: Trump Aides Join Paradigm’s Policy Council to Revolutionize Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-aides-paradigm-crypto-policy/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, Paradigm, a leading crypto investment firm, has announced the addition of six new members to its Policy Council. What’s truly grabbing headlines is the inclusion of former Trump administration officials, signaling a potential shift in the landscape of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. Are we witnessing a new era of collaboration between traditional political heavyweights and the rapidly evolving digital asset space? Let’s dive into the details. Why is the Paradigm Policy Council attracting such attention? Paradigm is not just any investment firm; it’s a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, known for backing some of the most innovative projects in the space. Their Policy Council is designed to navigate the complex and often murky waters of crypto regulation . By bringing together individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise, Paradigm aims to proactively engage with policymakers and shape the future of digital asset legislation. The recent appointments highlight the growing importance of strategic policy engagement in the crypto industry. The newly inducted members include: Robert O’Brien : Former National Security Advisor during the Trump administration. O’Brien’s experience in national security and international policy brings a significant weight to the council, particularly in discussions around the national security implications of cryptocurrency and its regulation. Van Jones : A well-known CNN host and political commentator. Jones adds a unique perspective, bridging the gap between mainstream media and the crypto world. His understanding of public opinion and communication will be invaluable in shaping the narrative around digital assets. Jen Brown : A Democratic advisor. Brown’s inclusion ensures bipartisan representation and a balanced approach to policy discussions, crucial for navigating the politically charged environment surrounding crypto. And three other unnamed individuals, as reported by The Block. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation? The involvement of former Trump aides , particularly Robert O’Brien, in Paradigm’s Policy Council is noteworthy for several reasons: Legitimacy and Mainstreaming : Having figures from previous administrations on board lends a degree of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency industry. It signals that crypto is no longer a fringe technology but a serious sector engaging with established political players. Policy Influence : These individuals possess deep networks and understanding of Washington D.C.’s policy-making processes. Their involvement could translate to more informed and potentially favorable regulations for the crypto industry. Bipartisan Approach : The inclusion of both Republican and Democratic figures suggests an attempt to build bipartisan consensus around cryptocurrency policy . This is crucial for long-term regulatory stability and industry growth. However, challenges and questions remain: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty Despite these appointments, the overall regulatory landscape for crypto remains unclear in many jurisdictions. The Policy Council will need to navigate diverse and sometimes conflicting regulatory approaches globally. Public Perception Cryptocurrency still faces skepticism from some segments of the public and policymakers. Overcoming negative perceptions and educating stakeholders will be a key task. Balancing Innovation and Regulation The council must strike a delicate balance between advocating for regulations that protect consumers and prevent illicit activities, while also fostering innovation and growth within the crypto space. Robert O’Brien and the Paradigm Vision: A New Direction for Crypto? Robert O’Brien’s background in national security adds a fascinating dimension to the Paradigm Policy Council. His expertise could be particularly valuable in addressing concerns related to: National Security Implications of Crypto : Examining how cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit activities and developing strategies to mitigate these risks while preserving the benefits of the technology. International Crypto Policy Coordination : Navigating the complexities of global crypto regulation and fostering international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. Cybersecurity and Digital Asset Protection : Drawing on his national security experience to enhance cybersecurity measures within the crypto industry and protect digital assets from theft and fraud. The addition of these high-profile individuals to the Paradigm Policy Council underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a clear signal that crypto is moving beyond its early, Wild West days and actively seeking to engage with the established political and regulatory frameworks. This move could pave the way for more constructive dialogue between the crypto industry and policymakers, potentially leading to clearer and more supportive regulations in the future. Actionable Insights: What can we expect next? Here are some actionable insights and things to watch out for: Increased Policy Advocacy : Expect Paradigm and its Policy Council to become more vocal in policy debates and regulatory discussions. Their influence in shaping crypto legislation is likely to grow. Focus on Clear Regulations : The council will likely advocate for clear, consistent, and innovation-friendly regulations that provide businesses with the certainty they need to operate and grow. Bipartisan Engagement : Keep an eye on how effectively the council leverages its bipartisan composition to build consensus and bridge political divides on crypto policy. Global Regulatory Influence : Paradigm’s initiatives could have implications beyond the US, potentially influencing global discussions on crypto regulation . Conclusion: A Powerful Alliance for Crypto’s Future? The formation of a robust Policy Council at Paradigm, bolstered by figures like former Trump aides and prominent political voices, is a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a powerful alliance aimed at shaping the future of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. While challenges undoubtedly remain, this move signals a determined effort to bridge the gap between the crypto world and traditional power structures. The coming months and years will reveal the extent of their impact, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto regulation is becoming more sophisticated and influential, promising a potentially transformative period for the digital asset landscape.

As speculation mounts over its potential to reach $500, investors are tuning in for Litecoin’s next act. Yet, despite being a well-established cryptocurrency, Litecoin’s explosive growth potential is clouded by intense market competition. Conversely, Web3Bay (3BAY) is turning heads for a different reason. This budding decentralized e-commerce platform, still in its presale phase, has not only raised over $1.5 million but also tantalizes with projections of gains surpassing 3,633%. Is Litecoin’s journey to $500 feasible, or does Web3Bay present a more astute investment avenue? Let’s dissect both opportunities to unearth which harbors the greatest growth potential for 2025. Is Litecoin on the Verge of a $500 Breakthrough? The resurgence in Litecoin’s market activity has reignited investor enthusiasm. Recently surging past the critical $100 barrier, LTC’s current trading price of $128 reflects a robust 30% growth in the past fortnight. Technical analysis suggests that breaking the $135 resistance could propel LTC towards ambitious targets of $175 and $240, aligned with key Fibonacci levels, indicating potential for further ascents. Another pivotal development boosting Litecoin’s prospects is the potential U.S. approval of a Litecoin ETF. The SEC’s nod to a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing, coupled with NASDAQ’s proposal to trade ETF shares, could significantly draw institutional investors, potentially catalyzing Litecoin’s value. However, achieving a $500 valuation implies a formidable 290% increase from its present stance—a feat Litecoin has not accomplished in a single cycle since 2017. With the rise of agile and cost-effective blockchains like Solana and Avalanche, sustaining momentum could prove challenging for Litecoin despite a promising setup. Web3Bay’s 3,633% ROI Prospect—Capturing Investor Focus While Litecoin offers modest growth potential, Web3Bay is shaping up as a powerhouse investment with far greater return possibilities. Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce by crafting a decentralized marketplace that omits intermediaries, slashes fees, and grants transactional control to users. This platform stands apart from centralized giants by employing blockchain to foster a transparent, efficient, and community-led shopping environment. With the presale already amassing over $1.5 million, demonstrating robust investor trust, the current presale price of 3BAY at $0.005247 points to an explosive 3,633% ROI, should it hit its projected launch price of $0.1959. What Sets Web3Bay Apart? Real-World Utility: Web3Bay addresses tangible e-commerce pain points, positioning it for sustained adoption and growth. Early Investor Benefits: The ongoing presale offers a prime opportunity to acquire 3BAY at its inception price, ahead of major exchange listings. Vast Market Reach: With the e-commerce market valued at over $6 trillion, Web3Bay’s innovative model stands to capture significant market share by eliminating traditional barriers and costs. Unmatched Growth Potential: Unlike Litecoin’s gradual appreciation path, Web3Bay’s presale stage presents a remarkable opportunity for rapid value increase. Key Insights While Litecoin’s potential climb to $500 is not out of reach, it is fraught with challenges from competitive pressures and the need for sustained, large-scale institutional investment. In contrast, Web3Bay is at a nascent stage where the scope for exponential gains is remarkably higher. As it pioneers a decentralized model in e-commerce and captivates substantial early-stage funding, Web3Bay represents an irresistible prospect. For investors who missed early opportunities in trailblazers like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable foundational investment chance—one that could yield transformative returns for early participants.

SHIB’s Price Prediction Shows Optimism & LTC Could Fall,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-hits-200m-next-target-600m-with-10-upcoming-listings-shibs-price-prediction-shows-optimism-ltc-could-fall/,"Market watchers are keenly observing trends across key cryptocurrencies. The Shiba Inu price prediction is drawing attention after a spike in large-scale purchases suggests a possible price surge. The focus remains on whether these buys will drive substantial price movements or if SHIB will stabilize within its current range. Conversely, the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is causing worry, with forecasts pointing to a potential 25% decline. Reduced trading activity and growing short positions might hinder LTC’s recovery anytime soon. On another note, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making significant strides as it prepares to debut on 10 leading centralized exchanges. With $200 million already raised in its presale and providing a stunning 2,380% ROI to initial supporters, BDAG is positioned as a top crypto to follow as it approaches a whopping $600 million presale target. SHIB Price Prediction: Whale Activity Sparks Hope The Shiba Inu price prediction is once again a hot topic due to an impressive 90% increase in transactions from major holders. This uptick suggests a positive shift, with SHIB’s price prediction potentially turning bullish as large-scale holders continue to buy in. Currently priced near $0.00001424, SHIB faces crucial resistance at $0.00001660. Discussions around the Shiba Inu price prediction suggest breaking this barrier could push prices to $0.00001700 or more, while failure to maintain $0.00001500 could drop SHIB below $0.00001400. The growing whale activity remains a key influence in this Shiba Inu price prediction, with further gains possible if this trend persists. Litecoin (LTC) Bearish Outlook: Is a 25% Drop Looming? The Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is strengthening with evidence pointing to a possible 25% reduction from its current $117 value. Analysts see $141 as a significant hurdle, enhancing discussions that Litecoin’s (LTC) bearish outlook might solidify if LTC cannot surpass this obstacle. A 23% fall in trade volume contributes to the concerns among those betting short-term. While the 200 EMA indicates some resilience, the overall mood remains pessimistic, reinforcing the LTC’s (LTC) bearish outlook. A jump in short bets now surpassing $67 million this week shows an increasing trend of market players anticipating further losses. Nevertheless, some long-term stakeholders continue to amass, showing not all are swayed by the prevailing negative outlook. BlockDAG Sets Sights on 10 Major CEX Listings BlockDAG is preparing for a significant move with upcoming launches on 10 renowned centralized exchanges. Listings on these platforms not only enhance credibility but also significantly boost trading volume. With these exchanges on board, anticipation is building that their users will soon join the presale frenzy. Currently priced at $0.0248, the coin’s value is soaring thanks to a presale that has already gathered over $200 million. To date, 18.6 billion coins have been claimed, and with the 27th batch now available, early participants are enjoying a remarkable 2,380% ROI. Industry experts have dubbed BDAG a top crypto to buy, eyeing a colossal $600 million funding goal. These listings are anticipated to drive wider adoption, setting the stage for more liquidity and robust trading activity. With plans for a mainnet launch in 2025, the future looks promising for significant value appreciation. Expectations of reaching $20 by 2027 are keeping the community engaged, bolstered by BDAG’s growing network of partnerships and a vibrant supporter base. With the momentum from the presale, anticipated exchange listings, and ambitious price targets, BDAG is on a fast track to gaining broad recognition among both new and experienced crypto traders seeking the next lucrative venture. Market Trends: Optimism & Caution in Crypto Trading The cryptocurrency domain is currently a mix of excitement and caution, with the Shiba Inu price prediction indicating a potential surge thanks to increased interest from major buyers, while the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook signals a possible downturn unless it overcomes specific resistance hurdles. In the meantime, BlockDAG is making strides toward becoming a mainstream fixture with 10 significant CEX listings in the pipeline. The crypto presale has been a massive success, securing $200 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. As BDAG moves toward the $600 million mark, its escalating presence in the market positions it as a top crypto to buy, with upcoming listings poised to broaden its trading scope.

California is stepping up its game. Just when you thought the AI safety debate couldn’t get any hotter, the Golden State is back in the ring with a brand-new legislative punch. Senator Scott Wiener, the very lawmaker behind last year’s controversial SB 1047, has just dropped SB 53 – a bill that’s already sending ripples through Silicon Valley and beyond. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals closely watching the intersection of digital innovation and regulation, this is a development you can’t afford to ignore. Let’s dive into what this new California AI Bill means for the future of artificial intelligence and tech innovation. What’s New in California’s AI Regulation Landscape? After the intense discussions surrounding SB 1047, which aimed to put guardrails on potentially dangerous AI systems, Senator Wiener is back with SB 53. This new bill appears to take a more nuanced approach, focusing on two key areas: Tech Whistleblower Protection: Empowering employees at leading AI labs to speak out about potential risks without fear of retaliation. CalCompute Cloud Initiative: Creating a public cloud computing resource to democratize AI development and boost public-interest research. Think of it as a strategic pivot. Instead of directly tackling the ‘existential risk’ aspects that made SB 1047 so contentious, SB 53 carves out specific, arguably less controversial, components. But don’t be fooled – this bill is still packing a punch when it comes to shaping the future of AI regulation in California and potentially setting a precedent for the rest of the nation. Why Whistleblower Protection is a Game-Changer for AI Safety One of the most significant aspects of the California AI Bill , SB 53, is its focus on Tech Whistleblower Protection . Imagine being an engineer at a cutting-edge AI lab and noticing something deeply concerning – a potential flaw that could lead to serious societal harm. Historically, speaking out could mean risking your job and career. SB 53 aims to change that. Key highlights of the whistleblower protection aspect: Protection from Retaliation: AI developers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who report concerns about ‘critical risks’. Clear Definition of ‘Critical Risk’: The bill defines this as a risk of death or serious injury to over 100 people, or damages exceeding $1 billion. Reporting Channels: Whistleblowers can disclose information to the California Attorney General, federal authorities, or even internal colleagues. Follow-up Requirements: Companies must report back to whistleblowers on internal processes related to their concerns. This is a powerful move towards enhancing AI safety . By empowering insiders, SB 53 seeks to create a crucial check-and-balance system within the rapidly evolving AI industry. It acknowledges that those closest to the technology are often best positioned to identify potential dangers. CalCompute Cloud: Democratizing AI Development? Beyond whistleblower protection, SB 53 introduces another intriguing element: the CalCompute Cloud . This initiative proposes creating a public cloud computing cluster to level the playing field in AI development. But what exactly is CalCompute, and why does it matter? Understanding CalCompute Cloud: Public Resource: CalCompute would be a publicly funded cloud computing cluster accessible to researchers and startups. Collaboration Focus: A group consisting of University of California representatives and other experts would guide its development. Boosting Public Interest AI: The goal is to provide resources for developing AI that benefits the public, not just large corporations. Addressing Compute Inequality: It aims to tackle the issue where only a few tech giants have access to massive computing power needed for advanced AI. For startups and researchers, especially those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space exploring AI applications, CalCompute Cloud could be a game-changer. It could lower the barrier to entry, fostering innovation and potentially leading to more diverse and publicly beneficial AI applications. Imagine the possibilities for decentralized AI projects with access to state-of-the-art computing resources! Will SB 53 Face the Same Pushback as SB 1047? Senator Wiener’s previous AI Safety Bill , SB 1047, faced intense opposition, particularly from Silicon Valley. Critics argued it would stifle innovation and put California at a disadvantage in the global AI race. Governor Newsom ultimately vetoed it, citing concerns about its approach. Key Differences and Potential Challenges for SB 53: Feature SB 1047 (Controversial) SB 53 (New Approach) Focus Preventing catastrophic AI risks (existential risk) Whistleblower protection & public computing resources Controversy Level High – sparked accusations of fear-mongering and hindering innovation Potentially lower – focuses on arguably less contentious areas Silicon Valley Reaction (SB 1047) Strong opposition, labeled as harmful to competitiveness TBD – likely to be more receptive to whistleblower protection and CalCompute, but scrutiny expected Political Climate 2024 – heightened AI safety concerns 2025 – potential shift towards prioritizing AI innovation over safety While SB 53 may be seen as less radical than SB 1047, it’s still likely to face scrutiny. The political landscape may also be shifting, with some voices, like Vice President J.D. Vance, suggesting a greater emphasis on AI innovation over stringent AI regulation . The coming months will be crucial in determining SB 53’s fate in the California legislature. The Future of AI Regulation: What to Watch For California’s efforts to shape AI regulation are being closely watched globally. SB 53, regardless of its outcome, will contribute to the ongoing conversation about how to govern this transformative technology. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding these regulatory trends is vital as AI increasingly intersects with decentralized technologies. Key takeaways and what to watch: Silicon Valley’s Response: How will tech giants and startups react to SB 53? Will they see whistleblower protection and CalCompute as constructive or burdensome? Legislative Process: SB 53 still needs to navigate the California legislature. Amendments, debates, and eventual votes will shape its final form. National Impact: California’s actions often influence other states and even federal policy. SB 53 could set a precedent for Tech Whistleblower Protection and public AI infrastructure. Global Dialogue: The debate around AI safety and AI regulation is global. California’s experience will inform international discussions and policy development. In conclusion, SB 53 represents a significant step in California’s ongoing journey to grapple with the complexities of artificial intelligence. By focusing on whistleblower protection and democratizing access to computing resources, it offers a potentially more palatable approach to AI safety than its predecessor, SB 1047. Whether it will successfully navigate the legislative process and ultimately shape the future of AI remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the debate around AI regulation is far from over, and California is determined to remain at the forefront.

41122642,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136399,1741046603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking AI Impact at MWC: Two Visions Divide Tech’s Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-impact-mwc-tech-future/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to be a dominating force in the tech world, sparking both excitement and apprehension. At the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC), this dichotomy was on full display, with two prominent voices presenting radically different perspectives on the AI impact on our lives and society. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-forward individuals, understanding these diverging viewpoints is crucial as AI increasingly intersects with blockchain and the digital economy. Let’s delve into the starkly contrasting visions that emerged from MWC. The Optimistic Vision: AI as Humanity’s Supercharger Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and Google researcher, presented a compelling case for AI’s transformative potential. Speaking virtually, Kurzweil painted a picture of an AI future brimming with unprecedented advancements and benefits for humanity. His core arguments revolved around: Enhanced Longevity and Healthcare: Kurzweil believes AI will revolutionize healthcare, leading to significant extensions in human lifespan. AI-driven diagnostics, personalized medicine, and drug discovery are poised to tackle diseases and improve overall health dramatically. Renewable Energy Revolution: He highlighted AI’s role in optimizing renewable energy technologies. According to Kurzweil, “AI-optimized designs” are making solar and other renewable energy sources increasingly efficient and cost-effective, paving the way for a sustainable energy future. He boldly predicted that renewable energy will “dominate within a decade,” thanks to AI. Ubiquitous Benefits: Kurzweil envisions AI transforming “everything all at once,” showering humanity with benefits across countless domains. From smarter cities to personalized education, he sees AI as a catalyst for progress in virtually every aspect of life. Kurzweil’s presentation was a classic example of technological optimism, emphasizing the immense potential of AI to solve global challenges and elevate the human experience. He urged attendees to pay attention to the “huge gains” already being powered by AI, suggesting we are on the cusp of a technological golden age. The Pessimistic Counterpoint: AI and the Rage Machine In stark contrast to Kurzweil’s utopian vision, Scott Galloway, a tech investor and academic, offered a much more sobering perspective. Galloway’s fireside chat delivered a powerful warning about the darker side of AI, particularly its role in fueling societal division and negativity. His key concerns included: Rage-Fueled Algorithms: Galloway argued that algorithms, particularly those powering social media platforms, have discovered that “rage” is the ultimate engagement driver. These technology platforms, driven by ad revenue, prioritize sensational and divisive content, leading to increased polarization and societal fragmentation. Erosion of Social Cohesion: He painted a grim picture of a nation where AI-driven information sorting amplifies isolation and anti-social attitudes. Galloway pointed to the increasing loneliness and division in the U.S., where neighbors are losing the ability to communicate civilly, attributing this partly to AI’s influence on information consumption. Tech CEO Cowardice and Societal Impact: Galloway went further, criticizing tech billionaires for their silence in the face of democratic backsliding and social issues. He accused them of prioritizing personal gain over speaking out against policies that exacerbate inequality and undermine democratic institutions. He specifically called out CEOs like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook for not challenging what he sees as abuses of power, expressing disappointment at their perceived “cowardice.” Galloway’s message was a stark warning about the unintended consequences of unchecked technological advancement. He argued that while we are stronger technologically than ever, societal bonds are weakening, and AI is playing a significant role in this negative trend. His presentation served as a potent counterpoint to the unbridled optimism surrounding AI, urging for a more critical and responsible approach to its development and deployment. Navigating the AI Divide: Optimism vs. Realism The contrasting viewpoints presented at MWC highlight a crucial debate surrounding AI: Is it a force for unparalleled progress, or does it harbor significant risks that could undermine society? The reality, as with most complex issues, likely lies somewhere in between. Here’s a table summarizing the key differences: Perspective Key Proponent Core Argument Focus Tone Technological Optimism Ray Kurzweil AI will solve major problems, enhance human life, and drive unprecedented progress. Benefits, potential, future possibilities Utopian, enthusiastic, future-oriented Technological Realism/Criticism Scott Galloway AI algorithms can exacerbate societal problems, fuel division, and require careful management. Risks, challenges, current societal impact Sobering, critical, present-focused Actionable Insights and the Path Forward So, what are the key takeaways from these divided views on AI impact , especially for those in the cryptocurrency and tech space? Embrace Innovation with Caution: While the potential of AI and related innovation is undeniable, it’s crucial to approach its development and implementation with a critical eye. We must be mindful of potential downsides and unintended consequences. Ethical Considerations are Paramount: As AI becomes more pervasive, ethical frameworks and responsible AI development practices are essential. This includes addressing algorithmic bias, ensuring data privacy, and mitigating the potential for misuse. Foster Dialogue and Collaboration: Open and honest conversations about the societal implications of AI are crucial. Bringing together diverse perspectives – from technologists to ethicists to social scientists – is vital for navigating the complex challenges and opportunities that AI presents. Demand Accountability from Tech Leaders: Galloway’s critique of tech CEOs raises important questions about responsibility and leadership. As AI’s influence grows, it’s essential to hold tech leaders accountable for the societal impact of their technologies and platforms. Conclusion: A Nuanced Perspective on the AI Future The MWC presentations by Kurzweil and Galloway offer valuable, albeit contrasting, lenses through which to view the AI future . While Kurzweil’s optimism inspires us to imagine the transformative possibilities of AI, Galloway’s realism compels us to confront the potential pitfalls. Ultimately, a balanced and nuanced approach is necessary. We must strive to harness the immense power of AI for good while proactively addressing its risks and ensuring that its development benefits all of humanity, not just a select few. The conversation at MWC underscores that the journey into an AI-driven world requires both visionary enthusiasm and critical foresight.

41122773,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136411,1741046849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Bitwise Files for Spot Dogecoin ETF – A New Era for DOGE?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-files-spot-dogecoin-etf/,"Hold onto your digital wallets, Dogecoin enthusiasts! The crypto world is buzzing with exciting news that could potentially reshape the landscape for everyone’s favorite meme-inspired cryptocurrency. If you’ve been eagerly waiting for more accessible ways to invest in DOGE, you might just be in luck. Let’s dive into the details of this potentially groundbreaking development. What’s the Buzz About a Spot Dogecoin ETF? As reported by Watcher Guru on X, crypto asset manager Bitwise has officially thrown its hat into the ring, filing an application with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch a spot Dogecoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This is a significant step because a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Dogecoin – offering investors exposure to DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. But what does this mean for you, the average crypto enthusiast, and the future of Dogecoin? Why is a Spot Crypto ETF a Big Deal? To understand the excitement, let’s break down why a spot crypto ETF, especially a Spot Dogecoin ETF , is such a noteworthy event: Accessibility for Mainstream Investors: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a vast pool of investors who may be hesitant or unfamiliar with navigating cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. This could open Dogecoin to a significantly larger investment audience. Regulation and Security: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some may find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto space. Investing through a regulated Bitwise ETF could ease concerns about security and compliance. Simplified Investment Process: Buying and selling ETF shares is straightforward, similar to trading stocks. This simplicity removes the technical hurdles associated with buying, storing, and managing Dogecoin directly, making it more appealing to a broader range of investors. Potential for Increased Liquidity: An ETF can boost liquidity for Dogecoin as it creates another avenue for trading and investment, potentially leading to more robust and stable market conditions. Spot vs. Futures: Understanding the Difference in Crypto ETFs You might be wondering, aren’t there already crypto ETFs? Yes, there are, but the key difference lies in the term “spot.” Many existing crypto ETFs are based on futures contracts, not the actual underlying cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot ETF Futures ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds the cryptocurrency (Dogecoin in this case) Holds futures contracts that predict the future price of the cryptocurrency Price Tracking More closely tracks the actual spot price of the cryptocurrency Price can deviate from the spot price due to futures market dynamics Investor Exposure Direct exposure to the price movements of the cryptocurrency Indirect exposure through futures contracts, potentially leading to tracking errors and roll costs A Spot Dogecoin ETF , like the one Bitwise is proposing, is generally considered more desirable by many investors as it offers more direct and transparent exposure to the price of Dogecoin. Why Bitwise for a Dogecoin ETF? Bitwise is a well-known and respected name in the crypto asset management space. They have a track record of launching innovative crypto investment products. Their decision to file for a DOGE ETF signals a growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the broader meme coin sector. Bitwise’s expertise and reputation could lend credibility and attract investors to this new ETF offering. Challenges and Roadblocks for a Spot DOGE ETF While the filing is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the path to launching a Spot Dogecoin ETF isn’t guaranteed to be smooth. There are potential hurdles: Regulatory Approval: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in the United States has been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs. Getting the green light from regulators is the biggest hurdle. The SEC needs to be convinced about market surveillance, investor protection, and the maturity of the Dogecoin market. Market Volatility: Dogecoin, like many cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. Regulators may have concerns about the risks associated with a highly volatile asset within an ETF structure. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC is also concerned about potential market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space. Bitwise will need to demonstrate robust measures to prevent manipulation and ensure fair trading of the ETF. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin’s Price and Future? The potential launch of a Spot Dogecoin ETF could have several implications for Dogecoin: Increased Demand: If the ETF is approved and gains traction, it could create significant new demand for Dogecoin as ETF providers need to acquire DOGE to back the ETF shares. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand could potentially drive up the price of Dogecoin. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and price movements are influenced by many factors. Mainstream Adoption: A successful Crypto ETF for Dogecoin could further legitimize Dogecoin as an asset class and contribute to its broader mainstream adoption. Evolution of Meme Coins: The success of a Dogecoin ETF could pave the way for ETFs based on other meme coins, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the meme-driven crypto world. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? While we wait for updates on Bitwise’s Bitwise ETF application, here are some actionable steps you can consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on cryptocurrency news and regulatory developments. Follow reputable sources like Watcher Guru and Bitwise’s official announcements for updates on the ETF application. Do Your Research: Understand the risks and potential rewards associated with Dogecoin and crypto ETFs before making any investment decisions. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Your Investment Strategy: Think about how a Spot Dogecoin ETF might fit into your overall investment portfolio, if at all. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Engage in the Community: Join discussions and communities around Dogecoin and crypto ETFs to learn from others and stay updated on the latest developments. Conclusion: A Promising Development for Dogecoin? Bitwise filing for a Spot Dogecoin ETF is undoubtedly a significant and exciting development for the Dogecoin community and the broader crypto market. It represents a potential step towards mainstream adoption and greater accessibility for DOGE. While regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain factors to consider, this move signals growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Keep watching this space – the journey of the Spot Dogecoin ETF is just beginning, and it promises to be an interesting one!

NFTs are not securities.” SEC ends Yuga Labs probe into BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin after two years In October 2022, the SEC opened a probe into Yuga Labs to examine its NFT offerings and the distribution of ApeCoin. The SEC aimed to determine whether these digital assets qualified as securities under U.S. law, applying the Howey Test—a legal standard established by a 1946 Supreme Court case. The watchdog’s probe began under former Chair Gary Gensler. It was part of a wider investigation into NFTs, including probes into NFT creators and marketplaces, to determine whether some, such as fractional NFTs, were securities. Founded in 2021, Yuga Labs created some of the most sought-after and expensive NFT collections during the market’s peak, including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club. It also bought the rights to CryptoPunks, an early NFT collection that had historically fetched huge sums. The NFT conglomerate achieved a $4 billion valuation after securing $450 million in funding by 2022. The firm’s BAYC collection has generated billions in trading volume, making it a prominent player in the NFT space. SEC softens crypto stance, drops multiple investigations The SEC’s reported decision to abandon its investigation into Yuga Labs aligns with the regulator’s increasingly lenient stance toward the crypto industry under the Trump administration. Most recently, the regulator has dropped its investigation of several major crypto companies, including Robinhood, Gemini, UniSwap Labs, Consensys-owned MetaMask, and OpenSea. The SEC has also reached settlements with Coinbase and is reportedly on track to settle its case against TRON’s Justin Sun. In its announcement that it is dropping its case against Coinbase, the SEC said its Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit will weed out those that are looking to exploit innovation to harm investors, including through fraud related to blockchain technology and crypto assets. The SEC has been reversing multiple crypto-related enforcement actions taken under former Chair Gensler, such as dropping a years-old lawsuit against Kraken on March 3. However, the SEC’s long-standing lawsuit against Ripple remains in active litigation. President Donald Trump recently named XRP one of the coins included in his proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve, alongside Cardano, Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price of ApeCoin , a token linked to the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, has fallen 16% in the past 24 hours amid a broader market pullback. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Following an initial decline in recent days, BTC surged above $94,000 on Sunday. This increase was fueled by reports of an upcoming US strategic crypto reserve that includes BTC and other major digital assets. However, as of today, BTC is trading just below $93,000, signaling an unstable upward momentum in the crypto market. Amid this price movement, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst KriptoBaykusV2 highlights an evolving pattern in Bitcoin’s net exchange flow, offering insight into investor sentiment. This data suggests that exchange inflows and outflows may play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s short-term price direction. Related Reading: Top Bitcoin Inflows Hit Year-High on Binance – Should You Be Concerned? Bitcoin Exchange Flows and Investor Sentiment According to KriptoBaykusV2, on February 25, Bitcoin saw a significant inflow to exchanges, with approximately 8,400 BTC being deposited. Historically, large inflows suggest increased selling pressure, as traders move assets to exchanges in preparation for liquidation. This was followed by a decline in Bitcoin’s price, aligning with previous market trends where increased supply on exchanges often leads to downward price movements. The following day, February 26, Bitcoin experienced a shift, with a substantial amount of BTC being withdrawn from exchanges. Large-scale outflows typically indicate a preference for holding, reducing the available supply on exchanges and potentially supporting price stability. This shift coincided with Bitcoin’s price finding support and beginning to recover, reflecting investor confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. The analyst noted: In summary, those closely monitoring Bitcoin’s exchange movements should take note: Large inflows into exchanges may indicate heightened selling pressure, requiring caution. On the other hand, significant outflows suggest that investors are opting to hold, which could lead to price appreciation. We will see in the coming days how these trends continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Enough—Coinbase CEO Rejects Altcoins For US Reserves Short-Term Selling and Market Trends Meanwhile, a separate analysis by another CryptoQuant analyst, abramchart, suggests that Bitcoin holders have started selling at a loss. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) index, which measures the profitability of short-term investors, according to the analyst recently recorded a value of 0.95. This level, the lowest since August 2024, suggests that more traders are selling BTC at a loss, an indication of capitulation. Historically, such periods have been followed by market recoveries as selling pressure eases and accumulation phases begin. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: The SOPR measures the proportion of Bitcoin wallets that have held Bitcoin for more than 1 hour and less than 155 days. Values over ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a profit. Values below ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a loss., which is a sign of capitulation and a return to an upward trend.

He tells his 243,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking to see KAITO rally above the $2.50 level, about 20% higher than current prices. “KAITO just longed around this area, targeting $2.50 and higher. will take profits along the way, hope BTC is stable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, KAITO is worth $2.09. Also in the AI sector, Altcoin Sherpa says AI Rig Complex ( ARC ), a Rust-based AI agent framework, is likely sitting at a local bottom and is ready to head higher. “I still have a bag of this and still feel pretty decent about it. It’s shown a lot of strength relative to other AI coins and, although the volatility is high on it, I still think this is the relative bottom. 200 exponential moving average on the four-hour acting as a stopping point and $0.19 still seems like a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, ARC is trading for $0.22. Looking at the mid-term time frame, the trader names three of his top altcoin picks. His watchlist includes the layer-one blockchain Sonic ( S ), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Maker ( MKR ), and a toss-up of intellectual property-focused project Story ( IP ), Ethereum ( ETH ) virtual machine (EVM) chain Berachain ( BERA ) and KAITO. “If I were to choose three coins to hold for the mid-term, they’d probably be: S: good defi activity, strong rebrand, lots of $$ going on there + Andre MKR: insane chart, continually grinding higher, strong og defi prob one of BERA/KAITO/IP, all these new coins are strong.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s the Crypto Promising a 3,633% Surge.",https://thecoinrise.com/will-shiba-inu-and-cardano-reach-new-peaks-in-2025-heres-the-crypto-promising-a-3633-surge/,"Shiba Inu and Cardano have been pivotal players in the cryptocurrency scene, drawing significant attention and fostering robust communities. Both have weathered varied market cycles, yet the possibility of them surpassing their historical peaks remains a topic of hot debate. Amidst this, Shiba Inu capitalizes on its vibrant community and viral appeal, whereas Cardano continues to push the boundaries with its technological enhancements. However, a new challenger, Web3Bay , is starting to eclipse these familiar faces with its groundbreaking potential and enticing promise of a 3,633% return on investment for early investors, having already accrued over $1.6 million in its presale. Analyzing Shiba Inu’s Market Dynamics Shiba Inu, a frontrunner among meme coins, faces a challenging path to reclaim its peak price levels. Despite achieving impressive highs during the 2021 bull market, it now trades at a significantly lower level, with recent months showing a notable decline. This downturn has sparked concerns among investors about its capability to breach and sustain beyond its previous highs. While there is speculative optimism about its future performance, real traction will likely depend on substantial developments within its ecosystem, such as the successful rollout of Shibarium and other strategic enhancements. Cardano’s Prospects for Setting New Records Cardano stands as a beacon of innovation within the smart contract arena but hasn’t been immune to the market’s downturns. Despite the recent advancements and increasing trading volumes, its price has struggled to keep pace. Yet, with developments like the Chang Hard Fork, Cardano is enhancing its network’s decentralization and functionality, potentially setting the stage for increased adoption across DeFi and enterprise solutions. However, the intense competition from other blockchain networks poses significant hurdles, requiring Cardano to not only innovate but also capture substantial market traction to achieve new price records. Web3Bay: A New Frontier for Crypto Returns While Shiba Inu and Cardano work to recapture their former highs, Web3Bay is making a powerful entrance with its innovative and disruptive approach to e-commerce. This decentralized platform is set to transform the online shopping experience by eliminating middlemen, slashing transaction fees, and bolstering security—all through its trustless, peer-to-peer marketplace. By diving into a trillion-dollar industry, Web3Bay is perfectly positioned to leverage blockchain technology for a monumental shift in how digital commerce operates. Already, Web3Bay’s presale has amassed over $1.6 million, signaling strong investor trust and optimism. Priced attractively at just $0.005247 during its presale, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay offers early investors the chance for a staggering 3,633% return on investment. Such a significant growth opportunity is uncommon among more established cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Cardano, positioning Web3Bay as one of the standout investment opportunities for 2025. The true allure of Web3Bay extends beyond just its financial prospects. Unlike many cryptocurrency ventures that are propelled by mere market excitement, Web3Bay serves a tangible, utilitarian purpose that could fundamentally alter the e-commerce landscape. As conventional online marketplaces grapple with issues like excessive fees, concerns over data privacy, and the pitfalls of centralized governance, Web3Bay’s blockchain solution stands out as a superior alternative that delivers real benefits to both merchants and consumers. This not only enhances its appeal as an investment but also underscores its potential to set a new standard in the e-commerce sector. Choosing the Crypto with the Most Upside for 2025 As investors navigate the choices between Shiba Inu, Cardano, and Web3Bay, the latter presents a compelling case with both immediate and long-term benefits. While Shiba Inu and Cardano require broader market rallies and significant ecosystem developments to reach new highs, Web3Bay offers a clear path to substantial returns based on tangible advancements and market penetration. For those looking to maximize their investment impact in 2025, Web3Bay provides an intriguing alternative, promising not only robust returns but also a revolutionary change in how e-commerce operates. As the crypto landscape evolves, aligning with innovative projects like Web3Bay could prove to be a wise strategy for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, aiming to capture significant gains in the rapidly expanding digital economy.

Turbo (TURBO) is a prime example—launched as an experimental meme coin, it shocked everyone by skyrocketing to a market cap that made early buyers filthy rich. If you missed that wave, here’s your redemption shot with the top new meme coin for significant returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is storming through its presale, offering a 3650% ROI potential, and those who recognize this golden window will be sitting on serious wealth. Right now, BTFD Coin is at $0.00016, but it won’t stay this cheap for long. With over $6.25 million raised, 71 billion coins sold, and 11,200+ holders, the 14th presale stage is near its end. Analysts predict a moonshot to $0.006 after launch, and if you invest now, you could see your portfolio multiply 36.5 times. While others sleep on this gem, smart investors are stacking their bags with the top new meme coin for significant returns before it’s too late. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That Could Mint New Millionaires Every once in a while, a presale emerges that screams opportunity. Right now, that’s BTFD Coin (BTFD). Unlike the wild volatility of post-launch meme coins, presales offer investors a chance to secure assets at rock-bottom prices before the pump. With BTFD’s presale currently at $0.00016, those who get in now are locking in a 275% ROI before it even hits exchanges, and that’s just the beginning. Let’s put it into perspective. A $1,500 investment today at $0.00016 secures you 9.375 million BTFD coins . When the presale wraps up at $0.0006, your holdings would already be worth $5,625—a nearly 4x gain before public trading even starts. But the real magic happens if BTFD hits its predicted moon price of $0.006. That same $1,500 investment? It would be worth $56,250. This isn’t speculation—this is math. BTFD isn’t just hype—it’s built on Ethereum, ensuring security and long-term sustainability. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which launched on January 1, 2025, lets users earn rewards while playing, further boosting community engagement. Staking is another powerhouse feature, offering a 90% APY, meaning passive income while you wait for prices to skyrocket. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad has built a movement—one that embraces buying low, holding strong, and cashing out when the market moons. Did you miss the Bitcoin dips? Ethereum crashes? Dogecoin’s underdog story? This is your shot to BTFD and ride the bull market from the very beginning. And if you’re looking for even more ways to stack up your holdings, BTFD’s referral program makes it simple: To earn big with BTFD, simply connect your wallet on the BTFD official site , grab your unique referral code, and share it with friends, family, or your community. Whenever someone buys $50 or more, they score 10% extra BTFD, while you pocket 10% of their purchase—and if you land in the top 20, your rewards skyrocket even more. Keep an eye on your earnings, stack up BTFD, and secure your spot in the top new meme coin for significant returns before the presale ends! Turbo (TURBO) – The Meme Coin That Turned Peanuts into Fortunes Turbo (TURBO) started as a joke—literally generated by AI—but ended up making millionaires. Its presale days were overlooked, with many laughing at its experimental origins. But while skeptics stayed on the sidelines, early investors quietly loaded up. Back in its launch phase, Turbo traded for fractions of a cent, but its insane rally took it to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.0144 on December 11, 2024. At its peak, investors who had put in a mere $500 during its early days were sitting on millions. The doubters? They were left wishing they had taken the risk when it was still dirt cheap. That story isn’t unique. Dogecoin had the same fate. Shiba Inu followed suit. Every time a meme coin gets dismissed as a fluke, it ends up proving the naysayers wrong. The ones who win? The ones who get in before the hype wave crests. Turbo’s story is a reminder that missing a meme coin’s early days is a costly mistake. History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes—and right now, BTFD is playing the same song Turbo did before it took off. Will you listen this time? Final Call – BTFD Presale Is Almost Over, Are You In? If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing Turbo’s meteoric rise, BTFD is your second chance—and maybe your last. The 14th stage is almost complete, and once this presale ends, prices won’t be this low again. The $0.00016 entry point won’t last forever. When it hits $0.006, your ROI is 3650%. That’s the kind of return that turns small investments into financial freedom. While others hesitate, action-takers secure their future. If you’re waiting for a sign, this is it. The next meme coin explosion is unfolding right now. Get in before the BTFD Coin presale swings into action, or watch the top new meme coin for significant returns from the sidelines again.

BTFD Coin is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a thriving community, a high-yield staking system (90% APY), and a Play-to-Earn game already live. Its presale has raised $6.25 million, and analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, making it one of the hottest meme coins right now. How does BTFD’s presale compare to Turbo’s early days? Like Turbo, BTFD is in its undervalued presale phase, offering a huge upside for early buyers. Turbo’s launch price was dirt cheap, and those who got in made life-changing gains. BTFD’s $0.00016 presale price offers a similar early-stage entry before its moonshot. How much can I make if I invest $1,500 in BTFD? At the current price of $0.00016, a $1,500 investment gets 9.375 million BTFD coins. If BTFD hits its expected post-launch price of $0.006, that $1,500 turns into $56,250. Is there a risk in investing in meme coins like BTFD? Like any investment, meme coins carry risk, but BTFD mitigates it with a strategic presale entry, staking rewards, and a growing ecosystem. Getting in early minimizes exposure to post-launch volatility, unlike buying at an all-time high. How do I join the BTFD Coin presale? Simply visit the official BTFD website, connect your wallet, and buy at the current presale price before the stage sells out. Don’t wait—the price increases at every stage.

The SEC attached a $50K incentive for its employees in what the financial regulator is calling a “voluntary early retirement” program. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) have focused their efforts on significantly slimming the government workforce and saving the government money in several areas. Massive layoffs and federal buyout programs are the results of their efforts so far. Most recently, SEC has offered its long-term employees the chance to resign or retire for a cash prize of $50K. Photo of Elon Musk wielding the chainsaw that Argentine president, Javier Milei gave to him at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) SEC goes the voluntary early retirement route According to an internal memo from SEC Chief Operating Officer Ken Johnson, the voluntary early retirement program is open to permanent employees who were on the agency’s payroll before January 24, 2025. Employees eligible for the offer must make their decision by March 21, 2025, and separate from the agency by April 4, 2025. The program allows these employees to either resign, be transferred to another agency, or immediately retire. The memo also stated that employees who accept the incentive and return to the SEC within five years are obligated to repay the incentive in full. The Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to reduce the federal workforce have already resulted in the elimination of over 100K civilian jobs, and their momentum does not seem to be slowing down. In February, The White House instructed federal agencies to submit their plans for “ large-scale reductions in force ” by March 13. The memo from the White House didn’t provide any specific roles for termination but said to start with workers deemed non-essential during a government shutdown. Furthering their plans to save money, the memo also instructed federal agencies to submit proposals to move their offices out of Washington and into “less costly parts of the country.” It is expected that the immediate cost of the SEC’s buyout offer will be offset by eliminating further expenses on the employees who accept the offer. Additionally, the SEC has instructed all staff, including unionized workers, to return to the office starting April 14, 2025. This instruction follows an order from the president demanding that employees work in person . This order doesn’t come as a surprise, as Donald Trump ordered heads of departments and agencies to “take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements” on his very first day in office. The instructions have been met with pushback from employees as the union’s contract with the agency allows for remote work. The instruction only temporarily excludes employees who already have full-time remote arrangements or whose homes are more than 50 miles from an SEC office. Buyouts in the workforce The SEC buyout program is in line with the Trump administration’s aim of significantly slashing the government workforce. It is one of many other agencies that has offered incentives to workers to voluntarily part with their roles. Black and white photo of US President Donald Trump and DOGE head and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk sitting side by side. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) An average of 62,000 federal workers have retired each year over the past decade, according to data provided by the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), but with the strategies of DOGE and President Trump, that number is expected to rise sharply. The Department of Education offered a $25K incentive to its employees to voluntarily retire or resign. Although it was framed as a voluntary program, the announcement of the incentive also came with the threat of a “significant reduction in force for the US Department of Education” following the deadline for application. The White House also offered all 2.3M federal employees, including 783K civilians in the Defense Department, a buyout worth roughly eight months of their salary and benefits. The offer was reported to be for employees who refused to comply with President Trump’s demand for all workers to return to the office. The email offering the incentive was framed as an easy method for the administration to effectively end remote work for most of the federal workforce. Still, it also carried the threat of the “majority” of agencies seeing reductions in force following the expiration of the offer. The US Postal Service recently offered early retirement incentives of up to $15,000 to mail handlers and other support staff, citing operational changes as the reason behind the move. “The United States Postal Service is continuing to transform its business model and build an organization structured for success. As a result of our capital investments in state-of-the-art mail processing equipment and changes to our network, the Postal Service needs to reduce staffing in those facilities that are overstaffed as we continue to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service to all communities,” the USPS spokesperson said .

His remarks triggered a sharp decline in U.S. stocks during late afternoon trading, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also weakened. “They’re going to have to face a tariff. What they need to do is build their car plants and other facilities in the United States—then they won’t have tariffs,” Trump stated at the White House. Trump doubles down on tariffs, citing fentanyl crisis and trade imbalances Trump stated there was “no room left” for a deal to prevent the tariffs by addressing fentanyl flows into the United States. He also announced that reciprocal tariffs would take effect on April 2 against countries that impose duties on U.S. products. Additionally, he reaffirmed plans to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports from 10% to 20% as a penalty for Beijing’s continued shipment of fentanyl to the U.S., asserting that China “has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis.” CEOs and economists warn that Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico—which would affect over $900 billion in annual U.S. imports—would significantly disrupt the deeply integrated North American economy. The Trump administration confirmed that the tariffs would take effect on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT). At that point, Canada and Mexico will face a 25% tariff, with Canadian energy products subject to a 10% duty. Mexican officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters that Ottawa was prepared to respond. She noted that there’s a level of unpredictability and chaos coming from the Oval Office, and they would be dealing with it. Gustavo Flores-Macias, a public policy professor at Cornell University, said consumers could see price hikes within days. “The automotive sector is expected to face significant negative impacts, not only due to disruptions in the supply chains that span all three countries but also because higher vehicle prices could weaken consumer demand,” said Flores-Macias. Mexico, which first managed to evade Trump’s first round of tariffs by vowing to deploy thousands of troops to its northern border, has stepped up its anti-drug efforts and signalled it might also impose new measures on Chinese goods coming into Mexico. At a press conference on Monday before Trump’s announcement, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that her government was calm while awaiting his decision. She still stressed that Mexico would retaliate if tariffs were enacted. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum holds a press conference a day before the imposition of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico March 3, 2025. REUTERS/Luis Cortes According to Sheinbaum the country has a plan B, C, and D,” Sheinbaum said, without providing specifics. She noted that trade and fentanyl-related cooperation with the U.S. had been “very good.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, synthetic opioids—primarily fentanyl—were responsible for 72,776 deaths in the U.S. in 2023. Lawmakers and economists sound alarm on tariff fallout and inflation risks Representative Suzan DelBene, a Democrat from Washington, warned that imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico would burden American families with higher costs at the grocery store, gas pump, and pharmacy. “No president should have the power to raise taxes without a vote in Congress,” she said in a statement. Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that any inflationary impact from the tariffs would be “second-order small.” He added, “I don’t see the president wavering on this because he understands that to achieve a strong and prosperous America—with rising real wages and more factory jobs—this is the path he has chosen.” On Saturday, Trump levelled up his targeted sanction initiatives by starting a national safety probe into lumber and wood items, which might produce tremendous new tariffs. He particularly delivered to Canada, a nation already dealing with 14.5% tariffs on softwood. The prior week, Trump had actively reprimanded many Western nations for taxing American tech enterprises and threatened to sting more obstacles on billions of products. The same day, he imposed a new investigation into copper tariffs and other trade limitations. Trump intends to impose U.S. “reciprocal tariffs” equivalent to those of other nations and has either removed trade barriers. The European Union might rapidly face this initiative since the VAT taxes imposed by the European Union on its member states considerably affect the result. Nonetheless, Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s Policy Development and Review Department , believes that Trump’s “tariffs on steroids” strategy could fuel inflation and potentially push the global economy into recession.

This price fluctuation has led to millions of dollars in liquidations, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Cardano (ADA) Liquidations Data shows that a total of $40.80 million worth of ADA positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Of these liquidations, $30 million came from the long side, while $11 million came from the short side. Current Price Momentum As a result, ADA has recorded a 25% price drop in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.81. Due to this significant price fluctuation, its trading volume has dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels With the notable price drop, ADA has reached a crucial support level of $0.80. According to expert technical analysis, this support level was previously broken during the recent upside rally. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the asset holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 35% to reach $1.14. However, if the asset fails to hold this level, it could decline by 20% to $0.65 in the coming days. $110 Million Worth of ADA Outflow Despite market uncertainty, investors and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the token, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass .

The task force was announced by SEC acting chairman Mark Uyeda on Jan. 21. The task force has several aims, according to an accompanying description . They include “appropriately distinguish securities from non-securities, … provide realistic paths to registration for both crypto assets and market intermediaries … and make sure that enforcement resources are deployed judiciously.” The task force has familiar faces, and a few new ones Peirce, a vocal crypto advocate in Gary Gensler’s SEC, was named head of the task force on Jan. 21. In addition, Richard Gabbert was named the group’s chief of staff and Taylor Asher was named chief policy adviser. Gabbert and Asher are also senior advisers to Uyeda. There are 15 members of the task force. “The task force is composed of staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and other divisions and offices across the Commission,” Peirce said in the SEC announcement of the appointments. Some of the appointees are longtime SEC staffers. According to LinkedIn, Gabbert, for example, has been at the agency since 2011 and served as Peirce’s counsel for seven years. Others were hired for the task force position. Chief Counsel Michael Selig is joining from law firm Wilkie Farr & Gallagher. Asher was an aide to pro-crypto Senator Bill Hagerty for a year before joining the SEC as an adviser to Uyeda in 2023. The task force has veteran crypto defenders Senior adviser Landon Zinda came to the task force from advocacy group Coin Center, where he had been policy counsel. In October 2022, Coin Center and three individuals filed suit against the Treasury Department and its Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) seeking the removal of OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash and 44 wallets associated with it. The Tornado Cash suit was launched before Zinda joined the organization. During Zinda’s tenure, Coin Center has provided support for the Jarretts’ latest suit against the Internal Revenue Service and for Lewellen v. Garland, in which a software developer sued the Justice Department for targeting developers who create non-custodial crypto wallets for unlicensed money transmission. Before Coin Center, Zinda was counsel for the Senate Committee on Banking focusing on crypto and fintech. Zinda began his career at the Heritage Foundation. Senior adviser Chris Rice is also senior adviser in the SEC Division of Investment Management. He came to the agency in 2023 after working in alternative investments in major financial institutions. New policies precede the task force Mark Uyeda has been on the SEC staff since 2006 and has been a commissioner since 2022. U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkin to be the chair of the SEC. He has not been confirmed by the Senate yet. Atkins comes from a legal background. He was a commissioner at the SEC from 2002 to 2008 under three chairs. He has been on the staff of two SEC commissioners and was also co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance. No date has been set for Atkin’s confirmation hearing. Even without the new chair in place, the SEC has shown indications of a drastic policy change from Gensler’s strident anti-crypto stance. Since Jan. 20, when Uyeda was appointed acting chair, the agency has dropped actions against the Tron Foundation , cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken , decentralized exchange Uniswap , NFT platform Yuga Labs, MetaMask developer Consensus and financial services company Robinhood. The agency has also rescinded the burdensome accounting rule in Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 that required crypto platforms to treat all assets they custodied as liabilities.

With XRP trading at $2.19 and Dogecoin at $0.2, their growth potential appears limited compared to MUTM’s expected spike. Already in its presale phase, this rapidly developing altcoin has already surpassed over $2 million, with Phase 2 ongoing at a price of $0.015. Over 3,800 investors have already jumped on this project, looking to get a 33.33% hike in price during the next stage. Investors who buy now will enjoy a 300% profit when Mutuum Finance goes live at $0.06. Furthermore, with predictions anticipating rising to $16 in 2025, investors will achieve 1600x gains. Limited Upside: Why Dogecoin and Ripple Could Trail Behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been mainstream famous within the crypto market, yet their upside for future appreciation appears to be capped. Dogecoin, while it has a cult following and temporary social media bursts, doesn’t have strong fundamentals and real-world applicability beyond speculation. At the same time, XRP, valued at $2.19, continues to struggle with regulatory challenges, as its price movement heavily relies on legal proceedings and institutional acceptance. While the two coins may see a rise in value in the next market cycle, their potential upside is overshadowed by future projects with greater potential for growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), even at the stage of presale, is already indicating such humongous breakout potential that it’s far more of a good investment in 2025. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big DeFi Thing Mutuum Finance is fast becoming the next big thing in decentralized finance. This upcoming altcoin has already garnered over $2 million in funding and 3,800+ investors in its presale, with its groundbreaking dual-lending mechanism. Trading at $0.015 in Phase 2, investors have not much time before the next 33.33% price surge. With the initial launch price being $0.06, early investors would realize 300% returns, and analysts foresee even bigger gains during the following bull run. From its dual lending program and solid fundamentals, Mutuum Finance is turning into one of the most promising DeFi projects of the year. Mutuum Finance offers an innovative lending model that is a combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows individuals to lock stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-based liquidity pools, earning passive returns while facilitating instant borrowing. The P2P model facilitates direct lending contracts between users in a peer-to-peer manner, cutting out middlemen for greater efficiency, transparency, and autonomy. The hybrid model addresses conservative investors seeking stable yields as well as risk-taking traders seeking higher rewards. A Secure & Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is also launching a collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that offers security and price stability. Unlike volatile algorithmic stablecoins, the model is backed by full asset and therefore avoids devaluations at the click of a button. Deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and strategic liquidity management also aid long-term growth. Mutuum Finance is set to spearhead the next generation of DeFi innovation with its strong architecture and expanding adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) are constrained on the upside, with Dogecoin relying on hype and XRP battling regulation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers genuine utility with its double-lending mechanism, stablecoin and deflationary strategy. On a presale value of $0.015, early birds can earn 300% at launch and 1,600x gain if MUTM hits $16 by 2025. With more than 3,800 investors and $2 million raised, Mutuum is launching. With the next big crypto thing, the time to act is now.

Dogecoin’s goal to achieve a market capitalization resembling Tesla’s would necessitate a 2,990% increase in price to $7.82, presenting a substantial potential gain but reliant on community enthusiasm and the influence of figures like Elon Musk. ADA, currently trading below $0.75, faces downward pressure, with technical evaluations indicating possible drops to $0.70 unless it regains the $0.81-$0.84 resistance zone. Conversely, BlockDAG displays substantial advancement and community-supported expansion. With a $200 million presale, over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold, and initial participants experiencing a 2,380% return, BDAG’s operational foundation is notably strong. Its March beta launch, $30 million grants initiative, and growing user base (over 500,000 X1 Miner application users) suggest sustained value beyond simple market speculation. Dogecoin’s Market Cap Ambitions: A Feasibility Study Dogecoin maintains a broad discussion presence, supported by a dedicated community and endorsements from prominent individuals like Elon Musk. This recognition has contributed to Dogecoin’s continued relevance in the evolving digital currency market. For Dogecoin to match Tesla’s market cap, its price must reach $7.82 per coin, a 2,990% increase from its current $0.25332. Such a rise would transform 15,000 Dogecoin, presently valued at $3,798, into $117,352, attracting those seeking substantial gains. While Tesla’s acceptance of Dogecoin enhances its credibility, substantial demand growth is essential. Its community-driven appeal maintains its ongoing relevance. The examination of BlockDAG in comparison, shows a different trajectory. ADA’s Technical Analysis: Identifying Key Support Levels ADA’s price is under downward pressure, presently trading below the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart. If ADA’s price fails to remain above $0.75, a decline to $0.73 or even $0.70 is possible, indicating further weakness. Technical indicators, such as LuxAlgo Trendline Breaks, suggest a potential breakdown, making support levels crucial. The MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating reduced buying strength, while the RSI at 41.38 suggests ADA is approaching oversold conditions but is not yet at extreme levels. A breakout above $0.81 could shift sentiment, though resistance at $1.16590 and $1.34 may limit gains without sufficient trading volume. Rejection near $0.80-$0.84 validates a supply zone. If ADA’s price reclaims $0.81-$0.84, a recovery towards $1 is possible, but its ability to maintain key levels will determine its subsequent movement. The review of BlockDAG shows a different growth pattern. BlockDAG’s $200M Presale & Beta Launch: An Assessment of 30,000x Potential BlockDAG is gaining traction within the digital currency market with significant growth and strategic plans for 2025. In its recent AMA, attended by over 800 individuals, the team shared key updates, including a March beta test net launch, a $30 million developer grants program, and new team members focused on global expansion. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising $200 million with over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold. Early participants have experienced a 2,380% return, and new participants are securing coins before the next price increase. BlockDAG’s beta test net will enhance network scalability, security, and speed, inviting community participation in testing and earning rewards. The $30 million grants program supports developers in creating innovative dApps, with hackathons planned in collaboration with HackerEarth.

With 10 CEX listings planned and projections of a 30,000x increase, BlockDAG is positioned as a major digital currency opportunity. The examination of BlockDAG’s technological approach is very important. The potential of BlockDAG is very high. The future of BlockDAG is being closely watched. The analysis of BlockDAG’s growth shows real value. The progress of BlockDAG is significant. The review of BlockDAG’s roadmap is critical. Comparative Analysis & Future Outlook While Dogecoin’s market cap aspirations and ADA’s potential recovery may attract traders, BlockDAG’s strategy is based on tangible progress, not just market sentiment. Dogecoin’s path to a Tesla-sized market cap is highly speculative, and ADA’s potential gains depend on overcoming persistent downward pressure. BlockDAG is actively achieving milestones, including a beta test net launch in March and a developer grants program that promotes development. The X1 Miner application’s over 500,000 downloads and planned 10 exchange listings contribute to its expanding ecosystem. With early participants experiencing substantial returns and projections of a 30,000x increase, BDAG offers both immediate gains and potential for sustained growth.

As ADA struggles to regain ground—trading at $0.80 after falling over 40% from its December high—analysts believe a breakout could be on the horizon. A 70% rally isn’t off the table, particularly as Cardano pushes for deeper Bitcoin integration, a move that could reshape its standing in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is drawing serious attention from investors, with its presale exceeding $1.5 million over the weekend. While Cardano fights to reclaim its bullish momentum, Web3Bay is emerging as one of the most intriguing crypto plays of 2025, offering early backers the potential for exponential gains. Cardano’s 70% Upside—Is a Breakout Imminent? ADA’s price has been caught in a volatile range, hovering around $0.80. However, analysts suggest that a 70% rally could be within reach if Cardano can break out of consolidation. Hoskinson’s recent remarks have only added fuel to the speculation. In a lengthy interview, he took aim at Ethereum and Solana, arguing that neither has the infrastructure to build a robust DeFi layer on Bitcoin—a challenge that Cardano is actively addressing. Hoskinson sees Bitcoin integration as a game-changer for Cardano, unlocking access to Bitcoin’s liquidity while establishing a more decentralized financial ecosystem. With the Bitcoin market valued at over $2 trillion, the opportunity remains largely untapped. Other projects like Core and Stacks (STX) have attempted similar integrations, but Hoskinson insists that Cardano’s research-based approach and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) framework offer a superior solution. Technical analysts point to the $1 resistance as a critical barrier. If ADA clears this level, the next target sits at $1.36, aligning with the projected 70% rally. However, sustaining momentum will depend on continued adoption, network advancements, and successful Bitcoin integration. Web3Bay’s Presale Crosses $1.5M—A Sleeping Giant? While Cardano eyes a breakout, Web3Bay’s presale is already hitting major milestones. Surpassing $1.5 million over the weekend, the project has quickly become one of the fastest-growing crypto startups of 2025. Web3Bay is shaking up the e-commerce industry by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes intermediaries, lowers transaction costs, and empowers buyers and sellers through blockchain technology. Unlike centralized giants such as Amazon and eBay—known for high fees and seller restrictions—Web3Bay offers a peer-to-peer ecosystem where users maintain full control over transactions. Investor interest in Web3Bay has been surging, with demand for its 3BAY token driving its presale success. Currently priced at $0.005247, the token is expected to launch at $0.1959, potentially delivering a staggering 3,633% return for early investors. The project’s appeal lies in its ability to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. Blockchain-based e-commerce is still in its infancy, giving Web3Bay a critical first-mover advantage in decentralized marketplaces. Which Crypto Has the Biggest Growth Potential? Both Cardano and Web3Bay offer compelling opportunities, but their appeal depends on investment strategy and risk tolerance. Cardano, an established blockchain with a dedicated community, could see a major upswing if its Bitcoin integration succeeds. However, ADA’s short-term prospects hinge on breaking key resistance levels and gaining broader adoption in the DeFi space. A 70% rally is possible, but long-term growth will depend on Cardano delivering on its ambitious plans. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is in its early adoption phase, meaning its potential upside is far greater. With an estimated ROI of 3,633% for presale participants, it represents a rare opportunity to enter a high-growth project before widespread adoption. For those looking for a more established yet potentially slower-moving investment, Cardano remains a solid choice. But for investors willing to take a chance on an early-stage disruptor with massive potential, Web3Bay stands out as one of the most exciting opportunities in the market. With Cardano pushing toward a breakout and Web3Bay gaining momentum in its presale, the question is clear—will you wait for established cryptos to regain their footing, or will you get ahead of the curve with an emerging project that could redefine its sector?

41126459,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=706124,1741053636,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Will Bitcoin Rise Or Fall Again? QCP Questions Trump-Fueled Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rise-or-fall-again-qcp-questions-trump-rally/,"Bitcoin surged past $95,000 during low-liquidity trading hours on Sunday after US President Donald Trump made a major announcement. The formation of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), set the market ablaze with speculation. Many traders viewed this as a defining moment, one that could solidify crypto’s place in the U.S. financial system, while others remained wary, questioning whether the rally could sustain itself beyond the immediate reaction. Among those skeptical is QCP Capital. A Well-Timed Political Bitcoin Play? The timing of Trump’s announcement is difficult to ignore. Throughout the past week, risk assets faced mounting pressure as global markets reacted negatively to a series of economic and geopolitical developments. Trump’s newly imposed tariffs rattled investor confidence, while shaky Ukraine-Russia peace talks created additional uncertainty. Stock market volatility intensified, weighing heavily on sentiment across the financial sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Average Cost Basis At $90,950 — Why Is It Relevant? Bitcoin broke below its multi-month range, showing signs of weakness before Trump’s announcement. The sudden announcement was a stark contrast to the downward trajectory risk assets had been following. QCP Capital highlighted the political strategy behind the move: “For a president who thrives on being the market’s hero, last week’s risk asset performance performance was anything but inspiring. His slew of new tariffs and shakier than expected Ukraine-Russia peace talks rattled investor confidence. So, while the timing of the SBR was somewhat unexpected, the political calculus was clear — Trump needed a win before his approval ratings starts slipping, a metric he likely takes very personally.” However, questions remain as to whether this move represents a genuine shift in policy toward long-term crypto adoption or simply a well-timed announcement aimed at stabilizing sentiment before further economic strain emerges. While Bitcoin’s rapid ascent over the weekend excited traders, QCP Capital remains unconvinced that this rally represents a meaningful breakout. The firm pointed to several key market signals that indicate Bitcoin is not yet out of the woods. QCP Capital cautioned: “Are we back in the game? Not quite. BTC is still trading near the bottom of its multi-month range and frontend crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March. The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the US administration.” Lessons From The Past: The ‘Xi Candle’ Comparison For seasoned traders, the weekend’s price action is reminiscent of a historical event in the crypto market—the infamous Xi Candle of 2019. Prominent crypto analyst Cold Blooded Shiller took to X to draw comparisons between the two events. Reflecting on the Xi Candle, Cold Blooded Shiller recalled how Bitcoin had been in a prolonged downtrend, trading at fresh lows with market sentiment at rock bottom. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China should embrace blockchain technology. The result was a massive short squeeze, with Bitcoin skyrocketing by 40% in just two days. Traders at the time believed it marked the beginning of a new bullish era for crypto. “Sentiment was very quick to adjust. You’ll be surprised (not) to hear that it didn’t take much back then to shape the whole mindset of Twitter into the positives and ability for the market to now have an infinite bid,” he wrote. However, the euphoria was short-lived. Several weeks later, China backtracked on its pro-blockchain rhetoric, implementing fresh crackdowns on crypto exchanges and warning investors about the risks of digital assets. Bitcoin’s gains slowly eroded, with price action reversing over the following month and ultimately dipping below pre-announcement levels. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Cycle Really Over? This Indicator Suggests Price Could Rebound To $130,000 “We did not immediately reverse the candle. It actually took many weeks to do that, which made it all the more painful for those trading it or those who had their bullish bias,” Cold Blooded Shiller recalled. The similarities between the Xi Candle and Trump’s Crypto Reserve announcement are striking. Both events followed prolonged periods of market weakness, both saw a dramatic shift in sentiment almost overnight, and both created a new bullish narrative that was widely embraced by the market. The key question now is whether Trump’s announcement will lead to a sustained trend shift or if, like the Xi Candle, it will eventually fizzle out, leaving late buyers trapped at the top. Key Events To Watch This Week Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its gains or extend higher will likely depend on key macroeconomic and regulatory developments in the coming days. On Wednesday, markets will receive the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, a crucial economic indicator that could influence expectations for Federal Reserve policy. If PMI data shows signs of economic weakness, it could increase speculation about potential rate cuts, which may provide a tailwind for risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, stronger-than-expected data could reinforce the view that the Fed will maintain its restrictive policy stance, potentially pressuring crypto and equities alike. Friday brings the release of the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, a key employment indicator that has historically influenced market sentiment. A strong jobs report could signal continued economic resilience, reducing the likelihood of near-term rate cuts, which could negatively impact Bitcoin. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected report could fuel risk-on sentiment, further supporting BTC’s momentum. Also on Friday, the White House Crypto Summit is expected to provide critical insights into the future of the US Crypto Strategic Reserve. If tangible announcements emerge, BTC could rise further. However, if the event fails to deliver meaningful policy direction, the market could react negatively, leading to increased volatility. As QCP Capital put it, “Just when we think Trump has exhausted his cards, he may still have more surprises up his sleeve. Will this be the push toward that elusive all-time high? We’ll be watching.” At press time, BTC traded at $90,352.

Qubetics Is Set to Ignite,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-for-significant-returns-in-2025-missed-polygon-qubetics-is-set-to-ignite/,"The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing, with new trends emerging faster than you can refresh your feed. 2025 is no exception. After experiencing a major dip in early 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have regained some ground, sparking conversations about the next big thing. But as the usual heavyweights like Ethereum and Polygon continue to ride their well-worn waves, some fresh contenders are catching everyone’s eye. In fact, some promising cryptos that could’ve been snapped up earlier in 2025 are now considered missed opportunities—Polygon, for instance. But that doesn’t mean the ship has sailed for high returns. If anything, there’s a fresh opportunity on the horizon—Qubetics ($TICS). It’s quickly becoming the next big crypto to look out for in 2025, and the FOMO around it is palpable. While other tokens struggle to bring something new to the table, Qubetics is focused on real-world solutions, setting itself apart from the crowd. From its rapidly growing crypto presale numbers to analysts predicting explosive price surges post-launch, Qubetics is worth paying attention to. Missed Opportunity: Polygon Polygon, once a darling of the Layer-2 scaling solutions, has been making waves for its ability to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities. It was one of the first projects to really show that Ethereum could scale without compromising security or decentralization. And for a while, it seemed like Polygon would only grow bigger. Its aim to support Ethereum’s ecosystem and offer faster, cheaper transactions really caught people’s attention back in 2021 and 2022. Fast forward to 2025, and Polygon’s hype has started to die down. What happened? Well, as the years went on, competition caught up. Layer-2 solutions from various blockchain networks are quickly growing, and other projects have started outpacing Polygon in terms of innovation and adoption. While Polygon still holds some relevance, it no longer holds the same level of excitement or potential as it once did. The crypto world moves fast, and while Polygon did great things, it’s just not as “hot” as it once was. So, if you missed out on Polygon during its prime, you’re probably wishing you’d jumped in a bit earlier. But the good news is, there’s still time to cash in on newer projects with even greater potential. Qubetics: The Crypto You Shouldn’t Miss in 2025 Here’s where things get interesting. If Polygon’s miss was a reminder that the crypto world is always shifting, then Qubetics is the shining example of a project that’s ahead of the curve. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain solution—it’s aiming to tackle real-world problems that others haven’t been able to address. And that’s where it differs from most cryptos. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 24th stage, having sold more than 495 million tokens to over 22,000 holders, raising over $14.5 million. At just $0.0976 per $TICS token, it’s clear that early supporters are about to see massive returns as the presale progresses. If analysts are right, $TICS could skyrocket to $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 155% return on investment. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. After the presale ends, some analysts predict that $TICS could hit $1, which would result in a whopping 923% ROI. And it doesn’t stop there. Post-mainnet launch, the price could reach $5, representing a jaw-dropping 5018% return. What makes Qubetics even more enticing is the real-world application of its blockchain. The flagship product, QubeQode IDE, is a next-gen development platform that’s designed to solve a massive gap in the tech world. Developers and businesses alike are constantly looking for more efficient tools, and Qubetics delivers. By providing a seamless way for developers to write, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps), Qubetics is positioning itself to be a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem. Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner trying to streamline your operations. You could be in e-commerce, retail, or even healthcare—no matter the industry, Qubetics could help you develop a custom blockchain solution tailored to your needs. Or maybe you’re a developer working on the next big dApp. Instead of navigating through complex, fragmented platforms, you can use QubeQode to make your life a whole lot easier. That’s the beauty of Qubetics: it’s solving problems in real ways that businesses and individuals can relate to. Qubetics’ application has already gained significant traction. For example, a freelance developer could use the QubeQode IDE to launch a decentralized app without worrying about hefty upfront costs or complicated integration processes. Similarly, larger enterprises looking to move toward blockchain could integrate Qubetics’ tools to make their processes more efficient, secure, and cost-effective.Given its early momentum and the potential for massive returns, Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025. Popular Crypto Coin To Buy in 2025: Qubetics When you hear about a coin that’s already setting new records, it’s hard to ignore. Analysts are all buzzing about Qubetics and its future potential in 2025. Here’s why this crypto could be the one to watch this year: its use case is far more robust than a lot of the coins making waves right now. Qubetics stands out because it’s one of the few cryptocurrencies solving a real-world issue. Unlike many other coins that are mostly speculative or still struggling to gain solid footing in the blockchain space, Qubetics has proven it’s more than just a “promise.” The platform is actively being used in various sectors, ranging from tech startups to established industries like finance and healthcare. But it’s not just about utility—Qubetics also offers explosive growth potential. As its presale progresses, the $TICS price is set to rise rapidly. This means that anyone who hops on board now could be looking at some seriously impressive returns when the coin hits mainstream exchanges. And given its utility in real-world applications, there’s a high likelihood that $TICS could see long-term, sustained growth after its official mainnet launch. So, why should anyone care about Qubetics in 2025? Well, for starters, it’s tackling a problem that others have yet to touch. The QubeQode IDE is not just a tool for developers—it’s something that could dramatically shift how blockchain technology is used across industries. With blockchain becoming a critical part of various sectors, businesses are actively looking for ways to integrate it smoothly into their operations. Qubetics is the bridge they’ve been waiting for. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics So, here’s the takeaway: if you missed out on Polygon, it’s not too late. But don’t sit around waiting for the next big thing. Qubetics is here and already gaining serious traction. With a revolutionary development tool and real-world applications across multiple industries, Qubetics could very well be the key to massive crypto gains in 2025.

The regulator will take no enforcement action and has not issued any charges against the firm. Yuga Labs confirmed the news in a Mar. 3 post on X, calling it a “huge win” for the NFT industry and creators. The company added, “NFTs are not securities.” After 3+ years, the SEC has officially closed its investigation into Yuga Labs. This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward. NFTs are not securities. — Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) March 3, 2025 The SEC launched its probe into Yuga Labs in October 2022 to determine whether its NFT collections and ApeCoin ( APE ), a token linked to BAYC, should be classified as securities under the Howey Test. The inquiry was part of a larger campaign against NFTs led by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, which also targeted NFT markets and fractionalized NFTs.

The SEC has dropped other investigations involving cryptocurrency companies in recent weeks, which coincides with the decision to conclude the Yuga Labs inquiry. The agency recently settled litigation with Coinbase and Kraken and concluded investigations into OpenSea, Robinhood, Gemini , and Uniswap Labs. The market anticipates that the regulatory shift will have a positive impact on the BAYC NFTS floor price , which is currently trading around13.75 Ethereum ( ETH ), down more than 90% from its peak of 153.7 ETH in May 2022. Meanwhile, on March 3, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force revealed on the regulator’s official website that it will be holding a number of roundtables for the public called “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The goal of these roundtables is to establish more precise rules pertaining to digital assets. The first event, “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” is set for March 21 from 17:00 to 21:00 UTC. These talks will explore important issues in crypto regulation and signal how the agency is changing its stance on digital assets.

Right now, many traders are overly focused on Bitcoin, believing it to be the safest bet. However, historical trends suggest that when altcoin interest is at its lowest, a significant rally is usually on the horizon. Market experts predict that altcoins are gearing up for a strong recovery, with capital expected to shift from Bitcoin to high-growth altcoin projects. While Bitcoin maintains a dominant position, an altcoin boom is approaching, and early investors in the right tokens could see substantial returns. Among the top contenders, three altcoins stand out for their potential in the next market cycle. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain solid picks, but a rising star— Web3Bay (3BAY)—is catching investors’ attention. Ethereum (ETH) — The Smart Contract Leader Ready for Expansion Ethereum has consistently been the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. Despite growing competition from other blockchains, Ethereum remains the primary hub for decentralized applications, with institutional investors increasing their exposure to ETH. With Ethereum-based ETFs gaining traction, demand for ETH is rising, and analysts believe breaking past $3,500 could trigger a strong rally toward new highs. As DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets gain adoption, Ethereum is positioned at the center of blockchain growth, making it a must-have for the next altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are driving optimism by reducing gas fees and improving transaction speeds. With ETH’s supply declining due to its deflationary tokenomics, a supply crunch could send prices soaring in the coming months. Solana (SOL) — The High-Speed Blockchain on the Verge of a 13% Breakout Solana has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a setup that often signals an imminent breakout. Crypto analyst Ali recently pointed out that Solana is primed for a 13% price move, with $193 being a key level to watch. Despite past concerns over network congestion, Solana has continued to deliver high-speed transactions with minimal fees, attracting strong institutional interest. As DeFi and NFTs continue expanding, Solana remains one of the most efficient blockchain networks, positioning it ahead of rivals like Cardano and Avalanche. With trading activity rising and sentiment improving, Solana’s next breakout could push it past key resistance zones, bringing it closer to its all-time high. However, while Solana presents a solid long-term investment, another lesser-known altcoin is gaining momentum—Web3Bay. Web3Bay (3BAY) — The Hidden Gem With 4200% Growth Potential Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which are already established, Web3Bay gives investors the chance to buy in early before its projected surge. Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes middlemen, lowers fees, and enhances security for buyers and sellers. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay impose high fees and centralized control, whereas Web3Bay offers a blockchain-powered alternative with peer-to-peer transactions, transparency, and security. Web3Bay’s presale has already exceeded $1.5 million, reflecting strong demand for 3BAY tokens. Currently priced at $0.004562, its anticipated launch price of $0.1959 suggests a massive 4200% return—far exceeding the potential gains of Ethereum or Solana at this stage. What makes Web3Bay particularly compelling is its real-world application. Many cryptocurrencies rely on speculation, but Web3Bay is solving practical issues within the multi-trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. As demand for decentralized solutions grows, 3BAY is positioned for significant adoption, making it one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. Why This Is the Perfect Time to Buy These Altcoins The market is approaching a major altcoin rally, and history shows that early positioning is key to maximizing gains. Ethereum and Solana are showing strong signs of upward movement, but the biggest opportunity lies in early-stage projects like Web3Bay. With Ethereum aiming to break past $3,500, Solana consolidating before a key move, and Web3Bay still in its presale phase, now is the time to invest before prices skyrocket. Many investors miss out by waiting for confirmation, only to buy when prices have already surged. Those who take action now stand to gain the most. Ethereum and Solana offer solid long-term growth, but Web3Bay remains the most undervalued altcoin with the highest upside. Its disruptive e-commerce model, strong presale momentum, and projected 4200% ROI present a rare investment opportunity before it reaches mainstream markets. The question is—will you act now, or will you watch from the sidelines as another major crypto success story unfolds?

This reserve will include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Following the announcement, XRP’s value surged from $2.23 to $2.99. But can the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could affect everything. Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino pointed out that the case between Ripple and the SEC has big consequences for the future of XRP and the U.S. economy. He believes that if former President Donald Trump doesn’t act soon and the SEC continues its case against Ripple, it could hurt American investments in cryptocurrencies. However, Crypto Law founder and attorney John Deaton pointed out something interesting: the Ripple lawsuit was filed just before the end of Trump’s first term, under the leadership of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. Now, four years later, XRP has a chance to be a part of a major global cryptocurrency reserve. Deaton argues that if Trump does not intervene and the case continues, the U.S. could lose out on big opportunities in the growing crypto market. “He has to drop it,” Deaton said. What’s Next for XRP? The future of XRP and Ripple largely depends on how the case with the SEC plays out. If Ripple can resolve the issue, XRP could become a major part of the digital currency world. As Deaton said, this is a critical moment for the entire crypto industry, not just Ripple. How the SEC case is handled will impact not only XRP but also the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. and beyond. In conclusion, while the road ahead for Ripple and XRP is still uncertain, one thing is clear: the decisions made in this case could shape the future of cryptocurrency, with XRP playing a key role in the new world of digital finance.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|FIAT|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:00:26

Both will serve as senior advisors to the task force, alongside career SEC staff. Taylor Asher, who previously advised former Commissioner Mark Uyeda on policy, will serve as chief policy advisor.

ETH is now back below $2,200 and might decline further in the near term. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,350 support zone. The price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,160 and $2,250 resistance levels to start a recovery wave. Ethereum Price Dives 15% Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,550 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $2,400 and $2,350 support levels. There was a clear move below the $2,250 support zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price even dived below the last low and tested the $2,000 zone. A low was formed at $2,003 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,080 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,150 level. There is also a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $2,275 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,275 resistance might send the price toward the $2,350 resistance. An upside break above the $2,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,450 resistance zone or even $2,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,020 level. The first major support sits near the $2,000 zone. A clear move below the $2,000 support might push the price toward the $1,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,750 support level in the near term.

The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability.

The latest market shakeup has turned the crypto world into a battlefield where only the strongest projects survive. Those who pick wisely now could be sitting on life-changing gains when the next bull run ignites. But here’s the catch—getting in early is the name of the game. That’s why BTFD Coin (BTFD) has taken center stage. This presale is roaring through its 14th stage with investors rushing in for its 90% APY staking, P2E game rewards, and a potential 3650% ROI moonshot. With over $6.25 million already raised and more than 71 billion coins sold, it’s the hottest bet in the meme coin universe right now. Miss it, and you might regret it when the price rockets. Ready to uncover the best meme coin presale to buy this week? Let’s dive in. 1. BTFD (BTFD) – The Meme Revolution Offering 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Ever wished you could buy the dip before a meme coin goes parabolic? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin (BTFD) is delivering—except this time, it’s pre-loaded with opportunities that no other meme coin can match. This isn’t just another pump-and-dump meme token. BTFD’s ecosystem is built to reward its holders long-term, offering a whopping 90% APY staking, a fully playable P2E game, and an ever-growing community that thrives on smart, early-stage investing. Right now, BTFD is in its 14th presale stage, with each coin priced at $0.00016. But when the presale ends, its listing price will shoot up to $0.0006, meaning early investors could already be sitting on 275% gains before the token even hits the market. Imagine throwing in $1500 at today’s presale price of $0.00016. You’d be holding 9,375,000 BTFD coins. If BTFD reaches its predicted moonshot price of $0.006, that same investment would be worth a staggering $56,250. And if that’s not enough, BTFD’s referral program allows you to earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code and invest at least $50. It’s a win-win—stack tokens and stack profits. Why does BTFD deserve a spot on this list? No other meme coin is offering this combination of high-yield staking, gaming rewards, and a presale surge that’s already bringing in millions. This best meme coin presale to buy this week isn’t just a chance—it’s your golden ticket to crypto riches. 2. Book of Meme (BOME) – The Meme Library That’s Breaking the Internet Book of Meme (BOME) is rewriting the history of meme coins—literally. It’s not just a token; it’s an entire archive of the internet’s funniest and most viral memes, stored forever on the blockchain. Its decentralized meme library allows users to create, own, and monetize memes like never before. Recently, BOME has expanded its ecosystem, integrating NFT meme minting and meme staking, where holders can earn passive income by simply owning legendary internet memes. Why is BOME part of this list? Because memes aren’t just a joke anymore—they’re an economy, and BOME is leading the way. 3. Ponke (PONKE) – The Hottest Community-Driven Meme Coin With Explosive Potential Ponke (PONKE) has been on a meteoric rise, thanks to its highly engaged community and aggressive development roadmap. Unlike other meme coins that fizzle out after a few weeks of hype, Ponke has been delivering on its promises. With exclusive airdrops, staking rewards, and a major CEX listing in the pipeline, Ponke is gearing up for another massive breakout. Why does Ponke deserve your attention? Because a strong, loyal community is what separates short-lived meme coins from long-term winners. 4. Bonk (BONK) – The People’s Meme Coin That’s Here to Stay Launched as Solana’s first meme coin, Bonk (BONK) has proven it’s more than just a fun experiment. With massive adoption across NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, and Solana-based games, BONK is showing real-world use cases. The team recently introduced BonkPay, a decentralized payment system allowing users to spend BONK for real-world purchases, making it one of the few meme coins with tangible utility. Why is Bonk a must-watch? Because it has successfully bridged the gap between meme culture and real-world adoption. 5. Brett (BRETT) – The Under-the-Radar Meme Coin Making Quiet Moves Brett (BRETT) might not have the same cult following as some of the bigger meme coins, but that’s exactly what makes it an undervalued gem. It’s been stealthily gaining momentum, with whales accumulating and rumors of upcoming exchange listings swirling around. BRETT has also teased a metaverse integration, potentially making it the next big play-to-earn contender in the meme coin space. Why should Brett be on your radar? Because sometimes, the best gains come from the coins people aren’t talking about yet—but soon will be. Final Thoughts: Time is Running Out! With meme coins making yet another explosive comeback, the question isn’t if they’ll take off, but which ones will leave you behind if you don’t act now. The one project that stands out among the best meme coin presales to buy this week is BTFD Coin. With 90% APY staking, a fully live P2E game, and a presale about to hit its final stages, this could be your last chance to lock in early-stage gains before the moonshot happens. Once it’s listed at $0.0006, the rocket launch is officially on. Are you in, or are you going to be the one watching from the sidelines when BTFD reaches $0.006?

The analyst has pinpointed a critical resistance level that XRP will need to hold lest it crashes to new lows and eradicates recent gains. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.5 TradingView crypto analyst MadWhale has shared a new price analysis focusing on XRP’s future price potential. The analyst emphasized his strong track record of cryptocurrency trends, underscoring that he has accurately identified and hit all the gain targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Pump To $3.35 On The Horizon With Bullish Cup And Handle Pattern Formation MadWhale predicts that the XRP price could crash below $1.9 to $1.5. The analyst revealed that XRP is currently in a downtrend and has been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish structure. According to his price chart, the cryptocurrency is also trading within a descending channel and fast approaching a key resistance level. This critical resistance point at the $2 mark has been tagged as a psychological level where sellers are likely to emerge and trigger further downward pressure on the cryptocurrency. If a rejection occurs at this $2.00 resistance level, MadWhale highlights that the next support area and downside target will be around $1.90, representing a 17.62% value drop. If the resistance level fails completely and the $1.90 support level breaks, the TradingView crypto analyst has forecasted another major breakdown in the XRP price. He predicts that the cryptocurrency could experience a more profound decline of 35%, possibly dropping down to the next major support level at $1.5. This crash target aligns with the lower boundary of the descending channel in which XRP currently resides. MadWhale has revealed that the decline to $1.5 could serve as a pivotal point for price stabilization, hinting at a possible reversal in the cryptocurrency once bearish pressures wane. The analyst’s price chart also shows that XRP recently tested the upper boundary of the descending channel but faced a rejection near the resistance. The main daily resistance area for the XRP price is marked in red on the chart, suggesting that $2.6 is where selling pressure might occur. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.8, already significantly above MadWhale’s daily resistance area. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan Triggers Major XRP Price Surge After experiencing a significant price crash over the past few weeks, the XRP price seems to be recovering at an alarming pace. In just one day, the cryptocurrency saw a double-digit price surge, successfully reversing its previous downtrend. Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring Analysts have attributed this unexpected sharp surge to the recent United States (US) crypto reserve plan announced by Donald Trump. The US President had included XRP in his plans for a crypto reserve aimed at boosting the country’s debt strategy and crypto dominance. As news of this strategic plan spread, the XRP price saw a 24.5% increase, pushing its value significantly above the $2.5 threshold once again.

Last week, it reached an all-time high of $2.98, but has since pulled back by around 41%. This price volatility has raised questions among investors about what’s driving the changes in its value. The token’s future is closely tied to market sentiment and exchange listings. If major exchanges list Pi, it could spark renewed investor interest, pushing the token to new highs. According to CoinCodex, Pi could surge by 234.84% this month, with a potential average price of $3.37—an increase of 101.79% from its current level. The highest price forecast is $5.64. A major factor affecting Pi’s price is the anticipation surrounding its potential listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Recently, Binance held a community vote, with 86% of users supporting the listing of Pi. However, despite this strong support, Pi Network has yet to be listed, which has led to some uncertainty among investors and contributed to the recent price dip. Despite the exchange listing delays, Pi Network is seeing increasing real-world use. Businesses in countries such as the USA, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and India are accepting Pi as payment. In China, BYD Auto Service Company even allowed customers to purchase cars with Pi, selling around 100 vehicles globally. This growing acceptance could help boost Pi’s reputation in the crypto space. March will be a key month for Pi’s future, as it could determine whether the token bounces back or remains under pressure.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:43:12

Has Bitcoin Bottomed? Bitcoin experienced significant volatility over the past week, dropping from $96,000 on February 23 to $78,258 on February 27. However, it recovered most of its losses yesterday, rebounding to as high as $95,000. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Sell Pressure Fades, Could A Local Bottom Be Forming? Analyst Explains In the Quicktake post, abramchart highlighted the declining Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for BTC holders. For those unfamiliar, the SOPR measures the proportion of BTC wallets that have held the cryptocurrency for more than one hour but less than 155 days. According to SOPR, any value greater than 1 indicates that short-term investors are selling at a profit. Conversely, a value below 1 suggests that short-term investors are incurring losses. While a value under 1 may indicate bearish sentiment, it can also be seen as a sign of market capitulation, often followed by a potential trend reversal. The total crypto market cap surged by more than $200 billion yesterday, driven by US President Donald Trump’s announcement regarding the creation of a crypto reserve. As of today, the SOPR sits at 0.95, the lowest it has been since August 2024 when BTC was trading within a consolidation zone around the mid-$50,000 range. The post concludes: We have likely reached good accumulation zones for Bitcoin and are close to the bottom of the current wave. BTC Showing Signs Of Trend Reversal While predicting crypto markets can be difficult, some indications suggest that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a trend reversal after prolonged selling over the past month. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains For example, during its potential local bottom at $78,258, BTC partially filled a long-standing CME gap between $78,000 and $80,000. CME gaps often act as price magnets, and once filled, BTC typically moves in the opposite direction. Additionally, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that BTC has reached its most oversold level since August 2024. Martinez suggested that the high selling pressure on BTC might be nearing its end, potentially signaling a trend reversal. In related news, Andre Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, noted that despite the market pullback, BTC is flashing a massive contrarian buy signal, presenting an attractive risk-reward opportunity at current prices.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-trader-gains-1-2-million-in-two-hours-heres-how/,"Crypto trader and enthusiast Crypto Beast recently shared a post on X highlighting a substantial gain with XRP trading. According to his tweet, he earned $1.2 million in just two hours, attributing his success to his strong belief in XRP. The tweet quickly gained traction among cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts, prompting various responses from the community. Along with his post, Crypto Beast attached a screenshot of an XRP/USDT chart, showing a sharp price increase. The chart indicates a significant upward movement, with a key price level at $2.9110 and a percentage gain of 33.60%, demonstrating the volatility XRP experienced during that period. I just made $1.2M in 2 hours How? I’m a $XRP believer It’s as simple as that pic.twitter.com/lTGBAxFZpi — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) March 2, 2025 Community Reactions to the Rapid Gains The tweet sparked a conversation among traders, with some praising Crypto Beast’s conviction while others urged caution regarding XRP’s well-known volatility. A user named Crynet responded to the post, saying: “That’s quite the return in such a short time! Just remember, with great gains come great volatility—hope you’re ready for the rollercoaster ride ahead.” Crynet’s comment underscores a common sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. While large gains can be exhilarating, they often come with significant price swings. Many traders who experience rapid profits also face the risk of sharp corrections. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Jacqueline Marjory, took a more optimistic stance, stating : “That’s the power of conviction in your plays! $XRP has been showing signs of massive potential, and if you’ve been holding strong, those gains speak for themselves. It’s not just about the price action; it’s about believing in the long-term vision. Major respect for sticking with it!” Her comment reflects that XRP’s price movements are not just speculative but part of a broader growth trajectory. Many XRP supporters have long maintained that it has strong fundamentals and could see substantial adoption in the financial sector. The Nature of XRP’s Market Movements XRP’s market behavior has often been characterized by sharp price swings, making it attractive to traders looking for short-term opportunities. The 33.60% price surge, as shown in the attached chart, is a testament to XRP’s ability to generate substantial returns in a short period. However, such movements are risky, as corrections can follow rapid price increases. Crypto Beast’s success highlights the opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. It’s also a reminder of the importance of risk management. While his $1.2 million gain is impressive, not all traders will experience the same outcome, and significant price fluctuations can lead to losses just as quickly.

The leading cryptocurrency is down 10% on Tuesday, Mar. 4, according to the price tracker on crypto.news, reversing its weekend rally following Trump’s announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Investor sentiment quickly shifted after Trump reaffirmed 25% tariffs, triggering a major selloff across financial markets. The Dow Jones erased a 300-point gain to drop over 1,100 points, while the S&P 500 lost $1.5 trillion in market cap. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which had surged to $95,000 over the weekend, fell back into consolidation. Analysts had warned that the crypto reserve news lacked immediate impact and that macroeconomic risks could weigh heavier. The broader crypto market also suffered. Ethereum ( ETH ) plunged 15% to $2,067, marking its first drop below $2,100 in 15 months. Stocks linked to crypto, including Coinbase (-4.6%) and Robinhood (-6.4%), reversed earlier gains.

In his March 4 Substack article , he pointed to declining U.S. Treasury liquidity as a bullish sign, though he warned BTC could briefly test $70,000 if risk assets continue selling off.

SOL price is down over 20% and might struggle to recover above the $150 resistance. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $162 and $150 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $150 zone. Solana Price Dips Heavily Solana price struggled to clear the $180 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $165 and $155 support levels. It even dived below the $150 level. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The recent low was formed at $132 and the price is now consolidating losses with a bearish angle. Solana is now trading below $140 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $140 level. The next major resistance is near the $144 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $180 swing high to the $132 swing low. The main resistance could be $156 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $180 swing high to the $132 swing low. A successful close above the $156 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $165. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level.

The first major support is near the $125 level. A break below the $125 level might send the price toward the $120 zone.

While XRP remains a major player in cross-border payments, uncertainty surrounding regulations and price fluctuations has investors seeking new opportunities with high growth potential. Lightchain AI, with its blockchain and AI integration, is gaining traction as a top contender. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.6 million at a presale price of $0.006, reflecting strong confidence in its future. As investors look for stability and innovation, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a smart choice for long-term gains. Ripple Investors Face Market Ambiguity- What’s Driving the Shift Ripple’s XRP investors are navigating a landscape marked by significant market ambiguity. Recent price volatility, including a 4.3% decline to just under $2.02, has raised concerns. This downturn is influenced by the SEC’s ongoing legal actions against Ripple, alleging unregistered securities sales. Additionally, global economic factors, such as recent tariff announcements by President Donald Trump, have heightened market uncertainty, leading to cautious investor behavior. Despite these challenges, some investors remain optimistic, anticipating that a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the current administration could bolster XRP’s prospects. However, the convergence of legal uncertainties and macroeconomic factors continues to drive the current market shift, leaving XRP investors in a state of cautious anticipation. Lightchain AI- Safe Bet Amid Market Uncertainty As market uncertainty continues to impact cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI is emerging as a stable investment due to its well-structured tokenomics and low-latency performance. The platform’s tokenomics is designed for long-term sustainability, ensuring fair distribution and balanced incentives. With a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens , allocations are strategically placed for presale participants, staking rewards, liquidity pools, and ecosystem growth. Additionally, dynamic pricing mechanisms and deflationary elements, such as token burning, help maintain value over time. Beyond tokenomics, Lightchain AI boasts ultra-low latency, making transactions and AI computations seamless. Its high-speed processing allows real-time execution of decentralized applications while maintaining network efficiency. By prioritizing both economic stability and performance, Lightchain AI stands strong amid market fluctuations. Grab Investment Opportunities with Lightchain AI Presale The Lightchain AI presale presents an exciting opportunity for Ripple investors looking to diversify their portfolio. With a presale price of $0.006, participants have the potential to secure LCAI tokens at a discounted rate, anticipating future value appreciation. Moreover, early adopters can also benefit from staking rewards and liquidity pool incentives, further enhancing their investment returns. As the platform continues to grow and expand its use cases, LCAI tokens are expected to increase in value, given its well-structured tokenomics and demand for high-speed blockchain solutions. As such, investing in the Lightchain AI presale offers a unique chance to join an innovative platform with high growth potential. https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://twitter.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 05:10:41

The drop follows a short-lived rally after Donald Trump’s March 2 announcement of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, which briefly pushed ETH above $2,500. However, Trump’s confirmation that fresh tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico will go into force on March 4 has caused market sentiment to shift, raising concerns about broader economic instability. The announcement caused Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price to plummet, dropping below its pre-pump level of about $2190. Decentralized finance activity and the Ethereum futures market both indicate Ethereum’s declining momentum. Open interest in ETH futures has dropped by 10% over the last day, according to Coinglass data .

Staking (90% APY) and Bulls Squad Staking rewards are insanely high—90% APY, making BTFD a passive income machine for long-term holders. Combine that with the Bulls Squad, a unique community concept that gamifies engagement, and it’s easy to see why BTFD’s presale is moving fast. Referral Program: Turn Your Friends into Your Wealth Machine The BTFD referral program is a game-changer for those who want to maximize their profits beyond just holding. If your referral code gets used and you make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard, you’ll earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet : Visit BTFD’s official site and generate your referral code. Share Your Code : Send it to your friends, family, and crypto communities. Get Paid Big Time : If your referrals buy $50+ in BTFD, they get 10% extra tokens. You earn 10% of every purchase through your code if you make it into the top 20 referrers. Track your earnings in real time. This isn’t just a passive reward—it’s a 3650% ROI moonshot opportunity for those who bring in the biggest buys. With the 14th stage nearly complete, the referral competition is heating up, and every second counts. Investment Example: The Math Behind the 3650% ROI Let’s break it down with numbers.

In a post on X, he emphasized the strategic advantage of announcing on a Sunday when traditional financial markets are closed. He pointed out that this smart move by the president gives retail investors a unique opportunity, suggesting that traditional finance must adapt to the evolving landscape of digital assets. “For the first time, retail investors win. Traditional finance better catch up, or it will quickly become extinct,” Eric Trump stated, reinforcing that the financial world is no longer bound by conventional market hours.

The world no longer runs on a Mon-Friday,… pic.twitter.com/EPtbEisbdI — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) March 3, 2025 U.S. Crypto Reserve Announcement Donald Trump confirmed the creation of a U.S. Crypto Reserve on March 2, describing it as a necessary step to protect and elevate the cryptocurrency industry. Eric Trump shared his father’s statements, where the president criticized the regulatory stance of the Biden administration, claiming that it had hindered the growth of the digital asset sector. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration,” Trump stated, underscoring his belief that government policies had previously been detrimental to the sector. An Inclusive Reserve to Advance the Crypto Industry The reserve will reportedly include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Trump also stated that the reserve would contain other valuable assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By establishing a strategic reserve that includes multiple major digital assets, Trump signals a policy shift that could lead to broader adoption and institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. financial system. The inclusion of XRP, SOL, and ADA, in addition to BTC and ETH, suggests a diversified approach rather than focusing solely on the most dominant assets. Before the confirmation of the crypto reserve, Bitcoin maximalists were pushing for a Bitcoin-focused reserve , attempting to remove other digital assets from this monumental development. However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other advocates continually called for multi-token reserve , as involvement from the broader market could help to bolster the crypto space and encourage innovation. Eric Trump’s response underscores the broader implications of his father’s announcement, highlighting a shift in the U.S. government’s approach to digital assets. By establishing a U.S. Crypto Reserve, Trump aims to integrate cryptocurrencies more firmly into the financial system while challenging existing regulatory policies. This move could be a major step in advancing global finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

U.S.-China competition may drive strategic Bitcoin accumulation worldwide. Uncertainty surrounds the scale of Bitcoin holdings attributed to China. China is reportedly holding private discussions about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which is causing intense speculation in the cryptocurrency market. Reports indicate that government officials have been meeting on this topic since the U.S. election. This raises questions about China’s changing stance on digital assets. This development follows years of regulatory restrictions that severely limited Bitcoin trading and mining in the country. Will China Reverse Bitcoin Ban? On March 3, 2025, Crypto Rover, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, reported that China intends to lift its ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2025.

Recent incidents highlight the increasing risks faced by both individual crypto holders and major platforms. Popular streamer Amouranth was the target of a home invasion where attackers allegedly sought access to her digital assets, while Bybit suffered a record-breaking $1.4 billion hack due to a security loophole. Popular Streamer Amouranth Targeted in Home Invasion by Crypto-Seeking Robbers Late in the night on March 2, popular streamer and internet personality Kaitlyn Siragusa, widely known as Amouranth, reported being the victim of a terrifying home invasion. The assailants, allegedly three armed men, broke into her residence while demanding access to her cryptocurrency holdings. According to Amouranth’s posts on X, the robbers were yelling for crypto during the invasion, heightening concerns over the growing trend of physical attacks targeting digital asset holders. In a harrowing series of social media updates, Amouranth detailed the events of the night, explaining that the robbers appeared to be specifically after her cryptocurrency assets. Just hours later, on March 3, she posted a security camera video showing the three men on her property. The footage captured the moment she led them to another section of the house before three loud noises rang out, prompting the invaders to flee the scene. While it remains unclear whether the noises were gunshots, alarms, or some other form of deterrent, the attackers’ swift retreat suggests that their plan was disrupted. Authorities have yet to release official details regarding the incident, including whether any suspects have been identified or apprehended. Amouranth’s prominence in the online world has not only made her a successful content creator but also a known figure in the financial and cryptocurrency sectors. In November 2024, she shared a screenshot of her Coinbase account revealing that she held approximately 211 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at around $20 million at the time. The screenshot also indicated holdings of around $80,000 in Ether (ETH). Given her public transparency regarding her wealth, some speculate that the attackers may have specifically targeted her due to these disclosures. With her significant cryptocurrency holdings and history of financial openness—including appearances on YouTube financial shows—Amouranth has been vocal about investment strategies and wealth accumulation. Amouranth’s ordeal adds to a growing list of “crypto wrench” attacks, a term used to describe physical threats or coercion aimed at forcing victims to transfer their digital assets. These crimes have surged in 2025 as cryptocurrency’s mainstream adoption continues to rise, making high-net-worth holders prime targets for criminals. Several high-profile incidents in recent months have underscored this alarming trend: January 2025: A Canadian volunteer moderator for a crypto forum reportedly went into hiding after kidnappers attempted to abduct him and force him to transfer his Bitcoin holdings. Jan. 21, 2025: David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, was allegedly abducted from his home, with the assailants demanding a crypto ransom before his eventual release. February 2025: Another alleged crypto-related kidnapping attempt occurred in Chicago, reinforcing concerns that such attacks are becoming more frequent and geographically widespread. Speaking on the rising trend of crypto-related physical attacks, security expert “Dr. Anon” explained in an interview that these attacks are “frequently ‘your money or your life’ situations carried out by sophisticated, professional, and organized criminals.” He also advised crypto holders to take proactive security measures, including the use of “decoy” wallets containing only a small portion of funds that can be surrendered under duress. The attack on Amouranth serves as a chilling reminder of the risks associated with holding and publicly discussing large cryptocurrency holdings. With digital assets being decentralized and irreversible once transferred, they remain a prime target for criminals who see an opportunity to exploit high-profile or wealthy individuals. Security experts suggest several precautions that crypto holders should take to mitigate risk: Avoid publicly sharing holdings: Broadcasting crypto balances on social media can make individuals targets. Use hardware wallets: Keeping assets in cold storage rather than online exchanges limits immediate access. Implement multi-signature wallets: Requiring multiple approvals for transactions can make forced transfers more difficult. Have a security plan: Personal safety should be a priority, with home security systems and contingency plans in place. The Bigger Picture: Crime and Cryptocurrency The attempted robbery at Amouranth’s home is part of a broader discussion around the risks and regulatory concerns surrounding cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional bank accounts, which have fraud protection and centralized control, digital assets rely solely on their owners to ensure security. Once funds are transferred, they are nearly impossible to recover. Law enforcement agencies worldwide have been increasingly working on strategies to combat crypto-related crimes, but decentralized technology often complicates tracking and prosecution. Cases like Amouranth’s show the urgent need for heightened security measures, both for individuals and the industry as a whole. While Amouranth appears to have escaped physical harm, the psychological toll of such an invasion cannot be understated. The attack serves as a stark warning to high-profile cryptocurrency holders about the real-world dangers that accompany digital wealth. As crypto adoption continues to expand, so too must the awareness of security risks and the necessary precautions to prevent such terrifying incidents in the future. Crypto Hack Losses Surpass $1.5 Billion, Experts Urge Stronger Bug Bounty Programs In other news, as cryptocurrency-related security breaches continue to escalate, losses from hacks have now surpassed $1.5 billion, according to a report by blockchain security firm CertiK. The staggering amount, fueled largely by the historic $1.4 billion Bybit hack, has prompted cybersecurity experts to call for more robust bug bounty programs to attract top-tier ethical hackers and strengthen platform security. On March 3, CertiK reported that the total losses from cryptocurrency hacks in February alone reached $1.53 billion. The vast majority of this sum—more than $1.4 billion—came from the exploit of Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange. However, even without this incident, the firm found that additional hacks and exploits resulted in $126 million in losses, including a $49 million theft from Infini. This rising wave of attacks sheds light on the increasing sophistication of malicious actors in the crypto space, who continually exploit vulnerabilities in both centralized and decentralized platforms. Ethical hacker Marwan Hachem said recently that these figures signal an urgent need for better bug bounty programs to incentivize white hat hackers to identify vulnerabilities before bad actors do. Hachem, who serves as the chief operating officer at cybersecurity firm FearsOff, criticized the bug bounty framework employed by Safe, the multisignature wallet provider used by Bybit. According to him, Safe’s bug bounty program classified front and back-end bugs as ‘out of scope,’ meaning ethical hackers who discovered these vulnerabilities were not eligible for rewards. This oversight proved disastrous. The Bybit hack occurred due to a vulnerability that was excluded from the bounty program’s scope. As a result, while ethical hackers had no incentive to report such vulnerabilities, criminals exploited them for one of the largest thefts in crypto history. “What they considered out of scope led to the biggest crypto hack in history,” Hachem stated. “We often breach platforms through bugs found in out-of-scope assets. Ethical hackers wouldn’t get rewarded for such findings, but criminals exploited them and stole $1.5 billion from Bybit.” Hachem pointed out that Bybit’s official bug bounty program offers a maximum reward of $4,000 on its website and up to $10,000 on the HackerOne platform. These amounts are negligible compared to the multi-million-dollar sums that malicious hackers can potentially steal. The cybersecurity expert argued that offering larger bounties upfront to ethical hackers would be far cheaper and more effective than trying to recover funds after a breach. He criticized the industry’s tendency to offer 10% of stolen funds as white hat rewards post-hack, stating that such reactive measures only embolden malicious actors rather than preventing attacks in the first place. “Motivating top ethical hackers to dedicate their time and attention to testing an exchange by offering higher rewards will greatly improve its security, will be a lot cheaper, and will safeguard its reputation,” Hachem emphasized. While bug bounty programs are crucial, cybersecurity experts also stress the need for stricter security measures to prevent incidents like the Bybit and Infini hacks from recurring. A spokesperson from CertiK said recently that several industry-standard practices must be adopted, including: Air-gapped signing devices to prevent unauthorized transactions. Non-persistent OS environments for transaction approvals to reduce exposure to malware. Enhanced authentication layers for high-value transactions to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, the firm recommended regular red-team exercises and phishing simulations to mitigate social engineering risks, which remain a major attack vector in the crypto space. CertiK’s report provided insights into the specific vulnerabilities that led to the Bybit and Infini hacks: The Bybit exploit was the result of a phishing attack, where multisignature signers were deceived into approving a malicious contract upgrade, effectively allowing attackers to gain access to users’ funds. The Infini hack occurred due to an admin private key leak, which allowed attackers to make unauthorized withdrawals. Both cases show the dangers of blind signing and inadequate transaction verification. CertiK emphasized that stronger authentication protocols, real-time transaction monitoring, and improved user interface security are necessary to prevent such breaches in the future. The Future of Crypto Security As the cryptocurrency sector continues to evolve, exchanges and other platforms must prioritize prevention over reaction. The rise in large-scale hacks demonstrates that weak security practices and insufficient bug bounty incentives are actively being exploited by criminals. Bybit’s record-breaking $1.4 billion hack should serve as a wake-up call to all crypto exchanges and wallet providers. Security must become a top priority, with an emphasis on: Significantly increasing bug bounty rewards to attract the best ethical hackers. Expanding the scope of security programs to cover all possible vulnerabilities. Implementing stronger authentication measures for both internal and user transactions. Conducting regular penetration tests and security audits to identify risks before attackers do. The surge in cryptocurrency-related hacks, culminating in February’s $1.5 billion losses, highlights the urgent need for stronger proactive security measures. Exchanges must rethink their approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that ethical hackers are adequately incentivized to uncover vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by criminals. With cybercriminals continuously adapting their tactics, the crypto industry must stay ahead of the curve. By offering more competitive bug bounty programs, tightening security protocols, and implementing stricter authentication measures, crypto platforms can significantly reduce their risk exposure and safeguard user funds from future attacks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-04 05:30:00

Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, sparked industry debate about its impact and regulatory clarity. Coinbase is also concerned about regulation, and even recently filed a FOIA request seeking details on SEC spending for crypto enforcement actions. Lawmakers Establish Congressional Crypto Caucus The United States House of Representatives will see the formation of a new pro-crypto group, as Congressmen Ritchie Torres and Tom Emmer announced the launch of the Congressional Crypto Caucus . The bipartisan caucus will advocate for digital asset-friendly policies and serve as a voting bloc to rally support for key crypto legislation. Torres confirmed the news through a post on X on March 3, while Emmer’s office shared that the group will play a crucial role in advancing pending legislation, including stablecoin and market structure bills. The formation of this caucus comes as a more action-oriented counterpart to the existing Congressional Blockchain Caucus, which was established in the later years of the Obama administration to boost and encourage understanding of blockchain technology. While that group largely functioned as an educational and discussion platform, the Congressional Crypto Caucus will actively influence policy decisions by mobilizing votes in favor of digital asset regulation. Currently, lawmakers in the House are reviewing a draft bill that is designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the US. The legislation was introduced by Representatives French Hill and Bryan Steil on Feb. 7, adding to the growing momentum for clear rules around digital assets. Representative Maxine Waters also voiced her support for a stablecoin bill that was introduced in 2024. Steil, who chairs the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, indicated that an updated version of the FIT21 bill, a key market structure proposal that was passed in 2024, may be on the horizon. Both Torres and Emmer have been very vocal supporters of the crypto industry. Torres has consistently advocated for balanced regulations that prevent crises like the FTX collapse while also ensuring the US remains a leader in finance and innovation. He previously expressed his support for FIT21 because of its role in consumer protection and industry oversight. Emmer serves as the House Majority Whip and vice chairman of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, and has also been a strong proponent of advancing crypto-friendly policies. He has positioned digital assets as a matter of American leadership, particularly under the current political climate. The emergence of the Congressional Crypto Caucus certainly aligns with the broader pro-crypto shift in Washington. President Donald Trump recently announced that his Working Group on Digital Assets was instructed to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a strategic crypto reserve. Additionally, Trump is set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Idea Gains Traction but Lacks Clarity Donald Trump’s recent announcement of a strategic crypto reserve generated a lot of discussion in the industry, with some experts seeing it as a positive development but also warning that it does not replace the need for clearer regulation. Patrick Young , go-to-market lead at Web3 app Galxe, believes that while the move signals growing government involvement in digital assets, the long-term impact on the market will depend on regulatory clarity rather than state-led accumulation of cryptocurrencies. Trump’s Truth Social post In a March 2 post on Truth Social , Trump revealed that his administration’s digital assets working group was instructed to include XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a US government crypto stockpile. He later stated that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be at the core of this reserve. Trump has been promoting the idea of a US strategic crypto reserve since mid-2024, and his latest statement had an immediate impact on the market. Bitcoin saw a sharp increase, and briefly jumped past $90,000 before stabilizing. Cardano surged by more than 40% in the first 24 hours after the announcement. Despite the market reaction, Young said that the broader industry is more focused on regulatory progress. He pointed out that a friendlier regulatory environment could serve as a more sustainable driver for crypto markets. Trump’s appointments to key regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raised expectations that clearer guidelines will soon be introduced. The SEC already moved forward with applications for US crypto products that previously stalled under the prior administration, which many believe signals a shift in regulatory approach. The commission also stated in February that meme coins are likely not securities, which also clarified a lot of questions that the industry had. Trump’s decision to include altcoins like XRP and Cardano in the reserve raised some concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Some industry figures suggested that the president could be leveraging the move to increase his own crypto wealth, given his connections to entities that hold various digital assets. Others pointed to the centralization risks that are associated with a government-controlled reserve of decentralized assets. Adam O’Brien , CEO of Bitcoin Well, questioned the rationale behind centralizing cryptocurrencies in a government reserve, and argued that if centralized assets were the goal, traditional blue-chip stocks would be a more logical choice. He also warned that such a move could set a precedent that shifts focus away from the fundamental decentralization principles of blockchain technology. While the creation of a strategic crypto reserve has been received as a step toward legitimizing digital assets at the federal level, many in the industry believe that long-term stability will ultimately depend on regulatory frameworks. Coinbase Seeks SEC Spending Details on Crypto Lawsuits Some in the crypto industry are still holding on to the damage that was caused by the previous administration. In fact, Coinbase filed a Freedom of Information Act request looking for details on how much the SEC spent on enforcement actions against crypto firms. Paul Grewal, the exchange’s chief legal officer, announced the move on March 3, and stated that the request covers investigations and enforcement actions from April 17 of 2021, to Jan. 20 of 2025. Coinbase is looking for information on the number of employees that were involved, third-party contractors used, and the overall cost of these regulatory efforts. Grewal criticized the SEC’s previous regulation-by-enforcement approach, and argued that it costs the US innovation, leadership, and jobs. He also questioned the budget and operational costs of the SEC’s now-defunct Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, which was replaced by the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit on Feb. 20 this year. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is very well known for his strict stance on crypto, resigned on Jan. 20 , 2025, the same day Donald Trump began his second presidential term. Under Gensler’s leadership since 2021, the SEC pursued more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms. After his departure, the agency completely reversed course by dropping multiple lawsuits, including cases against Kraken , Gemini , and Yuga Labs.

The protocol processed $4.66 billion in swaps in the week ended March 2, the highest tally on record, according to data source DefiLlama . The tally exceeded the $1 billion mark on Sunday alone. The surge in activity follows the hack of the crypto exchange Bybit on Feb. 22, which saw the North Korean malicious entity walk away with $1.4 billion in ether. Per observers, the entity used THORChain to swap and launder funds, resulting in a record activity on the platform. ""Starting from the initial Bybit Exploiter wallet, funds were sent across a further stretching net of wallets. With each 'hop' further from the main wallet, there was an increasing amount of intermediary wallets and the value transfers became smaller and smaller,"" blockchain analytics firm Nansen said in a report shared with CoinDesk. ""From hop 2, the hacker started interacting with third-party entities to start swapping and laundering the funds. Entities with the most inflow volume from the hack include THORChain, Paraswap, Mantle, OK DEX and DODO,"" Nansen added. CoinDesk reached out to THORChain for a comment on the matter. Per onchain analyst EmberCN, hackers have laundered the entire ETH balance in ten days, generating record revenue for THORChain. ""Hackers have laundered all 499,000 ETH ($1.39 billion) stolen from Bybit, a process that took 10 days. The ETH price has fallen by 23% in the process (from $2,780 to $2,130 today).

The markets toppled then but bounced back heavily, attracting over $300 billion in liquidity after validating a crypto strategic reserve. In the times when the markets were hoping that these tariffs could get delayed, Trump confirmed that the tariffs would begin on March 4, 2025. With this, the traditional markets plunged, driving the crypto markets back under a strong bearish influence. Bitcoin price and Ethereum price faced a huge pullback as they dropped below their respective psychological barriers at $84,000 & $2100, respectively. Therefore, this suggests that the excitement of the most-awaited announcement of a strategic reserve was very short-lived. Besides, the impact over the crypto markets quickly nullified with the probability of the start of a fresh tariff war. This suggests the market participants do not appear to be confident over the next price action as they continue to remain in fear. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve? Ever since the President announced the creation of a strategic reserve, the demand for only a ‘Bitcoin strategic reserve’ has emerged. Many criticize the inclusion of XRP, SOL, ADA, or other altcoins and push for only a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Besdies, more clarity is yet to be given after the announcement, while the formation is expected to consume more time than expected as it has to be tabled and approved in the parliament. Meanwhile, after a year of the first BTC ETF approval, the round of the first strategic reserve could have a similar impact. As rightly pointed out by a popular analyst, Crypto Rover , the BTC price has experienced a smooth upswing ahead of the expectation of the strategic reserve, and hence the impact of the news is yet to happen as it occurred after the approval of the ETFs. Therefore, the crypto markets are heading towards a very crucial phase, and hence, it would be more interesting to watch what new updates will unfold in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 05:48:27

The firm unstaked and distributed 3.03 million SOL (roughly $431.4 million) to 37 wallets just three hours ago. The company has followed a pattern of similar monthly activity over the past year by redeeming and transferring millions of SOL tokens regularly. The tokens move at regular intervals, mainly around the 12th to the 15th of each month, with amounts approaching 170,000 SOL. Spot On Chain noted that FTX/Alameda’s latest move was the largest unstake since November 2023. The firm also believes that FTX/Alameda’s latest unstaked Solana was likely part of the 11.2M SOL (nearly $2.06B) set to be unlocked in early March. FTX/Alameda Research’s SOL unstaking history. Source: Spot On Chain on X The analytic firm highlighted that FTX/Alameda had unstaked and unloaded 7.83M SOL since November 2023. The firm has now unstaked about $986M SOL to Coinbase and Binance at an average price of $125.8. In the wake of FTX’s unstaking activities, Solana has experienced a slight drop in prices since yesterday. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL has seen a 19.54% drop in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at $135.69 at the time of publication. FTX commences its creditor repayment process FTX’s latest unstaking followed its recent decision to commence its creditor repayment process this month, with an initial distribution of $1.2 billion to smaller claim holders. FTX’s creditor repayment process began officially on February 18 at 3 AM UTC. The repayment of $16 billion will begin with $6.5B to $7B in the first phase. The first batch of repayments will also target creditors with claims under $50,000, totaling approximately $1.2 billion. “It’s estimated that $6-7 Billion are going back into the hands of crypto investors. If a good fraction of that re-enters the market it could provide a boost to liquidity in the near future. – Miles Deutscher , Crypto analyst. Louis Origny, co-founder of FTXcreditor.com, told crypto influencer and journalist Tiffany Tong that account holders with claims over $50,000 may receive 175% of their original claim. He did not provide an official date for the distribution of funds to creditors with larger claims exceeding $50,000. The firm’s executive did reveal that the process is expected to begin in Q2 2025, with an estimated $16 billion to be disbursed in stages. He also highlighted that 50% of the repayment amount will be withheld to cover disputed claims. FTX revealed its reorganization plan that became effective on January 3, which outlined that all creditor repayments should be processed within 60 days of the effective date. Part of the plan tasked crypto custodian BitGo with handling the distribution of funds to creditors. The firm decided to base the payouts on crypto prices from November 2022, when FTX collapsed. Solana has also increased by over 700% since the company declared its bankruptcy, surging from about $22 to price levels slightly above $180. Ethereum holders with Ethereum in FTX will get a full $2500, the same price in 2022. FTX liquidated 41 million SOL in three auctions as part of its bankruptcy proceedings to refund its customers. Galaxy Digital was the largest buyer, acquiring nearly 25.52 million SOL at a price of $64 per token. At current SOL prices, Galaxy’s return rate stood at 187% since Solana’s price rose since the exchange went bankrupt. Pantera was the second-largest buyer, followed by a consortium of buyers who secured 13.67 million SOL at $95 per token. The purchase resulted in a 93% return rate, with other buyers managing to acquire 1.8 million SOL at $102 at 80% profit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

However, despite this bullish outlook, many ADA whales have already shifted their capital toward Rollblock’s presale – a promising GameFi altcoin gaining rapid traction. Rollblock is transforming the $450 billion gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology to eliminate fraud and scams. With over 7,000 games deployed on-chain, the platform has drawn significant investor interest. More than 50,000 investors have contributed nearly $11 million, making Rollblock one of the most promising presale altcoins of 2025. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Breaks the $1 Resistance Level Cardano has surged by 5.20% in the past month and 33% in the last week, and it’s now trading just below $1, with a $34 billion market cap. According to TradingView , its Average Directional Index has dropped below 46.8, signaling a strong uptrend that may persist unless a sell off ensues. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Santiment data shows that whale addresses holding 1 million to 10 million ADA has grown from 2,454 on February 21 to 2,789. This suggests large investors are onboarding ADA, which could trigger further highs for smaller holders. However, Crypto creator Satoshi Talks believes that ADA could test key support at $0.90 if the downtrend resturns. A break below may push it to $0.32, a level not seen since November 2024. However, if $90.0 holds, ADA could attempt a rebound, with resistance at $1,and $1.11. A breakout above these levels may help Cardano flip $1 resistance to support for the first time since late January. Grayscale has also added Cardano to its Smart Contract Fund, making ADA the fund’s third-largest asset at 18.23%. This move indicates confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential, even as its current price action remains volatile. Rollblock Hits $0.06 As 50,000+ Players Enter the Ecosystem Rollblock’s presale has been a massive success, with RBLK surging 500% across ten presale rounds. Now priced at $0.06, the token has attracted over 50,000 investors and raised nearly $11 million, making it one of the most successful GameFi projects of 2025. This growth isn’t just speculation – Rollblock’s innovative gaming ecosystem is driving real adoption backed by tried and tested utility. The platform hosts over 7,000 AI-powered games directly on-chain, ensuring full transparency and eliminating any possibility of fraud. Every outcome is immutably recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, guaranteeing fair play and further boosting investor confidence through superior security standards. Rollblock holds a full e-gaming license from the Anjouan Gaming Authority and has passed a SolidProof audit, verifying its smart contract integrity and solidifying the project’s compliance with the latest regulatory requirements. At the heart of this ecosystem is RBLK, a deflationary utility token with a fixed supply of 1 billion. Unlike inflationary altcoins like Cardano, Rollblock actively reduces the tokens in circulation, increasing scarcity and value over time. Its revenue-sharing model reinforces long-term growth. Up to 30% of platform revenue is used to buy back RBLK, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned and 40% distributed as staking rewards. This ensures constant demand, rewarding early investors while strengthening Rollblock’s ecosystem. Rollblock’s robust gaming ecosystem and deflationary tokenomics have caught the attention of many crypto experts and commentators. Here’s why Freddie Finance believes that this up-and-coming crypto gaming powerhouse could take everyone by surprise in 2025. This Crypto Presale Has INSANE Potential ($6M Already Raised?!) ROLLBLOCK Review Can Rollblock Outperform Cardano in 2025? Rollblock’s presale has skyrocketed 500%, hitting $0.06, with investors and players predicting a 100x surge toward $1.

With market sentiment shifting fast, attention also turns to Panshibi (SHIBI) , a panda-themed newcomer gaining traction in its presale at $0.005. While Cardano’s rapid climb underscores growing confidence in established altcoins, the latest Cardano Price Prediction further amplifies the buzz, and Panshibi’s meme coin appeal backed by locked liquidity and a robust design, offers a fresh angle for traders seeking high-upside meme tokens. Cardano’s Rally and Trump’s Crypto Reserve Observers point to a powerful catalyst in President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that Cardano would be part of a U.S. “Crypto Reserve.” Fueling the altcoin’s rally, Cardano climbed an impressive 60% after weeks in a stubborn downtrend. Now trading around $0.972 , the coin has pushed back above critical resistance at $1.00, an encouraging sign after languishing below that level. Market data reveals that this boost in buyer interest coincided with an uptick in the MVRV Long/Short Difference metric, signaling that long-term holders remain confident. Although the president pegged a lofty sum for the entire reserve package, skeptics caution that official numbers remain sparse. Regardless, the psychological effect of including Cardano in a high-profile initiative has contributed to bullish sentiment. Technical analysts warn that for ADA to maintain its upward path, $1.00 must be reliable support . A break below that threshold could drag the coin toward $0.85 or even lower, unraveling the recent gains. Nonetheless, traders remain watchful, as Cardano’s “living governance” structure and DeFi expansions underscore the network’s ambition. Panshibi (SHIBI): A meme coin Token with Locked Liquidity Amid the excitement over Cardano Price Prediction angles, a new meme coin stands out: Panshibi (SHIBI) . Priced at $0.005, the presale has already raised more than $1.2 million. Panshibi merges meme coin branding with robust tokenomics, locking liquidity for ten years and the team tokens for two. An AI-based “social-fi” model encourages staking and quest-based activities, seeking to sustain engagement well beyond its initial launch. Such a structured approach addresses the volatility typical of meme coins, reassuring those who fear sudden dumps. By building meme coin flair on top of a stable foundation, Panshibi catches the eye of risk-oriented traders looking for potential quick gains. A new meme coin token can sometimes thrive alongside more established altcoins, especially if market attention drifts from older memes or if bullish cycles return. While no meme coin asset is guaranteed success, the token’s mix of humor, locked liquidity, and interactive community fosters expectations of an upward climb possibly rivaling the big leaps of other early-stage meme coins. Conclusion As the crypto sphere buzzes over Cardano Price Prediction , talk of $1.20 or higher, the arrival of Panshibi (SHIBI) signals that meme coin tokens can still grab the spotlight if they blend novelty with security. Cardano’s bounce above $1.00 demonstrates that strong catalysts, like a U.S. Crypto Reserve mentioned, can quickly shape sentiment. Meanwhile, Panshibi’s presale success suggests that some traders prefer a meme coin’s thrill (and potential upside) that attempts to avoid typical pitfalls. Whether both can thrive simultaneously remains an open question, but their contrasting appeals highlight the vast opportunities and risks that define the crypto market.

Ripple (XRP) also experienced a strong surge after the announcement, but investors are still debating whether it can continue the explosive growth after substantial moves in recent months. Meanwhile, after gaining over 800% amid a turbulent market, many DOGE and XRP holders are reinvesting in DTX Exchange (DTX), a hybrid project that aims to transform the trading sector. In the bonus (final) round, the DTX presale is seeing overwhelming demand. Due to a $0.36 projected listing price, a 2x surge from now, it has emerged as the new safe haven for investors seeking a promising investment. Expert investors believe that the DTX Exchange could surpass XRP and Dogecoin prices before mid-2025. Dogecoin Price Reclaims $0.22, New Highs Soon? After 42 days of continuous downtrend, the Dogecoin price formed a pivot candle, surging above the $0.22 support. Last Friday, DOGE plunged to a low of $0.181, the lowest price seen since 7 November 2024. On late Sunday, the Dogecoin price surged over 15%, reaching a high of $0.24. This minor recovery offers hope to holders, but the meme coin remains under heavy pressure, as monthly stats show a loss of 30%. Courtesy: TradingView Commenting on the Dogecoin price prediction, renowned crypto analyst, Ali Martinez said that if it holds above the key support, an uptrending move could occur. Currently, the key level for Dogecoin price is the support range of $0.20 and $0.22. If DOGE manages to surge above the $0.28 resistance, then an uptrend could be confirmed. Can Ripple (XRP) Inclusion in Crypto Reserve Solve Regulatory Challenges? President Trump recently disclosed that the US cryptocurrency strategic reserve will have Ripple (XRP) and several other main digital assets. This information has resulted in the rise in value of the XRP, which rose by more than 36% in one go, reaching above $3.02. Ripple is facing SEC in court and aims to win the case, which could be one of the factors influencing its long-term upward trend. James Murphy, an attorney, expressed his opinion about why the SEC did not drop the suit against Ripple right away. He is a prominent figure in the field of financial services law and often shares his views on cryptocurrency-related legal disputes, particularly the Ripple vs. SEC one. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of uncertainty that drives XRP investors to hedge the risk and seek new industry leaders like DTX Exchange. DTX Presale Soars Past $15.50 Million: Easy 2X Opportunity While turbulent market conditions have affected Ripple and Dogecoin, DTX Exchange’s presale performance has been nothing short of remarkable. Due to the increasing demand, the bonus round is selling out rapidly, and the total raised has crossed $15.50 million. This incredible success demonstrates strong market validation for its innovation of a hybrid trading model, which combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. DTX Exchange’s hybrid protocol allows traders to access more than 120,000 financial assets, including stocks, crypto, ETFs, forex, and bonds. This approach eliminates the necessity of multiple platforms and also saves users from various charges, such as AMC. Experts consider the DTX token’s current valuation of $0.18 to be highly undervalued because, upon listing at $0.36, it will provide early investors with a 200% profit before it even hits major exchanges. Key Takeaways Ripple investors remain cautious due to regulatory hurdles, and the Dogecoin price is still struggling from sentiment shifts, while DTX Exchange has created a stir with its advanced platform being hailed as a one-stop solution for traders. Investors looking for a solid investment contender will most probably find that DTX offers a much superior upside compared to other cryptos.

33767162,[object Object],1741068018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Sleeping Giants Awaken: Old Whales Resurface Amid Price Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-giants-awaken-old-whales-price-surge/,"On-chain data shows the dormant Bitcoin whales have come back alive to make moves following the latest price surge in the cryptocurrency. Old Bitcoin Whales Have Just Made Several Transactions As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, there have been several transfers involving old tokens of the cryptocurrency during the past day. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “ Spent Output Age Bands ,” which tracks the transaction activity of the various Bitcoin ‘age bands.’ An age band defines a time-range inside which the coins contained by it were last moved on the network. The 6 months to 12 months band, for example, includes the tokens that were last involved in a transaction between six and twelve months ago. If the owners of these coins include them in a move, the Spent Output Age Bands would spike for the band. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the latest trend in the indicator for the 7 years to 10 years and 10+ years age bands: As is visible in the above graph, the Spent Output Age Bands has registered a few spikes from each of these age bands in the last 24 hours. This means that coins that were previously dormant for at least seven years have just been brought out of the freezer. Given that the transactions followed the cryptocurrency’s recovery back above $90,000, it’s possible that these old whales made them to take profits. If so, it could be a bearish sign for the asset, considering how long these coins were dormant for. Something to note, though, is the fact that when tokens get older than seven years, they become more likely to have reached their age by being lost, rather than by being HODLed . Coins are said to be ‘lost’ when the keys associated with the wallet holding them become misplaced. Thus, it’s possible that the investors who have made these transactions in the past day only recently rediscovered the keys attached to the addresses. If they were truly HODLing by their own volition thus far, though, them deciding to sell now would suggest these diamond hands don’t believe Bitcoin would get much higher. A cohort that’s more likely to contain willful HODLers is the 5 years to 7 years one and it turns out coins falling in this age band have also seen significant movement in the last 24 hours. BTC Price It would seem that the decision to sell from the dormant whales may not have been such a bad one as Bitcoin has already erased most of its gains from the rally, with its price falling back to $87,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Dormant Whales|Bitcoin Old Whales|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Price Surge|Bitcoin Rally|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-04 06:00:18

The SEC’s decision means no penalties, no changes to Kraken’s business operations, and no admission of wrongdoing. The SEC has closed probes into major companies like OpenSea, Gemini, and Robinhood but continues to investigate others, including Ripple. A Major Legal Victory for Kraken The SEC filed a lawsuit in November 2023, accusing Kraken of mishandling customer funds and operating as an unregistered securities broker. Instead of settling, Kraken chose to fight the charges. A federal judge initially ruled that the SEC had a plausible case, which led to the case heading to trial. However, the SEC has now decided to drop the charges after reaching an agreement with Kraken. Pending approval from the SEC’s Commissioners, the case will be officially closed. “This dismissal lifts that cloud of uncertainty. It reaffirms that businesses like Kraken, which prioritize compliance and consumer protection, should not be subject to arbitrary legal battles,” the company stated. A Turning Point for Crypto in the U.S. Kraken celebrated the SEC’s decision, calling it more than just a legal victory. The company described the move as a turning point for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. The SEC’s decision, Kraken stated, puts an end to what they called a politically motivated campaign, lifting the uncertainty that has hindered innovation and investment in the industry. SEC’s Changing Approach to Crypto Enforcement Kraken’s win comes as the SEC, under new leadership, shifts away from the aggressive enforcement tactics that characterized the tenure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The new leadership has expressed a commitment to developing clear and fair regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, rather than relying on “regulation by enforcement.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 06:09:06

While the announcement initially triggered a jump in crypto trading, markets cooled on Monday as concerns about the implications of the plan surfaced. Trump announced plans on Sunday to establish a government-backed reserve that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano, claiming the move would help the United States become the “Crypto Capital of the World.” But the initiative has drawn criticism, particularly over the inclusion of multiple cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and whether such government intervention contradicts traditional free market principles. Related News: There Will Be Intense Cryptocurrency Spotlight In The US Senate This Week - Here Are The Details Of The Development Expected To Be Positive Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the richest man in American crypto with a net worth of $9.6 billion, expressed his skepticism on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that the reserve should focus solely on Bitcoin, which he called a “successor to gold” for the U.S. government. Billionaire investor Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of AI-focused defense firm Palantir and a staunch Trump supporter, was even more critical. Responding to Trump’s post, Lonsdale condemned the plan, arguing that “it is wrong for crypto brokerage firms to tax themselves” and that government intervention in crypto markets is “not the proper, principled role of government.” Notably, even those connected to Trump’s crypto chief David Sacks have voiced their disapproval of the plan. Jason Calacanis, Sacks’ co-host on the influential “All-In” podcast, called the move an example of “Trump Pump” and “a crazy scam.” Meanwhile, Jeff Park, a strategist at Bitwise, a crypto index fund manager in which Sacks’ venture capital firm was an early investor, called Trump’s decision to include multiple cryptocurrencies “a huge political miscalculation.” *This is not investment advice.

Retail and institutional players reacted differently at several stages of the dip, with the latter making market-swinging sales. United States foreign policies also affected the market despite being tipped to spur market growth during Donald Trump’s second term. Bitcoin Whale Dump Large Holdings In the last 30 days, Bitcoin whales have transferred 60,000 BTC to exchanges, heightening sell pressure. This follows shaky weeks in U.S. tech stocks, sparking bear sentiments in crypto assets. Bitcoin price sank below $100K after the launch of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and has struggled to find its previous momentum. As confidence plummeted further with Trump’s new tariffs, whales began moving assets to prevent losses gained in previous months. Last year, institutional inflow and whale accumulations spiked the asset’s price above $100k with an expected run to $150K this year. These recent outflows have slowed mainstream adoption, lowering sentiments as seen in a drop in the fear and greed index. The mark reaction shows fear as multiple assets dipped below previous support levels. Bitcoin whales dominate the market, and huge sales for large groups result in a plunge in the fear and greed index. Centralized exchange and whale balances are closely monitored to determine the next market direction. Despite these bear factors, investors bought the dip looking for good entry positions ahead of a rebound. Crypto trader Ali Martinez pointed out that the wider market recorded $6 billion in capital inflows as holders set sights on recovery. Rebound Hinged On Spot Bitcoin ETFs The nosedive affected Bitcoin, altcoins, meme tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers. Declined volumes negatively impacted the market leading to a crash in crypto prices. The wider market capitalization dropped from $3.5 trillion to $3.1 trillion, wiping out billions. Bitcoin price trades at $97,746, down 4% in the last seven days while altcoins recorded higher exits. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs which have attracted over $40 billion, dominating the financial markets are a lifeline to BTC price. Institutional appetite is growing as on-chain metrics point upwards despite the status quo. Firms like Standard Chartered made higher projections expecting a massive run before the end of Trump’s second term.

According to a Mar. 4 post on X by on-chain analyst EmberCN, who has been tracking the stolen funds, much of the Ethereum ( ETH ) was funneled through THORChain ( RUNE ), a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol, and converted into Bitcoin ( BTC ). 黑客已经把从 Bybit 盗取的 49.9 万枚 ETH ($13.9 亿) 全部清洗完了，整个过程历时 10 天。 ETH 价格在这个过程中下跌了 23% (从 $2,780 跌到现在的 $2,130)。 而黑客洗钱使用的主要通道 THORChain 也因黑客洗钱获得了 $59 亿的交易量跟 $550 万的手续费收入。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/osoKNzFhkG pic.twitter.com/QUWuMmV6zH — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 4, 2025 THORChain has handled $605 million in transactions in the last 24 hours alone. The platform has received criticism for its involvement in facilitating illegal transactions, after recording $5.9 billion in volume and collecting $5.5 million in fees during the laundering process. One critic on X referred to THORChain’s response as “negligence at best, greed at worst.” While other protocols acted accordingly to stop the movement of stolen funds, THORChain validators did not take any meaningful action. Pluto, a core contributor, resigned in protest after a governance proposal to halt ETH transactions was rejected.

This and… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) March 4, 2025 According to Zhou, 83% of the laundered funds were converted into Bitcoin, distributed across 6,954 wallets, with 72% ($900 million) of these funds passing through THORChain. Moreover, after being transferred through ExCH, 16% of the assets became untraceable, and the OKX Web3 Proxy processed another 8% ($100 million). Bybit has since launched Lazarusbounty.com, a fund-tracking website, and it is providing bounties to exchanges that help recover the stolen assets. So far, $2.17 million in rewards have been paid to 11 bounty hunters, with Mantle, Paraswap, and ZachXBT among the top contributors.

The sharp reversal aligned with a cautious mood among traders after Monday’s market rally following the ambitious plan, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted. Trump’s Sunday declaration that the reserve would include ADA, XRP and SOL, alongside bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) ignited a market frenzy, with ADA soaring over 60%, XRP climbing 33%, and SOL jumping 22% within hours. The promise of a government-backed crypto stockpile was hailed as a game-changer, with analysts predicting it could legitimize digital assets and drive institutional adoption. However, the rally proved short-lived amid profit-taking and a general risk-off mood in broader equity markets. “Trump's latest tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico, and China caused a massive selloff of crypto assets, completely reversing the previous day's crypto strategic reserve gains,” Kevin Guo, director of HashKey Research, said in a Telegram message. “Despite a slew of pro-crypto deregulation initiatives and supportive policies, investors view cryptocurrencies as risk assets strongly bound by the performance of the US equity market.” On Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff on the import of various items after Trump, doubled the tariff on imports from China to 20%. The U.S. President also confirmed that 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would be effective on Tuesday. Bitcoin is down 9% in the past 24 hours amid the macroeconomic chaos, trading at $84,000 as of Asian afternoon hours. Ether lost 12% and trades just above $2,000 — its lowest since 2023.

Regulatory Case Ends Without Penalties The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Kraken with prejudice, preventing the regulator from refiling the case in the future. The crypto exchange confirmed the development, stating that the case was dropped without any admission of wrongdoing, penalties, or required changes to its business operations. Kraken framed the SEC’s decision as a pivotal moment for the crypto industry in the United States, suggesting it signals the end of a politically driven crackdown that has hampered innovation and investment. The exchange expressed optimism about a more stable regulatory landscape moving forward. The announcement from Kraken added, “The SEC’s decision to dismiss its lawsuit against us (and many others) is more than just a legal victory—it’s a turning point for the future of crypto in the US. It ends a wasteful, politically motivated campaign, lifts uncertainty that stifled innovation and investment, and clears the path toward a stable, forward-thinking regulatory regime. Legal Battle and Regulatory Uncertainty The SEC initially sued Kraken in November 2023, accusing the platform of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency. The regulator alleged that Kraken facilitated the trading of crypto asset securities without proper registration, depriving investors of key protections such as audits, disclosures, and oversight. Kraken denied the allegations and countered that the SEC had not provided clear guidelines on whether digital assets should be classified as securities. The exchange filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing regulatory uncertainty and a lack of fair notice. While a federal judge allowed certain aspects of Kraken’s defense to proceed, the SEC continued to pursue its claims until now. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation Kraken acknowledged the role of the new leadership at the SEC and the White House in influencing the decision, suggesting a shift in regulatory priorities. The company credited what it described as “bold and thoughtful” leadership for fostering a new era of crypto innovation. Senior Advisor Marco Santori celebrated the outcome, stating, “We beat the SEC! Congratulations to the best legal team in crypto. Fighting—and beating—the SEC was not foretold. Lawyers, lobbyists, and everyone in between… We had to earn it.” SEC Cases Dropping like Flies The dismissal follows a series of dropped crypto-related enforcement actions by the SEC under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. The regulator recently abandoned cases against Gemini, Consensys, Robinhood, and Uniswap, while also agreeing to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice. With the SEC scaling back its aggressive stance against crypto firms, industry participants are hopeful that future regulatory efforts will provide clearer guidelines rather than rely on enforcement-driven approaches.

Mintoak, an Indian ecommerce startup that facilitates merchant payments, has acquired Digiledge in a deal worth around $3.5 million, marking the first acquisition in India’s CBDC area, Reuters, has learned , citing sources close to the matter. With Digiledge, which specializes in CBDC and bill payments, Mintoak’s partner banks — HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI — could offer payment solutions in e-rupee, India’s form of CBDC.

Initially, only banks could use it, but the scope expanded to payment firms in April 2023. The e-rupee adoption has been sluggish, with the RBI reporting 1 million retail transactions by late June 2024, a milestone reached only after local banks introduced incentives and partially paid employee salaries using the state-issued digital currency. The RBI had previously urged banks to increase transactions to at least 1 million per day by late 2023 to test the system’s scalability. However, this push has since ceased, casting doubt on the future of the digital currency initiative due to the gap between incentivized metrics and actual user adoption.

In the last seven days, the Hedera price has experienced a surge of 17.5%. In the last hour alone, the market has grown by around 0.5%. Let’s analyse the scenario deeper. Nasdaq Files for Grayscale’s Hedera ETF It was on Monday that the Nasdaq filed the form with the US SEC to list and trade the spot HBAR ETF of Grayscale. For an ETF to be traded on a major stock exchange, the exchange needs SEC approval.

As soon as the SEC acknowledges the filing, the regulator beings the approval process. For this reason, the filing is a crucial step in the process. HBAR’s Strong ETF Approval Chances It was not the first time that the Nasdaq approached the SEC to seek its approval to list and trade a spot Hedera ETF. Earlier, a 19b-4 form was submitted to the US SEC for the spot HBAR ETF of Canary Capital. Importantly, renowned ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently predicted that Hedera and Litecoin ETFs have the best chance of winning the approval of the SEC compared to other Altcoin ETFs. Hedera: Everything One Should Know Simply put, Hedera is a public network where anyone can build and use applications. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses a technology called “hashgraph.” This technology is designed to be faster, more secure, and more efficient than many blockchain systems. According to Jonathan Dotan , the founder of EQTYLAB, “Hedera’s enterprise-grade infrastructure, backed by a Council of global leaders like Dell Technologies, sets it apart from other blockchains by providing the scalability and security essential for bringing Verifiable Compute to market. Its visionary leadership team has long shaped the network to meet real-world business needs, positioning it as a trusted platform for enterprise adoption.” HBAR Price Reaction In the last 30 days, the Hedera market has seen a drop of 18.7%. However, in the last seven days, it has experienced a rise of 17.5%. In the last one hour alone, the market has surged by over 0.5%. The total market cap of HBAR is $9,543,646,221.

ETH prices crashed to their lowest levels in 16 months, plunging 15% to $2,035 during early trading in Asia on Tuesday morning. The last time ETH traded below $2,000 was in November 2023, as the asset was slowly thawing from crypto winter. Ethereum has now returned to bear market levels and has dumped 50% since it tapped $4,000 in early December 2024. ETH Death Predicted Analyst ‘Nebraskangooner’ looked at the monthly timeframe chart and identified a double-top formation before predicting that prices would break down to the $1,200 level. This would send ETH back to bear market lows from late 2022 when it bottomed out at around $1,100. $ETH Monthly double top confirmed.

Ethereum may genuinely be one of the worst charts I have ever seen. pic.twitter.com/4nOWi0ZuyH — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) March 3, 2025 The ‘Anonymous Crypto Predictions’ feed said that ETH needed to close above the 200-week moving average as it did last week. This long-term trend indicator is currently around the $2,500 level, and ETH is well below that. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio, or price of ether in terms of bitcoin, fell to a five-year low of 0.024 this week as the asset tanked. #Ethereum – The key level to watch is the 200 weekly (black line). We need to close back above that like we did last week. Expect lots of manipulation and volatility. pic.twitter.com/aIskRebYqV — Anonymous | Crypto Predictions (@Crypto_Twittier) March 4, 2025 Flight to Risk-Off Many were questioning why crypto was crashing in such a bullish environment in the United States following years of being persecuted under the Biden administration. The Kobeissi Letter explained that the real driver here is the global move towards the risk-off trade and assets. “As trade war tensions rise and economic policy uncertainty broadens, ALL risky assets are falling. This was seen in stocks, crypto and oil prices, which all fell sharply today.” Moreover, Bitcoin is no longer seen as a store of value, having decoupled from gold, which hit an all-time high in late February. When Bitcoin falls, the digital lemmings follow, and Ethereum has been the first off the cliff. What is happening with crypto? Crypto markets are now worth -$100 billion LESS than they were prior to the US Crypto Reserve announcement. Over the last 24 hours, crypto has erased -$500 BILLION of market cap in a massive reversal. Here’s what you need to know.

It currently appears strong, but the next direction remains unknown while bearish. As expected, Bitcoin’s price collapsed last week following a strong breakthrough at the crucial $90k level, which has been standing as support for more than three months. It tested $78.2k with a long wick and closed that week’s price well above the lost crucial support. The collapse started after losing grip above the $95k level, but the price interestingly retested that level during yesterday’s surge – completing a break and retest pattern. The level was rejected, and the price dropped to around $93.6k at the time of writing. Retaking the rejected high with a surge could fuel more buying towards the $100k mark. This could signal a trend shift on the daily chart. But looking at the market, there’s no conviction for a shift yet following the latest price rejection. Of course, Bitcoin’s downtrend is still in play on the daily chart, but things are likely to change if the price stays well above the recent low. Otherwise, it may experience more dips in the coming days. Currently, it is gaining traction on the day. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Marking the $95k level as resistance since last weekend, a push above it should advance recovery to $99,550. The $103,278 level is the next resistance to watch, followed by the $109,588 resistance. Towards the downside, the $91k level is providing support along with $85k and $80k. If the price collapses through these levels to reclaim last week’s $78,258 low, the next drop may surface at $71k. Key Resistance Levels: $99,550, $103,278, $109,588 Key Support Levels: $91,000, $85,000, $80,000 Spot Price: $93,615 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It has seen a major recovery following a bounce back but is now losing steam. Ethereum has continued to mirror Bitcoin’s weekly movement but has failed to break below its critical $2,100 level, which has been providing support for the past four months. Respecting this critical level again, it bounced and recovered nicely to where it’s changing hands at around $2,378. The $2,550 level has posted a threat to the buyers in the past hours and is now holding it as resistance. A surge above it could trigger more increases in the coming days. Although it has formed a double-top pattern on the weekly chart, the price may crash soon. The potential target level for such a crash is $1,650. As soon as the price touches this level, a major bounceback is expected. The only condition for a bullish move right now is holding the critical support level. If it continues to strengthen, we may see a strong rally above the important $3k level before considering a reversal. While the trend is still in favour of the bears, they appear set for another rally. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential support levels for selling right now are $2,310 and $2,076. If the price breaks lower, $1,900 and $1,700 are the next support levels to consider for a test. In case of a reversal, ETH must retake a lot of resistance on the way up. For now, the close resistance level to watch for a test is $2,550 and $2,700. Higher resistance levels to keep in mind are $2,920 and $3,213.

China introduced tariffs on US goods and other trade measures on Tuesday in response to US President Donald Trump’s move to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.34% to close at 37,331, while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.71% to 2,710 on Tuesday, erasing gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 149 per dollar on Tuesday, approaching a five-month-high. Japan’s unemployment rate was at 2.5% in January 2025, slightly above market estimates and December's readings of 2.4%. Japanese companies reduced capital spending on plant and equipment by 0.2% year-on-year in Q4 of 2024, missing market expectations of a 4.9% increase and swinging from the strongest growth in three quarters of 8.1% in Q3. The consumer confidence index in Japan unexpectedly declined to 35.0 in February 2025, down from 35.2 in the previous month, below market expectations of 35.7. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.25% closing at 3,324, while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.28% to 10,679 on Tuesday, recovering earlier losses as investors assessed the impact of new tariffs , and the offshore yuan strengthened around 7.28 per dollar. The Trump administration's additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods took effect today, raising total US tariffs on China to 20%. In response, Beijing immediately announced new tariffs of 10%-15% on certain US imports, set to take effect on March 10, and imposed export restrictions on US firms. This new tariffs coincide with the start of a key annual political meeting in China this week. The country is anticipated to roll out fresh stimulus measures to help its economy withstand the impact of the increased tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.44% to 22,631 in the Tuesday morning session, following modest gains in the prior day. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.19% to 72,846 in morning trade on Tuesday, retreating for the third straight session and staying at their lowest level since early June 2024 amid losses in the tech sector, consumer goods, auto, and pharmaceuticals. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.58% to close at 8,189 on Tuesday, nearing its lowest level in two months. The Australian dollar slipped to around $0.62 on Tuesday, nearing a one-month low, after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s February meeting revealed that policymakers were focused on downside risks to the economy, signaling a more dovish stance. Retail sales in Australia increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January 2025, shifting from a 0.1% decline in the previous month and matching market expectations. Australia's current account deficit declined to AUD 12.5 billion in Q4 2024 from a downwardly revised AUD 13.9 billion shortfall in Q3. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended in red prompted by US President Trump’s confirmation that tariffs on key trading partners would take effect today.

Meanwhile, the markets dropped as President Trump confirmed the start of 25% tariffs on Canada & Mexico. While Bitcoin plunged below $84,000 and is struggling to regain the lost momentum, Pi Network is displaying decent strength. The PI price has been trying very hard to keep up the momentum since the early trading hours. What’s next? Will Pi price reclaim $2 this month? Soon after the launch, the PI price spiked high to mark highs close to $3 but failed to surpass the range. Currently, the token has surpassed Hedera and reached the 11th spot of the crypto rankings, which suggests it could be the next big thing in the markets. The price has sustained a notable bullish trend despite the ongoing market crash. Therefore, the price is now believed to reclaim the lost levels and close the quarterly trade on a bullish note. As seen in the above chart, the PI price broke out from the falling wedge in the short term but has yet to validate the upswing. After experiencing massive volatility, the volatility has squeezed as the Bollinger Bands have contracted well. Besides, the stochastic RSI has reached the overbought zone, which suggests that a temporary pullback could be on the horizon. Meanwhile, the local support zone, between $1.6 and $1.62, could offer a strong base, which may trigger a strong rebound to the upper resistance around $1.92. Regardless of the growing strength and potential to surpass the giants, the Pi Network is yet to get listed on Binance. In the times when the newly launched memecoins get listed within minutes, this delay could have a negative impact on the token, instigating a huge whale sell-off.

Dogecoin Price Drops Despite ETF Hype Despite the growing optimism, DOGE has plunged over 15%, dropping to $0.19 amid broader market volatility. The trading volume has also dropped 16.80%, indicating weaker market activity. This decline came after the excitement surrounding Donald Trump’s crypto reserve announcement, which briefly boosted sentiment.

Lately, the chatter has been all about Bitcoin’s resurgence, leaving many wondering about the fate of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal, and it’s time to pay attention. According to CoinMarketCap (CMC), this crucial metric currently sits at a low 16, unchanged from yesterday, as of March 4th, 00:35 UTC. But what exactly does this number mean, and how should it influence your crypto strategy? Let’s dive deep into understanding the nuances of the Altcoin Season Index and what it signals for the current crypto market . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Weather Vane Think of the Altcoin Season Index as a weather vane for the cryptocurrency market. Instead of predicting rain or sunshine, it forecasts whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. This index, meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap , offers a data-driven perspective on market sentiment beyond just price fluctuations. It cuts through the noise and provides a clear, quantifiable measure of market trends. Here’s a breakdown of what makes up the Altcoin Season Index: Scope: It analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure representation of market dynamics. Timeframe: The index evaluates the performance of these cryptocurrencies over the past 90 days, offering a medium-term perspective that smooths out short-term volatility. Benchmark: Bitcoin (BTC) is the benchmark. The index compares the 90-day performance of each of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during the same period. Scoring: The index ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger ‘Altcoin Season’, while a lower score suggests a ‘Bitcoin Season’. To truly grasp its significance, let’s understand the thresholds that define Altcoin and Bitcoin Seasons. Decoding Bitcoin Season: What Does an Index of 16 Really Mean? With the Altcoin Season Index currently at 16, the message is unambiguous: we are in a Bitcoin Season . But what does this practically entail for investors and the broader crypto market ? The index operates on a simple yet powerful principle: Season Index Score Condition Market Characteristic Altcoin Season 75 or higher At least 75% of the top 100 coins outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Altcoins are generally experiencing higher gains than Bitcoin. Capital often flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher percentage returns. Bitcoin Season 25 or lower 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Bitcoin is generally outperforming altcoins. Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven in the crypto space. An index score of 16 firmly places us in Bitcoin Season territory. This means that over the past 90 days, a vast majority (more than 75%) of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have underperformed Bitcoin. Only a small fraction, 25% or less, have managed to outshine the original cryptocurrency. This dominance of Bitcoin has significant implications for the entire crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Strategies and Considerations So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to a Bitcoin Season ? Understanding the dynamics of this market phase is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are some key considerations: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin Season often coincides with increased Bitcoin dominance. This means Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows at a faster rate than the rest of the market, or it declines less during downturns. Keep an eye on Bitcoin dominance charts to gauge the strength of this trend. Altcoin Performance: While it’s called ‘Bitcoin Season’, it doesn’t mean all altcoins will necessarily decline in price. However, their growth may be slower and potentially more volatile compared to Bitcoin. Selectivity is key. Research and focus on fundamentally strong altcoins that can weather the Bitcoin-centric market. Risk Assessment: Bitcoin is generally perceived as less risky than altcoins . During Bitcoin Season, investors often gravitate towards Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven’ within the volatile crypto space. Consider adjusting your portfolio risk profile based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Trading Strategies: Traders might consider strategies that capitalize on Bitcoin’s strength, such as longing Bitcoin or Bitcoin-paired trading. For altcoin enthusiasts, identifying oversold altcoins with strong fundamentals could present buying opportunities, but caution and thorough research are paramount. Long-Term Perspective: Market seasons are cyclical. Bitcoin Season might be followed by an Altcoin Season, and vice versa. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on short-term market trends. Maintain a long-term perspective and focus on the fundamental value of your crypto investments.

The latest Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is flashing red, signaling a significant downturn in market sentiment. For those watching the volatile crypto markets, the shift is palpable. The index, a key metric for gauging investor emotions, has taken a dramatic dive, plunging 18 points to land at a chilling 15. This nosedive propels us from the already cautious “Fear” territory directly into the dreaded “Extreme Fear” zone. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio, and how should you navigate these turbulent times? Let’s delve into the details. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a creation of Alternative.me, is designed to quantify the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a mood ring for crypto investors. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0: Extreme Fear – Signaling a potential buying opportunity, or a sign of further decline? 100: Extreme Greed – Often precedes market corrections, indicating a possible bubble. Currently sitting at 15, the index screams “Extreme Fear.” But what factors contribute to this reading? The index isn’t based on guesswork; it’s a data-driven analysis incorporating six key metrics, each weighted to reflect its influence on market sentiment: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can breed fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume against the 30-day and 90-day averages. Weak momentum and low volume can indicate a lack of investor confidence. Social Media 15% Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. Dominance of negative sentiment fuels fear. Surveys 15% (Currently paused) Previously involved weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during fearful times, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for crypto-related search queries. A spike in searches like “Bitcoin crash” often correlates with market fear. Why is the Crypto Market Sentiment So Fearful Right Now? Several factors could be contributing to the current Extreme Fear in the crypto market . While the provided data doesn’t specify the exact reasons for this sudden 18-point drop, we can consider common drivers of fear in the crypto space: Geopolitical Instability: Global events, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine or rising inflation fears, can trigger widespread market uncertainty and risk aversion, impacting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Concerns about stricter regulations or potential crackdowns on the crypto industry by governments worldwide can induce significant fear among investors. Market Corrections and Liquidations: Significant price drops, like the one seemingly triggering this “Extreme Fear” reading, can lead to cascading liquidations, further amplifying negative sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: Rising interest rates, inflation, and fears of recession in major economies can all contribute to a risk-off environment, pushing investors away from volatile assets like crypto. It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects collective investor emotions, which can be highly reactive and sometimes irrational. However, understanding these emotions can provide valuable insights into potential market movements. Navigating ‘Extreme Fear’: What Should Crypto Investors Do? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes “Extreme Fear,” it’s natural to feel uneasy. However, seasoned crypto investors often view periods of extreme fear as potential opportunities. Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Benefits of ‘Extreme Fear’ Buying Opportunity? : Contrarian investors often see extreme fear as a signal to buy. When fear is rampant, asset prices can be driven down to undervalued levels, presenting potential entry points for long-term investors. The adage “buy when there’s blood in the streets” comes to mind. Market Reset: Extreme fear can purge the market of speculative excesses and unsustainable hype, paving the way for healthier, more sustainable growth in the long run. Challenges and Risks of ‘Extreme Fear’ Further Downturns: Extreme fear can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Panic selling can exacerbate price drops, leading to further declines. It’s impossible to predict the absolute bottom. Emotional Decision Making: Fear can lead to impulsive decisions, such as selling assets at a loss out of panic. It’s crucial to avoid emotionally driven trading. Increased Volatility: Periods of extreme fear are often accompanied by heightened volatility, making it a risky environment for inexperienced traders. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors During ‘Extreme Fear’ Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Is your portfolio positioned to weather potential further downturns? Consider rebalancing if necessary. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t make impulsive decisions based on fear. Instead, double down on your research. Understand the projects you’ve invested in and their long-term potential. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider using dollar-cost averaging to gradually buy into your chosen cryptocurrencies over time. This strategy can mitigate the risk of buying at the absolute peak or trough. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Keep abreast of market developments, but be wary of fear-mongering headlines and social media hype. Focus on credible news sources and fundamental analysis. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, view periods of extreme fear as temporary setbacks and potential long-term opportunities. Cryptocurrency Analysis : Is ‘Extreme Fear’ a Buying Signal? The million-dollar question: Is this Extreme Fear a screaming buy signal? Historically, periods of extreme fear in the crypto market have often been followed by market rebounds. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Ultimately, whether “Extreme Fear” represents a buying opportunity depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook on the crypto market . It’s a time for caution, careful cryptocurrency analysis , and strategic decision-making, not panic. Conclusion: Navigating the Fearful Crypto Seas The sharp drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to “Extreme Fear” is a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While fear can be unsettling, understanding its drivers and potential implications is crucial for informed decision-making. By staying calm, conducting thorough research, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these fearful times and potentially capitalize on opportunities that may arise. Remember, market sentiment is cyclical; fear eventually gives way to greed, and vice versa. The key is to be prepared and informed, regardless of the prevailing market mood.

However, the momentum appears to have faded, as evidenced by the ongoing retreat in the asset’s price. So, let’s explore the current accumulation trend and see what lies ahead for the crypto. XRP News: Ripple Whales Buy 1 Bln Coin Ripple whales have once again made headlines in the XRP news column with their latest buying trend. Renowned market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the trend , indicating the renewed interest of the market participants towards the asset. For context, Martinez said that whales or large investors have purchased nearly 1 billion coins from yesterday, as the price soared more than 25% nearing the $3 mark. However, despite the massive XRP whale accumulation, the momentum was short-lived. Source: Ali Martinez, X XRP Price Slips: Here’s Why XRP price today was down 13% to $2.31, with its trading volume falling 30% to $13.9 billion. Notably, the 24-hour high and low of the asset were recorded at $2.23 and $2.7, respectively. Further, XRP Futures Open Interest fell 23% to $3.16 billion, indicating a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. It appears that despite XRP whales’ heavy buying, investors grew concerned over the future of the market. Besides, it also comes amid a broader digital assets selloff, with the crypto market facing liquidation of over $1 billion since yesterday. Why Is Crypto Market Falling? The current crypto market crash could be due to Trump tariffs going into effect on Mexico and Canada. This event, alongside other macroeconomic woes, has weighed on the investors’ sentiment, causing a massive selloff in the market. In addition, the impact of the recent announcement from Donald Trump regarding the US Crypto Reserve was also short-lived. While it initially caused a massive spike in prices, some investors might take the opportunity to book profit, triggering the selling pressure in the market. What’s Next For The Crypto? The recent decline in XRP could also be attributed to the delay in Ripple Vs SEC case resolution. While Trump’s announcement to add XRP to the US Reserve asset sparked hopes, legal experts have refuted claims of the development’s impact in speeding up the XRP lawsuit resolution . As the XRP price slipped to the $2.3 level, experts highlighted key support levels for the asset. For context, Rose Premium Signals said that in a bearish case, holding the $2.40 level is key. Breaking below this level could drag down the price to below $2. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Echoing a similar sentiment, EGRAG CRYPTO said that the crypto is likely to retest the $2.3 and $2.2 mark. However, Ripple’s coin holds key support at $2.2, which could help in a strong recovery ahead. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Having said that, the crypto must hold the $2.2 mark to witness a strong recovery ahead. While experts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin, some have warned of a potential crash to below $2 if the bears continue to dominate.

This news, delivered via an X (formerly Twitter) announcement, marks a significant moment of relief for the NFT community and signals potential shifts in the regulatory landscape for digital collectibles. But what exactly does this mean for the future of NFTs and the broader crypto space? Let’s dive into the details of this landmark decision and explore its implications. Why is the End of the SEC Probe into Yuga Labs a Big Deal for Bored Ape NFTs? The conclusion of the SEC probe Yuga Labs faced is more than just a corporate victory; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire NFT ecosystem, especially for prominent collections like Bored Ape NFTs . Since October 2022, when reports first surfaced about the SEC’s inquiry, the shadow of regulatory uncertainty has loomed over Yuga Labs and the broader NFT market. The investigation’s closure brings a sense of clarity and reduces the immediate fear of enforcement actions that could have stifled innovation and growth. Here’s why this development is particularly noteworthy: Validation for NFTs: The SEC’s decision to close the investigation without any enforcement action can be interpreted as a form of implicit validation for the NFT asset class, at least in the context of Yuga Labs’ operations. Boost in Investor Confidence: The resolution of regulatory uncertainty often leads to increased investor confidence. We might see renewed interest and investment in Bored Ape NFTs and other blue-chip NFT collections as the overhang of potential SEC action is removed. Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, this closure could set a precedent for how the SEC approaches other NFT projects. It might suggest a more nuanced approach than initially feared by many in the crypto space. Focus on Innovation: With the legal cloud lifted, Yuga Labs can now fully refocus on innovation and expansion within the metaverse and NFT space, potentially accelerating developments for BAYC and their other projects. What Was the Focus of the Yuga Labs Investigation? While the specifics of the Yuga Labs investigation were never officially disclosed by the SEC, reports indicated that the inquiry centered around whether certain NFTs offered by Yuga Labs, and the distribution of ApeCoin, constituted unregistered securities offerings. This is a critical question that has been hanging over the NFT space as regulators grapple with how to classify and regulate these novel digital assets. The SEC’s scrutiny likely revolved around: Security vs. Collectible: Determining if Bored Ape NFTs and ApeCoin were being marketed and sold in a way that resembled investment contracts, thus falling under securities laws, or if they were legitimately collectibles. Utility and Promises: Examining the utility promised or implied for these assets and whether Yuga Labs’ actions constituted an “investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,” a key aspect of the Howey Test used to define securities. Secondary Market Activity: While Yuga Labs does not control the secondary market, the SEC may have been interested in how the secondary market dynamics and price appreciation of Bored Ape NFTs influenced investor perceptions. Crypto SEC Cases: A Trend of Resolution? The closure of the Crypto SEC cases against Yuga Labs is not an isolated incident. As mentioned, the SEC has recently resolved investigations or reached settlements with several prominent crypto firms, including Robinhood, Gemini, UniSwap Labs, MetaMask, OpenSea, Coinbase, and Kraken. This pattern raises questions about the SEC’s evolving approach to crypto regulation. Is the SEC softening its stance, or is this a strategic shift? Here are a few potential interpretations: Interpretation Possible Reasoning Strategic Focus Shift The SEC may be prioritizing enforcement actions against more egregious cases of fraud or clear violations, while taking a more measured approach to projects that operate in the gray areas of regulation, like NFTs. Resource Allocation The SEC might be re-allocating resources, focusing on areas they deem higher priority or where they believe they have stronger legal footing. Investigations are resource-intensive, and closures could reflect strategic prioritization. Legal Challenges and Setbacks The SEC has faced legal challenges in some of its crypto enforcement actions. These closures might indicate a recalibration based on legal realities and a desire to pursue cases with a higher likelihood of success in court. Dialogue and Engagement Perhaps these closures represent a move towards more dialogue and engagement with the crypto industry to establish clearer regulatory frameworks, rather than solely relying on enforcement actions. Navigating NFT Regulation: What’s Next? While the end of the NFT regulation probe into Yuga Labs is undoubtedly positive news, it doesn’t mean the NFT space is entirely out of the regulatory woods. Clarity on NFT regulation remains a crucial need for the industry to thrive sustainably. Here’s what to consider moving forward: Continued Regulatory Scrutiny: NFT projects should still expect regulatory scrutiny. The SEC and other agencies are likely to continue monitoring the space and may initiate future investigations. Importance of Compliance: NFT projects should prioritize legal compliance, seeking advice to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. This includes understanding securities laws, intellectual property rights, and consumer protection regulations. Industry Self-Regulation: The NFT industry itself can play a role in shaping its regulatory future. Developing best practices, promoting transparency, and engaging in constructive dialogue with regulators can help foster a more favorable regulatory environment. Global Regulatory Landscape: NFT regulation is not just a U.S. issue. Projects need to be aware of and compliant with regulations in different jurisdictions as the global regulatory landscape for digital assets evolves. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air for NFTs and the Metaverse The SEC concluding its investigation into Yuga Labs without any charges is undeniably a significant victory for the company and a breath of fresh air for the NFT community. It signals a potential shift in the regulatory climate and provides a much-needed dose of optimism. While the long-term regulatory framework for NFTs is still being shaped, this development offers a moment to celebrate progress and look forward to continued innovation in the exciting world of digital collectibles and the metaverse. It underscores the resilience and dynamism of the crypto space and its ability to navigate and overcome regulatory hurdles.

With Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs already in place, and Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) expected to follow, attention has now turned to other potential candidates. Here are the possible altcoins next to be added to the crypto reserve. Next Token To Add in Crypto Reserve A recent tweet post by CryptoRank highlights a list of altcoins currently awaiting ETF launches. These include Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche (AVAX), and Aptos (APT).

Dogecoin (DOGE), with a massive $32.4 billion market cap, stands out as a strong contender. Given its popularity and links to prominent figures like Elon Musk, it wouldn’t be surprising if it finds favor in Trump’s strategy with a possibility of Dogecoin ETF getting approval soon. Hedera (HBAR) and Chainlink (LINK), both valued at $10.4 billion, could also be appealing due to their blockchain infrastructure capabilities, which align with national security and financial interests. Litecoin, which was created as a faster alternative to Bitcoin in 2011, is closer to getting SEC approval for a spot Litecoin ETF. Experts believe there is a 90% chance it will be approved by the end of the year. Apart from all Avalanche, Polkadot & Aptos with market caps of $9.6 billion, $7.52 billion, and $3.74 billion, respectively also have strong foundations. These tokens could be next in Trump’s crypto reserves, helping shape the future of U.S. digital assets. Trump’s Crypto Strategy Perhaps CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently expressed concerns that the U.S. is using crypto as a tool for economic dominance. His remarks suggest that the Trump administration’s stance prioritizes digital assets that serve national interests while leaving others unprotected. Trump’s selective support for certain assets has sparked debates about whether crypto is becoming more centralized under political influence. If his administration continues along this path, we could see a major shift in how cryptocurrencies are regulated and adopted in the U.S.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|BTC|LINK|LTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 07:45:25

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-in-local-distribution-phase-heres-the-significance/,"Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently noted that XRP whales have been offloading their holdings at unprecedented levels. In a post on X, Deutscher stated that large holders have been “aggressively selling” since the asset’s price surged by over 500% from November. He described the current market behavior as a local distribution phase, indicating that whales are taking profits following the substantial rally. Deutscher also attached a chart highlighting significant selling activity among whales. This pattern suggests a shift in market sentiment, as large-scale distributions typically indicate that investors who accumulated XRP earlier are now selling. The implications of such activity could influence both short-term price movement and broader market trends. $XRP whales are unloading at record levels! Large holders have been aggressively selling since the price rallied over 500% from November. $XRP seems to be in a local distribution phase right now. pic.twitter.com/NgaOoiZkWX — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 3, 2025 XRP’s Remarkable Run In late 2024, XRP began a remarkable run triggered by Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement . The asset rose from around $0.55 in early November, to a multi-year high of $3.39 in January 2025, marking a 516.4% increase. Contrasting Whale Behavior Despite the widespread selling reported by Deutscher, other recent whale movements provide a more complex picture. Some large investors accumulate tokens amid the sell-offs, signaling confidence in the asset. For example, a recent report highlighted that whales had acquired 1 billion XRP during a price dip. In another instance, a single entity purchased 65 million XRP , reinforcing the idea that not all major holders engage in the sell-off. These acquisitions contrast with the broader trend identified by Deutscher and suggest that while some whales are exiting, others see an opportunity to accumulate anticipating further gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for XRP? The significant movement of tokens by whales extends beyond buying and selling on the open market. Recent blockchain data reveals that Ripple and major holders moved 490 million XRP within 24 hours. Another report pointed out that 520 million XRP had been acquired by whales, further complicating the market outlook. Increased whale activities can impact liquidity, volatility, and overall market sentiment, making them critical indicators for traders and investors monitoring the asset’s trajectory. Deutscher’s observation that XRP is in a local distribution phase aligns with broader market trends where large holders capitalize on price surges to take profits. However, the mixed activity among whales indicates that while some major holders are liquidating their positions, these purchases suggest that other investors view the current price levels as a strategic entry point. At press time, XRP traded at $2.6 after a notable surge caused by Donald Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve including XRP. It will be intriguing to see how the whales react to this development. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

41136693,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136499,1741074786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing: IMF’s Strict Bitcoin Conditions for El Salvador’s $1.4B Loan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/imf-loan-el-salvador-bitcoin/,"In a move that has the crypto world buzzing, El Salvador’s pursuit of a substantial $1.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has come with strings attached – and these strings are tightly wound around Bitcoin . Yes, you heard it right. The IMF is laying down some serious ground rules regarding El Salvador’s favorite cryptocurrency, demanding significant changes to its Bitcoin strategy as a condition for financial assistance. Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating development and what it means for El Salvador and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the IMF imposing strict conditions on El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption? The IMF’s concerns aren’t exactly new. Since El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, the international financial institution has voiced worries about the risks associated with cryptocurrency adoption, particularly its volatility and potential impact on financial stability. For a nation seeking a massive IMF loan to bolster its economy, these concerns have now translated into concrete demands. The core issue? The IMF wants to ensure that public funds are managed responsibly and that the risks associated with Bitcoin are mitigated. Here’s a breakdown of the key conditions El Salvador must meet to secure the IMF loan : Phasing out Public Involvement in Chivo Wallet: By July 2025, El Salvador must cease all public sector engagement with the state-run Chivo wallet. This means no more government funds can be used to support or operate the Chivo wallet. Ending State Funding for Chivo: Following the previous point, the government must completely stop using state resources to finance the Chivo wallet by the specified deadline. Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN (Bitcoin Trust Fund): The controversial Bitcoin Trust Fund, FIDEBITCOIN, is required to be dissolved. This fund was set up to facilitate the conversion of USD to Bitcoin and vice versa when Bitcoin became legal tender. Audited Financial Reports: El Salvador must release fully audited financial reports for FIDEBITCOIN, providing transparency into the fund’s operations and financial status before its dissolution. Implementing a Bitcoin Holdings Management Framework: The government needs to establish a robust framework for managing its Bitcoin holdings. This includes clear policies and procedures for acquisition, storage, and potential sale of Bitcoin . Disclosing Wallet Addresses to the IMF: Transparency is paramount. El Salvador is mandated to disclose all its Bitcoin hot and cold wallet addresses to the IMF. This level of scrutiny is unprecedented in traditional financial agreements. Regular IMF Reviews: Compliance isn’t a one-time event. The IMF will conduct regular reviews until 2025 to monitor El Salvador’s adherence to these Bitcoin -related conditions. What are the potential benefits of these strict cryptocurrency regulations for El Salvador? While these conditions might seem restrictive, they could bring some unexpected benefits to El Salvador. Let’s explore the potential silver linings: Enhanced Financial Stability: By reducing public exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility, El Salvador could achieve greater financial stability. The IMF’s conditions aim to insulate public funds from the unpredictable nature of the Bitcoin market. Improved Investor Confidence: Adhering to international financial standards and demonstrating fiscal responsibility can boost investor confidence in El Salvador. This could attract foreign investment beyond just the crypto sector. Greater Transparency and Accountability: The requirements for audited reports and disclosure of wallet addresses promote transparency and accountability in the management of public funds related to Bitcoin . This can build trust with both international partners and Salvadoran citizens. Streamlined Financial Operations: Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN and phasing out the Chivo wallet could streamline government financial operations, removing complexities and potential inefficiencies associated with managing a parallel Bitcoin system. Securing the Crucial IMF Loan: Ultimately, compliance unlocks access to the $1.4 billion IMF loan , which is vital for El Salvador’s economic stability and development. This financial injection can support crucial public services and infrastructure projects. What challenges does El Salvador face in complying with IMF’s Bitcoin demands? Navigating these cryptocurrency regulation demands from the IMF won’t be a walk in the park for El Salvador. Significant hurdles lie ahead: Political Resistance: Bitcoin adoption is a flagship policy of President Bukele’s administration. Scaling back public involvement in Bitcoin could face political resistance from within the government and among staunch Bitcoin supporters. Technical Complexity: Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN, auditing its finances, and establishing a new Bitcoin management framework are technically complex tasks. El Salvador will need expertise and resources to execute these changes effectively and transparently. Public Perception and Chivo Wallet Users: The Chivo wallet has been widely adopted in El Salvador. Phasing out public support might lead to confusion and dissatisfaction among users who rely on it for transactions and Bitcoin access. Managing public perception during this transition will be critical. Economic Impact of Bitcoin Policy Reversal: While intended to enhance stability, a perceived reversal of Bitcoin policy could have unforeseen economic consequences, potentially impacting tourism and businesses that have embraced Bitcoin . Meeting Tight Deadlines: The July 2025 deadline for many of these conditions is relatively tight. El Salvador will need to act swiftly and decisively to meet these requirements within the given timeframe. Examples of other countries and cryptocurrency regulation El Salvador isn’t alone in grappling with cryptocurrency regulation . Many countries are navigating the complexities of digital assets, each with different approaches: Country Regulatory Approach Key Features United States Fragmented, evolving Multiple agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN) involved, focus on investor protection and anti-money laundering, ongoing debate about classification of cryptocurrencies. European Union MiCA Regulation Comprehensive framework for crypto-asset markets, aiming for harmonization across member states, covers issuers, service providers, and consumer protection. Singapore Pro-innovation, risk-based Supportive of blockchain technology and crypto innovation, but with strict AML/CFT regulations, licensing regime for crypto service providers. China Strictly Regulated, Centralized Digital Currency Banned cryptocurrency trading and mining, focuses on developing its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY. These examples highlight the diverse approaches governments are taking. El Salvador’s situation is unique due to its adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, making the IMF loan conditions particularly significant. Actionable Insights: What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin in El Salvador? The IMF loan conditions signal a significant shift in El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. While Bitcoin remains legal tender, the government’s direct involvement is being curtailed. Here are some actionable insights: Decentralization of Bitcoin in El Salvador: The IMF conditions push for a more decentralized approach to Bitcoin in El Salvador. Reduced government involvement could foster a more organic and community-driven Bitcoin ecosystem. Focus on Private Sector Bitcoin Adoption: With the state stepping back from Chivo, the onus will be on the private sector to drive Bitcoin adoption. Businesses and individuals will need to innovate and create solutions for Bitcoin usage. Increased Scrutiny on Bitcoin Adoption Globally: The IMF’s stance on El Salvador will likely influence how other international institutions and governments view Bitcoin adoption. It sets a precedent for conditional financial assistance related to cryptocurrency policies. Potential for a More Sustainable Bitcoin Ecosystem: By addressing concerns about financial stability and transparency, El Salvador could potentially build a more sustainable and resilient Bitcoin ecosystem in the long run, even if it looks different from the initial vision. Conclusion: A pivotal moment for Bitcoin and El Salvador El Salvador’s journey with Bitcoin has reached a pivotal moment. The IMF loan conditions represent a significant course correction, demanding greater fiscal prudence and transparency in its Bitcoin strategy. While challenges undoubtedly exist, these changes also present opportunities for a more mature and sustainable integration of Bitcoin into El Salvador’s economy. The world will be watching closely to see how El Salvador navigates these new conditions and what it means for the future of Bitcoin adoption globally. This episode serves as a stark reminder that even revolutionary financial technologies must operate within the bounds of sound economic principles and international financial norms.

Shiba Inu, FloppyPepe, and Pepe are top crypto tokens with the potential to grow from $20k to $1 million within a short period of time. Table of Contents FloppyPepe, the million-dollar crypto token Pepe gears for another major pump Shiba Inu works to revive winning ways Final thoughts Turning $20k to $1 million within a short period isn’t uncommon in the crypto world. In 2025, investors can make this happen by investing in some crypto tokens. Based on their potential, Shiba Inu (SHIB), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Pepe (PEPE) can surge massively, turning a $20k portfolio into a million-dollar bag. FloppyPepe, the million-dollar crypto token When Shiba Inu and Pepe first hit the market, these crypto tokens skyrocketed in value and made early investors millions. In 2025, FloppyPepe is hoping to do the same. FloppyPepe is a meme coin that embodies the humor, strong social media presence, community, and virality associated with successful meme cryptos; after all, it’s a Matt-inspired token like Pepe and Brett. While entertainment and humor were the main defining features of past successful meme coins, FloppyPepe is about to add AI technology to improve the meme space. The platform’s community number surged in the past 24 hours after the release of its Meme-o-Matic AI machine, a text-to-image AI tool that can convert text prompts into high-quality meme images. Available for free use on Telegram, tons of users are already discovering how to create viral memes and put them for sale on marketplaces. FloppyPepe is also about to release another AI agent called Floppy X. It’s a video generator that needs only text prompts or images to generate high-resolution videos. Floppy X videos are interactive, can record engagement, and can analyze the data collected. FloppyPepe isn’t limiting itself to AI tech, even though its Floppychain technology, which works like ChatGPT, is also on the way. The meme coin is spreading its wings to touch nature. According to its tokenomics, 1% of every transaction funds the care of wildlife like Hippos and endangered species. Seeing its potential to see a massive rise when it lists on major exchanges soon, investors are rushing to join its presale priced at $0.0000002 to be part of its upcoming rise to the moon shot. You might also like: Matt Furie’s meme created PEPE’s success, could FloppyPepe be the next 1,000x run? Pepe gears for another major pump After its 2021 moonshot, investors didn’t expect Pepe to see a massive pump again. However, in 2024, PEPE rose again to set a new all-time high of $0.000008585. Pepe continues to increase over the years, keeping its community optimistic. In 2025, as Bitcoin’s performance continues to fuel market optimism, Pepe may hit a new high. Despite Pepe’s large market cap, it’s impossible to rule out a 1,000x surge for the crypto token. Shiba Inu works to revive winning ways SHIB’s popularity during the 2021 bull market stemmed from its massive gains, making many early investors millionaires. However, it’s currently facing challenges. Despite this, Shiba Inu is expanding and working on a comeback, with recent efforts like token burns and partnerships with AI companies. In 2025, Shiba Inu could potentially deliver returns of up to 1,000x. Final thoughts Among the three crypto tokens, Shiba Inu, FloppyPepe, and Pepe, FloppyPepe’s introduction of AI technology into meme space and utilities makes it the most promising to deliver high returns of up to 1,000x. So far, the crypto token presale has raised about $900,000 in a few days, a sign of huge buying pressure since its private presale also sold out in a day, raising $1 million. With a superior burn model that removes 1% of each transaction of the crypto token from circulation, FloppyPepe, the SolidProof audited meme coin, is a sustainable investment for savvy investors. Still selling at $0.0000002, investors can join its presale today to get in while it’s still early. For more information on FloppyPepe, visit its website , Telegram , or X .

Bitcoin has retreated to around $84,000, marking a 9% decrease from the previous close. The total crypto market cap has also dropped by around 10% to $2.76 trillion. However, rumors about President Donald Trump considering zero capital gains tax for US-based cryptocurrencies have sparked enthusiasm among traders. If this rumor turns true, how will it impact USA coins and cryptocurrencies price predictions? Will President Trump Announce Zero Capital Gains on Cryptocurrencies? Crypto analyst Mike Alfred has sparked speculation about Trump announcing zero capital gains on crypto. He noted that Trump would announce this move during the White House Crypto summit on Friday. In January, The Street reported that Eric Trump had confirmed that US-based cryptocurrencies such as XRP would be exempt from capital gains tax while non-US-based projects would be subject to a 30% tax. This move will put the US on par with crypto-friendly countries like El Salvador, which exempts foreign investors from capital gains on Bitcoin to attract investors. If Trump confirms this development, it will drive price gains for cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). These three USA coins have already been included in plans for a crypto strategic reserve despite market-wide criticism . XRP Price Defends Support After 16% Decline The XRP price has recorded a sharp 16% drop in 24 hours to trade at $2.35 at press time. The price drop follows broader weakness across the cryptocurrencies market but XRP has managed to defend crucial support at $2.14. Technical indicators show mixed momentum. The CMF indicator is positive signalling underlying accumulation. The Awesome Oscillator remains negative but has flashed green suggesting the bearish momentum is weakening. For a bullish reversal, the XRP price needs to flip resistance at $2.70 for a rally to $3.40. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Cardano Price Drops 23% Amid Crypto Market Volatility Cardano price has dropped by 23% in 24 hours to trade at $0.82. Despite the dip, ADA price still trades above its 200-day SMA, which is a crucial support level. If bulls defend this zone, another rally past $1 could follow, However, if selling pressure continues, it could lead to a bearish Cardano price prediction and a drop to $0.67. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Solana Price Forms a Death Cross Solana price has formed a death cross on its daily chart with the 50-day SMA falling below the 200-day EMA. After falling by more than 18% in 24 hours, SOL trades at $138. The altcoin was struggling to defend multi-month support at $135. The RSI is yet to be oversold, indicating there is room for further downside. With FTX unlocks for SOL tokens weighing on the cryptocurrency price, it could decline towards $100 in the near term. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Bottom Line Speculation around President Trump’s potential zero capital gains tax for US-based cryptocurrencies like XRP, Cardano, and Solana has sparked enthusiasm about price performance. However, heightened volatility in the broader market has prevented these USA coins from making meaningful gains.

At first, it rose to a new ATH but crashed 53% amid a broader market correction and is struggling to recover. Although yesterday marked a significant recovery, the trend changed again, leading to another step down and more risk. With the FTX/ Alameda unstacking millions of SOL, the token is one step closer to a further crash. Will it drop below $100? Let’s discuss this. Solana Price Crash: What’s Happening Today? Today marks another turbulent day, and the entire crypto market is witnessing a crash , including the Solana price. It currently trades at $128.14 after a 19% drop in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization and trading volume are $70.16B after the 19% drop and $9.56B after the 24% drop. Interestingly, this drop is because the tariffs on Mexico and Canada go into effect. However, the most alarming thing is that this drop came after an impressive SOL price rally fueled by Donald Trump’s U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement. At a time when investors anticipated a further uptrend, possibly as high as $200, the SOL price crashed, with the FTX and Alameda unstacking 3.03M SOL, equivalent to $431.3M. FTX Unstake Event and Its Impact on SOL As the crypto exchange begins redistributing the funds of FTX crash-affected investors, the market is witnessing millions of token unlocks, which are affecting their price. The firm recently unstaked 3.03M SOL ($431.3M) and transferred them to multiple crypto wallets. 24,799 SOL ($3.38M) has already been deposited to the Binance exchange, liquidating the asset. More importantly, many similar unlocks will come in April and the month after that, injecting fear into the market. This is because large token unlocks often influence investors’ sentiments and cause price fluctuations. As the crypto market is already under pressure, investors wonder if Solana could crash below $100. Why Wouldn’t Solana Price Crash Below $100? The SOL token’s performance today shows high signs of volatility, and factors like investor sentiments, a drop in network performance, token unlocks, and broader market conditions are to blame. However, considering SOL’s rally yesterday and market sentiments, the Solana price may not crash to $100 despite the odds. This altcoin grew to $177.88 yesterday and witnessed high trading volume and open interest, showcasing high investor interest. This explains the token’s potential for recovery even in adverse market conditions. Although the SOL is on the brink of massive liquidation, a $100 crash is unlikely. According to the Coinglass data, $300M will liquidate if the SOL price crashes to $127. This might initially trigger a drop to $120, but a rebound may occur, making a dip below $100 unlikely. Lastly, the Bitcoin price recovery in March could prevent this altcoin from further falling. The historical data reveals that BTC is bullish this month from the last 4 years, and the same might also happen this year, assisting the altcoins in recovery. Conclusion: A Steep Correction, but No Collapse Despite the ups and downs, Solana’s status in the crypto market is prominent. Although the FTX’s $431.3M unlock puts significant downtrend pressure on the price, the current analysis sees support at $120. Hence, the SOL price crash to $100 is unlikely, but due to liquidation data, it may dip towards $120. Investors must consider the liquidation level, whale data, and Bitcoin’s price movement to better comprehend Solana price predictions.

Analyst Says ADA ‘Could Be Poised’ For Rally To $2.20,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-125-pump-coming-analyst-says-ada-could-be-poised-for-rally-to-2-20/,"On Sunday, Cardano (ADA) saw a massive 80% pump following the US President’s announcement of a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” that will include ADA. As the cryptocurrency retests its key support levels, some analysts believe it might be poised for a 125% rally from current levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Sets $0.43 Target Cardano Attempts Reclaiming $1 On March 2, US President Donald Trump announced the establishment of a “US Crypto Reserve” comprised of Cardano, XRP, and Solana (SOL), with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at the heart of the strategic reserve. On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump stated the strategic reserve would “elevate the critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.” The announcement sent many cryptocurrencies into an end-of-week pump to reclaim some recently lost support levels. ADA has been in a downtrend since December when it hit its 3-year high of $1.32 but failed to hold the $1 support in mid-January. The February market retraces sent the cryptocurrency’s price below several key support zones, with the token hovering between the $0.60-$0.80 price range. Following Trump’s announcement, Cardano rose 60% in two hours, climbing from $0.64 to the $1 barrier for the first time in over a month. ADA continued its surge in the following hours, recovering over 80% from its Friday low of $0.58. On Sunday, ADA hit a two-month high of $1.17 before retracing over 20% to the key $0.90 support zone. Cardano investor Sebastian noted that the retest of the $0.92 level was “perfectly normal after such an insane move.” The investor suggested it could consolidate within the $0.90-$1.00 range for a few days before resuming its ascending trajectory. Moreover, he asserted that If ADA breaks above its December high, the token could likely see a new all-time high (ATH) soon. ADA’s New High Could Be Near Crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that Cardano “could be poised for a rally to $2.20.” According to the post, investors should “watch for a 12-hour candlestick close above $1.19” to confirm the bullish breakout and target an 84% jump from the breakout level. Martinez also highlighted that Cardano whales bought over 420 million ADA in the past 24 hours, which could signal strong sentiment from large-scale investors on the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that Cardano’s chart displays a “big power of 3 in the making.” This pattern divides the price cycle into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Key Levels And Faces Resistance At $97K – Can It Break $100K This Week? The first phase consists of a consolidation near the recent high after a strong price performance. The second phase sees a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level and trades within a range below the recently lost zone. In the third phase, a strong price breakout occurs, with momentum building and participants entering the market. According to Sjuul, “the chart never lies,” and Cardano entered the distribution phase after Sunday’s pump, suggesting that ADA could retest December highs soon. As of this writing, ADA trades at $0.91, a 9.9% retrace in the daily timeframe.

The task force aims to tackle the regulatory challenges surrounding digital assets. This group of experts will help the SEC address critical issues, including compliance and regulatory guidelines, ensuring that crypto regulations are more clear and effective. The leadership team of the task force includes Richard Gabbert as Chief of Staff, Michael Selig as Chief Counsel, Taylor Asher as Chief Policy Advisor, and Sumeera Younis as Chief of Operations. In addition to these leaders, the task force benefits from the input of Senior Advisors, including Landon Zinda, Donald Battle, Bernard Nolan, Laura Powell, Veronica Reynolds, Christopher Rice, Mark Sater, Andrew Schoeffler, Frank Sensenbrenner, and Robert Teply. The combined expertise of these professionals covers key areas such as legal, policy, and operational matters within the cryptocurrency landscape. Formed in January 2025 under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, the Crypto Task Force is tasked with refining existing crypto regulations, creating clearer compliance processes, and improving disclosure standards. By ensuring that enforcement remains focused and effective, the SEC hopes to pave the way for a more secure and transparent crypto market. As part of their initiative to encourage public dialogue on crypto regulations, the task force will be hosting a series of roundtable discussions, named “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The first roundtable, scheduled for March 21, is titled “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status.” This event will be streamed live and is open to the public, with security measures limiting in-person attendance. However, recorded versions of the event will be made available for later viewing. Participants will also be able to engage in smaller, off-air breakout discussions. Commissioner Peirce highlighted the importance of collaboration with the public, noting that these roundtables will be a key part of developing a workable regulatory framework for digital assets. The creation of this task force and the upcoming roundtable events signal a commitment from the SEC to create a well-regulated crypto market.

In a new thread, Ki Young Ju tells his 410,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s surge on Sunday is confirming his belief that Bitcoin’s bull market is far from over – as long as it doesn’t fall significantly below the $75,000 level. “Made a bold call knowing I could be way off, but glad I got it right.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Bitcoin surged over the weekend from around $84,000 to around $94,000, after President Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve for the US that will include the flagship digital asset. Ki Young Ju also says that deep-pocketed investors using the top US crypto exchange Coinbase were propelling Bitcoin to higher price levels over the weekend. “Coinbase whales led this Bitcoin surge.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The CEO points to other metrics that he says continue to signal bullishness, including Bitcoin’s hash rate. The hash rate measures the computational power used by miners to secure the BTC network. A higher hash rate indicates a stronger network and better security. “The chart that backs my belief in Bitcoin. When investment in its network security stops, it has likely absorbed enough capital. That’s the time to sell.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X He also says that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator shows the price of the flagship crypto asset is likely to go up based on historic precedence. MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at) and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued. “Bitcoin on-chain indicators feel like this – like something unfinished.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The flagship digital asset did retrace on Monday amid the Trump tariff news that caused a sell-off in the stock market. Bitcoin is trading for $83,284 at time of writing, down 10.4% in the last 24 hours.

This filing follows Bitwise’s earlier submission of an S-1 to the SEC. According to the filing, Coinbase Custody will manage the ETF's Dogecoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon will oversee the cash assets and handle administration tasks. The filing proposes that the ETF will hold Dogecoin as its primary asset, with its Net Asset Value (NAV) calculated daily using the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, an industry-standard pricing benchmark. This would allow the ETF to closely track the market value of Dogecoin, offering investors an opportunity to trade the meme cryptocurrency on traditional markets. Besides Bitwise, other major firms like Grayscale and Rex Shares have also filed for a Dogecoin ETF, with Grayscale’s application further along in the SEC's review process. Grayscale’s filing has already been acknowledged by the SEC, making it a strong competitor in this space. Market sentiment surrounding the approval of a Dogecoin ETF has been increasingly positive. According to Polymarket, the probability of approval has risen to 67%, up from 55% just a day before. Bloomberg analysts have also forecast a 75% chance of approval in 2025. This rising confidence reflects the market’s belief that a regulated Dogecoin ETF may soon become a reality, although approval is still not guaranteed. This potential ETF marks a turning point for Dogecoin, which began as a joke in 2013 but has since grown into the largest meme cryptocurrency, with a market cap surpassing $28 billion. Despite this, DOGE’s price has recently fallen by nearly 16%, with trading volume showing a marked decline of 17%. This drop in price and volume underscores broader market challenges, despite the increasing optimism around the ETF. Market optimism is increasing due to the growing chance of a Dogecoin ETF approval in 2025. Grayscale’s lead in the ETF approval process signals significant regulatory interest. However, DOGE’s price drop highlights the volatility of meme coins despite positive regulatory news.",,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:04:46

While liquidity decreases, the influx of new coins and inflation pressures are only adding to the downward trend. Investors became more cautious after Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and a 20% tariff increase on China, starting later today. The crypto market experienced significant volatility following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. While there was an initial surge in prices, those gains quickly faded as doubts arose over its execution and necessary regulatory approvals. Further, Trump’s announcement about tariffs added extra uncertainty, which led to a larger sell-off across the market. Crypto Liquidations Cross $1 Billion Crypto liquidations have surged to over $1.09 billion, with BTC alone accounting for more than $400 million. The crypto market has faced the most significant selloff of 2025, losing $460 billion in just 24 hours. This equates to an average loss of about $19.1 billion per hour for the last 24 hours staright, according to The Kobeissi Letter. We are seeing crypto's steepest selloff of 2025: Over the last 24 hours, crypto markets are down -$460 billion from their highs.

Market volatility is likely to continue, especially as these tariffs take effect later today. Bitcoin fell 9.8% to $83,725. Alankar Saxena, CTO and co-founder of Mudrex, cautioned the investors to stay careful as volatility could continue if BTC drops below the $81,000 support. However, there is room for recovery with resistance at $92,000 if market sentiment improves. Arthur Hayes Says BTC Could Drop To $70k Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s current bull market, maintaining that the cryptocurrency is on track for continued growth. However, he also warned that in the worst-case scenario, Bitcoin’s price could drop to around $70,000, aligning with the previous cycle’s all-time high. Altcoins Hit Harder In the last 24 hours, altcoins have taken a bigger hit, with Ethereum dropping to $2,000 and heading towards its worst Q1 performance ever. Ethereum dropped 15% to $2,083. After a brief spike above $2,500 following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement, Ethereum has now collapsed to $2,050, erasing all its weekend gains. The global crypto market cap fell by 10.5% to $2.76 trillion in the last 24 hours.

Goliath’s primary goal is to offer Visa-level transaction speeds , targeting up to 24,000 transactions per second, making it a strong contender in the competitive world of high-speed blockchain solutions. It aims to accomplish this with a Proof-of-Stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW) and selects validators based on the amount of tokens they stake, thus reducing the network’s carbon footprint. Goliath will provide scalable and secure infrastructure for banks and financial service providers, marking a significant step forward in blockchain technology for the finance sector. Onyx emphasized that while Goliath will be a Layer-1 blockchain , it will remain interoperable with existing financial networks, ensuring it can seamlessly integrate with current systems. The roadmap for Goliath’s development includes a testnet launch scheduled for Q3 2025 , followed by a mainnet release in Q1 2026 . These phases will allow the team to refine the blockchain before it’s fully deployed in the financial sector. In addition to the Goliath project, Onyx is also launching a Points Program for its existing Layer-3 XCN Ledger . Participants who bridge assets like WETH, USDT, and others from the Base blockchain to Onyx will receive rewards. Despite the optimistic announcements, Onyxcoin’s token (XCN) saw a significant drop of over 11% today, continuing a larger trend. The broader crypto market, grappling with bearish news from the Federal Reserve, saw major price declines, impacting XCN’s value. After Onyxcoin had a brief rally earlier this month, a mass exodus of investors occurred, and the token saw a significant 50% loss in February. The Goliath announcement has yet to slow down this downward trend, and while it’s an exciting innovation for the blockchain and financial sectors, it remains to be seen if it can halt XCN’s current struggles. Despite the challenges, Onyx’s Goliath project presents a promising leap forward in blockchain’s role in finance, especially with its focus on scalability, security, and energy efficiency. However, it will face fierce competition as other blockchain networks aim to provide similar solutions for high-speed financial transactions.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:07:24

Ongoing Efforts to Trace and Recover Assets The Bybit team is actively working with blockchain forensics firms and law enforcement to trace and recover the stolen assets. The significant amount that remains traceable suggests that coordinated action could lead to a portion of the funds being frozen or recovered.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) are tasked with creating the proposal for managing digital assets and cryptocurrencies. This initiative follows a recent directive aimed at promoting national growth and increasing economic stability. The move is seen as crucial in regulating the growing digital asset market in Vietnam, which ranks 7th globally in cryptocurrency ownership, according to data from Triple-A. As of now, cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender in Vietnam, and many businesses that operate in the country register abroad to avoid local regulations. This has created a competitive disadvantage for local companies and has led to a loss in potential tax revenue. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of taking action, stating that all levels of government and the people have shown support for the initiative. With this legal framework, businesses will be able to access capital from financial institutions more easily, and users will benefit from greater transparency, helping minimize risks associated with digital currency transactions. Additionally, the framework will help the government in taxing crypto transactions and digital assets, contributing to the national economy. Currently, the Vietnamese government does not have a clear definition of virtual currencies or digital assets. The country’s previous efforts to regulate digital assets were incorporated into the Law on Digital Technology Industry, classifying crypto as intangible assets. In 2025, the government plans to classify digital assets based on factors like technology and purpose. This is expected to create clearer guidelines for the regulation of digital assets, which will contribute to the growth of the sector. To support these efforts, the Vietnamese government is also exploring the possibility of setting up testing mechanisms, known as sandboxes, to help establish a digital asset exchange. This initiative is expected to boost the financial industry and help Vietnam develop its digital currency market further. Moreover, the country plans to launch financial hubs in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang by 2025. The Prime Minister’s recent directive also mandates the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to draft policies related to digital assets and sandboxes, with deadlines set for Q2 2025. As Vietnam moves forward with these regulatory efforts, the country aims to position itself as a key player in the global digital currency space.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:11:47

McWilliams brings over 20 years of experience in financial management and auditing, and his role is crucial in driving Tether’s strategy to become more transparent amid growing regulatory pressure. Under his leadership, Tether aims to carry out a comprehensive financial audit, which the company hopes will address the long-standing doubts surrounding its reserve backing. In a shift of roles, Giancarlo Devasini, the former CFO, has been moved to the Chairman position, where he will focus on broader strategic initiatives, including advancing Tether’s integration into the U.S. financial system and boosting global digital asset adoption. McWilliams' appointment marks a critical step toward reinforcing Tether’s standing in the $232 billion stablecoin market. For years, Tether has faced skepticism regarding the transparency and legitimacy of its reserves. Until now, the company has only provided quarterly attestations from the accounting firm BDO, but these reports have been criticized for lacking the thoroughness of a full audit. This opacity has fueled doubts, particularly following a 2021 settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office, which exposed that Tether had misrepresented the backing of USDT at a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar. Despite the challenges, Tether has disclosed that a significant portion—82.35%—of its reserves is in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits, with nearly 80% of these holdings in U.S. Treasury bills. Critics, however, argue that only a full audit will truly resolve lingering concerns about the company’s financial stability. Tether's move for a comprehensive audit fits into its broader strategic goals. Recently, the company relocated its headquarters to El Salvador, aiming to secure a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license. This relocation signals Tether’s intention to strengthen its operational foundation and expand within the institutional financial sector. This development also comes as Tether seeks to demonstrate greater accountability and enhance its relationship with regulators, institutional partners, and users. With McWilliams’ appointment, Tether hopes to restore confidence and solidify its position as a leader in the stablecoin market, aligning itself with institutional needs while working toward full regulatory compliance. The company’s focus on transparency and its efforts to provide a more detailed and trustworthy audit process are seen as key factors in achieving long-term success. Tether’s move for greater transparency, led by McWilliams, aligns with its strategy to overcome past criticism and position itself as a key player in the global financial ecosystem. The outcome of the comprehensive audit will be crucial in shaping Tether’s future and its ability to maintain trust among users and investors alike. Simon McWilliams ' expertise is expected to guide Tether through a thorough audit process, addressing concerns about transparency and boosting institutional trust. Tether's future depends on how well it can tackle transparency issues and regulatory demands. McWilliams' leadership comes at a pivotal time as Tether looks to regain its standing amidst growing skepticism and regulatory scrutiny.",,EN,0,0,USDT|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:14:54

At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.34, marking an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT predicts that XRP will climb approximately 16% to reach $2.80 by March 31, 2025. “Given the recent market trends and bullish developments surrounding XRP, a 16% increase to $2.80 by the end of March is a realistic projection,” ChatGPT stated. Several key factors support this forecast, including recent political endorsements and regulatory clarity in the United States. Trump’s Announcement Boosts XRP Sentiment A Times Tabloid report recently revealed that former U.S. President Donald Trump announced the inclusion of XRP in a newly established national cryptocurrency reserve. This move marks a major shift in U.S. policy toward digital assets, as the government officially recognizes the importance of blockchain-based financial systems. Alongside XRP, other major cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) were also included in this strategic reserve. The news sent shockwaves through the crypto market, sparking investor optimism. Following the announcement, XRP and other selected cryptocurrencies experienced a short-term price surge, reinforcing the argument that XRP has strong institutional backing and growing mainstream adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This development suggests that XRP could see further price appreciation in the coming weeks as investors digest the implications of a U.S. government-backed crypto reserve. XRP Receives Special Recognition in U.S. Federal Register Adding to the bullish outlook, another Times Tabloid report revealed that XRP received special mentions in the U.S. Federal Register . The document outlined XRP’s transactional utility and unique role in financial settlements, differentiating it from other cryptocurrencies that function primarily as stores of value. This recognition is significant because it reinforces XRP’s legitimacy in the regulatory space, reducing uncertainty for investors and institutions looking to integrate the asset into their payment systems. As regulatory clarity continues to improve, XRP could see heightened demand from financial institutions and corporate entities. Can XRP Reach $2.80 By March 31? Given these major developments, ChatGPT’s prediction of a 16% price increase to $2.80 seems increasingly plausible. The combination of government support, regulatory recognition, and increased adoption among institutions strengthens XRP’s foundation for growth. Additionally, the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining momentum. Historically, altcoins like XRP follow suit when these assets perform well. If overall market sentiment improves, XRP could quickly recover from its recent dip. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

SBI VC Trade , the crypto exchange arm of financial giant SBI Group, is making waves. They’ve just announced a groundbreaking development: the exchange has secured Japan’s first license for a stablecoin-related trading business and will be supporting USDC stablecoin starting March 12th. This is not just another listing; it’s a potential game-changer for digital currency adoption in Japan and beyond. Let’s dive into what this exciting news means for you and the crypto world. What Makes USDC Stablecoin a Key Player? Before we delve deeper into SBI VC Trade’s move, let’s understand why USDC stablecoin is garnering so much attention. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins offer a beacon of stability. Here’s a breakdown of why USDC is considered a crucial digital asset: Pegged to the US Dollar: USDC is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. This means for every USDC in circulation, there is a corresponding dollar held in reserve. This peg provides price stability, unlike the fluctuating nature of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Transparency and Trust: USDC is issued by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. They are committed to transparency, regularly publishing attestations of their reserves by reputable accounting firms. This builds trust and confidence in the stablecoin’s peg. Growing Adoption: USDC is one of the most widely adopted stablecoins globally. It’s used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, centralized exchanges, and for international remittances. Its utility is continuously expanding. Regulatory Compliance: Circle actively engages with regulators and strives for compliance. This proactive approach makes USDC a preferred choice for institutions and users concerned about regulatory clarity. In essence, USDC acts as a bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world, offering the benefits of digital currencies without the extreme price swings. This stability is vital for wider digital currency adoption , particularly in markets like Japan where regulatory compliance and stability are highly valued. SBI VC Trade Secures Landmark Stablecoin Regulation License The real newsmaker here is SBI VC Trade securing Japan’s first “stablecoin-related trading business” license. This isn’t just a procedural step; it’s a landmark achievement under Japan’s evolving stablecoin regulation . Here’s why this license is so significant: First of its Kind: This license is specifically tailored for businesses handling stablecoins and related electronic payment services. SBI VC Trade is the pioneer in obtaining this specific regulatory approval in Japan. Regulatory Green Light: Japan has been proactive in establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This license demonstrates that SBI VC Trade has met stringent requirements and is operating within the legal boundaries set by Japanese authorities. Boosts Credibility: Being licensed by Japanese regulators enhances SBI VC Trade’s credibility and trustworthiness, both domestically and internationally. It signals a commitment to operating legally and responsibly within the crypto space. Opens Doors for Innovation: This license paves the way for SBI VC Trade to offer a broader range of stablecoin-related services, potentially including payments, remittances, and DeFi integrations, further driving digital currency adoption . This regulatory victory for SBI VC Trade is a strong indicator of Japan’s progressive approach to digital assets. It suggests a willingness to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. This could set a precedent for other countries looking to establish clear stablecoin regulation frameworks. How Will This Impact the Japan Crypto Exchange Market? SBI VC Trade’s support for USDC is poised to have a ripple effect across the Japan crypto exchange market. Let’s examine the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effect Increased Trading Volume USDC is a popular trading pair. Its addition could attract more traders to SBI VC Trade, boosting overall trading volume on the exchange. Enhanced Liquidity Stablecoins like USDC enhance market liquidity by providing readily available trading pairs and facilitating faster transactions between different cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Attracting Institutional Investors Institutional investors often prefer regulated and compliant platforms. SBI VC Trade’s license and USDC support could make it more appealing to institutions looking to enter the Japanese crypto market. Competitive Pressure Other Japan crypto exchange platforms may feel pressure to also seek stablecoin licenses and list USDC or other stablecoins to remain competitive. This could lead to a broader adoption of stablecoins across the Japanese market. Broader Market Growth Increased accessibility to stablecoins like USDC can contribute to the overall growth of the Japanese cryptocurrency market by providing a stable and reliable on-ramp and off-ramp for digital assets. Essentially, SBI VC Trade’s move could be a catalyst for a more mature and robust Japan crypto exchange ecosystem, attracting both retail and institutional participants. Benefits of USDC Support on SBI VC Trade: What’s in it for You? For users and traders, the introduction of USDC on SBI VC Trade brings several tangible benefits: Stable Trading Pair: USDC provides a stable and reliable trading pair against other cryptocurrencies. This reduces the risk of volatility when moving funds in and out of crypto positions. Fiat-like On-ramp/Off-ramp: USDC can function as a near-fiat on-ramp and off-ramp. Users can easily convert Japanese Yen to USDC and vice versa (through SBI VC Trade’s services), making it easier to enter and exit the crypto market. Reduced Transaction Costs: Using USDC for transactions can sometimes be more cost-effective than using traditional banking channels, especially for international transfers. DeFi Opportunities: While specifics are yet to be announced, SBI VC Trade’s license could potentially open doors for users to access DeFi opportunities involving USDC in the future, expanding their access to decentralized financial services. Increased Confidence: Trading on a licensed platform that supports a regulated stablecoin like USDC can enhance user confidence and security in their crypto activities. In short, USDC support on SBI VC Trade offers a more stable, efficient, and potentially more versatile experience for cryptocurrency users in Japan. Navigating the Future of Stablecoins and SBI VC Trade While this news is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to consider the broader context and potential challenges: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Stablecoin regulation is still evolving globally. While Japan is taking a proactive approach, the regulatory landscape could change, potentially impacting how stablecoins are used and regulated in the future. Competition in the Stablecoin Market: USDC is not the only stablecoin. Tether (USDT) is another dominant player, and other stablecoins are emerging. Competition and market dynamics could influence the long-term success and adoption of USDC in Japan. User Education: Wider adoption of stablecoins requires user education. SBI VC Trade and other industry players will need to educate users about the benefits and risks associated with stablecoins to ensure responsible usage. Despite these considerations, SBI VC Trade’s move to support USDC is a significant step forward for the Japanese cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing legitimacy and integration of digital assets within the traditional financial system. As digital currency adoption continues to accelerate, expect to see more innovative developments in the stablecoin space and further regulatory clarity around the globe. Conclusion: A Breakthrough for Japan’s Crypto Future SBI VC Trade’s acquisition of Japan’s first stablecoin license and its decision to support USDC is more than just a news headline; it’s a breakthrough moment for the Japanese cryptocurrency industry. It signifies regulatory progress, increased market maturity, and greater accessibility to stable and reliable digital assets for users. This move not only benefits SBI VC Trade and its users but also contributes to the broader growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Japan and potentially sets a positive example for other nations. Keep an eye on March 12th – it marks the beginning of a new chapter for USDC and SBI VC Trade in the dynamic world of digital finance.

One of the most talked-about possibilities is the 0% capital gains tax on U.S.-issued cryptocurrencies. Back in January, Eric Trump reportedly confirmed that U.S.-based cryptocurrencies like XRP would be exempt from capital gains tax, while foreign crypto projects could face a 30% tax. If such a policy is implemented, it could boost the prices of key U.S.-linked cryptos like Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). Top Altcoin To Buy Before Crypto Summit Additionally, Capo Of Crypto has recently added some altcoins to his portfolio in preparation for a potential market shift, believing they could benefit from the summit’s outcomes. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): A scalable blockchain with strong U.S. ties and a promising technical setup. However, currently seeing a drop of 14% from yesterday’s high. Render (RENDER): A project focusing on AI and 3D rendering with a strong U.S. presence. With a market cap of $1.82 billion, the Render token has seen a drop of 15% making it an attractive token to buy at discounted prices. Constellation (DAG): A low-cap token with government connections that could see increased demand. After seeing continued downward pressure DAG is forming a solid bullish pattern, looking to break the $0.050 resistance. ENA (Ethena): A rising altcoin that has caught attention due to its potential growth in the market. Right now, ENA is trading at $0.35 , down 16%, with a market cap of $1.12 billion. Solana (SOL): Since Trump’s Crypto Reserve includes Solana, its price reaction will be interesting to watch. SOL is currently trading at $137.

41139302,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136567,1741080367,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Australia’s Bold Crypto Stance: No Strategic Reserve, Just Smart Regulation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/australia-crypto-regulation-stance/,"In a surprising move that has the crypto world buzzing, Australia has firmly stated it will not be creating a strategic crypto reserve. While some nations are eagerly stockpiling digital assets, the land Down Under is taking a different, perhaps more pragmatic path. Let’s dive into why Australia is prioritizing regulation over reserves and what this means for the future of crypto in the region. Are they missing out on a golden opportunity, or are they playing the long game for sustainable crypto growth? Australia Crypto Regulation: Prioritizing Stability Over Speculation Forget the image of Australia hoarding Bitcoin in a digital vault! The Australian government, under Prime Minister Albanese, is laser-focused on establishing a robust framework for Australia crypto regulation . A spokesperson for Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones clarified that, unlike some U.S. states exploring crypto reserves, Australia’s current strategy centers on carefully regulating digital asset platforms. This isn’t a rejection of crypto; it’s a strategic decision to build a secure and reliable environment for digital assets to thrive. Why this focus on regulation? Here are a few key reasons: Protecting Consumers: Regulation is paramount to safeguarding Australians from the inherent risks associated with the volatile crypto market. Clear rules and oversight can minimize fraud, scams, and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Unregulated crypto markets can pose risks to the broader financial system. Prudent digital asset regulation ensures crypto operates within established financial boundaries, preventing systemic risks. Fostering Innovation Responsibly: Australia aims to be a hub for blockchain and digital asset innovation, but not at the expense of financial stability. Regulation provides a clear pathway for innovation to flourish within a safe and compliant environment. Think of it like building a house. Some might rush to fill their house with valuable furniture (crypto reserves) before the foundation is even properly laid (regulation). Australia, on the other hand, is meticulously building a strong regulatory foundation first to ensure everything built upon it, including crypto innovation, is secure and sustainable. The Allure of Crypto Reserves: Why Some Nations Are Stockpiling The idea of a crypto reserve , particularly a Bitcoin reserve, has gained traction in certain circles. Nations and even some corporations are exploring this concept. Why? Let’s look at the potential benefits: Diversification: Crypto, especially Bitcoin, is seen by some as a hedge against inflation and a diversifier away from traditional assets like fiat currencies and bonds. Holding a crypto reserve could diversify a nation’s balance sheet. Future-Proofing: Believers in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies see reserves as a way to future-proof their nation’s finances, positioning them to benefit from the anticipated growth of the digital asset space. Technological Leadership: Nations holding crypto reserves might be perceived as being at the forefront of technological adoption, attracting crypto businesses and talent. However, the path to crypto reserves is not without its challenges. Volatility, security concerns, regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions, and the environmental impact of some cryptocurrencies are significant hurdles. Blockchain Australia: Recognizing Potential, Navigating Risks Despite opting out of a strategic reserve, the Australian government isn’t dismissing the transformative potential of blockchain and digital assets. They explicitly acknowledge the capacity of these technologies to: Drive Economic Growth: Blockchain can streamline processes, reduce costs, and create new business models across various sectors. Enhance the Financial Sector: Digital assets and blockchain can modernize payment systems, improve efficiency, and foster financial inclusion. Foster Innovation: Embracing blockchain and digital assets positions Australia as a forward-thinking nation, attracting investment and talent in cutting-edge technologies. The key is to unlock these benefits responsibly through well-crafted digital asset regulation . This approach aims to nurture innovation while mitigating the inherent risks associated with this nascent technology. Crypto Adoption: A Measured Approach in Australia So, what does Australia’s regulatory focus mean for crypto adoption in the country? It suggests a measured and sustainable approach rather than a rapid, speculative surge. Here’s what we can expect: Gradual Integration: As regulations become clearer and more comprehensive, we’ll likely see a gradual integration of crypto into the mainstream financial system and various industries in Australia. Focus on Utility: Regulation can steer crypto adoption towards practical use cases – supply chain management, secure data storage, efficient payments – rather than purely speculative investments. Increased Trust: Robust regulation can build trust and confidence in the crypto space, attracting both institutional and retail investors who prioritize security and compliance. Instead of aiming for a quick win with a volatile crypto reserve, Australia is investing in long-term, sustainable growth of the digital asset ecosystem through thoughtful regulation. This strategy may not grab immediate headlines, but it could prove to be the more prudent and ultimately more rewarding path. What’s Next for Australia’s Crypto Journey? Australia’s decision to prioritize regulation over a strategic crypto reserve signals a mature and considered approach to digital assets. It’s a recognition that the long-term success of crypto hinges not on speculative hoarding, but on building a stable, secure, and innovative ecosystem. While the allure of quick gains from crypto reserves might be tempting, Australia is betting on the power of smart regulation to unlock the true potential of blockchain and digital assets for its economy and its citizens. This bold stance could position Australia as a leader in responsible crypto innovation in the years to come.

Lee's outlook comes amid economic uncertainty as President Trump navigates his first 100 days in office. Several factors are contributing to market volatility, including the Department of Government Expenditure (DOGE) program, which imposes austerity measures that reduce public spending, and the tariff policies creating further uncertainty for businesses and investors. Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced yet another reversal in price, filling in Friday's CME gap and currently sitting at $83,000 —down over 10% this year. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has also dropped nearly 10%, with another similar decline would trigger a bear market. Lee points to Friday’s upcoming job data as a key event that could dictate short-term market direction. If the data is worse than expected, he anticipates an initial wave of panic, but Lee believes it could also prompt the Federal Reserve to accelerate interest rate cuts. Currently, the futures market is pricing in 75 basis points of cuts for this year, which would bring the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3.50%-3.75% by year-end. So far, the Fed has already implemented 100 basis points worth of cuts in this cycle. Lee also addressed bitcoin’s struggles, noting that its recent downturn is not driven by negative news but rather by cyclical market forces. He sees a potential short-term price target of $62,000 but still see's bitcoin finishing over $150,000 by end of the year.

But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 10 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.0025, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication.

Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Avalanche: The Eco-Friendly Blockchain That’s Changing the Game Avalanche, or AVAX, is making waves in the blockchain world. It’s an eco-friendly platform known for low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Processing up to 4,500 transactions per second and finalizing them in under two seconds, it outpaces many competitors. A standout feature is its customizable Subnets, allowing users to create their own tailored blockchain networks. Its three interconnected chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—work together smoothly, handling everything from simple transactions to complex smart contracts. In today’s market, AVAX is catching the eye of those looking for innovative and practical solutions. Its hybrid consensus mechanism blends classical and Nakamoto methods, offering both security and speed—a combination that’s rare among cryptocurrencies. The AVAX token plays a vital role, not just in transactions but also in securing the network through staking and powering the Subnets. As the blockchain space grows more competitive, platforms like Avalanche that offer scalability, speed, and eco-friendly operations are standing out. With a shift towards sustainable and efficient technology, AVAX seems poised to make a significant impact. Chainlink: Bridging the Gap Between Blockchain and Real World Data Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts connect with real-world data. Smart contracts are digital agreements on the blockchain, but they often can’t access data outside their network. Chainlink solves this by using oracles, which are like trusted messengers that bring external information to the blockchain. It ensures the data is accurate by using a reputation system, so smart contracts get reliable information. This makes them more useful because they can interact with real-world events and applications. In the current market, technologies that enhance blockchain functionality are gaining attention. Chainlink stands out by focusing on connecting blockchains with external data sources. Its LINK token is important because it rewards those who provide data and helps keep the network secure through staking. As more industries look to use blockchain technology that interacts with real-world data, Chainlink’s approach could become increasingly valuable. Compared to other cryptocurrencies that focus solely on transactions or finance, Chainlink offers a service that expands what blockchain can do. This trend of integrating blockchain with real-world applications is something many are watching closely in the crypto market. Conclusion While AVAX and LINK are strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) could surpass them by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for significant growth during the current bull run.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors keenly observing global economic shifts, this development carries substantial implications for market volatility and the broader financial landscape. Let’s delve into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for you. Decoding China Tariffs: What’s Happening? On March 4th, Beijing declared its response to recently imposed U.S. tariffs by implementing its own levies ranging from 10 to 15 percent on a range of American agricultural and food products. This move isn’t just about tariffs; China has also placed export and investment restrictions on 25 U.S. companies, signaling a multifaceted approach to counter what it perceives as protectionist measures from Washington. This reciprocal action immediately raises concerns about a deepening trade war impact and its cascading effects on the global economy. Why are China Tariffs Increasing? The increase in China tariffs is a direct reaction to new tariffs imposed by the United States. This tit-for-tat escalation is characteristic of a trade war, where each nation responds to the other’s trade barriers with countermeasures. The core reasons behind this escalating trade tension can be summarized as: Reciprocal Retaliation: China frames these tariffs as a necessary response to protect its own economic interests in the face of U.S. trade policies. Economic Leverage: Tariffs are used as a tool to exert economic pressure and negotiate trade agreements more favorably. Protecting Domestic Industries: Both nations aim to protect their domestic industries from foreign competition through these measures, although the long-term effects can be complex and often detrimental to consumers and businesses. Impact on the Global Economy The imposition of China tariffs and subsequent restrictions on U.S. firms has far-reaching implications for the global economy. Here’s a breakdown of the potential impacts: Area of Impact Potential Consequence Agricultural and Food Sectors U.S. farmers and food producers face reduced access to the Chinese market, potentially leading to surpluses, decreased prices domestically, and financial strain. Chinese consumers may face higher prices or reduced availability of certain U.S. products. U.S. Companies The 25 U.S. firms facing export and investment restrictions could experience significant business disruptions, revenue losses, and challenges in maintaining their global operations. Supply Chains Global supply chains, already strained by various factors, could face further disruptions as businesses scramble to adjust to the new trade barriers. This can lead to increased costs and delays in production and delivery of goods. Market Volatility Financial markets are likely to react to these developments with increased volatility. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies often leads to investor anxiety, impacting stock markets, currency values, and potentially the cryptocurrency market as well. Geopolitical Relations Escalating trade disputes can strain broader geopolitical relations between the U.S. and China, impacting international cooperation on various fronts. Trade War Impact: A Deeper Dive The term “trade war” is often used to describe a situation of escalating trade tensions between countries. This scenario typically involves: Increased Tariffs: Countries impose tariffs on each other’s goods, making imports more expensive. Retaliatory Measures: Affected countries respond with their own tariffs and trade restrictions, leading to a cycle of escalation. Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars create uncertainty for businesses, investors, and consumers, impacting economic growth and stability. Disrupted Trade Flows: The flow of goods and services between countries is disrupted, altering established trade patterns. The current situation with China tariffs and U.S. responses certainly fits the description of an escalating trade dispute, with potential to morph into a full-blown trade war if not managed carefully. Market Volatility and Cryptocurrencies For those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding market volatility is paramount. Traditional financial markets often react strongly to geopolitical and economic uncertainties, and these reactions can spill over into the crypto market. Here’s how: Risk-Off Sentiment: Increased trade tensions can trigger a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets. Investors may move away from perceived riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies towards safer havens like government bonds or gold. Currency Fluctuations: Trade disputes can lead to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or the Chinese Yuan can impact the cryptocurrency market, which is often priced in USD. Economic Slowdown Concerns: A trade war impact can lead to concerns about a global economic slowdown. In such scenarios, investors might become more cautious across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Safe Haven Narrative: Conversely, some argue that in times of economic uncertainty, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be seen as a safe haven asset, uncorrelated to traditional markets. However, empirical evidence for this is still developing, and market reactions can be unpredictable. Navigating the Uncertainties: Actionable Insights Given the evolving situation with China tariffs and the potential for increased market volatility, what steps can you take? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in the trade dispute and their potential economic consequences. Reliable news sources and financial analysis are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile times. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s in crypto or traditional assets. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategies accordingly. Consider using risk management tools like stop-loss orders if you are actively trading. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market volatility is often a short-term phenomenon. Maintain a long-term perspective on your investments and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market swings. Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, especially in uncertain market conditions. Conclusion: Urgent Need for Global Trade Resolution The escalating trade tensions marked by increased China tariffs and restrictions on U.S. companies represent a significant challenge to the global economy. The potential for prolonged trade disputes and a full-blown trade war is a serious concern, with implications ranging from disrupted supply chains to increased market volatility. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macroeconomic factors is essential for navigating market uncertainties and making informed decisions. The situation underscores the interconnectedness of the global economy and the urgent need for diplomatic solutions to trade disputes to ensure stability and growth.

Recent data reveals a concerning pattern: U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have experienced a significant net outflow of $12.1 million on March 3rd. This marks the eighth consecutive trading day of net outflows, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment and prompting crucial questions about the future trajectory of the ETH ETF market . Let’s delve into the details of this intriguing development and understand what it might mean for the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Recent Ethereum ETF Outflows: What’s Happening? According to data from Farside Investors, a financial information platform closely monitoring ETF flows, the cumulative net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs reached $12.1 million on March 3rd. This figure represents the combined activity across all listed spot ETH ETFs in the United States. To break it down further: BlackRock’s ETHA: This ETF recorded a substantial net outflow of $16.1 million. This is noteworthy as BlackRock is a major player in the ETF space, and their ETF performance often reflects broader market trends. Bitwise’s ETHW: In contrast to the general outflow trend, Bitwise’s ETHW ETF experienced a net inflow of $4 million. This positive inflow amidst overall outflows could indicate specific investor interest in Bitwise’s offering or a divergence in investment strategies. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings on March 3rd. This suggests a mixed bag of investor reactions, with some ETFs experiencing outflows while others remained stable. To better visualize the situation, here’s a table summarizing the ETF flows on March 3rd: ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Flow (USD Million) BlackRock ETHA -16.1 Bitwise ETHW +4.0 Other ETFs Various 0.0 Total Net Flow -12.1 Why are we seeing consecutive ETH ETF Outflows? Understanding Crypto Investment Trends Eight consecutive days of net outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs raise eyebrows and prompt us to ask: what’s driving this trend? Several factors could be at play, reflecting broader crypto investment trends and market dynamics: Profit Taking: After a period of price appreciation in Ethereum and the broader crypto market, some investors might be taking profits. Selling ETF holdings could be a part of this profit-taking strategy. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Periods of uncertainty or price corrections can lead investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, triggering outflows from ETFs. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as interest rate hikes or inflation concerns, can influence investor sentiment towards all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Uncertainty in the macroeconomic landscape can lead to risk aversion and outflows from crypto ETFs. Rotation into other Assets: Investors might be reallocating their capital from Ethereum ETFs into other asset classes that they perceive as more attractive at the moment. This could include other cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, or even traditional commodities. ETF Maturity and Market Dynamics: As spot Ethereum ETFs are relatively new products, the market is still finding its equilibrium. Initial excitement and inflows might be followed by periods of adjustment and outflows as the market matures. Spot Ethereum ETFs: Benefits and Challenges in the Digital Asset Outflows Scenario Spot Ethereum ETFs were hailed as a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption, offering both benefits and challenges, especially when we observe digital asset outflows . Let’s examine both sides of the coin: Benefits of Spot Ethereum ETFs: Accessibility and Convenience: ETFs provide traditional investors with an easy and regulated way to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the digital asset. This lowers the barrier to entry and broadens the investor base. Liquidity and Transparency: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and price transparency. This is a significant advantage compared to directly holding and trading Ethereum on crypto exchanges. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, providing investors with a level of security and investor protection not always available in the decentralized crypto world. Diversification: ETFs allow investors to diversify their portfolios by including exposure to Ethereum alongside traditional assets, potentially enhancing risk-adjusted returns. Challenges Highlighted by Digital Asset Outflows: Market Volatility Amplification: While ETFs offer access, they can also amplify market volatility. Large inflows and outflows can exacerbate price swings in the underlying asset, as seen with the current digital asset outflows . Tracking Error: ETFs aim to track the price of Ethereum, but there can be tracking errors due to ETF operating costs, market inefficiencies, and other factors. This can lead to slight deviations between the ETF’s performance and the actual price of Ethereum. Centralization Concerns: While providing regulated access, ETFs are inherently centralized products. This contrasts with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies and might not appeal to all crypto enthusiasts. Fees and Expenses: ETFs charge management fees and other expenses, which can erode returns over time compared to directly holding Ethereum. Navigating the ETH ETF Market: Actionable Insights So, what can investors and market observers glean from these recent Ethereum ETF outflows ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor ETF Flows Closely: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF flow data from sources like Farside Investors. Significant and sustained outflows can be an indicator of shifting market sentiment. Consider Broader Market Context: Don’t just focus on ETF flows in isolation. Analyze them in the context of broader crypto market trends, macroeconomic factors, and news events that could be influencing investor behavior. Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio: Relying solely on Ethereum ETFs for crypto exposure might not be optimal. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio across different assets and investment strategies. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies and crypto ETFs are inherently volatile. Ensure your investment decisions align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Stay updated on market developments, regulatory changes, and technological advancements to make informed investment decisions and navigate the ETH ETF market effectively. Conclusion: A Cautious Outlook on Ethereum ETF Market? The recent $12.1 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs , marking eight consecutive days of outflows, is a noteworthy development in the evolving crypto investment landscape. While Bitwise’s ETHW saw inflows, the overall trend suggests a cautious sentiment among investors, potentially driven by profit-taking, market volatility, or broader macroeconomic uncertainties. Understanding the dynamics of digital asset outflows and the nuances of the ETH ETF market is crucial for investors navigating this exciting yet complex asset class. As the market matures, monitoring these trends and adapting investment strategies will be key to success in the world of cryptocurrency ETFs.

RSI and MACD indicate bearish momentum, limiting chances of an immediate rebound. Futures trading declines, but options market surges, signaling potential volatility ahead. XRP has seen a sharp price decline, dropping 12.47% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is now trading at $2.32 after falling from a recent high of $2.6495.

Bitcoin Has A Major Supply Wall Between $95,400 & $98,200 In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed about how the various BTC price ranges are looking in terms of on-chain resistance and support. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance range is assumed to lie in the amount of supply that was last purchased/transacted by investors at price levels falling in said range. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As Bitcoin & Altcoins Bounce Back That is, strong support/resistance ranges carry the cost basis of a large number of addresses. The reason behind this is that to any investor, their break-even level is naturally a special level, so when retests of it happen, they are probable to make some kind of move. Holders who were in loss prior to such a retest may be tempted to sell, as they would at least recoup all of their investment. Investors who were in profit, however, may decide to buy more instead, as they could believe the same acquisition level would end up paying off again in the future. Naturally, just a few investors showing this buying/selling would have no effects on the cryptocurrency’s price, so the range would need to contain the cost basis of a significant amount of addresses if it has to act as a resistance or support boundary. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows how the Bitcoin supply is distributed at ranges around the current spot price: In the graph, the size of the dot correlates to the amount of coins that the investors purchased inside the corresponding range. It would appear that one range ahead of the current price particularly stands out in terms of the size of its dot: $95,400 to $98,200. At these price levels, around 2.29 million addresses purchased a total of 1.66 million tokens. Given that the range is above the asset’s price at the moment, all of these investors would be in the red.

It now remains to be seen whether demand would be enough to outpace these potential sellers, if BTC can rally far enough to retest this range. BTC Price Bitcoin neared the $95,000 level during the latest price rally, but it seems its price has since faced a retrace as it’s now back to $90,700.

Solomon, who was speaking at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney on Tuesday, mentioned risks to global trade policies and how those risks could affect economic growth. Judge grants Trump’s request to delay civil fraud trial President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico effective immediately, the White House announced Monday. Tariffs on Chinese imports will rise from 10% to 20% after China failed to stop the shipment of fentanyl into the U.S. These moves have also fueled fresh volatility in equity and bond markets as investors assess their possible impact on global trade and growth. Solomon recognized the economic risks associated with those policies, but he emphasized that they don’t necessarily indicate a looming economic recession.

Congress Centre – Aspen 2. Copyright by World Economic Forum/Sandra Blaser. David Solomon said at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney that there are trade imbalances and that the president is aggressively taking action to level the playing field. He added that Trump is executing this view. Business leaders express cautious optimism Solomon has also tried to remain cautiously optimistic despite some market analysts’ warnings about potential economic headwinds. He noted that business executives are acutely attuned to the impact of trade policies and the state of credit markets. He also noted that the economy has been without a conventional credit cycle for more than a decade, resulting in an accumulation of excess. While it may not be an immediate threat, he noted that people need to look ahead and recognize the increasingly interconnected nature of financial systems. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of Blackstone Inc., spoke at the same conference. Schwarzman cited a quarterly survey by Blackstone of the 250 companies it owns, none of whose executives expect a recession this year. “The U.S. economy remains in good shape,” he declared. Despite Solomon’s optimism, some economists have been warning about stagflation — a scenario when high inflation continues while growth slows. In a report, Business Insider wrote that prolonged inflationary pressure and higher interest rates are expected to inhibit economic momentum, especially if spending among consumers weakens. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, also recently took a more sober view of the economy. He added that there are still geopolitical risks, inflationary pressures, and the potential for all kinds of disruptions from global trade conflicts. Although the U.S. economy is holding steady, the long-term effects of Trump’s hardline trade policies are unknown. Market analysts will converge on how businesses have adjusted to the changing trade landscape. Solomon said that investors should stay alert and mindful of changing credit cycles and market dynamics. “The trick is understanding how all the pieces talk to each other,” he added.

Has the Expected Support Arrived?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/industry-leaders-talk-about-trump-adding-xrp-sol-and-ada-to-us-crypto-reserves-has-the-expected-support-arrived/,"US President Donald Trump made a surprise announcement on Sunday about the creation of a national strategic reserve. At this point, Trump announced on Sunday that he plans to establish a reserve that includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Trump claimed that this move will allow the US to become the Cryptocurrency Capital of the world. Although the announcement was initially met with enthusiasm by markets, they cooled on Monday amid concerns about its implications. While the addition of other altcoins to the reserve besides Bitcoin and Ethereum was criticized, industry experts argued that the altcoins in question lacked the developer activity and decentralization features present in BTC and ETH. Nic Carter, General Partner at Castle Island Ventures, criticized Trump’s decision on XRP, ADA, and SOL, saying, “The government’s job is not to run a fake crypto hedge fund. It’s not their job to pick winners and losers.” Ethereum and Solana Make Sense Apart from Bitcoin! SPACE ID senior manager Harrison Seletsky said he supports Trump’s diversified crypto reserve plan but that the choices are wrong. Seletsky said that Ethereum and Solana’s inclusion in the reserve makes sense given their strong and growing developer activity. However, the famous name, who argued that it does not make sense to include XRP and ADA in the reserve, said that XRP and ADA have smaller TVL than ETH and SOL. “In my eyes, the inclusion of XRP and ADA in the reserve delegitimizes the idea of including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which are the mainstays of the industry, in the reserve.” Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime Digital Assets, also criticized the inclusion of XRP, ADA, and SOL in the reserves, saying that these are tech companies that happen to own cryptocurrencies. “These altcoins are very centralized and the sense of ownership is very intense. These altcoins are constantly changing and adapting to the market, whereas Bitcoin is a decentralized product with no owner or control group and is more similar to gold.” Trump Did It For His Own Token! Jean Rausis, co-founder of DeFi platform SMARDEX, shared the same opinion, while stating that Trump's XRP, ADA, SOL announcement was not planned. “The announcement of the US crypto reserve, which will include XRP, SOL, and ADA, is a clear sign that President Trump is trying to pump his own money. There is no benefit to having these assets in the strategic reserve. “It is clear that Bitcoin and Ethereum are much more suitable for reserves, but BTC and ETH are touted as afterthoughts.” Only Bitcoins! As a result, industry leaders have argued that Bitcoin and Ethereum make more sense for the US national reserve. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsely argued that it was only right to include Bitcoin: “I had imagined the Strategic Reserve would just be Bitcoin. That makes the most sense to me. Many crypto assets have value, but we're talking about a reserve here, not a US investment portfolio. That's why Bitcoin is arguably the best store of value in the digital age.” *This is not investment advice.

41139441,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136526,1741080730,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Tax Reality Check: Cochran Debunks Trump’s Unilateral Power,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-tax-trump-cochran-reality/,"Is the crypto community buzzing with excitement about potential tax relief? Rumors swirled recently, fueled by whispers from digital asset circles, suggesting that former President Donald Trump might be considering a dramatic move: abolishing the crypto capital gains tax. The prospect of such a change, especially with a White House summit on the horizon, ignited hopes among crypto investors eager for friendlier tax policies. But before you start celebrating tax-free crypto profits, a crucial voice of reason has stepped in to temper expectations and inject a dose of reality into the conversation. Decoding the Crypto Capital Gains Tax Debate The heart of the matter lies in understanding who actually holds the power to change tax laws in the United States. Adam Cochran, a respected figure in the blockchain space and founder of Cinneamhain Ventures, took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify a critical point: President Trump, or any U.S. President for that matter, cannot unilaterally wave a magic wand and eliminate the crypto capital gains tax . This isn’t a matter of presidential decree; it’s a matter of legislative authority. Cochran’s comments directly addressed speculation ignited by Mike Alfred, founder of Eaglebrook Advisors, who hinted at a potential push for tax elimination at an upcoming White House summit on March 7th. While Alfred’s suggestion sparked enthusiasm, Cochran’s expert opinion serves as a vital reminder of the checks and balances within the U.S. government. Why Congress, Not Trump, Holds the Tax Law Key To grasp why Cochran’s statement carries weight, it’s essential to understand the fundamental structure of U.S. lawmaking. Tax laws are not presidential prerogatives; they are the domain of the legislative branch, Congress. Here’s a breakdown: Legislative Authority: In the U.S. system, Congress is explicitly granted the power to create and amend tax laws. This power is enshrined in the Constitution, ensuring that significant financial policies are debated and decided upon by elected representatives. Presidential Role: The President’s role in the legislative process is primarily to sign bills into law or veto them. While a President can certainly propose tax reforms and advocate for them, they cannot bypass Congress to enact these changes single-handedly. Checks and Balances: This separation of powers is a cornerstone of American democracy, designed to prevent any single branch of government from becoming too powerful. It ensures that major policy changes, like tax law amendments, require broad consensus and deliberation. The Reality of Tax Reform: Amending the tax law , including the rules surrounding crypto capital gains, is a complex legislative process. It involves drafting bills, committee hearings, debates in both the House and the Senate, and ultimately, a vote in both chambers. Therefore, while President Trump (or any president) can express intentions or desires regarding tax policy, actual changes to the crypto capital gains tax necessitate Congressional action. Cochran’s statement isn’t about downplaying the potential for future tax reforms; it’s about grounding expectations in the reality of how U.S. law is made. The Implications for Crypto Investors: Navigating the Tax Landscape So, what does this mean for crypto investors navigating the often-murky waters of taxation? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Don’t Bank on Unilateral Action: While presidential support for crypto-friendly policies is valuable, don’t assume that a president can unilaterally alter existing tax law . Focus on legislative developments and Congressional actions. Stay Informed About Legislative Efforts: Keep an eye on legislative proposals related to cryptocurrency taxation. Organizations like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center often track and advocate for sensible crypto tax policies. Engage with Policymakers: Advocacy matters. Contact your elected representatives to voice your opinions on crypto taxation. Grassroots movements can influence legislative priorities. Plan for Current Tax Regulations: For now, the crypto capital gains tax remains in effect. Ensure you understand your tax obligations and maintain accurate records of your crypto transactions. Consult with a tax professional specializing in cryptocurrency for personalized advice. Focus on Long-Term Policy Changes: Meaningful and lasting changes to crypto taxation will likely come through legislative reforms. Support initiatives aimed at creating a clearer and more favorable tax framework for digital assets through Congressional action. Could Tax Reform Still Be on the Horizon? While unilateral presidential action is off the table, the conversation around crypto capital gains tax reform is far from over. Here’s what to consider: Presidential Influence: Even without unilateral power, a president can significantly influence the legislative agenda. If President Trump were to actively advocate for crypto tax reform, it could increase the likelihood of Congress taking up the issue. Political Will: The political climate plays a crucial role. Growing bipartisan interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology could create an environment more conducive to tax reform. Economic Arguments: Arguments for crypto tax reform often center on promoting innovation, attracting investment, and keeping the U.S. competitive in the global digital economy. These economic considerations can sway policymakers. Stakeholder Engagement: The crypto industry, advocacy groups, and individual investors all have a role to play in pushing for tax reform. Consistent and informed engagement with policymakers is key. The Bottom Line: Navigating Crypto Tax Realities Adam Cochran’s clarification serves as a vital reality check in the often-hyped world of crypto news. While the prospect of immediate crypto capital gains tax abolition by presidential decree is wishful thinking, the broader conversation around sensible crypto taxation remains important. True and lasting change will require navigating the legislative process and engaging with Congress. For crypto investors, the message is clear: stay informed, understand the legal landscape, and focus on supporting policy initiatives that promote a fair and innovative future for digital assets. Don’t get swept away by rumors; focus on the facts and the legislative path to potential tax reform.

41139464,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136517,1741080893,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Asian Currencies Plunge as Trump Tariffs Loom,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asian-currencies-trump-tariffs/,"Are you watching the forex markets closely? If you are invested in or keeping an eye on Asian Currencies , you need to pay attention. A significant shift is underway in the global currency landscape, and it’s directly linked to the resurgence of trade tensions fueled by potential Trump tariffs. Let’s dive into why Asian Currencies are currently under pressure and what it means for the broader Currency Market . Why Are Asian Currencies Retreating? The Trump Tariff Effect The primary driver behind the current weakness in Asian Currencies is the increasing anticipation of new tariffs being imposed by former US President Donald Trump, should he return to office. His previous administration was marked by aggressive trade policies, and the mere prospect of a return to these policies is sending ripples through the global financial markets. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Fear of Trade Wars: Trump’s “America First” approach often involved unilateral tariff impositions, which historically led to retaliatory measures from other countries, effectively sparking trade wars. This uncertainty and potential disruption are making investors nervous about economies heavily reliant on exports, particularly in Asia. Dollar Strength as a Safe Haven: In times of global economic uncertainty or heightened risk aversion, the US Dollar tends to strengthen. Investors flock to the dollar as a safe haven asset, perceiving it as less risky compared to emerging market currencies. The threat of Trump Tariffs is injecting uncertainty into the global trade outlook, thus boosting demand for the US Dollar . Impact on Asian Economies: Many Asian Currencies are tied to economies that are heavily dependent on international trade, especially with the United States. Tariffs can significantly impact their export competitiveness, reduce economic growth, and subsequently weaken their currencies. Capital Outflows: As investors become wary of the potential negative impacts of Trump Tariffs on Asian economies, we are seeing capital outflows from these regions. Investors may move their funds to what they perceive as safer or more stable markets, further weakening Asian Currencies . The Steady Rise of the US Dollar: A Pillar of Strength Amidst Uncertainty While Asian Currencies are facing headwinds, the US Dollar is exhibiting remarkable steadiness. This isn’t just a passive stability; it’s a proactive strengthening driven by several factors: Safe Haven Demand: As mentioned earlier, the US Dollar benefits from its safe-haven status during periods of global economic unease. The looming Trump Tariffs and the associated trade tensions are creating exactly this kind of environment, driving investors towards the dollar. Strong US Economic Data: Relatively robust economic data from the United States, including employment figures and inflation indicators, supports the US Dollar . A stronger US economy makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Federal Reserve Policies: The monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve also plays a crucial role. While future rate cuts are anticipated, the current relatively higher interest rates in the US compared to some other developed economies make the US Dollar more appealing for yield-seeking investors. Geopolitical Stability (Relatively): Compared to many other regions facing geopolitical risks, the United States is often perceived as a relatively stable geopolitical environment, further enhancing the attractiveness of the US Dollar . Which Asian Currencies Are Most Affected? Not all Asian Currencies are reacting uniformly to the tariff threats. Some are experiencing more pronounced declines than others. Here’s a look at some of the currencies most under pressure: Chinese Yuan (CNY): As the world’s second-largest economy and a major trading partner of the US, China and its currency, the Yuan, are highly sensitive to US-China Trade Tensions . Any escalation in tariffs directly impacts the Chinese economy and the Yuan. South Korean Won (KRW): South Korea is another export-oriented economy heavily reliant on global trade. The Won is often seen as a bellwether for Asian economic sentiment and is susceptible to fluctuations based on trade policy developments. Taiwanese Dollar (TWD): Similar to South Korea, Taiwan’s economy is deeply integrated into global supply chains, and the Taiwanese Dollar is vulnerable to trade-related shocks. Singapore Dollar (SGD): Although Singapore is a highly developed economy, its currency is also affected by regional economic sentiment and trade flows, making it sensitive to broader Trade Tensions in Asia. Emerging Southeast Asian Currencies: Currencies like the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR), and Thai Baht (THB) can also be impacted, though potentially to varying degrees, depending on their specific trade exposures and economic fundamentals. It’s important to note that the extent of the impact can vary based on the specific details of any tariffs imposed, the retaliatory measures taken, and the overall global economic conditions at the time. Navigating the Currency Market Amidst Trump Tariff Uncertainty: What Should You Watch For? For those involved in the Currency Market , whether as traders, investors, or businesses with international exposure, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Here are some actionable insights and key factors to monitor: Trump’s Political Statements: Pay close attention to statements and policy announcements from Donald Trump and his campaign regarding trade and tariffs. These pronouncements can be leading indicators of potential market movements. US Trade Policy Developments: Monitor official US trade policy announcements, reports, and any legislative actions related to tariffs and trade agreements. Asian Economic Data: Keep an eye on economic data releases from major Asian economies, such as GDP growth, export figures, and manufacturing indices. Weakening economic data could further pressure Asian Currencies . Central Bank Actions: Watch for any interventions or policy responses from central banks in Asian countries. They may attempt to stabilize their currencies or mitigate the economic impact of trade tensions. Global Risk Sentiment: Overall global risk sentiment will continue to play a significant role. Events that heighten risk aversion will likely further strengthen the US Dollar and weigh on Asian Currencies . The Broader Implications of Trade Tensions The retreat of Asian Currencies and the strengthening of the US Dollar due to potential Trump Tariffs are not isolated events. They are symptoms of broader shifts in the global economic and political landscape. Here are some wider implications to consider: Aspect Implication Global Supply Chains Increased tariffs could further disrupt global supply chains, leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Companies may need to re-evaluate their sourcing and production strategies. Inflationary Pressures Tariffs can contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing the cost of imported goods. This could prompt central banks to adjust their monetary policies, potentially leading to higher interest rates in some economies. Geopolitical Risks Trade Tensions often exacerbate geopolitical risks. Strained trade relationships can spill over into other areas of international relations, increasing global instability. Emerging Markets Vulnerability Emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia heavily reliant on exports, are especially vulnerable to trade wars. Currency weakness, capital outflows, and reduced economic growth can pose significant challenges. Investment Strategies Investors may need to adjust their portfolios to account for increased volatility and uncertainty in currency and equity markets. Diversification and risk management become even more critical in this environment. Is This a Buying Opportunity? Or a Warning Sign? For some, the current weakness in Asian Currencies might present a buying opportunity. If you believe that the tariff threats are overblown or that Asian economies will prove resilient, then buying Asian Currencies at lower levels could be a strategic move. However, it’s equally important to recognize the risks. The potential for escalating Trade Tensions and a prolonged period of uncertainty should not be underestimated. Consider these questions: How likely are significant Trump Tariffs to be implemented? What would be the scale and scope of these tariffs? How resilient are Asian Currencies and economies to trade shocks? What are the potential retaliatory measures from affected countries? What is your risk tolerance and investment horizon? Answering these questions will help you determine whether the current situation represents an opportunity or a warning sign for your investment strategy. Conclusion: Navigating the Turbulent Waters of Global Currencies The current retreat of Asian Currencies against a steady US Dollar , driven by the specter of Trump Tariffs , underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and the profound impact of trade policy on Currency Market dynamics. Understanding these forces is essential for anyone operating in or observing the global financial landscape. As we move forward, vigilance and a nuanced understanding of geopolitical and economic developments will be key to navigating these potentially turbulent waters. The situation is fluid, and staying informed is your best defense and potentially your greatest advantage.

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, just dropped some exciting news that’s set to shake up the crypto index fund landscape. They’ve announced the addition of five new digital assets to their Coin50 Index. This move isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant expansion that could offer fresh opportunities for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolio and tap into broader crypto market trends . Let’s dive into what this means for you and the wider crypto sphere. What’s the Buzz About Coinbase Coin50 Index? For those new to the concept, the Coinbase Coin50 Index is designed to mirror the performance of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Think of it as a benchmark for the broader crypto market, similar to how the S&P 500 functions in traditional finance. It’s a market capitalization-weighted index, meaning that cryptocurrencies with larger market caps have a greater influence on the index’s overall movement. Coinbase also offers perpetual futures trading linked to this index, providing traders with sophisticated tools to engage with the broader crypto market. Here’s a quick rundown of why the Coin50 Index matters: Broad Market Exposure: It offers diversified exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Benchmark Performance: It serves as a performance benchmark for the overall crypto market, allowing investors to gauge market sentiment and trends. Investment Tool: With futures trading available, it’s not just an index for tracking; it’s also a tool for active trading and portfolio management. Which New Crypto Listings Are Joining the Coin50 Party? The five new digital assets joining the Coin50 Index are: Pepe (PEPE): The memecoin sensation that took the crypto world by storm. dogwifhat (WIF): Another popular memecoin, known for its Shiba Inu dog with a hat. Compound (COMP): A decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that facilitates lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies. Aptos (APT): A layer-1 blockchain focused on scalability and security, aiming to be a fast and reliable platform for decentralized applications. Aerodrome (AERO): A decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Base network, designed for efficient and low-cost trading. Why is Coinbase Expanding the Coin50 Index Now? Coinbase’s decision to add these new crypto listings to the Coin50 Index is likely driven by several factors: Market Evolution: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Including newer, trending assets like PEPE and WIF reflects the dynamic nature of the space and ensures the index remains relevant and representative. DeFi Growth: The inclusion of COMP and AERO highlights the growing importance of DeFi within the crypto ecosystem. These assets represent established and emerging players in decentralized finance. Layer-1 Innovation: Adding APT signifies the continued interest in and development of layer-1 blockchains that aim to solve scalability and efficiency issues. Investor Demand: Coinbase likely sees investor demand for exposure to a broader range of cryptocurrencies, including those that have gained significant traction recently. Benefits of Diversifying with Crypto Index Funds Like Coin50 Investing in crypto index funds , such as those linked to the Coin50 Index, can offer several compelling benefits: Diversification: The most significant advantage is instant diversification. Instead of betting on a single cryptocurrency, you’re spreading your investment across 50 assets, reducing risk associated with individual asset volatility. Simplicity: Index funds simplify crypto investing. You don’t need to research and pick individual coins; the index does the asset selection and weighting for you based on market capitalization. Passive Investment: Index investing is largely passive. The index is rebalanced periodically (Coinbase rebalances Coin50 quarterly), so you don’t need to actively manage your portfolio daily. Cost-Effectiveness: Compared to actively managed crypto funds, index funds typically have lower expense ratios, making them a cost-effective way to gain broad market exposure. Exposure to Market Growth: By tracking the top 50 cryptos, you’re positioned to benefit from the overall growth of the crypto market. As the market cap of the top cryptos increases, so should the value of the index. Let’s visualize the diversification power of crypto index funds in a table: Investment Approach Diversification Level Research Effort Management Style Potential Risk Single Cryptocurrency Low Moderate Active High (Asset-Specific) Top 10 Cryptos Portfolio Medium Moderate Active/Passive Medium Coinbase Coin50 Index High Low Passive Lower (Market-Based) Navigating the Crypto Market Trends with Coin50 Staying ahead of crypto market trends is crucial in the fast-paced world of digital assets. The Coinbase Coin50 Index can be a valuable tool for this. By tracking its performance, investors can gain insights into: Market Sentiment: The overall direction of the index reflects the general sentiment towards the broader crypto market. An upward trend suggests bullish sentiment, while a downward trend indicates bearishness. Sector Performance: Analyzing the performance of individual assets within the Coin50 Index can reveal which sectors of the crypto market are currently outperforming or underperforming (e.g., DeFi, memecoins, layer-1s). Emerging Trends: The inclusion of new assets in the index can signal emerging trends and growing investor interest in specific types of cryptocurrencies or blockchain technologies. Risk Assessment: Monitoring the volatility of the Coin50 Index can help investors assess the overall risk level in the crypto market at any given time. Are There Challenges to Consider with Crypto Index Investing? While crypto index funds offer numerous benefits, it’s essential to be aware of potential challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Even with diversification, index funds are still subject to overall market swings. Index Composition: The Coin50 Index is market cap-weighted. This means that a few large cryptocurrencies can heavily influence the index’s performance. Changes in the top crypto rankings can significantly impact the index. Rebalancing Frequency: Coinbase rebalances the Coin50 Index quarterly. This means that the index’s composition may not always perfectly reflect the very latest market trends, especially in a rapidly evolving market. Fees and Tracking Error: While generally cost-effective, index funds still have expense ratios. Additionally, there can be a slight tracking error, meaning the fund’s performance may not exactly mirror the index’s performance. Regulatory Risks: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the crypto market as a whole and, consequently, crypto index funds. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Research the New Assets: Familiarize yourself with PEPE, WIF, COMP, APT, and AERO. Understand their use cases, tokenomics, and potential risks before considering them as part of your investment strategy. Explore Coin50 Futures: If you’re an experienced trader, consider exploring Coinbase’s perpetual futures linked to the Coin50 Index. This can offer opportunities for hedging or leveraged trading (but be mindful of the risks involved in futures trading). Assess Portfolio Diversification: Evaluate your current crypto portfolio. Is it sufficiently diversified? Could a crypto index fund like Coin50 be a suitable addition to enhance diversification? Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with crypto market trends and developments. Monitor the performance of the Coin50 Index and the assets within it to make informed investment decisions. Consider Risk Tolerance: Crypto investing is inherently risky. Ensure that investing in crypto index funds aligns with your risk tolerance and overall financial goals. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Crypto Index Investing Coinbase’s addition of PEPE, WIF, COMP, APT, and AERO to the Coin50 Index is more than just a routine update. It’s a significant move that reflects the evolving nature of the crypto market and the growing demand for diversified investment options. By expanding the index to include these trending and innovative assets, Coinbase is providing investors with even broader exposure to the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or just starting your journey, understanding the Coin50 Index and its constituents can be a valuable step in navigating the dynamic crypto landscape.

This move comes amid a wave of staffing changes within the regulator, signaling a potential shift in its approach to crypto enforcement. According to a March 4 Bloomberg report , the SEC sent an internal email outlining the “voluntary separation incentive” or “voluntary early retirement program.” The memo, dated February 28, was issued by SEC Chief Operating Officer Ken Johnson, inviting employees to apply for the incentive by March 21. To qualify, employees must have been on the SEC payroll before January 24 and must voluntarily exit the agency through resignation, transfer, or retirement. The memo also specifies that those who accept the incentive cannot return to the SEC for at least five years, or they must repay the entire bonus. Federal Workforce Faces Restructuring The SEC’s voluntary resignation program aligns with a broader effort by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , to downsize federal agencies. According to Reuters, DOGE has already cut more than 100,000 positions across the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce through layoffs and buyouts. The SEC has not provided an official reason for the staff reductions, but speculation is growing that the regulator is shifting its focus away from aggressive enforcement. In early February, reports emerged that the SEC was scaling back its 50-member crypto enforcement unit. Commissioner Hester Peirce also outlined a revised regulatory approach , suggesting a more balanced assessment of whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. Crypto Industry Sees Regulatory Softening The SEC’s staffing shake-up coincides with significant changes in its legal actions against the crypto industry. In recent weeks, the regulator has dropped lawsuits against several major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, and Kraken. This suggests a softening stance on crypto regulation, a stark contrast to the aggressive enforcement actions seen over the past two years. Meanwhile, the U.S. labor market remains in focus this week as investors anticipate key economic reports, including nonfarm payroll data, initial jobless claims, and the February Jobs Report. These indicators are expected to provide insight into the overall health of the economy and the potential impact of ongoing federal workforce reductions.

But a recent development in the US has sent ripples of concern through the AI community and beyond. The Trump Administration’s recent budget cuts are casting a dark shadow over the future of AI research , specifically targeting the National Science Foundation (NSF), a critical pillar of scientific advancement in the nation. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, where AI is increasingly becoming a transformative force, these developments are particularly noteworthy. Are we witnessing a setback in the progress of AI innovation due to these unexpected policy shifts? Let’s dive into the details. Why are Trump Administration Cuts Alarming for AI Research? Reports are emerging that the Trump Administration has initiated significant staff reductions at the National Science Foundation, an agency vital for nurturing scientific and engineering progress. According to Bloomberg, several NSF employees, specifically chosen for their deep AI research expertise, have been terminated. This isn’t just a routine reshuffle; it’s a strategic blow to the agency’s core capabilities. Here’s why this is raising red flags: Expertise Drain: The fired employees were specialists in AI, meaning their departure represents a loss of institutional knowledge and specialized skills crucial for guiding and evaluating AI research proposals. Directorate Disruption: The Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP), a key NSF department instrumental in channeling government grants into AI funding , is directly impacted. This directorate was designed to accelerate technological breakthroughs, and its disruption could have far-reaching consequences. Grant Funding Stalled: The immediate fallout includes the postponement or cancellation of numerous review panels. These panels are the gatekeepers of AI funding , responsible for assessing and approving research projects. The delays are already stalling funding for promising AI initiatives. This situation isn’t just about bureaucratic changes; it’s about the tangible impact on the pace and direction of AI research in the US. For the crypto world, which often benefits from and integrates the latest AI advancements, a slowdown in this sector could indirectly affect the innovation pipeline. NSF Layoffs: A Closer Look at the Impact on AI Funding The National Science Foundation plays a pivotal role in the US science and technology ecosystem. It’s a primary source of federal funding for fundamental research across various disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence. The recent NSF layoffs are not just isolated incidents; they signal a potential shift in governmental priorities and a possible contraction of support for scientific research. Let’s break down what these NSF layoffs could mean for AI funding : Impact Area Description Potential Consequence Grant Review Process Layoffs lead to the cancellation/postponement of review panels. Delays in approving and disbursing AI funding , hindering project timelines. Directorate for TIP Disruption of a key directorate focused on technology, innovation, and partnerships in AI. Reduced efficiency in identifying and supporting cutting-edge AI research initiatives. Expertise Within NSF Loss of experienced AI specialists within the NSF due to layoffs. Weakened capacity to strategically guide and evaluate future AI research proposals and funding allocations. Overall Research Ecosystem Potential chilling effect on the broader scientific community and discouragement for researchers seeking federal grants. Slower progress in AI research and development, potentially impacting US competitiveness in the global AI landscape. The table illustrates a cascading effect. The initial NSF layoffs trigger disruptions in grant processing, weaken institutional expertise, and could ultimately dampen the entire AI research ecosystem. For those watching the intersection of crypto and AI, this warrants close attention as it could shape the future technological landscape. Elon Musk Criticism and the Department of Government Efficiency Adding another layer of complexity to this situation is the involvement of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. AI experts have voiced strong disapproval of the Trump Administration cuts to scientific grant-making, particularly those championed by this department. Geoffrey Hinton, a luminary in the AI field and Nobel Laureate, didn’t mince words in his critique. He publicly called for Elon Musk’s expulsion from the British Royal Society, citing the “huge damage he is doing to scientific institutions in the U.S.”. This is a powerful statement from a respected figure in the scientific community, highlighting the gravity of the situation. Musk responded on X, acknowledging the possibility of mistakes and expressing a commitment to correction. However, the core concern remains: are these Trump Administration cuts , influenced by a focus on efficiency, undermining critical areas of scientific research, specifically AI research , which is vital for future innovation and economic growth? The debate underscores a fundamental tension between fiscal austerity and long-term investment in science and technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI Innovation? The implications of these Trump Administration cuts and NSF layoffs could be profound. While the immediate impact is on AI funding and research projects, the long-term consequences could reshape the landscape of AI innovation in the United States. Consider these potential future scenarios: Brain Drain: Reduced funding and instability in research environments could lead to top AI talent leaving the US for countries with more supportive research ecosystems. Slowed Innovation: Delays and reductions in AI funding can stifle groundbreaking research, potentially pushing the US behind in the global AI race. Economic Impact: AI is projected to be a major economic driver. Hampering AI research could weaken US competitiveness and future economic prosperity. National Security: AI is increasingly critical for national security. Cuts in this area could have implications for defense and strategic technological advantage. For the crypto and blockchain community, these developments are a reminder that the broader technological ecosystem is interconnected. Progress in AI can fuel advancements in blockchain and vice versa. A setback in one area can have ripple effects across the entire tech landscape. It remains to be seen how this situation will evolve, but the alarm bells are ringing loudly within the scientific and tech communities. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for US AI Research The Trump Administration cuts and subsequent NSF layoffs represent a critical juncture for AI research in the United States. While the administration’s rationale might be rooted in fiscal efficiency, the potential damage to the nation’s scientific infrastructure and future innovation pipeline cannot be ignored. The concerns raised by AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton and the visible disruptions in AI funding processes underscore the urgency of this situation. As the world increasingly looks towards AI as a transformative technology, these developments warrant close scrutiny and raise important questions about the future of US leadership in AI innovation. The crypto world, deeply intertwined with technological advancements, should be keenly aware of these shifts and their potential long-term impact.

41139695,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136495,1741081354,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Confident Prediction: Bitcoin to Boom as US Stock Market Bottoms Out, Says BitMEX Co-founder",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-boom-stock-market-bottom/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! Are you ready for a potential market shift that could send Bitcoin soaring? According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, the wait might not be long. In a recent blog post, Hayes delivered a compelling Bitcoin price prediction , suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) is not only nearing its bottom but is also poised to lead a powerful recovery, even before the traditional markets find their footing. Decoding Hayes’ Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction Hayes, a prominent voice in the crypto sphere, isn’t known for mincing words. His latest analysis points towards a fascinating divergence between Bitcoin and the U.S. stock market. He notes that Bitcoin reached a staggering high of around $110,000 just before a significant U.S. political event, only to correct by about 30% to approximately $78,000. While a 30% drop might sound alarming, Hayes views this as a healthy correction within a larger Bitcoin bullish cycle . He confidently asserts that the critical support level for Bitcoin lies at $70,000, marking the peak of the previous market cycle. Let’s break down Hayes’ key arguments: Bitcoin’s Resilience: Despite the recent dip, Hayes emphasizes Bitcoin’s inherent strength and its position within a continuing bullish trend. He sees the $70,000 level as a robust floor. Historical Context: He draws on historical price action, noting the previous cycle’s peak as a crucial support indicator. Liquidity Signals: Hayes highlights the declining U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) as a positive sign, indicating increased liquidity in the market. Why Crypto Market Recovery Could Be Bitcoin-Led? Hayes’ analysis isn’t just about Bitcoin’s individual trajectory; it’s about its potential leadership in a broader crypto market recovery . He suggests that Bitcoin, being a more agile and sentiment-driven asset compared to traditional stocks, is likely to bottom out and rebound faster. This is a significant point for investors looking for early signals of market turnaround. Consider these factors supporting Hayes’ view on Bitcoin leading the crypto recovery: Factor Description Implication for Bitcoin Market Sentiment Crypto markets are heavily influenced by sentiment and narratives, which can shift rapidly. Positive news or shifts in macroeconomic outlook can quickly drive Bitcoin’s price upwards. Technological Advancements Ongoing developments in blockchain technology and crypto adoption continue to build long-term value. Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, benefits directly from increased adoption and technological progress. Decentralization Appeal In times of economic uncertainty, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin becomes more attractive to investors seeking alternatives to traditional systems. Bitcoin’s inherent properties as a decentralized and finite asset position it as a safe haven during financial turmoil. The U.S. Stock Market Bottom and Its Ripple Effect The connection between Bitcoin and the US stock market bottom is central to Hayes’ thesis. He posits that while Bitcoin might experience a brief dip to $70,000 if traditional risk assets face a sharp sell-off, its bottom will likely precede that of the stock market. This is a crucial insight for investors trying to time their market entries. Hayes points to the declining TGA as a potential catalyst. A shrinking TGA often indicates increased liquidity in the financial system, which can be beneficial for risk assets like Bitcoin. However, it’s important to remember that market dynamics are complex, and various factors can influence both the stock market and Bitcoin. Key takeaways regarding the U.S. stock market’s influence: Intermarket Dynamics: While Bitcoin is increasingly correlated with traditional markets, Hayes believes it will decouple and lead the recovery. TGA as a Liquidity Indicator: The U.S. Treasury General Account’s balance is a key metric to watch for liquidity shifts. Potential Sell-offs: Be prepared for potential short-term dips in Bitcoin if the stock market experiences significant downturns. Arthur Hayes Bitcoin Strategy: Accumulate and Hold for the Long Haul Hayes isn’t just making predictions; he’s also outlining a strategy. He reiterates his approach of steadily accumulating Bitcoin during market downturns, emphasizing a leverage-free approach. His long-term vision remains incredibly bullish, anticipating a major financial transformation that could propel Bitcoin’s price past the $1 million mark. This isn’t just short-term speculation; it’s a long-term conviction based on macroeconomic trends and Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. Hayes’ actionable insights for investors: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Consider a strategy of regularly buying Bitcoin, especially during price dips, to average out your entry point. Avoid Leverage: Hayes strongly advises against using leverage in volatile markets, focusing on long-term accumulation of actual Bitcoin. Long-Term Perspective: Adopt a long-term investment horizon, recognizing Bitcoin’s potential to appreciate significantly over time. Conclusion: Is Bitcoin Poised for a Major Rebound? Arthur Hayes’ analysis presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s imminent rebound and its potential to lead the next crypto market recovery . His Bitcoin price prediction , grounded in market analysis and historical context, offers a beacon of hope for crypto investors navigating market uncertainties. While caution is always advised in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, Hayes’ confident stance and strategic recommendations provide valuable insights. The confluence of factors he highlights – Bitcoin’s resilience, declining TGA, and potential stock market bottom – paints a picture of a potentially explosive upward trajectory for Bitcoin. Is this the moment to strategically position yourself for the next crypto boom? Hayes certainly seems to think so.

41139696,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136492,1741081381,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting First: Japan’s Dojima Exchange Set to Launch Revolutionary Bitcoin Futures Trading,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dojima-exchange-bitcoin-futures-trading/,"Get ready for a groundbreaking development in the Asian cryptocurrency landscape! Japan’s Dojima Exchange, a well-established futures exchange based in Osaka, is poised to potentially revolutionize the way investors in Asia engage with Bitcoin futures trading . According to a recent Bloomberg report, Dojima Exchange is gearing up to file an application with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) this month, seeking approval to list Bitcoin futures products. This move is fueled by the burgeoning number of crypto enthusiasts and a significant surge in the demand for sophisticated crypto futures exchange options within Japan. If the FSA gives the green light, Dojima will etch its name in history as the first traditional exchange in Asia to offer Bitcoin futures trading . Let’s delve into what this exciting development means for the crypto world. Why is Dojima Exchange Venturing into Bitcoin Futures Trading? The decision by Dojima Exchange to explore Bitcoin futures trading is not arbitrary. It’s a strategic response to several key factors shaping the current financial environment in Japan and beyond: Surging Crypto Investor Base: Japan has consistently been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. The nation boasts a significant and continuously growing population of crypto investors who are increasingly looking for diverse investment avenues within the digital asset space. Increased Demand for Futures Trading: As the cryptocurrency market matures, so does the sophistication of its investors. There’s a rising demand for tools that allow for more nuanced trading strategies, including hedging and leveraged positions. Crypto futures exchange platforms provide precisely these capabilities, making them highly attractive to experienced traders and institutions. Filling a Market Gap: Currently, no traditional exchange in Asia offers Bitcoin futures. This presents a clear gap in the market that Dojima Exchange is aiming to fill. By becoming the first mover in this space, Dojima could attract substantial trading volume and establish itself as a leading platform for Bitcoin futures trading in Asia. Understanding Bitcoin Futures: A Quick Overview For those new to the concept, Bitcoin futures trading might seem complex. In essence, futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset, in this case, Bitcoin, at a predetermined price on a future date. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Feature Description Contract An agreement to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price on a future date. Futures Price The agreed-upon price for Bitcoin in the future contract. Expiration Date The date when the futures contract expires and must be settled. Leverage Futures trading often involves leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with less capital. This amplifies both potential profits and losses. Hedging Futures can be used to hedge against price volatility. For example, miners can use futures to lock in a future selling price for their Bitcoin. The Role of the FSA Approval in Japan’s Crypto Market The FSA approval is a critical step for Dojima Exchange’s plan. The Financial Services Agency in Japan is known for its stringent regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges. Obtaining FSA approval signifies that Dojima Exchange will operate under a regulated and compliant environment, offering a level of security and trust that is paramount for both institutional and retail investors. The FSA approval process typically involves a thorough review of various aspects of the exchange’s operations, including: Security Measures: Ensuring robust security protocols to protect user funds and data. Compliance Framework: Adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations. Operational Stability: Demonstrating the exchange’s capacity to handle trading volumes and maintain operational integrity. Investor Protection: Implementing measures to safeguard investors and ensure fair trading practices. If Dojima Exchange successfully navigates the FSA approval process, it will not only legitimize its crypto futures exchange but also contribute to the overall maturity and credibility of the cryptocurrency market in Japan. Impact on the Japan Crypto Market and Beyond Dojima Exchange’s potential foray into Bitcoin futures trading is expected to have significant ripple effects across the Japan crypto market and potentially the broader Asian region: Increased Institutional Participation: A regulated crypto futures exchange operated by a traditional player like Dojima could attract more institutional investors who have been hesitant to enter the crypto market due to regulatory uncertainties and lack of established platforms. Enhanced Market Liquidity: The introduction of Bitcoin futures on a traditional exchange can boost market liquidity, making it easier for traders to execute large orders without significantly impacting prices. Greater Price Discovery: Futures markets contribute to price discovery by reflecting the collective expectations of market participants about future price movements. This can lead to more efficient and transparent price formation for Bitcoin. Competitive Landscape: Dojima’s move could spur other traditional exchanges in Asia to consider offering crypto derivatives, fostering competition and innovation in the market. Global Recognition: Japan’s continued embrace of cryptocurrency innovation, exemplified by Dojima’s initiative, reinforces its position as a leading hub for digital assets on the global stage. What are the Potential Challenges? While the prospect of Dojima Exchange launching Bitcoin futures trading is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Obtaining FSA approval can be a lengthy and complex process. There’s no guarantee that the application will be approved in the anticipated timeframe, or at all. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. This inherent volatility can pose risks to both the exchange and traders, especially in leveraged futures trading. Competition from Existing Crypto Exchanges: Dojima will face competition from established cryptocurrency exchanges that already offer Bitcoin futures. To succeed, Dojima will need to differentiate itself through its regulatory compliance, service offerings, or target audience. Educating Traditional Investors: Traditional futures traders might need education on the nuances of cryptocurrency markets and the specific risks and opportunities associated with Bitcoin futures trading . Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors Here’s what you should be paying attention to in light of this development: Monitor FSA Approval News: Keep an eye on news related to Dojima Exchange’s FSA approval application. This will be a key indicator of whether and when Bitcoin futures trading might launch on the exchange. Understand Futures Trading: If you’re interested in Bitcoin futures trading , now is a good time to educate yourself about futures contracts, leverage, risk management, and trading strategies. Track Japan Crypto Market Trends: Follow developments in the Japan crypto market . Dojima’s move could signal broader trends in regulatory acceptance and institutional adoption in the region. Compare Platforms: When Dojima Bitcoin futures (if approved) become available, compare their offerings with existing crypto futures exchange platforms in terms of fees, leverage, security, and user interface to make informed trading decisions. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Asian Crypto Futures Dojima Exchange’s plan to list Bitcoin futures trading is a significant leap forward for the Asian cryptocurrency market. It represents a convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, potentially opening doors for greater institutional participation, enhanced market maturity, and increased accessibility to sophisticated crypto investment tools in Japan and beyond.

41139827,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136491,1741081507,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking: Nasdaq Files for Grayscale Hedera ETF – Is HBAR ETF Approval Imminent?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nasdaq-files-grayscale-hedera-etf/,"Exciting news is brewing in the crypto world! Nasdaq, a leading global exchange, has just taken a significant step that could potentially revolutionize how investors access Hedera (HBAR). They’ve officially filed a 19b-4 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade the Grayscale Hedera ETF. This move, reported by Cointelegraph, signals a growing institutional interest in Hedera and the broader digital asset market. But what does this mean for you, and what are the implications for the future of crypto ETFs? Let’s dive into the details. What is the Buzz About the Grayscale Hedera ETF? The core of this exciting development is the Grayscale Hedera ETF . An ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is essentially a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock. In this case, the proposed ETF would hold Hedera (HBAR), allowing investors to gain exposure to this cryptocurrency without directly holding the digital asset themselves. Grayscale Investments, a well-known digital asset manager, is behind this initiative, further adding credibility and weight to this filing. Nasdaq’s filing of the 19b-4 filing is a crucial step in this process. A 19b-4 is a form required by the SEC for exchanges to propose new rules, in this case, rules to list and trade a new ETF. It’s essentially asking the SEC for permission to make the Grayscale Hedera ETF available for trading on the Nasdaq exchange. This is not a simple formality; it kicks off a review process by the SEC to determine if the ETF meets all regulatory requirements and protects investors. Why is a Nasdaq ETF Listing a Big Deal for Hedera? Listing on Nasdaq is a significant milestone for any ETF, and especially for a Hedera ETF . Here’s why it matters: Increased Accessibility: An ETF makes investing in Hedera significantly more accessible to a broader range of investors. Many traditional investors are more comfortable investing through regulated exchanges and familiar investment vehicles like ETFs rather than directly buying and managing digital assets. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs traded on major exchanges like Nasdaq typically enjoy high liquidity. This means investors can easily buy and sell shares of the Hedera ETF, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery for HBAR itself. Institutional Adoption: A Nasdaq-listed crypto ETF signals a growing acceptance and institutionalization of digital assets. It opens the door for institutional investors, who often have mandates to invest in regulated and easily accessible products, to allocate capital to Hedera. Validation for Hedera: The fact that a major institution like Grayscale is proposing a Hedera ETF, and a leading exchange like Nasdaq is willing to list it, is a strong validation of Hedera’s technology, ecosystem, and long-term potential. What are the Potential Benefits of Investing in a Hedera ETF? For investors, a Hedera ETF offers several compelling benefits: Simplified Exposure to HBAR: Investing in an ETF eliminates the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing HBAR tokens. You can gain exposure through a traditional brokerage account. Diversification: Adding a Hedera ETF to your portfolio can potentially diversify your investment holdings and provide exposure to the cryptocurrency market without the need to deeply understand the underlying technology. Regulation and Transparency: ETFs are regulated investment products, offering a level of transparency and investor protection that may be lacking in direct cryptocurrency investments. Potential for Growth: Hedera Hashgraph is a promising technology with various real-world applications. If Hedera’s ecosystem grows and adoption increases, the value of HBAR, and consequently the Hedera ETF, could potentially appreciate. What Challenges and Hurdles Does the Grayscale Hedera ETF Face? While the Nasdaq filing is positive, the crypto ETF still faces challenges: SEC Approval Process: The SEC’s approval process for crypto ETFs has been historically cautious and lengthy. There’s no guarantee that the Grayscale Hedera ETF will be approved, or how long the review process might take. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. The value of HBAR and the Hedera ETF could experience significant price swings, which investors need to be prepared for. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the ETF and the broader crypto market. Competition: The crypto ETF market is becoming increasingly competitive. The success of the Grayscale Hedera ETF will depend on its structure, fees, and investor demand compared to other available options. What are the Next Steps for the Hedera ETF? The immediate next step is for the SEC to review the 19b-4 filing . This involves a period of public comment and evaluation by the SEC staff. The SEC will consider various factors, including market surveillance, investor protection, and the underlying assets. Here’s a simplified timeline: Stage Description 19b-4 Filing Nasdaq submits the 19b-4 form to the SEC to propose listing the Grayscale Hedera ETF. SEC Review The SEC begins its review process, including soliciting public comments. Potential Delays The SEC can extend the review period if needed to gather more information or address concerns. Decision The SEC will ultimately approve or disapprove the 19b-4 application. Listing (if approved) If approved, the Grayscale Hedera ETF will be listed and begin trading on the Nasdaq exchange. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do? While the Grayscale Hedera ETF is not yet available, here are some actionable insights for investors: Stay Informed: Keep following news and updates regarding the SEC’s review of the 19b-4 filing. Cointelegraph and other reputable crypto news sources are good resources. Research Hedera: If you’re interested in the Hedera ETF, now is a good time to research Hedera Hashgraph, its technology, use cases, and potential. Understand the underlying asset before considering investing in the ETF. Assess Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment goals before considering any investment in a Hedera ETF or HBAR directly. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek advice from a qualified financial advisor to determine if a Hedera ETF aligns with your overall investment strategy. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Hedera and Crypto ETFs Nasdaq’s groundbreaking filing for the Grayscale Hedera ETF marks a significant advancement for both Hedera and the broader crypto ETF market. It represents a major step towards mainstream adoption of digital assets, offering investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to HBAR. While SEC approval is not guaranteed, this development underscores the growing institutional interest and maturity of the cryptocurrency space. The potential listing of a Nasdaq ETF for Hedera is undoubtedly something to watch closely, as it could pave the way for further innovation and investment in the digital asset ecosystem.

Pi Coin price recorded a surge of over 5% today despite a broader crypto market selloff, with BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL losing between 9% and 15% each. Besides, the crypto has also secured 11th place as a top asset by market cap, outpacing Hedera despite the HBAR ETF hype. Pi Network Outpaces Hedera: Here’s All Pi Network has secured 11th place on the top crypto ranking, surpassing the market cap of Hedera. Besides, it also emerged as a clear winner despite a broader crypto market selloff, with more than $1 billion in liquidation over the last 24 hours. Notably, this comes as Pi Coin value added more than 5% and exchanged hands at $1.73, after touching a 24-hour high of $1.85. On a weekly basis, the crypto has added 11% reaching a market cap of $12.02 billion. On the other hand, the 12th ranked crypto, Hedera price today was down 7% to $0.2303 with a market cap of $9.65 billion.

This development, if happens, could significantly boost the crypto’s appeal to the investors. On the other hand, crypto has also gained notable traction recently, as it extended deadlines for KYC and mainnet migration for Pioneers. This extension, as per their announcement, is the last chance for the traders to migrate to the mainnet. A Closer Look Into The Recent Market Trends The market also discussed Pi Coin’s potential to be added to the US Crypto Reserve asset in the coming days. For context, Donald Trump has reiterated his pledge to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Besides, he also revealed plans to add US-issued altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA alongside Bitcoin as a Strategic asset. Having said that, the community anticipates Pi Network to be added as a US Strategic Reserve asset in the near future. This development, if happens, could further trigger a robust rally in the asset’s price. Meanwhile, all eyes are now on the upcoming Pi Day on Friday, March 14. A flurry of market experts anticipates positive announcements or key developments regarding the Pi Coin on this date.

41139828,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136485,1741081657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Trump’s Shocking Ukraine Aid Cut – How Will Global Instability Impact Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-ukraine-aid-global-instability/,"In a dramatic turn of events shaking the foundations of international relations, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly ended all military aid to Ukraine. This seismic shift in US foreign policy , as reported by Watcher Guru on X, has sent ripples of concern across the globe. For those in the cryptocurrency sphere, where markets are sensitive to geopolitical tremors, this news arrives at a critical juncture. But what exactly does this mean, and how could it potentially impact the volatile world of digital assets? Decoding the Shocking Halt to Ukraine Military Aid The abrupt cessation of Ukraine military aid by the United States marks a significant departure from previous policies. While details remain sparse, the implications are potentially far-reaching. Let’s break down what we know and what this could signify: The Announcement: The news surfaced via a post from Watcher Guru on X, a platform known for disseminating financial and political updates. While official confirmation from U.S. government sources is pending, the report has already ignited widespread discussion and speculation. Potential Motivations: The reasons behind this decision are currently unclear. Speculation ranges from shifting US foreign policy priorities to domestic political considerations. It’s crucial to monitor official statements and evolving narratives to understand the underlying rationale. Immediate Impact: The immediate fallout is likely to be felt most acutely in Ukraine, which has been reliant on international military assistance. The move could embolden adversaries and alter the balance of power in the region. Global Reactions: Expect a spectrum of reactions from global leaders and international bodies. Allies may express concern, while adversaries could perceive this as an opportunity. The diplomatic ramifications are just beginning to unfold. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Geopolitical Risk ? You might be wondering, what does this geopolitical development have to do with cryptocurrency? The answer lies in the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets. Here’s why crypto investors should be paying close attention: Market Volatility: Geopolitical risk is a notorious catalyst for market volatility. Uncertainty breeds fear, and fear often translates to market fluctuations. Both traditional and cryptocurrency markets can experience heightened volatility in response to significant geopolitical events. Safe Haven Assets: In times of global instability , investors often seek safe haven assets. Historically, assets like gold have played this role. Some argue that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are emerging as modern-day digital gold, offering a hedge against traditional market turmoil and currency devaluation. Economic Uncertainty and Inflation: Major shifts in international relations can trigger economic uncertainty . Military aid cuts and their cascading effects can influence economic stability, trade relations, and even inflation rates. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes viewed as a hedge against inflation, making them potentially more attractive during periods of economic instability. Decentralization Appeal: Geopolitical tensions can underscore the appeal of decentralized systems. In a world facing increased uncertainty and potential disruptions to traditional financial channels, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies becomes a more compelling feature for some investors. Navigating the Waters of Global Instability : What’s Next? The situation is fluid, and the full consequences of this US foreign policy shift are yet to be seen. However, for crypto investors, here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news developments from reputable sources. Monitor official statements from governments and international organizations to understand the evolving situation. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is always a prudent strategy, especially during times of uncertainty. Consider diversifying across different asset classes, including a mix of cryptocurrencies, and potentially traditional safe haven assets. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Geopolitical risk can amplify market swings, so ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level for volatility. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions can be dramatic, maintain a long-term perspective. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their cyclical nature. Focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of your crypto investments amidst short-term turbulence. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of high volatility, stablecoins can offer a safe harbor within the crypto ecosystem. They provide a way to reduce exposure to market fluctuations while remaining within the digital asset space. The Unfolding Story of Economic Uncertainty and Crypto’s Role The decision to halt military aid to Ukraine injects a significant dose of economic uncertainty into the global landscape. How this unfolds will be crucial for all markets, including cryptocurrencies. Will this event trigger a flight to safety? Will crypto markets react as a hedge, or will they be swept up in broader market downturns? These are the pressing questions facing investors now. It’s essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is still relatively young and reactive to global news cycles. Events like this can serve as stress tests, revealing how digital assets behave under pressure. While the immediate impact remains to be seen, the long-term implications for the adoption and perception of cryptocurrencies as alternative assets are definitely in play. In conclusion, the reported halt of US military aid to Ukraine is a significant geopolitical event with potential ramifications for global markets, including the cryptocurrency space. By staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective, crypto investors can navigate these uncertain times and potentially position themselves to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The intersection of geopolitics and crypto is becoming increasingly important, and this latest development underscores the need for vigilance and informed decision-making in the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin’s Halving Cycle: Is Now the Time to Invest in Digital Gold? Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, created to change how we use money. It was introduced by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto. Instead of relying on banks, Bitcoin lets people send money directly to each other. This is done through a technology called blockchain, which is like a shared ledger that everyone can see. Miners help keep the network secure by solving puzzles, and they get rewarded with bitcoins. This system aims to prevent fraud and keep transactions safe. One unique feature of Bitcoin is the “halving” that happens every four years. This means the rewards for miners are cut in half, making bitcoins more scarce. With a limited supply of 21 million coins, this scarcity can increase demand. As the market evolves, some see Bitcoin as a good investment compared to other cryptocurrencies. Its potential lies in its decentralized nature and strong security. While the market can be volatile, many believe that Bitcoin’s technology and growing acceptance make it an attractive option in today’s digital economy. Ethereum’s Next Leap: How ETH Is Shaping the Future of Blockchain Ethereum isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a game-changer in the blockchain world. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it has introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps. This has opened doors to decentralized finance, where people can access financial services without traditional banks. The shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 made Ethereum more efficient and eco-friendly. Solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon are speeding up transactions and cutting costs. Ether (ETH) is at the heart of it all, used for transactions, rewards for stakers, and as a valuable asset. In today’s market, Ethereum shows strong potential. Its continuous upgrades aim to make it faster and cheaper to use. The upcoming sharding phase is set to boost its scalability even more. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s active development and wide use give it an advantage. Trends show that Ethereum often benefits from market cycles influenced by Bitcoin halvings. With its solid technology and growing ecosystem, Ethereum stands out as an attractive option in the crypto space right now. Solana’s SOL Coin: Speed and Scalability in the Crypto World Solana is a blockchain platform that puts speed and scalability first. Competing with networks like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps. What makes Solana stand out is its design choices aimed at faster transactions. Developers can build on Solana using various programming languages, giving them flexibility. At the center of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. More than just a coin, SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. In today’s market, SOL shows promising potential. Its value lies in supporting the Solana ecosystem, rewarding participants, and giving users access to a range of projects. Unlike some other platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale. This unique approach makes it appealing to developers and investors looking for a high-capacity network. With the increasing demand for fast and efficient blockchain solutions, SOL stands out as an attractive option. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Solana’s focus on speed and scalability could give it an edge over competitors. A Fast and Borderless Future: Exploring the Potential of XRP In the world of digital currencies, XRP stands out as a cryptocurrency built for speed and efficiency. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP operates on the XRP Ledger—a decentralized system without a central authority. This means transactions are secure, irreversible, and don’t require a bank account for settlements. With its design as a digitally native, programmable currency, XRP offers fast, low-cost transactions that cross borders effortlessly. Its name, derived from “ripple credits,” reflects its mission to enable seamless payment transfers across various currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP’s potential lies in its ability to facilitate quick and cheap transactions, making it an attractive option compared to other cryptocurrencies that face high fees and slower processing times. Ripple, the company associated with XRP, holds a significant amount of XRP in escrow, releasing it in a controlled manner to support network liquidity and the ecosystem. This approach aims to prevent inflation and maintain value. As the world moves toward more digital and decentralized finance solutions, XRP’s technology and purpose position it as a promising player worth watching in the cryptocurrency market. Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable Crypto Revolution Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, like Ethereum, but with a twist. Its native coin, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and even stake on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on being flexible, sustainable, and scalable. Instead of using the energy-hungry proof-of-work system like Bitcoin, Cardano uses a proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros. This means it’s much more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Another innovative aspect is Cardano’s two-layer structure. The Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer deals with smart contracts. This setup boosts its ability to process transactions—potentially up to a million per second. With the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, interacting with smart contracts became more secure and cost-effective. In the current market, ADA looks attractive, especially for those concerned about sustainability in crypto. Compared to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA offers similar features but with greater efficiency and scalability. As the demand for eco-friendly cryptocurrencies grows, Cardano’s unique approach positions it well for future success.

Others like Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson advocate for a multi-token approach. Meanwhile, Australia rejected similar plans, and is rather prioritizing regulatory frameworks over accumulation. Bitcoin Only True Reserve Asset? The debate over which cryptocurrencies should be included in the United States’ proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve intensified after President Donald Trump’s announcement of the initiative. The reserve is expected to include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP, which attracted very differing opinions from key figures in the cryptocurrency space. Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss argued that only Bitcoin meets the criteria for being a US reserve asset, and stated that it is the only digital asset that qualifies as “hard money” and a “proven store of value like gold.” While he acknowledged that many other cryptocurrencies have their place in the market and are listed on Gemini, he insisted that a strategic reserve should stick to higher standards. His brother and Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss agreed , and added that Ethereum could potentially be considered alongside Bitcoin, comparing them to America’s physical gold and oil reserves. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared a similar perspective, and suggested that Bitcoin alone will be the best choice because of its simplicity and status as the most widely recognized and accepted digital asset. However, he also proposed an alternative approach, where the US could adopt a market cap-weighted index of cryptocurrencies to eliminate potential bias in asset selection. Bitcoin advocate and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow took a stricter stance by arguing that only proof-of-work cryptocurrencies should be included in the reserve. He claimed that proof-of-stake assets, like Solana and Cardano, are susceptible to manipulation by foreign actors who could gain control simply by acquiring a large amount of the tokens. In his view, Bitcoin and potentially Litecoin will be the only suitable assets. Despite the skepticism from Bitcoin maximalists, executives from Cardano and Ripple defended the inclusion of their respective tokens. Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson rejected criticism from gold advocate Peter Schiff, and said that XRP demonstrated resilience and maintained a strong community over the years. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also long supported a multi-token reserve. The Crypto Strategic Reserve proposal was made after extensive discussions from Trump’s newly established Working Group on Digital Assets, which has been evaluating its structure and potential impact. Trump is also set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, where discussions will cover regulatory policies, stablecoin oversight, and broader crypto market dynamics. Crypto Leaders Debate Trump’s Vision Although Donald Trump’s plan to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve has been met with some optimism in the industry, experts still warn that it does not replace the need for clearer regulatory guidelines. Patrick Young , go-to-market lead at Web3 app Galxe, believes that while the initiative signals growing government interest in crypto, long-term growth will depend on regulatory clarity. Trump’s announcement led to a short-term surge in crypto prices. Bitcoin briefly climbed above $90,000 before settling, and Cardano saw an even sharper reaction after gaining more than 40% in the first 24 hours after the news. According to Young, while crypto reserve developments can drive short-term price movements, industry-friendly regulations will play a much bigger role in sustaining long-term growth. ADA’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Trump has taken steps toward a more pro-crypto regulatory environment by appointing leadership at key agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that advanced a number of crypto-related applications that were previously stalled under the prior administration. Many in the industry are looking forward to new SEC leadership clarifying what constitutes a security, especially after the agency stated in February that meme coins are unlikely to fall under that classification. (Source: SEC ) Despite the optimism, Trump’s inclusion of altcoins also attracted criticism, with some questioning whether the move could benefit his personal crypto holdings. Young pointed out that Trump accumulated various altcoins through entities under his control, which certainly raises serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, Adam O’Brien , CEO of Bitcoin Well, warned that including altcoins in a government reserve introduces centralization risks. He argued that if centralized assets are considered, traditional blue-chip stocks could just as easily be part of the reserve. While the proposal stirred excitement and price movements, it also raised many questions about how a government-backed crypto reserve should be structured and what assets should be included. Australia Rejects Crypto Reserve Plans Australia’s government has no plans to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, despite recent moves by the United States under President Donald Trump. While a number of US states are also considering adding cryptocurrency to their balance sheets, Australia’s current ruling party is focused on regulation rather than accumulation. A spokesperson for Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services Minister Stephen Jones confirmed that the government is prioritizing a regulatory framework for digital asset platforms. The government has been engaging with industry stakeholders to develop a tailored regulatory approach. It is, however, important to keep in mind that with Australia’s federal election looming before May 17, the political landscape may soon shift. A recent YouGov poll shows the opposition coalition holding a slight lead over the current Labor government. However, the coalition has not commented on whether it will consider a different stance on a crypto reserve. Industry experts are still very divided on the practicality of a national crypto reserve. Tom Matthews , head of corporate affairs at Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, believes that while the idea is popular, it carries a lot of risks. He pointed out that cryptocurrency price volatility could undermine the effectiveness of a strategic reserve, making it difficult to gain political traction. He also suggested that a more feasible approach might be the creation of a sovereign wealth fund with long-term crypto holdings. Jonathon Miller, managing director for Australia at Kraken, argued that cryptocurrency has already been recognized as an investment-grade asset. He specifically pointed to the presence of crypto ETFs on major exchanges and investments from superannuation and sovereign wealth funds. Miller suggested that institutions like the Future Fund and even the Australian Treasury should consider allocating assets to crypto. Meanwhile, regulatory oversight of the crypto industry in Australia is increasing. In December, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center CEO Brendan Thomas announced that the agency will shift its focus toward crypto in 2025, including a crackdown on crypto ATM providers that may not comply with anti-money laundering laws. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission also released a consultation paper in December, proposing that many digital assets be classified as financial products. This will require firms to obtain proper licensing.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|ADA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-04 09:49:02
41139854,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136476,1741081779,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Uncertainty Looms: Analysts Question Altcoins in US Crypto Reserve, Bitcoin’s ‘Digital Gold’ Status Solid",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/analysts-question-altcoins-crypto-reserve/,"The idea of a national crypto reserve is gaining traction, especially in the U.S., but a crucial question is emerging: should it be more than just Bitcoin? Recent statements from former President Trump have ignited discussions about including a basket of cryptocurrencies in a strategic crypto reserve, moving beyond just Bitcoin. But are altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) really suitable for a national reserve? Let’s dive into the insightful analysis from Bernstein and explore the complexities. The Bitcoin ‘Digital Gold’ Argument for a Crypto Reserve Bernstein analysts, in their March 3rd note, highlighted a key distinction: Bitcoin’s position as “digital gold.” This narrative, which resonates with many crypto enthusiasts and increasingly with institutional investors, provides a strong rationale for including Bitcoin (BTC) in a crypto reserve . Think of it like a digital-age equivalent of gold reserves held by central banks – a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a globally recognized asset. Here’s why Bitcoin fits the ‘digital gold’ narrative: Limited Supply: Just like gold, Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it inherently scarce. This scarcity is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of any single government or entity, offering a level of independence and resilience that appeals to the idea of a reserve asset. Established Network: Bitcoin boasts the most mature and robust blockchain network, with a proven track record of security and uptime. Global Recognition: Bitcoin is the most widely recognized and accepted cryptocurrency globally, making it a liquid and easily tradable asset. The Altcoin Conundrum: Why Question Inclusion in a Crypto Reserve? While the case for Bitcoin in a crypto reserve seems relatively clear-cut, the inclusion of altcoins like ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA raises significant questions. Bernstein analysts point out that the rationale for holding these cryptocurrencies in a national reserve is far less obvious. Unlike Bitcoin’s established narrative as ‘digital gold’, altcoins operate in a more diverse and, arguably, less defined space. Here’s the challenge with integrating altcoins into a national crypto reserve: Lack of Clear Narrative: While each altcoin has its own use case and community, none currently possess the broadly accepted ‘store of value’ narrative that Bitcoin enjoys. Ethereum, for example, is more focused on smart contracts and decentralized applications, while XRP is geared towards payment solutions. SOL and ADA are focused on blockchain scalability and ecosystem development. These are valuable technologies, but are they reserve assets? Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for altcoins is still evolving and often unclear, especially in the U.S. This uncertainty can pose risks for a national reserve, as regulatory actions could significantly impact the value and usability of these assets. Volatility and Market Maturity: Compared to Bitcoin, many altcoins exhibit higher volatility and are part of less mature markets. This increased risk profile might make them less suitable for a national reserve aimed at stability and long-term value preservation. Centralization Concerns: Some altcoins, while decentralized to some extent, may have different governance models and concentration of token ownership compared to Bitcoin, raising questions about their true decentralization and resilience. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Proposal: A Strategic Shift? The discussion around a U.S. crypto reserve gained momentum following posts by former President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Trump mentioned that his executive order had directed the Presidential Working Group to explore forming a strategic crypto reserve that included not just BTC, but also ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. This proposal suggests a potentially broader and more inclusive approach to a national crypto strategy. Trump’s rationale, though not explicitly detailed in the report, could stem from several factors: Diversification: Including multiple cryptocurrencies might be seen as a way to diversify the reserve and reduce risk associated with relying solely on Bitcoin. Technological Innovation: Recognizing the diverse potential of blockchain technology and the different functionalities offered by various altcoins might be a driver for including them. Political Signaling: Embracing a broader range of cryptocurrencies could be interpreted as a more inclusive and forward-looking approach to crypto policy, potentially appealing to a wider range of stakeholders. US Crypto Policy: Navigating the Complexities of a Digital Reserve The debate around including altcoins in a U.S. crypto reserve underscores the complexities of formulating a comprehensive US crypto policy . While a Bitcoin reserve aligns with its ‘digital gold’ status and established market presence, expanding it to include other cryptocurrencies introduces new challenges and considerations. Key questions for policymakers to consider include: Defining the Purpose: What is the primary objective of a national crypto reserve? Is it purely a store of value, a strategic asset, or something else? The answer will influence the selection of cryptocurrencies. Risk Assessment: A thorough risk assessment of each potential cryptocurrency is crucial, considering factors like volatility, regulatory risks, technological vulnerabilities, and market liquidity. Operational Challenges: Managing a multi-asset crypto reserve introduces operational complexities related to custody, security, and portfolio management. Transparency and Governance: Clear guidelines on the governance and management of the crypto reserve are essential to ensure transparency and accountability. The Future of Crypto Reserves: Bitcoin and Beyond? The discussion initiated by Bernstein’s analysts and Trump’s proposal is crucial for shaping the future of crypto reserves and US crypto policy . While Bitcoin’s role as ‘digital gold’ makes it a strong contender for inclusion, the case for altcoins is far from settled. The debate highlights the need for careful consideration of the goals, risks, and operational aspects of establishing a national crypto reserve. Ultimately, the decision of whether to include altcoins in a U.S. crypto reserve will depend on a complex interplay of economic, political, and technological factors. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, a nuanced and informed approach is essential to harness the potential of digital assets while mitigating potential risks.

Joining the whitelist ensures priority access to the presale and early staking rewards, offering traders a first-mover advantage in this new era of decentralized finance and multi-asset trading. The Challenge: Trading Across Markets is Inefficient Despite the rapid expansion of digital finance, trading remains highly fragmented, forcing investors to juggle multiple platforms to access different markets. Crypto traders rely on exchanges like Binance or Coinbase but lack direct access to traditional financial assets, making diversification difficult. Stock and forex traders, meanwhile, use brokers that do not support cryptocurrencies, cutting them off from blockchain-driven financial opportunities. This separation creates inefficiencies, restricting traders from executing seamless cross-market strategies. Shifting funds between asset classes—such as moving profits from meme coins into Gold ETFs—requires multiple transactions across different platforms, leading to delays, additional fees, and missed opportunities. Without a unified trading solution, investors struggle to react to market fluctuations in real time, making it harder to hedge risks, rebalance portfolios, and execute cross-asset strategies efficiently. This lack of integration limits financial flexibility, forcing traders to navigate a complex and outdated system that no longer fits the fast-moving, interconnected nature of modern markets. The Solution: One Platform for All Markets BlockchainFX eliminates these inefficiencies by uniting all major asset classes into a single, all-in-one trading platform, allowing users to move effortlessly between crypto, stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, and bonds. By breaking down the barriers between digital and traditional finance, BlockchainFX enables traders to diversify, hedge, and capitalize on market trends without the need for multiple accounts, intermediaries, or liquidity transfers. With seamless trading between Bitcoin, Ethereum, meme coins, and DeFi tokens, alongside Tesla, Apple, major ETFs, and forex pairs like USD, EUR, JPY, and GBP, BlockchainFX bridges the gap between asset classes. Traders can also invest in commodities such as Gold, Silver, and Oil, or access institutional-grade bonds and other traditional assets, making it the most comprehensive trading ecosystem available today. The instant asset swap feature removes liquidity lockups and withdrawal delays, ensuring traders can react immediately to market changes. For example, if Bitcoin experiences a surge but macroeconomic indicators suggest rising uncertainty, users can instantly swap BTC for Gold ETFs as a hedge—without waiting for fund transfers or navigating multiple platforms. By eliminating friction and providing a truly unified trading experience, BlockchainFX offers the efficiency, flexibility, and profitability that modern traders demand in an increasingly connected financial world. Market Opportunity: Why Multi-Asset Trading is the Future Financial markets are more interconnected than ever, yet less than 1% of global trading volume comes from crypto. Asset Class Daily Trading Volume Market Share Forex $7.5 trillion 77.85% Bonds $1.1 trillion 11.42% U.S. Stocks $700 billion 7.27% Commodities $250 billion 2.59% Crypto $89 billion 0.87% The crypto industry is rapidly expanding into mainstream finance, with institutional players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan entering the space. This blurring of boundaries between digital and traditional finance creates a huge demand for a unified trading solution—one that BlockchainFX is uniquely positioned to fulfill. Why Now? The Shift Toward All-in-One Trading Platforms Several key trends make this the perfect time for BlockchainFX’s launch: Crypto is going mainstream – Major institutions are integrating blockchain-based financial products.

41139972,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136475,1741081875,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Benchmarks: Super Mario Bros. Proves Tougher Than Pokémon,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/super-mario-ai-benchmarks/,"Forget complex datasets and intricate algorithms for a moment. In a stunning twist, researchers are now throwing AI models into the pixelated world of Super Mario Bros. to truly test their mettle. Yes, you read that right! Move over Pokémon, because this iconic plumber is the new boss in town when it comes to AI benchmarks . Is this just playful experimentation, or does it reveal something profound about how we evaluate artificial intelligence? Let’s dive into this intriguing development. Why Super Mario Bros. for AI Benchmarks? We all know games have long been playgrounds for AI. From chess to Go, conquering virtual worlds has served as a tangible way to measure AI progress. But why Super Mario Bros., a seemingly simple side-scrolling adventure? Hao AI Lab at UC San Diego argues it’s precisely this perceived simplicity that makes it a powerful AI benchmark . Unlike some complex strategy games, Super Mario demands real-time decision-making, precise timing, and the ability to adapt to unpredictable environments. Think about it: dodging Goombas, navigating tricky jumps, and strategizing power-up usage – all in milliseconds! This requires a different kind of intelligence than processing vast amounts of data, and that’s exactly what researchers are keen to explore. AI Models Performance Face the Mushroom Kingdom So, how did the top AI contenders fare against the might of Bowser’s minions? Hao AI Lab put several leading models to the test using their in-house framework, GamingAgent. Here’s a quick rundown of the AI models performance in this unexpected arena: Anthropic’s Claude 3.7: Emerging as the star player, Claude 3.7 demonstrated impressive adaptability and strategic gameplay, navigating levels with relative ease. Anthropic’s Claude 3.5: Close behind its sibling, Claude 3.5 also showed strong performance, proving Anthropic’s models are quite adept at jumping and running. Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro: Surprisingly, Gemini 1.5 Pro, a model known for its prowess in many other areas, struggled to keep pace in the fast-paced world of Mario. OpenAI’s GPT-4o: Another heavyweight contender, GPT-4o, also found the going tough, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-time gaming environments. It’s crucial to note that this wasn’t your nostalgic NES cartridge experience. The game ran in an emulator integrated with GamingAgent , a framework designed to translate the game environment into actionable information for the AI. GamingAgent provided basic instructions and visual input (screenshots) to the AI, which then generated Python code to control Mario. This setup allowed researchers to standardize the testing process and focus on the core AI capabilities needed for gameplay. The Reasoning Paradox: Why ‘Thinking’ Models Struggle in AI Gaming ? One of the most intriguing findings was the performance disparity between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Reasoning models, like OpenAI’s older models, are designed to meticulously ‘think’ through problems step-by-step. While generally superior in many benchmarks, they surprisingly underperformed in Super Mario compared to ‘non-reasoning’ models. Why this counterintuitive result? The researchers pinpointed timing as the critical factor. Reasoning models take precious seconds to deliberate actions – an eternity in a game where milliseconds matter. In Super Mario, hesitation is fatal. A delayed jump means plummeting into a pit, a moment’s indecision leads to a Goomba collision. AI gaming , especially fast-paced genres like platformers, demands rapid, almost instinctive responses, favoring models that can react swiftly over those that ponder deeply. Is AI Gaming Progress Real Progress? The Evaluation Crisis The rise of AI gaming benchmarks raises a crucial question: Are these virtual victories truly indicative of real-world AI advancement? Some experts are skeptical. They argue that games, while challenging, are inherently simplified and abstract representations of reality. Games offer neatly defined rules, predictable environments, and, crucially, an infinite supply of training data – luxuries not found in the messy, unpredictable real world. Andrej Karpathy, a prominent figure in AI research, has voiced concerns about an “evaluation crisis.” He questions the current metrics used to assess AI, suggesting that flashy gaming demos might not accurately reflect genuine progress towards more general and robust AI. “I don’t really know what [AI] metrics to look at right now,” Karpathy admitted, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding how to truly measure the ‘goodness’ of these increasingly sophisticated models. Are we focusing too much on spectacular but narrow achievements, like conquering Super Mario, while overlooking the broader, more fundamental challenges of artificial intelligence? The Future of Super Mario AI and Beyond Despite the ongoing debate, using Super Mario as an AI benchmark offers valuable insights. It pushes AI models to develop skills in real-time decision-making, spatial reasoning, and adaptive strategy – abilities that, while honed in a virtual world, could have implications for real-world applications requiring rapid response and environmental awareness, such as autonomous systems or robotics. Whether it’s navigating a treacherous level in Super Mario or a complex scenario in the real world, the ability to react quickly and strategically is paramount. So, while we might chuckle at the thought of AI battling Bowser, this seemingly playful experiment highlights a serious point: we need diverse and challenging benchmarks to truly understand the strengths and limitations of AI. Super Mario, in its charmingly pixelated way, is proving to be a surprisingly effective tool in this crucial evaluation process.

Imagine accessing the power of Google Gemini, the cutting-edge AI chatbot , without even unlocking your iPhone. That’s now a reality! Google has just rolled out an update that lets you put Gemini right on your iPhone lock screen . For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals constantly on the move, this seamless access to AI assistance is a game-changer. Let’s explore how this update is revolutionizing mobile AI interaction and what it means for you. Effortless Access to AI Chatbot from Your iPhone Lock Screen Gone are the days of unlocking your phone, finding the app, and then initiating your AI interaction. With the new iOS widgets for Google Gemini, you can now summon Gemini Live, Google’s real-time voice feature, directly from your lock screen. This update, initially spotted by 9to5Google on Monday, simplifies accessing AI assistance on your iPhone. Think of it as having a direct line to AI intelligence, ready at your fingertips before you even unlock your device. This streamlined approach is especially beneficial for quick queries or commands when you’re on the go, making your crypto research or market analysis faster and more convenient. Why is Google Gemini on iPhone Lock Screen a Big Deal? As we await Apple’s rumored AI-enhanced Siri, expected no sooner than 2027, the competition in the mobile AI space is heating up. Google’s move to bring Gemini to the iPhone lock screen is a strategic play, offering iPhone users a taste of sophisticated AI capabilities right now. While Apple’s future Siri might boast deeper integration, these readily available AI assistants are showcasing the immediate potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced voice assistant technology on iPhones. This early access is crucial for users eager to leverage AI in their daily routines, including staying updated on the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Consider these advantages of having Google Gemini accessible from your iPhone lock screen: Instant Information Access: Quickly ask Gemini about the latest crypto market trends, token prices, or blockchain news without unlocking your phone. Hands-Free Convenience: Use voice commands via Gemini Live to set reminders for important crypto events, like token launches or staking deadlines. Enhanced Productivity: Manage your schedule by adding calendar events directly through the Gemini widget, ensuring you never miss critical crypto webinars or meetings. Rapid Image Analysis: Use the camera widget to snap a picture and instantly upload it to Gemini for analysis – imagine quickly identifying a crypto logo or analyzing a chart screenshot. Seamless Text Chat: Jump directly into a text chat with Gemini for more detailed inquiries or complex questions related to blockchain technology or DeFi strategies. Beyond Voice: Exploring Other Gemini iOS Widgets The updated Gemini app isn’t just about voice commands. It offers a suite of iOS widgets designed to enhance your mobile AI experience: Widget Functionality Benefit for Crypto Users Gemini Live (Voice) Real-time voice interaction with Gemini.

In-depth crypto queries, strategy discussions, detailed information. What’s Next for Gemini and Mobile AI? Google isn’t stopping here. They’ve also announced upcoming features for Android Gemini users, including the ability to ask questions about video and on-screen content in real-time. These features, originating from Project Astra, Google DeepMind’s multimodal AI project, are gradually being integrated into the Gemini app. Initially, these advanced capabilities will be available to subscribers of Google’s Gemini Advanced plan, priced at $20 a month.

Nasdaq Files for Grayscale’s Spot Hedera (HBAR) ETF Amid Growing Altcoin ETF Momentum The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has officially submitted a 19b-4 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to list and trade Grayscale’s spot Hedera (HBAR) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This marks another significant development in the expanding landscape of cryptocurrency ETFs, as institutional demand for digital assets continues to rise. The filing, made on Monday, is part of the two-step process required to propose a crypto ETF for regulatory approval. Once the SEC acknowledges the submission, it will be published in the Federal Register, initiating a structured review process by the agency. This latest move by Nasdaq comes just a week after the exchange submitted a similar filing for Canary Capital’s spot HBAR ETF. The back-to-back applications indicate growing interest in Hedera (HBAR) as an investment-grade asset and suggest that the altcoin ETF market is quickly evolving beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hedera Hashgraph is a decentralized public network that operates on a Hashgraph consensus mechanism, offering an alternative to traditional blockchain solutions. Unlike proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks, Hedera’s unique consensus system provides faster transaction speeds, improved security, and lower fees. Governance of the Hedera network is handled by a council of major industry players, including Google, IBM, Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, and LG Electronics. This corporate backing has given the project a level of legitimacy and institutional trust that many other cryptocurrencies struggle to achieve. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, has noted that Hedera and Litecoin currently hold the best odds of securing SEC approval for their respective spot ETFs. Given their advanced progress in regulatory discussions, these altcoin ETFs may be among the first approved beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Following the reelection of Donald Trump, the SEC has seen an influx of crypto ETF filings. This shift signals renewed optimism that a crypto-friendly regulatory landscape is emerging, which could lead to approvals for a variety of altcoin ETFs. In addition to HBAR, issuers have already filed for spot ETFs tied to: Solana (SOL) XRP (XRP) Cardano (ADA) Litecoin (LTC) Dogecoin (DOGE) Recently, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also filed a 19b-4 form for Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF, further fueling speculation that regulators may greenlight altcoin-based ETFs in the near future. Will the SEC Approve Hedera’s ETF? While Bitcoin spot ETFs received their long-awaited approval in January 2024, altcoin ETFs still face regulatory hurdles. The SEC has historically been hesitant to approve non-BTC/ETH crypto products due to concerns over market manipulation, liquidity, and security compliance. However, with increasing institutional demand and Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto, many experts believe that the first altcoin ETF approvals could arrive by mid-2025. Analysts predict that HBAR’s strong governance model and transparent compliance efforts could make it an attractive candidate for approval, potentially paving the way for broader altcoin ETF adoption. Nasdaq’s filing for Grayscale’s HBAR ETF marks another milestone in the race to bring altcoin ETFs to the US market. With major exchanges like Nasdaq and NYSE backing these proposals, and regulatory attitudes shifting post-election, the chances of seeing more diverse crypto investment products are steadily increasing. The SEC’s decision on Grayscale’s HBAR ETF could set a precedent for future altcoin ETFs. If approved, it may open the floodgates for a new wave of institutional crypto investments, further legitimizing digital assets as a mainstream financial instrument. For now, all eyes remain on the SEC as the regulatory clock starts ticking on the latest round of crypto ETF applications. SEC Delays Decision on Cboe’s Ether ETF Options, Pushing Final Ruling to May Nasdaq’s filing of the Hedera ETF comes days after the SEC once again postponed its decision on whether to approve Cboe Exchange’s request to list options on Ether ETFs. In a regulatory filing dated Feb. 28, the agency extended its deadline until May, citing the need for additional time to review the proposal. This marks the second delay for Cboe’s application, which was originally submitted in August 2024. The SEC had previously extended its review period in October, a move that signaled growing regulatory scrutiny over derivative products tied to cryptocurrency ETFs. Cboe’s request specifically seeks to list options on the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), one of the most prominent Ether ETFs in the US market. According to VettaFi data , FETH has amassed around $1.3 billion in net assets, making it one of the leading Ethereum investment products available. This delay mirrors the SEC’s Feb. 7 response to Nasdaq ISE, which also sought approval to list options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is currently the largest Ether ETF, boasting more than $3.7 billion in assets under management. The SEC has given itself until April to make a final ruling on that application. Despite these delays, the demand for Ether ETFs continues to grow. Since Ethereum spot ETFs launched in July 2024, the sector has attracted approximately $11 billion in total net assets, signaling institutional investors' appetite for regulated Ethereum investment products. The creation of an options market for ETH ETFs is widely seen as a critical step toward mainstream institutional adoption. Options are financial contracts that grant traders the right—but not the obligation—to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset at a predetermined price. These instruments provide investors with flexibility in hedging, leverage opportunities, and additional risk management strategies. The precedent for crypto ETF options was set in November 2024, when options trading began for spot Bitcoin ETFs. On its first trading day, options contracts on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw an impressive $2 billion in total exposure, showcasing robust market demand. A similar response is expected for Ethereum ETF options, should the SEC eventually approve them. While the SEC remains cautious about expanding ETF-linked derivatives, the broader crypto derivatives market continues to evolve. Investment managers argue that the expansion of cryptocurrency ETF options in the US could accelerate institutional adoption and unlock significant upside potential for investors. The SEC’s stance on Ethereum ETF options comes at a time when other crypto derivative products are gaining traction. On Feb. 19, Coinbase launched Solana (SOL) futures, adding another major digital asset to the growing list of tradeable crypto derivatives. On Feb. 28, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group announced its plans to launch SOL futures contracts on March 17, pending regulatory approval. The Trump Administration’s Pro-Crypto Policies Could Influence the SEC’s Decisions One factor that could influence the SEC’s decision-making process is the Trump administration’s increasingly pro-crypto stance. Since his reelection, President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to make the US the “world’s crypto capital.” His administration has already begun appointing crypto-friendly officials to key financial regulatory positions, fueling speculation that the SEC could speed up approvals for a variety of crypto financial products, including ETF-linked options. With the SEC now targeting May for a decision on Cboe’s Ether ETF options and April for a ruling on Nasdaq ISE’s application for BlackRock’s ETH ETF options, the market remains in a state of anticipation. A favorable decision could signal a major milestone for Ethereum adoption, unlocking new avenues for institutional investors and improving liquidity in the crypto derivatives market. Conversely, further delays or outright denials could stall momentum for ETH derivatives, potentially slowing institutional inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem. For now, all eyes remain on the SEC, as the crypto industry awaits clarity on the future of Ethereum ETF options trading in the US.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|MARKET|ALTCOIN|HBAR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-04 10:00:00

Just when you thought the crypto narrative couldn’t get any more intriguing, El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) has made waves again, reinforcing its commitment to Bitcoin. Let’s dive into the details of this latest Bitcoin purchase and explore what it signifies for the nation and the broader crypto landscape. Why Another Bitcoin Purchase for El Salvador? In a recent announcement that reverberated across the crypto community, ONBTC declared on X (formerly Twitter) that El Salvador has added five more Bitcoin to its treasury. This might seem like a modest amount, but it’s a powerful signal of the country’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin, especially as crypto regulations become a global focal point. So, what’s driving this continued accumulation of Bitcoin? Doubling Down on a Vision: El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin, viewing it as a tool for financial inclusion and economic growth. This latest purchase reinforces that vision. Strategic Accumulation: Buying Bitcoin incrementally, especially during market dips, can be a strategic move to average out the purchase price and potentially benefit from future price appreciation. Confidence Signal: Despite market fluctuations and external pressures, El Salvador’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation sends a message of confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin. [img]Image URL here[/img]El Salvador continues to invest in Bitcoin. El Salvador’s Growing BTC Holdings: A Closer Look With this recent acquisition, El Salvador’s total BTC holdings now stand at an impressive 6,100.18 BTC. At current market prices, this translates to approximately $509 million. Let’s break down what this means in real terms: Metric Value Total Bitcoin Holdings 6,100.18 BTC Estimated Value (USD) $509 Million Significance Demonstrates strong commitment to Bitcoin strategy This substantial BTC holdings position El Salvador as a unique case study in national Bitcoin adoption. It’s a bold experiment that the world is watching closely, particularly other nations considering digital currency strategies. Navigating Crypto Regulations and IMF Pressure It’s no secret that El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption journey hasn’t been without its challenges. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed concerns and urged El Salvador to reconsider its Bitcoin policies. In response, El Salvador has reportedly tightened crypto regulations concerning Bitcoin purchases and holdings. What are these regulations, and why are they significant? Increased Oversight: New regulations likely involve enhanced monitoring and reporting of Bitcoin transactions and holdings within the country. Compliance Measures: These measures aim to address the IMF’s concerns regarding financial stability, money laundering, and consumer protection in the context of Bitcoin. Balancing Innovation and Stability: El Salvador is attempting to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation in digital currency and ensuring financial stability, especially under international scrutiny. The Global Impact of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bet El Salvador’s foray into Bitcoin has had a ripple effect globally. It has: Sparked Global Conversation: El Salvador’s adoption has forced a global conversation about the role of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in national economies. Inspired Other Nations: While no other nation has fully replicated El Salvador’s approach, several countries in Latin America and beyond are exploring Bitcoin and digital currency strategies with renewed interest. Tested Regulatory Frameworks: The situation in El Salvador is testing the limits and adaptability of international financial regulations in the face of decentralized digital currencies. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn? El Salvador’s ongoing Bitcoin experiment offers several key takeaways for individuals, businesses, and policymakers: Diversification is Key: For nations and individuals alike, considering Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio strategy can be a forward-thinking approach. Regulation is Evolving: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still nascent and rapidly evolving. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial. Long-Term Vision Matters: El Salvador’s commitment to Bitcoin demonstrates the importance of a long-term vision when adopting disruptive technologies. Conclusion: El Salvador’s Bold Stance on Bitcoin El Salvador’s latest Bitcoin purchase is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a statement of intent. It underscores the nation’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s potential, even amidst regulatory pressures and market volatility. As El Salvador continues to navigate this pioneering path, the world watches, learns, and debates the future of digital currency in the global economy. Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast, a financial analyst, or simply curious about the future of money, El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey is a story you can’t afford to ignore.

41140357,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=686437,1741082475,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41140357.jpeg,TRON-based USDT accelerates inflows to centralized exchanges as supply grows,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tron-based-usdt-inflows-supply-grows/,"TRON-based USDT is changing its profile, with recent inflows to centralized exchanges. Despite its high supply, this version of USDT was mostly used within the TRON ecosystem and for P2P payments. The TRC-20 version of TRON is flowing into exchanges, in a shift of its trading profile. The token’s supply is back at 63.73B , with additional inflows in the past week. The inflows also increased after Tether minted another 1B tokens for the TRON blockchain. The new mint arrived on March 1, though with a limited effect on the overall crypto market. After the latest USDT mint and increased activity, TRX remained relatively unchanged. However, after the latest market drawdown, TRX only lost a cent to trade at $0.23. TRON-based USDT accelerated its flow into exchanges during the latest bull cycle. Currently, 6.1% of USDT deposited on exchanges is coming from the TRON network. Despite the leading position of Ethereum-based tokens in terms of overall value, the TRON version makes up with activity and volumes. Binance is the largest holder of USDT on TRON compared to all exchanges. The leading market operators are in the top 10 of holders, including Bybit, OKX, and Kraken. At the same time, Ethereum-based stablecoins had a supply of 75.9B, with some outflows in the past week. Both versions of the token add to the growth and influence of USDT liquidity, with 5.2B new tokens added in the past month. USDT is attempting to recover its turnover as a tool for payments, DEX activity and transfers. In the past month, USDT increased its turnover by 6.57%, up to $25B. The regulated USDC token saw volumes above $48B, but the monthly result is down by 85% . Activity on TRON, which is 10 times that of Ethereum, is the main driver for the overall performance of USDT. TRON-based USDT offers no-fee transactions The transfers of USDT are preparing for the promised no-fee transfer shift. Justin Sun announced the change on February 25, and the shift was supposed to happen within a week. The current fee report shows that sending USDT on TRON is still priced between $3 and $6.29, depending on the status of the sending and receiving wallet. Free transactions are available on the TRON chain, with no additional expenses to onboard the token. USDT remains the stablecoin with the highest turnover and usage for both centralized and decentralized markets. USDT boosts the available liquidity on TRON, but the project’s founder aims to revive Decentralized USD (USDD). The stablecoin is riskier, due to its algorithmic issuance. One of the functions of USDT on TRON is to support the liquidity of USDD. The effect of increasing printing and activity may boost the usage of USDD for passive income, DeFi, and other tasks. However, USDD has been viewed with skepticism as a potentially risky asset. The previous version of USDD suffered de-pegs and was phased out during the bear market. After the 2024 bull market, TRON’s founder Justin Sun returned to the idea of USDD and once again started growing the token’s supply. Sun explained that currently, USDD is gaining popularity, and will offer a 1:1 swap with USDT. “ USDD is currently positioned as the wrapped version of USDT. The relationship between USDD and USDT is currently very similar to the relationship between WETH (Wrapped ETH) and ETH. Why should ETH be wrapped into WETH? Because the standards of Defi protocols are different, WETH is easier to interact with DeFi protocols,” explained Sun in a recent post on X. Sun has also tried to grow the acceptance of the TRON ecosystem, where critics have seen risk due to non-transparent creation of tokens. One of the latest bids to raise the value of TRON is the partnership and consultancy position with Trump’s investment fund, World Liberty Fi. The fund still owns 41.718M TRX , while Sun has acquired a $30M stake by buying WLFI tokens. At this point, it remains to be seen whether the TRON ecosystem will become part of the US-centered crypto activity.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President confirmed the plan to establish a cryptocurrency reserve, numerous rumours on how the composition of the proposed reserve would be have been released. Many believe that apart from Bitcoin, the US crypto reserve would include several prominent altcoins, including XRP, Solana, Ethereum, and Cardano. However, some renowned experts like Will Baxter have expressed reservations about the possible inclusion of altcoins in the reserve, appealing aggressively for the creation of a BTC-only reserve. Let’s understand what Baxter has to say! Ready? Trump Confirms a US Crypto Reserve The victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election reversed the approach of the US administration towards the crypto industry. In the initial days of the induction itself, the Trump administration introduced some aggressive policies to support the industry. The establishment of a special crypto task force under the US Securities and Exchange Commission to develop a clear crypto regulation framework and the appointment of pro-crypto leaders in key administration positions in the White House were the prominent ones among the policies adopted by the Republican government. Recently, the US government confirmed its plan to establish a crypto reserve. Currently, there is no clarity on what would be the composition of the US crypto reserve. Will Baxter, a Vice President at Braiins Mining, has strongly called for the creation of a Bitcoin-only reserve. The prime reasons why he believes including altcoins in the crypto reserve would be a huge mistake are given below. President Trump confirmed that America will get a Crypto Reserve. Sadly, it will include XRP, Solana, Ethereum, and Cardano. Here are 7 reasons why including altcoins (especially XRP) is a HUGE mistake and why the reserve should be bitcoin-only — Will Baxter (@willbaxter88) March 3, 2025 Bitcoin Is the Only Truly Decentralised Asset Baxter has highlighted the truly decentralised nature of Bitcoin. There exists no founding team to control Bitcoin. But most altcoins have centralised foundations or companies. Altcoins Has Pre-Mined Supply, Giving Insiders an Edge Baxter has emphasised the issues related to pre-mined supply. Bitcoin has no pre-mined supply. Meanwhile, the case of altcoins is different. Almost all the top ten altcoins including ETH have pre-mined supply. Ethereum pre-sold at least 70% of its initial supply. Importantly, Ripple holds no fewer than 55% of the total supply of XRP, and Solana Foundation, insiders and VCs own 50% of the total supply of SOL. Censorship Resistance and Security Issues The expert has also pointed out the importance of security. Bitcoin is known for its robust mining network. It is considered as highly secure. Are altcoins as secure as BTC? The sensible answer is no. It is not sensible to include a crypto with a questionable security framework to the national reserve of a country – which wants its economic system to be highly resistant to external threats. Ethereum’s History Proves It’s Not Immutable The expert has explained how a hack exposed the fundamental weakness of the world’s largest altcoin. Ethereum lost approximately $60 million in the DAO hack. Emphasising how Etheruem rolled back its blockchain after the hack, the expert has argued that Ethereum can be altered when convenient. Bitcoin’s Real-World Usage vs. Altcoin Speculation Baxter has also argued that altcoins see minimal real economic activity compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is used by millions as a store of value and settles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Markets Crash as U.S.-China Trade War Escalates: $500B Wiped Out , Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply vs. Altcoin Supply Changes The expert has brought attention to the issue of supply as well. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins . However, top altcoins, even Ethereum, have changed their supply rules multiple times. Altcoins Lobbied Their Way Into the Reserve Baxter has alleged that altcoins like XRP, Solana, Ethereum and Cardano have lobbied their way into the US crypto reserve. He has explained why it is unfair to include altcoins in the reserve, asking: “we don’t put tech stocks on our national balance sheet. Why would we put their blockchain equivalents there?” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Arthur Hayes Remains Bullish on Bitcoin, Sees $70,000 as Worst-Case Bottom “I still believe we are in a bull cycle and therefore, at worst, the bottom would be at $70,000, the all-time high from the previous cycle,” Hayes wrote on X. Hayes highlighted the decline in the US Treasury General Account (TGA) as a positive sign of liquidity, explaining that the contraction in TGA injects liquidity into the financial system, which can support risk assets like Bitcoin. Despite his optimism, Hayes signaled a cautious approach, saying his team would “chase dips” without using leverage, a sign that volatility remains a concern even amid long-term bullish expectations. The team's comments came as Bitcoin traded around $82,000 following a 10% drop triggered by macroeconomic concerns and Trump's new tariffs. Many analysts agree that strong liquidity indicators could help Bitcoin recover, with upcoming events like Trump’s crypto summit potentially shaping the next market move. *This is not investment advice.
