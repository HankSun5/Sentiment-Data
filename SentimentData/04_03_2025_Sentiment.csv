Qubetics Joins the Ranks of Top Crypto Assets with a Decentralized VPN Solution,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoins-success-story-repeats-qubetics-joins-the-ranks-of-top-crypto-assets-with-a-decentralized-vpn-solution/,"Bitcoin’s early days were marked by skepticism, uncertainty, and unparalleled opportunity. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009, there was no formal initial coin offering (ICO) or structured fundraising. Bitcoin could be mined with basic computer hardware, and early adopters acquired thousands of coins at virtually no cost. Over the years, Bitcoin’s rise has been nothing short of historic, transforming from an obscure digital experiment into a trillion-dollar asset. Those who recognized its potential early on have seen life-changing returns, as Bitcoin solidified its place among the top crypto assets . While Bitcoin’s best accumulation phase has long passed, the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities with strong long-term potential. Qubetics is one such project making strides in blockchain technology, introducing a decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) that enhances security, privacy, and unrestricted access to the internet. As concerns over digital surveillance and centralized control grow, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the top crypto assets to watch. Bitcoin: The Pioneer of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin emerged as a groundbreaking financial innovation, introducing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminated intermediaries. Unlike modern crypto projects that launch through ICOs or private sales, Bitcoin’s distribution was solely through mining. Those who mined or purchased Bitcoin in its earliest years had access to an asset that would later redefine digital finance. Over time, Bitcoin gained mainstream recognition as the most secure and decentralized network, driving its value from fractions of a cent to all-time highs exceeding $60,000. Bitcoin’s appeal has been strengthened by its limited supply of 21 million coins, censorship resistance, and adoption as a store of value. Institutional investors, corporations, and even governments have integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. However, with its current market maturity, Bitcoin has become more of a long-term asset than an emerging opportunity. Investors seeking projects with high upside potential are turning to the next wave of blockchain innovation, looking for the top crypto assets that offer real-world solutions. Qubetics: A New Opportunity in the Crypto Market Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency project. It is addressing a critical challenge that previous blockchain solutions have overlooked—online privacy. Traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have long been the go-to solution for internet users seeking security and anonymity. However, centralized VPN providers control user data, creating vulnerabilities where governments, hackers, or corporations can intercept or restrict access. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing network infrastructure. Instead of relying on central servers, Qubetics distributes traffic across a blockchain-based network of nodes, ensuring that no single authority has control over user data. This enhances privacy, protects against surveillance, and prevents censorship. Users can browse the internet freely without concerns over restricted access or data tracking. In an era where digital privacy is under constant threat, a decentralized approach to VPN technology positions Qubetics as a solution-driven project within the blockchain industry. With Qubetics integrating dVPN technology into its ecosystem, it is setting itself apart as a project with tangible use cases. As global internet restrictions increase and governments tighten control over digital access, demand for decentralized privacy solutions is expected to rise. Investors searching for top crypto assets with real-world applications are recognizing the significance of Qubetics and its potential in reshaping online security. Qubetics Crypto Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity The earliest opportunities to invest in Qubetics have already passed, and the project has gained momentum among investors. The whitelist stage required no upfront investment, allowing early participants exclusive access. The first presale round introduced $TICS at just $0.01, offering an entry point for those who recognized its potential early. Currently, in its 24th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0976, with over $14.5 million raised and more than 495 million tokens sold to 22,000 holders. Projections indicate that by the presale’s conclusion, $TICS could reach $0.25, offering an ROI of 156% at today’s price. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return jumps to 924%, and at $10 following the mainnet launch, early investors could see a staggering 10,137% ROI. Qubetics’ performance in this crypto presale signals strong investor confidence. With demand growing and privacy-focused blockchain applications gaining traction, its potential for long-term success continues to attract attention. As decentralized solutions become a necessity, the adoption of Qubetics’ technology could drive substantial value appreciation. Conclusion Bitcoin revolutionized finance, creating a decentralized digital asset that disrupted traditional financial systems. However, as Bitcoin transitions into a store of value, new blockchain projects are emerging with innovative applications that solve real-world problems. Qubetics is among the top crypto assets introducing meaningful advancements, particularly with its decentralized VPN, which challenges the vulnerabilities of centralized internet security solutions. As blockchain technology evolves, projects that provide practical utility will stand out in the market. Qubetics’ ongoing crypto presale presents an opportunity for early investors to gain exposure to a project that could shape the future of online privacy. With increasing demand for decentralized services, Qubetics is positioning itself as an investment worth serious consideration.

US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has assembled a dream team cutting across several departments and units of the securities watchdog. US SEC Confirms Crypto Task Force Members The SEC’s newly minted Crypto Task Force is raring to go following the confirmation of team members by Pierce. The US SEC Commissioner disclosed the team’s composition in a press release , hinting at a varied selection process. Pierce stated that the team comprises staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and several divisions within the SEC. Led by Pierce, the Commissioner had a free rein to select the task force members. “The Crypto Task Force exhibits deep expertise and an enthusiastic commitment to identifying -with the help of other talented staff across the Commission and interested members of the public – workable solutions to difficult crypto regulatory problems. The 15-man team comprises a Chief of Staff, a Chief Counsel, a Chief Policy Advisor, and a Chief of Operations. The remaining ranks are made up of 10 senior advisors drawn from various units within the US SEC. The Team Will Solve The Hardest Regulatory Issues Within days of assuming office, Acting US SEC Chair Mark Uyeda launched the Crypto Task Force to give the agency new direction. The agency is tasked with establishing the criteria for determining whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. Weeks after the announcement of the task force, the SEC disclosed that memecoins are not securities , urging the public to remain wary of scams. Pierce has hailed the new direction of the task force while criticizing regulation by enforcement during the Gensler era. The task force will be the main advisory body to the SEC on crypto-related matters. As a show of commitment, the Commission has dismissed Kraken’s case , ditching its actions against Coinbase and Gemini as well.

Kraken emphasized the importance of fact-based regulation and expressed optimism about collaborating with policymakers to create clearer rules. Changes in leadership at the SEC and White House appear to be driving a broader policy shift, offering relief to crypto firms previously targeted by enforcement actions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to a statement from the company. The case will be dropped with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Kraken will not admit to any wrongdoing, pay penalties, or change its business operations. SEC Ends Legal Fight Against Kraken, No Fines or Business Changes The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 , alleging it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, clearing agency, and dealer. The regulator also accused the company of commingling customer and corporate funds. Kraken contested the charges, leading a federal judge to rule the case had enough merit to proceed to trial. However, the exchange maintained that the lawsuit misrepresented its business and called the allegations politically motivated. But in a blog post released on March 3 , the company described the regulator’s case as baseless and politically motivated, doubling down on their claim that “Regulatory actions must be based on facts, not political agendas.” Kraken described the lawsuit as a misguided effort that misrepresented its business practices. “The SEC’s lawsuit, which mischaracterized our consistent business model, was always without merit,” the company said. https://t.co/4Ow50mZWhv pic.twitter.com/aURU02ZHU0 — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) March 3, 2025 The SEC’s move to dismiss the case comes amid a broader shift in regulatory attitudes toward the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. Kraken expressed optimism that the decision to drop the lawsuit may signal the end of an era marked by contentious legal battles between federal agencies and digital asset platforms, , pointing to leadership changes in Washington as a key factor. “We appreciate the new leadership both at the White House and the Commission that led to this change,” said a representative from the crypto platform. The company said it remains committed to working with policymakers to develop transparent regulations that support consumer protection while allowing for technological advancement. Now, pending approval from the SEC’s commissioners, Kraken says the charges will be dropped. Trump-Era SEC Policy Shift: Crypto Firms See Legal Relief Kraken’s victory marks a turning point in the SEC’s approach to crypto enforcement. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the agency pursued lawsuits against major crypto firms, arguing that most digital assets were unregistered securities. Critics condemned this “regulation by enforcement” strategy, saying it stifled innovation and pushed businesses offshore while other countries established clearer rules. Now, the SEC is taking a different path. Since the change in leadership, the agency has dropped multiple lawsuits and investigations, including cases against Consensys , Uniswap , Robinhood , and OpenSea. On February 27, it officially dismissed its case against Coinbase , further signaling a retreat from aggressive enforcement. Great news! After years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week)… pic.twitter.com/IlnoBs7N6n — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 21, 2025 This shift aligns with President Donald Trump’s broader regulatory approach. His nominee for SEC chair, Paul Atkins , is known for his pro-crypto stance, suggesting a massive change from Gensler’s approach. While Atkins awaits confirmation, acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has already begun scaling back enforcement efforts. According to a February report, the SEC has created the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) to fight crypto fraud rather than enforcing sweeping industry crackdowns. In a separate but related development, Coinbase is demanding answers from the SEC. The exchange has filed an FOIA request seeking details on the costs of the SEC’s crypto enforcement actions. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wants transparency on the amount of taxpayer money spent on investigations, lawsuits, and third-party contractors. After years of uncertainty under an enforcement-first approach that pushed innovation overseas, the digital assets industry now faces the prospect of a more balanced framework that could allow American crypto businesses to compete globally while still maintaining necessary consumer protections. This pivot raises important questions about how regulatory agencies should approach emerging technologies. As this new chapter unfolds, the challenge will be striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring market integrity; a balance that, if achieved, could position the U.S. well in a novel yet increasingly crucial sector of the global financial system.

Nasdaq Stock Market LLC made the filing on behalf of the firm as the firm pushes to expand its crypto product list. Grayscale Hedera ETF is Not New Per the filing, Grayscale plans to list the ETF product to track the underlying price of HBAR, the native currency of the Hedera blockchain. The 19b-4 is a crucial filing in the approval process for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) product. If approved, qualified investors can gain exposure to HBAR without directly holding the asset. If approved, the Hedera ETF product will trade on the Nasdaq exchange, like other funds from Grayscale investments. Key details tied to the fund, like the chosen custodian, were not disclosed. However, subsequent filings might confirm the custodian as Coinbase Custody, which the firm tapped for its GBTC and ETHE products. The Grayscale push for Hedera ETF has been spotted as early as January. Over the past few weeks, Canary Capital has pioneered the push for an HBAR ETF with the SEC . This implies that the Grayscale Hedera ETF product will not be the first of its kind. Grayscale Taking Frontline ETF Approach Over the past few weeks, Grayscale Investments has kept up with the crypto trust and ETF filings. To take a frontline position in the crypto ETF push, it has filed for the Cardano ETF , Solana ETF, and XRP ETF, amongst others. Meanwhile, the firm’s confidence in securing approvals hinges on its history with the US SEC. Grayscale won the lawsuit that compelled the markets regulator to revise its decision on Bitcoin ETF applications. Following this directive for review, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF products for trading in January 2024. Spot Ethereum ETF products followed shortly. As one of the largest issuers of these products, Grayscale has created a ready market to boost its push for more altcoin ETFs. US SEC and Crypto ETF Growth Beyond Grayscale, other asset managers are also pushing for crypto ETF approvals with the SEC. To stretch the regulator’s potential flexibility, asset managers like Rex-Osprey and Tuttle Capital have filings for Dogecoin ETF. Popular memecoins like TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK have ETF proposals to track prices. While Bloomberg has issued approval odds for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs, the chances of memecoin ETFs remain uncertain. The regulator is generally more open to the crypto market, as shown in the recently closed Kraken lawsuit . Whether this will translate to more crypto ETF approvals remains to be seen.

And some have suggested Moscow’s recent crypto pivot may be behind the Central Bank’s sudden decision. The Central Bank previously said that its nationwide rollout would take place on July 1, 2025. But in its most recent statements, the bank has announced that the launch will no longer take place as scheduled. Why Has Russia ‘Indefinitely Delayed’ Its CBDC Launch? And it has made no mention of a new launch date, leaving media commentators and analysts confused about the bank’s reasoning. Elvira Nabiullina, the Russian Central Bank Governor. (Source: RBC/Screenshot) Elvira Nabiullina, the Central Bank Governor, told Russian media outlets that Moscow will now “move on with the mass implementation of the digital ruble somewhat later than originally planned.” She added that the Central Bank would take a closer look at the results of its ongoing pilot. And she said that the bank wanted to hold new “consultation” sessions with commercial banks. Nabiullina further suggested that further talks were needed on the “economic model” that is “most attractive to banks’ clients, businesses, and people [in general].” These statements appear to suggest that the Central Bank is prepared – at least to some extent – to go back to the drawing board with some aspects of its CBDC. A Russian Central Bank employee. (Source: Telekanal Afontovo/Dzen/Screenshot) The Crypto Factor The Central Bank’s apparent lack of clarity on the matter has left media outlets with no recourse other than to speculate on the reasons for the delay. One of Russia’s top authorities on CBDCs, Insight Advocates, wrote in a social media post : “It is possible that the delay is due to a change in the Central Bank’s position on the use of cryptocurrencies in international settlements. It is possible that the digital ruble project will resume after inflation stabilizes and tests on new cross-border payment technology are complete.” The Central Bank has traditionally been vehemently opposed to crypto adoption. Nabiullina has repeatedly called for a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia . She has been the nation’s most vocal champion of CBDCs. She claims they will let Russia do business with its international partners, unheeded by Western sanctions. However, in recent times her voice has been drowned out by Russian pro-crypto advocates. Many people claim that while CBDC-powered trade is a long way off, crypto provides a powerful anti-sanctions solution that many international partners are ready to use. Reluctantly, Nabiullina has had to soften her stance on crypto, particularly after President Vladimir Putin embraced the crypto mining sector last year. Russia has been able to keep loading crude onto ships, but it’s having greater difficulty getting it off again, writes @JLeeEnergy https://t.co/4LkKCDlnYf — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 3, 2025 Trouble at the Central Bank? In an article from the IT-focused media outlet Comnews , the journalist Ivan Ivanov wrote: “The launch of the digital ruble has been postponed indefinitely. The head of the Central Bank claims that the reason is the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of medium and small banks. But perhaps this is only half of the truth.” He added that it was clear that “something has gone wrong.” Ivanov said the “main reason” was likely “the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of banks and businesses.” The journalist added: “To be honest, commerical banks are not interested in the digital ruble. It requires them – at their own expense – to build and integrate a new system that will not bring them any profits. It […] is profitable and even logical for them to try to delay the process for as long as possible.” Ivanov added that most people are “still unclear as to why exactly the digital ruble is needed.” Some of Russia’s biggest banks have previously dragged their feet on digital ruble pilot work. Most notably, the nation’s main banking association has repeatedly called for a delay . Sberbank, arguably the country’s biggest banking and IT player, was also notable by its absence in the first phase of the pilot, which launched in August 2023. In January this year, the same bank also called for a delay that would see the digital ruble launch in 2026 . Ivanov, meanwhile, noted that “despite denials,” a “persistent rumor that Nabiullina wants to leave her post” continues to circulate. Nabiullina has headed the Russian Central Bank since 2013. Prior too this, she served as the nation’s Minister of Economic Development under both Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev. She is known to be one of Putin’s closest political allies.

Official sources have been cagey about the CBDC delay thus far, suggesting that “feedback from partner banks” has “indicated a need for additional technical improvements.” However, Insight Advocates wrote that the ever-changing “international situation” could be another concern, adding: “In the context of sanctions pressure and the threat of restrictions from the United States against BRICS nations, the Russian authorities could begin testing cross-border settlements in digital national currencies.” Currently, only China has the technical capability to carry out cross-border CBDC transactions, Insight Advocates wrote, and “Russia may need more time to develop these capabilities.” The post Confusion Reigns as Russia CBDC Launch Is ‘Delayed Indefinitely’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|CBDC|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-03 23:30:00

His explanation on X sheds light on the trend that has caught the interest of the cryptocurrency community, especially as memecoins gain more popularity. XRPL Memecoin and XRP Price Schwartz explained that while memecoins do not directly affect XRP’s core utility, they can influence XRP’s price because of speculation in the market. Many investors view memecoins as high-risk, high-reward opportunities, often driven by social media trends and popular influencers. This means that sudden increases in interest or trading for certain memecoins can spark more activity on the XRP Ledger, which may then influence the overall market dynamics. Schwartz also pointed out that XRP’s price matches memecoins because of market feelings and speculation. When XRPL memecoin suddenly rises, it can make traders feel they are missing out, leading investors to pay more attention to XRP. As more people trade XRP, its price can increase. However, this rise doesn’t necessarily reflect XRP’s actual value. Furthermore, the Ripple CTO mentioned that speculative trading can cause short-term price changes for XRP, but this does not show its long-term value. He also explained that if the price of XRP goes up, it can lead to a rise in the memecoin’s price. This rise in the memecoin can generate profits, even if no profits are taken from XRP. Ripple CTO on XRP’s Value In an online exchange, David Schwartz passionately defended XRP Ledger against a critic’s claim that it operates as a “zero-sum game.” Ripple’s CTO actively engaged with the critic, dispelling misconceptions and highlighting XRP’s intrinsic value and utility. He countered the criticism by explaining the fundamental operation of the XRPL, portraying it as a platform facilitating seamless XRP transfers and issued assets. The Ripple executive emphasized that users willingly pay transaction fees for the valuable service, asserting that the benefits outweighed the associated costs. Schwartz affirmed that the XRPL is not solely a tool for transferring value but a sophisticated platform supporting various financial activities. Institutional Confidence Grows With XRP Meanwhile, institutional investors are interested in XRP. Ripple’s 2024 third-quarter market report hints at rising interest and suggests that institutional adoption has risen. Notably, 21Shares, Bitwise Invest, and Canary Funds have all filed for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Grayscale Investments has launched an XRP Trust and wishes to gain the regulatory body’s approval to convert its multi-asset fund into an ETF. These moves show that investors see value in XRP as a critical tool for guaranteeing global liquidity .

Schiff’s demand follows controversial posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, which allegedly contributed to a pump and dump scheme. Schiff is calling for transparency regarding the authorship of these posts, the individuals who had prior knowledge of them, and the financial transactions linked to the incident. Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Blasts Trump Over Alleged Crypto Pump and Dump Peter Schiff has raised concerns about the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices following two posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account. Schiff claims the posts were strategically timed to manipulate the market, benefiting individuals who had advance knowledge of their release. He has called for a full congressional investigation to determine who was involved. The economist has specifically questioned the authorship of the Truth Social posts. Peter Schiff believes certain individuals may have used insider knowledge to invest in cryptos such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) before selling at inflated prices. He urged lawmakers to trace financial transactions linked to the alleged scheme. More so, the Bitcoin critic is demanding access to emails and text messages from Trump’s staff, family, and employees. He aims to investigate any coordination behind the crypto-related posts on Truth Social. Peter Schiff added, “Donald Trump, the first crypto President, just helped pull off the biggest crypto rug pull of all time. A Congressional investigation is now warranted.” Schiff Questions Insider Trading Schiff has urged authorities to examine whether individuals close to Donald Trump benefited financially from the crypto market movements. He is calling for an investigation into who purchased digital assets before the posts were made public. The Bitcoin critic wants investigators to determine how much money was invested by those with prior knowledge of the posts and the exact timing of any subsequent sales. Schiff claims that if insider trading occurred, it would constitute a major financial scandal. The Bitcoin critic said, “We also need all emails or text messages that involve any members of the President’s staff, his or their family or friends, his campaign donors, or Truth Social employees, that relate to either of the two Sunday Truth Social posts.” Bitcoin Critic Rejects Support for BTC Reserve Meanwhile, Peter Schiff recently distanced himself from previous comments that appeared to support a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He now claims that Bitcoin enthusiasts misrepresented his statements to manipulate public perception. The economist has accused Bitcoin promoters of spreading false information to inflate BTC prices. Schiff insists that his remarks were taken out of context and that he never endorsed Bitcoin as a reserve asset. He has criticized what he calls “fraudulent tactics” used by Bitcoin supporters to influence the market. Despite Peter Schiff’s allegations, the Donald Trump administration has continued to push its crypto agenda. In a recent CoinGape report, US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce confirmed the members of the newly formed Crypto Task Force, signaling a shift in regulatory approach. The 15-member team includes staff from various SEC divisions, focusing on developing clear guidelines for the crypto industry.

A powerful directive from Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has ignited the conversation around Vietnam crypto regulation . The nation’s leader has called for the urgent establishment of a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, setting a deadline for the end of this very month. This decisive move signals a potential turning point for digital assets in Vietnam, a country with a rapidly growing tech-savvy population. Why is a Crypto Legal Framework Suddenly a Priority in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s instruction underscores the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies’ influence on the global financial landscape. For Vietnam, establishing a crypto legal framework isn’t just about keeping pace with global trends; it’s about strategically positioning itself in the burgeoning digital economy. Several factors are likely driving this urgency: Preventing Illicit Activities: Without clear regulations, the cryptocurrency space can be vulnerable to money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities. A legal framework aims to mitigate these risks and protect citizens. Harnessing Innovation: Vietnam has a vibrant tech sector and a youthful, digitally engaged population. A well-defined regulatory environment can foster innovation and attract investment in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Economic Growth: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have the potential to unlock new avenues for economic growth, including fintech innovation, cross-border payments, and new business models. Investor Protection: Clear rules provide clarity and protection for individuals and businesses engaging with cryptocurrencies, fostering trust and wider cryptocurrency Vietnam adoption. What Challenges Lie Ahead in Crafting Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations? While the Prime Minister’s directive is a significant step, creating a comprehensive and effective crypto legal framework is a complex undertaking. The Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) face several hurdles: Challenge Description Defining Cryptocurrencies: Classifying cryptocurrencies – are they currencies, commodities, or securities? – is crucial for determining applicable regulations. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulations must be robust enough to mitigate risks without stifling innovation and the growth of the crypto sector. International Best Practices: Learning from and adapting regulatory approaches from other countries while tailoring them to Vietnam’s specific context is essential. Enforcement and Compliance: Establishing mechanisms for effective enforcement and ensuring compliance with the new regulations will be critical for success. Public Awareness and Education: Educating the public about cryptocurrency risks and regulations is vital for responsible adoption and preventing scams. The Role of Pham Minh Chinh in Shaping Vietnam’s Crypto Future Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh crypto initiative demonstrates a proactive approach to embracing emerging technologies. His direct involvement signals the government’s commitment to navigating the complexities of the digital asset space. This top-down approach can accelerate the regulatory process and ensure inter-agency cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). His leadership could be instrumental in shaping a regulatory environment that fosters both innovation and responsible growth within the Vietnamese crypto ecosystem. What Could Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations Look Like? Examples from Around the Globe While the specifics of Vietnam’s regulations remain to be seen, we can look at examples from other countries to get an idea of potential approaches: South Korea: Known for its comprehensive approach, South Korea regulates crypto exchanges, requires KYC/AML compliance, and taxes crypto profits. Singapore: Emphasizes a balanced approach, promoting innovation while implementing AML/CFT regulations and consumer protection measures. United States: Takes a fragmented approach with various agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN) overseeing different aspects of the crypto market. European Union: Developing MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation to create a harmonized framework across member states. Vietnam could potentially draw inspiration from these models, adopting a blend of approaches that best suits its economic and regulatory context. It is likely that the framework will address areas such as: Licensing and registration for crypto exchanges and service providers. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Taxation of cryptocurrency transactions and holdings. Consumer protection measures to safeguard investors. Regulations on stablecoins and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Adoption in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s directive is a bullish signal for crypto adoption Vietnam . A clear legal framework, while potentially introducing stricter rules, will ultimately legitimize the cryptocurrency industry and foster greater trust and participation. Here’s what you should consider: For Crypto Investors in Vietnam: Stay informed about the upcoming regulations. Compliance will be key, so be prepared for potential KYC requirements and tax implications. For Crypto Businesses: Vietnam is becoming an increasingly attractive market. A clear regulatory framework will provide the certainty needed to invest and expand operations in the country. For the Vietnamese Government: A well-designed regulatory framework can position Vietnam as a regional leader in fintech innovation and attract foreign investment. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Vietnam’s Digital Economy Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh’s urgent call for a crypto legal framework marks a pivotal moment for Vietnam’s engagement with the digital asset revolution. While the specifics are yet to unfold, this decisive action signals a proactive and forward-thinking approach. By embracing regulation, Vietnam is not just catching up with global trends but actively shaping its future in the digital economy. The coming month will be crucial in defining the contours of this framework and its long-term impact on Vietnam’s crypto landscape. This bold move has the potential to unlock significant opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and greater financial inclusion in Vietnam, making it a nation to watch in the global crypto space.

41122507,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136357,1741046383,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Power Shift: Trump Aides Join Paradigm’s Policy Council to Revolutionize Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-aides-paradigm-crypto-policy/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, Paradigm, a leading crypto investment firm, has announced the addition of six new members to its Policy Council. What’s truly grabbing headlines is the inclusion of former Trump administration officials, signaling a potential shift in the landscape of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. Are we witnessing a new era of collaboration between traditional political heavyweights and the rapidly evolving digital asset space? Let’s dive into the details. Why is the Paradigm Policy Council attracting such attention? Paradigm is not just any investment firm; it’s a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, known for backing some of the most innovative projects in the space. Their Policy Council is designed to navigate the complex and often murky waters of crypto regulation . By bringing together individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise, Paradigm aims to proactively engage with policymakers and shape the future of digital asset legislation. The recent appointments highlight the growing importance of strategic policy engagement in the crypto industry. The newly inducted members include: Robert O’Brien : Former National Security Advisor during the Trump administration. O’Brien’s experience in national security and international policy brings a significant weight to the council, particularly in discussions around the national security implications of cryptocurrency and its regulation. Van Jones : A well-known CNN host and political commentator. Jones adds a unique perspective, bridging the gap between mainstream media and the crypto world. His understanding of public opinion and communication will be invaluable in shaping the narrative around digital assets. Jen Brown : A Democratic advisor. Brown’s inclusion ensures bipartisan representation and a balanced approach to policy discussions, crucial for navigating the politically charged environment surrounding crypto. And three other unnamed individuals, as reported by The Block. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation? The involvement of former Trump aides , particularly Robert O’Brien, in Paradigm’s Policy Council is noteworthy for several reasons: Legitimacy and Mainstreaming : Having figures from previous administrations on board lends a degree of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency industry. It signals that crypto is no longer a fringe technology but a serious sector engaging with established political players. Policy Influence : These individuals possess deep networks and understanding of Washington D.C.’s policy-making processes. Their involvement could translate to more informed and potentially favorable regulations for the crypto industry. Bipartisan Approach : The inclusion of both Republican and Democratic figures suggests an attempt to build bipartisan consensus around cryptocurrency policy . This is crucial for long-term regulatory stability and industry growth. However, challenges and questions remain: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty Despite these appointments, the overall regulatory landscape for crypto remains unclear in many jurisdictions. The Policy Council will need to navigate diverse and sometimes conflicting regulatory approaches globally. Public Perception Cryptocurrency still faces skepticism from some segments of the public and policymakers. Overcoming negative perceptions and educating stakeholders will be a key task. Balancing Innovation and Regulation The council must strike a delicate balance between advocating for regulations that protect consumers and prevent illicit activities, while also fostering innovation and growth within the crypto space. Robert O’Brien and the Paradigm Vision: A New Direction for Crypto? Robert O’Brien’s background in national security adds a fascinating dimension to the Paradigm Policy Council. His expertise could be particularly valuable in addressing concerns related to: National Security Implications of Crypto : Examining how cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit activities and developing strategies to mitigate these risks while preserving the benefits of the technology. International Crypto Policy Coordination : Navigating the complexities of global crypto regulation and fostering international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. Cybersecurity and Digital Asset Protection : Drawing on his national security experience to enhance cybersecurity measures within the crypto industry and protect digital assets from theft and fraud. The addition of these high-profile individuals to the Paradigm Policy Council underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a clear signal that crypto is moving beyond its early, Wild West days and actively seeking to engage with the established political and regulatory frameworks. This move could pave the way for more constructive dialogue between the crypto industry and policymakers, potentially leading to clearer and more supportive regulations in the future. Actionable Insights: What can we expect next? Here are some actionable insights and things to watch out for: Increased Policy Advocacy : Expect Paradigm and its Policy Council to become more vocal in policy debates and regulatory discussions. Their influence in shaping crypto legislation is likely to grow. Focus on Clear Regulations : The council will likely advocate for clear, consistent, and innovation-friendly regulations that provide businesses with the certainty they need to operate and grow. Bipartisan Engagement : Keep an eye on how effectively the council leverages its bipartisan composition to build consensus and bridge political divides on crypto policy. Global Regulatory Influence : Paradigm’s initiatives could have implications beyond the US, potentially influencing global discussions on crypto regulation . Conclusion: A Powerful Alliance for Crypto’s Future? The formation of a robust Policy Council at Paradigm, bolstered by figures like former Trump aides and prominent political voices, is a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a powerful alliance aimed at shaping the future of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. While challenges undoubtedly remain, this move signals a determined effort to bridge the gap between the crypto world and traditional power structures. The coming months and years will reveal the extent of their impact, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto regulation is becoming more sophisticated and influential, promising a potentially transformative period for the digital asset landscape.

As speculation mounts over its potential to reach $500, investors are tuning in for Litecoin’s next act. Yet, despite being a well-established cryptocurrency, Litecoin’s explosive growth potential is clouded by intense market competition. Conversely, Web3Bay (3BAY) is turning heads for a different reason. This budding decentralized e-commerce platform, still in its presale phase, has not only raised over $1.5 million but also tantalizes with projections of gains surpassing 3,633%. Is Litecoin’s journey to $500 feasible, or does Web3Bay present a more astute investment avenue? Let’s dissect both opportunities to unearth which harbors the greatest growth potential for 2025. Is Litecoin on the Verge of a $500 Breakthrough? The resurgence in Litecoin’s market activity has reignited investor enthusiasm. Recently surging past the critical $100 barrier, LTC’s current trading price of $128 reflects a robust 30% growth in the past fortnight. Technical analysis suggests that breaking the $135 resistance could propel LTC towards ambitious targets of $175 and $240, aligned with key Fibonacci levels, indicating potential for further ascents. Another pivotal development boosting Litecoin’s prospects is the potential U.S. approval of a Litecoin ETF. The SEC’s nod to a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing, coupled with NASDAQ’s proposal to trade ETF shares, could significantly draw institutional investors, potentially catalyzing Litecoin’s value. However, achieving a $500 valuation implies a formidable 290% increase from its present stance—a feat Litecoin has not accomplished in a single cycle since 2017. With the rise of agile and cost-effective blockchains like Solana and Avalanche, sustaining momentum could prove challenging for Litecoin despite a promising setup. Web3Bay’s 3,633% ROI Prospect—Capturing Investor Focus While Litecoin offers modest growth potential, Web3Bay is shaping up as a powerhouse investment with far greater return possibilities. Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce by crafting a decentralized marketplace that omits intermediaries, slashes fees, and grants transactional control to users. This platform stands apart from centralized giants by employing blockchain to foster a transparent, efficient, and community-led shopping environment. With the presale already amassing over $1.5 million, demonstrating robust investor trust, the current presale price of 3BAY at $0.005247 points to an explosive 3,633% ROI, should it hit its projected launch price of $0.1959. What Sets Web3Bay Apart? Real-World Utility: Web3Bay addresses tangible e-commerce pain points, positioning it for sustained adoption and growth. Early Investor Benefits: The ongoing presale offers a prime opportunity to acquire 3BAY at its inception price, ahead of major exchange listings. Vast Market Reach: With the e-commerce market valued at over $6 trillion, Web3Bay’s innovative model stands to capture significant market share by eliminating traditional barriers and costs. Unmatched Growth Potential: Unlike Litecoin’s gradual appreciation path, Web3Bay’s presale stage presents a remarkable opportunity for rapid value increase. Key Insights While Litecoin’s potential climb to $500 is not out of reach, it is fraught with challenges from competitive pressures and the need for sustained, large-scale institutional investment. In contrast, Web3Bay is at a nascent stage where the scope for exponential gains is remarkably higher. As it pioneers a decentralized model in e-commerce and captivates substantial early-stage funding, Web3Bay represents an irresistible prospect. For investors who missed early opportunities in trailblazers like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable foundational investment chance—one that could yield transformative returns for early participants.

SHIB’s Price Prediction Shows Optimism & LTC Could Fall,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-hits-200m-next-target-600m-with-10-upcoming-listings-shibs-price-prediction-shows-optimism-ltc-could-fall/,"Market watchers are keenly observing trends across key cryptocurrencies. The Shiba Inu price prediction is drawing attention after a spike in large-scale purchases suggests a possible price surge. The focus remains on whether these buys will drive substantial price movements or if SHIB will stabilize within its current range. Conversely, the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is causing worry, with forecasts pointing to a potential 25% decline. Reduced trading activity and growing short positions might hinder LTC’s recovery anytime soon. On another note, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making significant strides as it prepares to debut on 10 leading centralized exchanges. With $200 million already raised in its presale and providing a stunning 2,380% ROI to initial supporters, BDAG is positioned as a top crypto to follow as it approaches a whopping $600 million presale target. SHIB Price Prediction: Whale Activity Sparks Hope The Shiba Inu price prediction is once again a hot topic due to an impressive 90% increase in transactions from major holders. This uptick suggests a positive shift, with SHIB’s price prediction potentially turning bullish as large-scale holders continue to buy in. Currently priced near $0.00001424, SHIB faces crucial resistance at $0.00001660. Discussions around the Shiba Inu price prediction suggest breaking this barrier could push prices to $0.00001700 or more, while failure to maintain $0.00001500 could drop SHIB below $0.00001400. The growing whale activity remains a key influence in this Shiba Inu price prediction, with further gains possible if this trend persists. Litecoin (LTC) Bearish Outlook: Is a 25% Drop Looming? The Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is strengthening with evidence pointing to a possible 25% reduction from its current $117 value. Analysts see $141 as a significant hurdle, enhancing discussions that Litecoin’s (LTC) bearish outlook might solidify if LTC cannot surpass this obstacle. A 23% fall in trade volume contributes to the concerns among those betting short-term. While the 200 EMA indicates some resilience, the overall mood remains pessimistic, reinforcing the LTC’s (LTC) bearish outlook. A jump in short bets now surpassing $67 million this week shows an increasing trend of market players anticipating further losses. Nevertheless, some long-term stakeholders continue to amass, showing not all are swayed by the prevailing negative outlook. BlockDAG Sets Sights on 10 Major CEX Listings BlockDAG is preparing for a significant move with upcoming launches on 10 renowned centralized exchanges. Listings on these platforms not only enhance credibility but also significantly boost trading volume. With these exchanges on board, anticipation is building that their users will soon join the presale frenzy. Currently priced at $0.0248, the coin’s value is soaring thanks to a presale that has already gathered over $200 million. To date, 18.6 billion coins have been claimed, and with the 27th batch now available, early participants are enjoying a remarkable 2,380% ROI. Industry experts have dubbed BDAG a top crypto to buy, eyeing a colossal $600 million funding goal. These listings are anticipated to drive wider adoption, setting the stage for more liquidity and robust trading activity. With plans for a mainnet launch in 2025, the future looks promising for significant value appreciation. Expectations of reaching $20 by 2027 are keeping the community engaged, bolstered by BDAG’s growing network of partnerships and a vibrant supporter base. With the momentum from the presale, anticipated exchange listings, and ambitious price targets, BDAG is on a fast track to gaining broad recognition among both new and experienced crypto traders seeking the next lucrative venture. Market Trends: Optimism & Caution in Crypto Trading The cryptocurrency domain is currently a mix of excitement and caution, with the Shiba Inu price prediction indicating a potential surge thanks to increased interest from major buyers, while the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook signals a possible downturn unless it overcomes specific resistance hurdles. In the meantime, BlockDAG is making strides toward becoming a mainstream fixture with 10 significant CEX listings in the pipeline. The crypto presale has been a massive success, securing $200 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. As BDAG moves toward the $600 million mark, its escalating presence in the market positions it as a top crypto to buy, with upcoming listings poised to broaden its trading scope.

California is stepping up its game. Just when you thought the AI safety debate couldn’t get any hotter, the Golden State is back in the ring with a brand-new legislative punch. Senator Scott Wiener, the very lawmaker behind last year’s controversial SB 1047, has just dropped SB 53 – a bill that’s already sending ripples through Silicon Valley and beyond. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals closely watching the intersection of digital innovation and regulation, this is a development you can’t afford to ignore. Let’s dive into what this new California AI Bill means for the future of artificial intelligence and tech innovation. What’s New in California’s AI Regulation Landscape? After the intense discussions surrounding SB 1047, which aimed to put guardrails on potentially dangerous AI systems, Senator Wiener is back with SB 53. This new bill appears to take a more nuanced approach, focusing on two key areas: Tech Whistleblower Protection: Empowering employees at leading AI labs to speak out about potential risks without fear of retaliation. CalCompute Cloud Initiative: Creating a public cloud computing resource to democratize AI development and boost public-interest research. Think of it as a strategic pivot. Instead of directly tackling the ‘existential risk’ aspects that made SB 1047 so contentious, SB 53 carves out specific, arguably less controversial, components. But don’t be fooled – this bill is still packing a punch when it comes to shaping the future of AI regulation in California and potentially setting a precedent for the rest of the nation. Why Whistleblower Protection is a Game-Changer for AI Safety One of the most significant aspects of the California AI Bill , SB 53, is its focus on Tech Whistleblower Protection . Imagine being an engineer at a cutting-edge AI lab and noticing something deeply concerning – a potential flaw that could lead to serious societal harm. Historically, speaking out could mean risking your job and career. SB 53 aims to change that. Key highlights of the whistleblower protection aspect: Protection from Retaliation: AI developers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who report concerns about ‘critical risks’. Clear Definition of ‘Critical Risk’: The bill defines this as a risk of death or serious injury to over 100 people, or damages exceeding $1 billion. Reporting Channels: Whistleblowers can disclose information to the California Attorney General, federal authorities, or even internal colleagues. Follow-up Requirements: Companies must report back to whistleblowers on internal processes related to their concerns. This is a powerful move towards enhancing AI safety . By empowering insiders, SB 53 seeks to create a crucial check-and-balance system within the rapidly evolving AI industry. It acknowledges that those closest to the technology are often best positioned to identify potential dangers. CalCompute Cloud: Democratizing AI Development? Beyond whistleblower protection, SB 53 introduces another intriguing element: the CalCompute Cloud . This initiative proposes creating a public cloud computing cluster to level the playing field in AI development. But what exactly is CalCompute, and why does it matter? Understanding CalCompute Cloud: Public Resource: CalCompute would be a publicly funded cloud computing cluster accessible to researchers and startups. Collaboration Focus: A group consisting of University of California representatives and other experts would guide its development. Boosting Public Interest AI: The goal is to provide resources for developing AI that benefits the public, not just large corporations. Addressing Compute Inequality: It aims to tackle the issue where only a few tech giants have access to massive computing power needed for advanced AI. For startups and researchers, especially those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space exploring AI applications, CalCompute Cloud could be a game-changer. It could lower the barrier to entry, fostering innovation and potentially leading to more diverse and publicly beneficial AI applications. Imagine the possibilities for decentralized AI projects with access to state-of-the-art computing resources! Will SB 53 Face the Same Pushback as SB 1047? Senator Wiener’s previous AI Safety Bill , SB 1047, faced intense opposition, particularly from Silicon Valley. Critics argued it would stifle innovation and put California at a disadvantage in the global AI race. Governor Newsom ultimately vetoed it, citing concerns about its approach. Key Differences and Potential Challenges for SB 53: Feature SB 1047 (Controversial) SB 53 (New Approach) Focus Preventing catastrophic AI risks (existential risk) Whistleblower protection & public computing resources Controversy Level High – sparked accusations of fear-mongering and hindering innovation Potentially lower – focuses on arguably less contentious areas Silicon Valley Reaction (SB 1047) Strong opposition, labeled as harmful to competitiveness TBD – likely to be more receptive to whistleblower protection and CalCompute, but scrutiny expected Political Climate 2024 – heightened AI safety concerns 2025 – potential shift towards prioritizing AI innovation over safety While SB 53 may be seen as less radical than SB 1047, it’s still likely to face scrutiny. The political landscape may also be shifting, with some voices, like Vice President J.D. Vance, suggesting a greater emphasis on AI innovation over stringent AI regulation . The coming months will be crucial in determining SB 53’s fate in the California legislature. The Future of AI Regulation: What to Watch For California’s efforts to shape AI regulation are being closely watched globally. SB 53, regardless of its outcome, will contribute to the ongoing conversation about how to govern this transformative technology. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding these regulatory trends is vital as AI increasingly intersects with decentralized technologies. Key takeaways and what to watch: Silicon Valley’s Response: How will tech giants and startups react to SB 53? Will they see whistleblower protection and CalCompute as constructive or burdensome? Legislative Process: SB 53 still needs to navigate the California legislature. Amendments, debates, and eventual votes will shape its final form. National Impact: California’s actions often influence other states and even federal policy. SB 53 could set a precedent for Tech Whistleblower Protection and public AI infrastructure. Global Dialogue: The debate around AI safety and AI regulation is global. California’s experience will inform international discussions and policy development. In conclusion, SB 53 represents a significant step in California’s ongoing journey to grapple with the complexities of artificial intelligence. By focusing on whistleblower protection and democratizing access to computing resources, it offers a potentially more palatable approach to AI safety than its predecessor, SB 1047. Whether it will successfully navigate the legislative process and ultimately shape the future of AI remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the debate around AI regulation is far from over, and California is determined to remain at the forefront.

41122642,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136399,1741046603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking AI Impact at MWC: Two Visions Divide Tech’s Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-impact-mwc-tech-future/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to be a dominating force in the tech world, sparking both excitement and apprehension. At the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC), this dichotomy was on full display, with two prominent voices presenting radically different perspectives on the AI impact on our lives and society. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-forward individuals, understanding these diverging viewpoints is crucial as AI increasingly intersects with blockchain and the digital economy. Let’s delve into the starkly contrasting visions that emerged from MWC. The Optimistic Vision: AI as Humanity’s Supercharger Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and Google researcher, presented a compelling case for AI’s transformative potential. Speaking virtually, Kurzweil painted a picture of an AI future brimming with unprecedented advancements and benefits for humanity. His core arguments revolved around: Enhanced Longevity and Healthcare: Kurzweil believes AI will revolutionize healthcare, leading to significant extensions in human lifespan. AI-driven diagnostics, personalized medicine, and drug discovery are poised to tackle diseases and improve overall health dramatically. Renewable Energy Revolution: He highlighted AI’s role in optimizing renewable energy technologies. According to Kurzweil, “AI-optimized designs” are making solar and other renewable energy sources increasingly efficient and cost-effective, paving the way for a sustainable energy future. He boldly predicted that renewable energy will “dominate within a decade,” thanks to AI. Ubiquitous Benefits: Kurzweil envisions AI transforming “everything all at once,” showering humanity with benefits across countless domains. From smarter cities to personalized education, he sees AI as a catalyst for progress in virtually every aspect of life. Kurzweil’s presentation was a classic example of technological optimism, emphasizing the immense potential of AI to solve global challenges and elevate the human experience. He urged attendees to pay attention to the “huge gains” already being powered by AI, suggesting we are on the cusp of a technological golden age. The Pessimistic Counterpoint: AI and the Rage Machine In stark contrast to Kurzweil’s utopian vision, Scott Galloway, a tech investor and academic, offered a much more sobering perspective. Galloway’s fireside chat delivered a powerful warning about the darker side of AI, particularly its role in fueling societal division and negativity. His key concerns included: Rage-Fueled Algorithms: Galloway argued that algorithms, particularly those powering social media platforms, have discovered that “rage” is the ultimate engagement driver. These technology platforms, driven by ad revenue, prioritize sensational and divisive content, leading to increased polarization and societal fragmentation. Erosion of Social Cohesion: He painted a grim picture of a nation where AI-driven information sorting amplifies isolation and anti-social attitudes. Galloway pointed to the increasing loneliness and division in the U.S., where neighbors are losing the ability to communicate civilly, attributing this partly to AI’s influence on information consumption. Tech CEO Cowardice and Societal Impact: Galloway went further, criticizing tech billionaires for their silence in the face of democratic backsliding and social issues. He accused them of prioritizing personal gain over speaking out against policies that exacerbate inequality and undermine democratic institutions. He specifically called out CEOs like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook for not challenging what he sees as abuses of power, expressing disappointment at their perceived “cowardice.” Galloway’s message was a stark warning about the unintended consequences of unchecked technological advancement. He argued that while we are stronger technologically than ever, societal bonds are weakening, and AI is playing a significant role in this negative trend. His presentation served as a potent counterpoint to the unbridled optimism surrounding AI, urging for a more critical and responsible approach to its development and deployment. Navigating the AI Divide: Optimism vs. Realism The contrasting viewpoints presented at MWC highlight a crucial debate surrounding AI: Is it a force for unparalleled progress, or does it harbor significant risks that could undermine society? The reality, as with most complex issues, likely lies somewhere in between. Here’s a table summarizing the key differences: Perspective Key Proponent Core Argument Focus Tone Technological Optimism Ray Kurzweil AI will solve major problems, enhance human life, and drive unprecedented progress. Benefits, potential, future possibilities Utopian, enthusiastic, future-oriented Technological Realism/Criticism Scott Galloway AI algorithms can exacerbate societal problems, fuel division, and require careful management. Risks, challenges, current societal impact Sobering, critical, present-focused Actionable Insights and the Path Forward So, what are the key takeaways from these divided views on AI impact , especially for those in the cryptocurrency and tech space? Embrace Innovation with Caution: While the potential of AI and related innovation is undeniable, it’s crucial to approach its development and implementation with a critical eye. We must be mindful of potential downsides and unintended consequences. Ethical Considerations are Paramount: As AI becomes more pervasive, ethical frameworks and responsible AI development practices are essential. This includes addressing algorithmic bias, ensuring data privacy, and mitigating the potential for misuse. Foster Dialogue and Collaboration: Open and honest conversations about the societal implications of AI are crucial. Bringing together diverse perspectives – from technologists to ethicists to social scientists – is vital for navigating the complex challenges and opportunities that AI presents. Demand Accountability from Tech Leaders: Galloway’s critique of tech CEOs raises important questions about responsibility and leadership. As AI’s influence grows, it’s essential to hold tech leaders accountable for the societal impact of their technologies and platforms. Conclusion: A Nuanced Perspective on the AI Future The MWC presentations by Kurzweil and Galloway offer valuable, albeit contrasting, lenses through which to view the AI future . While Kurzweil’s optimism inspires us to imagine the transformative possibilities of AI, Galloway’s realism compels us to confront the potential pitfalls. Ultimately, a balanced and nuanced approach is necessary. We must strive to harness the immense power of AI for good while proactively addressing its risks and ensuring that its development benefits all of humanity, not just a select few. The conversation at MWC underscores that the journey into an AI-driven world requires both visionary enthusiasm and critical foresight.

41122773,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136411,1741046849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Bitwise Files for Spot Dogecoin ETF – A New Era for DOGE?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-files-spot-dogecoin-etf/,"Hold onto your digital wallets, Dogecoin enthusiasts! The crypto world is buzzing with exciting news that could potentially reshape the landscape for everyone’s favorite meme-inspired cryptocurrency. If you’ve been eagerly waiting for more accessible ways to invest in DOGE, you might just be in luck. Let’s dive into the details of this potentially groundbreaking development. What’s the Buzz About a Spot Dogecoin ETF? As reported by Watcher Guru on X, crypto asset manager Bitwise has officially thrown its hat into the ring, filing an application with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch a spot Dogecoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This is a significant step because a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Dogecoin – offering investors exposure to DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. But what does this mean for you, the average crypto enthusiast, and the future of Dogecoin? Why is a Spot Crypto ETF a Big Deal? To understand the excitement, let’s break down why a spot crypto ETF, especially a Spot Dogecoin ETF , is such a noteworthy event: Accessibility for Mainstream Investors: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a vast pool of investors who may be hesitant or unfamiliar with navigating cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. This could open Dogecoin to a significantly larger investment audience. Regulation and Security: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some may find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto space. Investing through a regulated Bitwise ETF could ease concerns about security and compliance. Simplified Investment Process: Buying and selling ETF shares is straightforward, similar to trading stocks. This simplicity removes the technical hurdles associated with buying, storing, and managing Dogecoin directly, making it more appealing to a broader range of investors. Potential for Increased Liquidity: An ETF can boost liquidity for Dogecoin as it creates another avenue for trading and investment, potentially leading to more robust and stable market conditions. Spot vs. Futures: Understanding the Difference in Crypto ETFs You might be wondering, aren’t there already crypto ETFs? Yes, there are, but the key difference lies in the term “spot.” Many existing crypto ETFs are based on futures contracts, not the actual underlying cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot ETF Futures ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds the cryptocurrency (Dogecoin in this case) Holds futures contracts that predict the future price of the cryptocurrency Price Tracking More closely tracks the actual spot price of the cryptocurrency Price can deviate from the spot price due to futures market dynamics Investor Exposure Direct exposure to the price movements of the cryptocurrency Indirect exposure through futures contracts, potentially leading to tracking errors and roll costs A Spot Dogecoin ETF , like the one Bitwise is proposing, is generally considered more desirable by many investors as it offers more direct and transparent exposure to the price of Dogecoin. Why Bitwise for a Dogecoin ETF? Bitwise is a well-known and respected name in the crypto asset management space. They have a track record of launching innovative crypto investment products. Their decision to file for a DOGE ETF signals a growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the broader meme coin sector. Bitwise’s expertise and reputation could lend credibility and attract investors to this new ETF offering. Challenges and Roadblocks for a Spot DOGE ETF While the filing is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the path to launching a Spot Dogecoin ETF isn’t guaranteed to be smooth. There are potential hurdles: Regulatory Approval: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in the United States has been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs. Getting the green light from regulators is the biggest hurdle. The SEC needs to be convinced about market surveillance, investor protection, and the maturity of the Dogecoin market. Market Volatility: Dogecoin, like many cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. Regulators may have concerns about the risks associated with a highly volatile asset within an ETF structure. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC is also concerned about potential market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space. Bitwise will need to demonstrate robust measures to prevent manipulation and ensure fair trading of the ETF. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin’s Price and Future? The potential launch of a Spot Dogecoin ETF could have several implications for Dogecoin: Increased Demand: If the ETF is approved and gains traction, it could create significant new demand for Dogecoin as ETF providers need to acquire DOGE to back the ETF shares. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand could potentially drive up the price of Dogecoin. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and price movements are influenced by many factors. Mainstream Adoption: A successful Crypto ETF for Dogecoin could further legitimize Dogecoin as an asset class and contribute to its broader mainstream adoption. Evolution of Meme Coins: The success of a Dogecoin ETF could pave the way for ETFs based on other meme coins, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the meme-driven crypto world. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? While we wait for updates on Bitwise’s Bitwise ETF application, here are some actionable steps you can consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on cryptocurrency news and regulatory developments. Follow reputable sources like Watcher Guru and Bitwise’s official announcements for updates on the ETF application. Do Your Research: Understand the risks and potential rewards associated with Dogecoin and crypto ETFs before making any investment decisions. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Your Investment Strategy: Think about how a Spot Dogecoin ETF might fit into your overall investment portfolio, if at all. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Engage in the Community: Join discussions and communities around Dogecoin and crypto ETFs to learn from others and stay updated on the latest developments. Conclusion: A Promising Development for Dogecoin? Bitwise filing for a Spot Dogecoin ETF is undoubtedly a significant and exciting development for the Dogecoin community and the broader crypto market. It represents a potential step towards mainstream adoption and greater accessibility for DOGE. While regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain factors to consider, this move signals growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Keep watching this space – the journey of the Spot Dogecoin ETF is just beginning, and it promises to be an interesting one!

NFTs are not securities.” SEC ends Yuga Labs probe into BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin after two years In October 2022, the SEC opened a probe into Yuga Labs to examine its NFT offerings and the distribution of ApeCoin. The SEC aimed to determine whether these digital assets qualified as securities under U.S. law, applying the Howey Test—a legal standard established by a 1946 Supreme Court case. The watchdog’s probe began under former Chair Gary Gensler. It was part of a wider investigation into NFTs, including probes into NFT creators and marketplaces, to determine whether some, such as fractional NFTs, were securities. Founded in 2021, Yuga Labs created some of the most sought-after and expensive NFT collections during the market’s peak, including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club. It also bought the rights to CryptoPunks, an early NFT collection that had historically fetched huge sums. The NFT conglomerate achieved a $4 billion valuation after securing $450 million in funding by 2022. The firm’s BAYC collection has generated billions in trading volume, making it a prominent player in the NFT space. SEC softens crypto stance, drops multiple investigations The SEC’s reported decision to abandon its investigation into Yuga Labs aligns with the regulator’s increasingly lenient stance toward the crypto industry under the Trump administration. Most recently, the regulator has dropped its investigation of several major crypto companies, including Robinhood, Gemini, UniSwap Labs, Consensys-owned MetaMask, and OpenSea. The SEC has also reached settlements with Coinbase and is reportedly on track to settle its case against TRON’s Justin Sun. In its announcement that it is dropping its case against Coinbase, the SEC said its Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit will weed out those that are looking to exploit innovation to harm investors, including through fraud related to blockchain technology and crypto assets. The SEC has been reversing multiple crypto-related enforcement actions taken under former Chair Gensler, such as dropping a years-old lawsuit against Kraken on March 3. However, the SEC’s long-standing lawsuit against Ripple remains in active litigation. President Donald Trump recently named XRP one of the coins included in his proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve, alongside Cardano, Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price of ApeCoin , a token linked to the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, has fallen 16% in the past 24 hours amid a broader market pullback. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Following an initial decline in recent days, BTC surged above $94,000 on Sunday. This increase was fueled by reports of an upcoming US strategic crypto reserve that includes BTC and other major digital assets. However, as of today, BTC is trading just below $93,000, signaling an unstable upward momentum in the crypto market. Amid this price movement, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst KriptoBaykusV2 highlights an evolving pattern in Bitcoin’s net exchange flow, offering insight into investor sentiment. This data suggests that exchange inflows and outflows may play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s short-term price direction. Related Reading: Top Bitcoin Inflows Hit Year-High on Binance – Should You Be Concerned? Bitcoin Exchange Flows and Investor Sentiment According to KriptoBaykusV2, on February 25, Bitcoin saw a significant inflow to exchanges, with approximately 8,400 BTC being deposited. Historically, large inflows suggest increased selling pressure, as traders move assets to exchanges in preparation for liquidation. This was followed by a decline in Bitcoin’s price, aligning with previous market trends where increased supply on exchanges often leads to downward price movements. The following day, February 26, Bitcoin experienced a shift, with a substantial amount of BTC being withdrawn from exchanges. Large-scale outflows typically indicate a preference for holding, reducing the available supply on exchanges and potentially supporting price stability. This shift coincided with Bitcoin’s price finding support and beginning to recover, reflecting investor confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. The analyst noted: In summary, those closely monitoring Bitcoin’s exchange movements should take note: Large inflows into exchanges may indicate heightened selling pressure, requiring caution. On the other hand, significant outflows suggest that investors are opting to hold, which could lead to price appreciation. We will see in the coming days how these trends continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Enough—Coinbase CEO Rejects Altcoins For US Reserves Short-Term Selling and Market Trends Meanwhile, a separate analysis by another CryptoQuant analyst, abramchart, suggests that Bitcoin holders have started selling at a loss. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) index, which measures the profitability of short-term investors, according to the analyst recently recorded a value of 0.95. This level, the lowest since August 2024, suggests that more traders are selling BTC at a loss, an indication of capitulation. Historically, such periods have been followed by market recoveries as selling pressure eases and accumulation phases begin. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: The SOPR measures the proportion of Bitcoin wallets that have held Bitcoin for more than 1 hour and less than 155 days. Values over ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a profit. Values below ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a loss., which is a sign of capitulation and a return to an upward trend.

He tells his 243,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking to see KAITO rally above the $2.50 level, about 20% higher than current prices. “KAITO just longed around this area, targeting $2.50 and higher. will take profits along the way, hope BTC is stable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, KAITO is worth $2.09. Also in the AI sector, Altcoin Sherpa says AI Rig Complex ( ARC ), a Rust-based AI agent framework, is likely sitting at a local bottom and is ready to head higher. “I still have a bag of this and still feel pretty decent about it. It’s shown a lot of strength relative to other AI coins and, although the volatility is high on it, I still think this is the relative bottom. 200 exponential moving average on the four-hour acting as a stopping point and $0.19 still seems like a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, ARC is trading for $0.22. Looking at the mid-term time frame, the trader names three of his top altcoin picks. His watchlist includes the layer-one blockchain Sonic ( S ), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Maker ( MKR ), and a toss-up of intellectual property-focused project Story ( IP ), Ethereum ( ETH ) virtual machine (EVM) chain Berachain ( BERA ) and KAITO. “If I were to choose three coins to hold for the mid-term, they’d probably be: S: good defi activity, strong rebrand, lots of $$ going on there + Andre MKR: insane chart, continually grinding higher, strong og defi prob one of BERA/KAITO/IP, all these new coins are strong.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s the Crypto Promising a 3,633% Surge.",https://thecoinrise.com/will-shiba-inu-and-cardano-reach-new-peaks-in-2025-heres-the-crypto-promising-a-3633-surge/,"Shiba Inu and Cardano have been pivotal players in the cryptocurrency scene, drawing significant attention and fostering robust communities. Both have weathered varied market cycles, yet the possibility of them surpassing their historical peaks remains a topic of hot debate. Amidst this, Shiba Inu capitalizes on its vibrant community and viral appeal, whereas Cardano continues to push the boundaries with its technological enhancements. However, a new challenger, Web3Bay , is starting to eclipse these familiar faces with its groundbreaking potential and enticing promise of a 3,633% return on investment for early investors, having already accrued over $1.6 million in its presale. Analyzing Shiba Inu’s Market Dynamics Shiba Inu, a frontrunner among meme coins, faces a challenging path to reclaim its peak price levels. Despite achieving impressive highs during the 2021 bull market, it now trades at a significantly lower level, with recent months showing a notable decline. This downturn has sparked concerns among investors about its capability to breach and sustain beyond its previous highs. While there is speculative optimism about its future performance, real traction will likely depend on substantial developments within its ecosystem, such as the successful rollout of Shibarium and other strategic enhancements. Cardano’s Prospects for Setting New Records Cardano stands as a beacon of innovation within the smart contract arena but hasn’t been immune to the market’s downturns. Despite the recent advancements and increasing trading volumes, its price has struggled to keep pace. Yet, with developments like the Chang Hard Fork, Cardano is enhancing its network’s decentralization and functionality, potentially setting the stage for increased adoption across DeFi and enterprise solutions. However, the intense competition from other blockchain networks poses significant hurdles, requiring Cardano to not only innovate but also capture substantial market traction to achieve new price records. Web3Bay: A New Frontier for Crypto Returns While Shiba Inu and Cardano work to recapture their former highs, Web3Bay is making a powerful entrance with its innovative and disruptive approach to e-commerce. This decentralized platform is set to transform the online shopping experience by eliminating middlemen, slashing transaction fees, and bolstering security—all through its trustless, peer-to-peer marketplace. By diving into a trillion-dollar industry, Web3Bay is perfectly positioned to leverage blockchain technology for a monumental shift in how digital commerce operates. Already, Web3Bay’s presale has amassed over $1.6 million, signaling strong investor trust and optimism. Priced attractively at just $0.005247 during its presale, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay offers early investors the chance for a staggering 3,633% return on investment. Such a significant growth opportunity is uncommon among more established cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Cardano, positioning Web3Bay as one of the standout investment opportunities for 2025. The true allure of Web3Bay extends beyond just its financial prospects. Unlike many cryptocurrency ventures that are propelled by mere market excitement, Web3Bay serves a tangible, utilitarian purpose that could fundamentally alter the e-commerce landscape. As conventional online marketplaces grapple with issues like excessive fees, concerns over data privacy, and the pitfalls of centralized governance, Web3Bay’s blockchain solution stands out as a superior alternative that delivers real benefits to both merchants and consumers. This not only enhances its appeal as an investment but also underscores its potential to set a new standard in the e-commerce sector. Choosing the Crypto with the Most Upside for 2025 As investors navigate the choices between Shiba Inu, Cardano, and Web3Bay, the latter presents a compelling case with both immediate and long-term benefits. While Shiba Inu and Cardano require broader market rallies and significant ecosystem developments to reach new highs, Web3Bay offers a clear path to substantial returns based on tangible advancements and market penetration. For those looking to maximize their investment impact in 2025, Web3Bay provides an intriguing alternative, promising not only robust returns but also a revolutionary change in how e-commerce operates. As the crypto landscape evolves, aligning with innovative projects like Web3Bay could prove to be a wise strategy for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, aiming to capture significant gains in the rapidly expanding digital economy.

Turbo (TURBO) is a prime example—launched as an experimental meme coin, it shocked everyone by skyrocketing to a market cap that made early buyers filthy rich. If you missed that wave, here’s your redemption shot with the top new meme coin for significant returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is storming through its presale, offering a 3650% ROI potential, and those who recognize this golden window will be sitting on serious wealth. Right now, BTFD Coin is at $0.00016, but it won’t stay this cheap for long. With over $6.25 million raised, 71 billion coins sold, and 11,200+ holders, the 14th presale stage is near its end. Analysts predict a moonshot to $0.006 after launch, and if you invest now, you could see your portfolio multiply 36.5 times. While others sleep on this gem, smart investors are stacking their bags with the top new meme coin for significant returns before it’s too late. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That Could Mint New Millionaires Every once in a while, a presale emerges that screams opportunity. Right now, that’s BTFD Coin (BTFD). Unlike the wild volatility of post-launch meme coins, presales offer investors a chance to secure assets at rock-bottom prices before the pump. With BTFD’s presale currently at $0.00016, those who get in now are locking in a 275% ROI before it even hits exchanges, and that’s just the beginning. Let’s put it into perspective. A $1,500 investment today at $0.00016 secures you 9.375 million BTFD coins . When the presale wraps up at $0.0006, your holdings would already be worth $5,625—a nearly 4x gain before public trading even starts. But the real magic happens if BTFD hits its predicted moon price of $0.006. That same $1,500 investment? It would be worth $56,250. This isn’t speculation—this is math. BTFD isn’t just hype—it’s built on Ethereum, ensuring security and long-term sustainability. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which launched on January 1, 2025, lets users earn rewards while playing, further boosting community engagement. Staking is another powerhouse feature, offering a 90% APY, meaning passive income while you wait for prices to skyrocket. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad has built a movement—one that embraces buying low, holding strong, and cashing out when the market moons. Did you miss the Bitcoin dips? Ethereum crashes? Dogecoin’s underdog story? This is your shot to BTFD and ride the bull market from the very beginning. And if you’re looking for even more ways to stack up your holdings, BTFD’s referral program makes it simple: To earn big with BTFD, simply connect your wallet on the BTFD official site , grab your unique referral code, and share it with friends, family, or your community. Whenever someone buys $50 or more, they score 10% extra BTFD, while you pocket 10% of their purchase—and if you land in the top 20, your rewards skyrocket even more. Keep an eye on your earnings, stack up BTFD, and secure your spot in the top new meme coin for significant returns before the presale ends! Turbo (TURBO) – The Meme Coin That Turned Peanuts into Fortunes Turbo (TURBO) started as a joke—literally generated by AI—but ended up making millionaires. Its presale days were overlooked, with many laughing at its experimental origins. But while skeptics stayed on the sidelines, early investors quietly loaded up. Back in its launch phase, Turbo traded for fractions of a cent, but its insane rally took it to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.0144 on December 11, 2024. At its peak, investors who had put in a mere $500 during its early days were sitting on millions. The doubters? They were left wishing they had taken the risk when it was still dirt cheap. That story isn’t unique. Dogecoin had the same fate. Shiba Inu followed suit. Every time a meme coin gets dismissed as a fluke, it ends up proving the naysayers wrong. The ones who win? The ones who get in before the hype wave crests. Turbo’s story is a reminder that missing a meme coin’s early days is a costly mistake. History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes—and right now, BTFD is playing the same song Turbo did before it took off. Will you listen this time? Final Call – BTFD Presale Is Almost Over, Are You In? If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing Turbo’s meteoric rise, BTFD is your second chance—and maybe your last. The 14th stage is almost complete, and once this presale ends, prices won’t be this low again. The $0.00016 entry point won’t last forever. When it hits $0.006, your ROI is 3650%. That’s the kind of return that turns small investments into financial freedom. While others hesitate, action-takers secure their future. If you’re waiting for a sign, this is it. The next meme coin explosion is unfolding right now. Get in before the BTFD Coin presale swings into action, or watch the top new meme coin for significant returns from the sidelines again.

BTFD Coin is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a thriving community, a high-yield staking system (90% APY), and a Play-to-Earn game already live. Its presale has raised $6.25 million, and analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, making it one of the hottest meme coins right now. How does BTFD’s presale compare to Turbo’s early days? Like Turbo, BTFD is in its undervalued presale phase, offering a huge upside for early buyers. Turbo’s launch price was dirt cheap, and those who got in made life-changing gains. BTFD’s $0.00016 presale price offers a similar early-stage entry before its moonshot. How much can I make if I invest $1,500 in BTFD? At the current price of $0.00016, a $1,500 investment gets 9.375 million BTFD coins. If BTFD hits its expected post-launch price of $0.006, that $1,500 turns into $56,250. Is there a risk in investing in meme coins like BTFD? Like any investment, meme coins carry risk, but BTFD mitigates it with a strategic presale entry, staking rewards, and a growing ecosystem. Getting in early minimizes exposure to post-launch volatility, unlike buying at an all-time high. How do I join the BTFD Coin presale? Simply visit the official BTFD website, connect your wallet, and buy at the current presale price before the stage sells out. Don’t wait—the price increases at every stage.

The SEC attached a $50K incentive for its employees in what the financial regulator is calling a “voluntary early retirement” program. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) have focused their efforts on significantly slimming the government workforce and saving the government money in several areas. Massive layoffs and federal buyout programs are the results of their efforts so far. Most recently, SEC has offered its long-term employees the chance to resign or retire for a cash prize of $50K. Photo of Elon Musk wielding the chainsaw that Argentine president, Javier Milei gave to him at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) SEC goes the voluntary early retirement route According to an internal memo from SEC Chief Operating Officer Ken Johnson, the voluntary early retirement program is open to permanent employees who were on the agency’s payroll before January 24, 2025. Employees eligible for the offer must make their decision by March 21, 2025, and separate from the agency by April 4, 2025. The program allows these employees to either resign, be transferred to another agency, or immediately retire. The memo also stated that employees who accept the incentive and return to the SEC within five years are obligated to repay the incentive in full. The Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to reduce the federal workforce have already resulted in the elimination of over 100K civilian jobs, and their momentum does not seem to be slowing down. In February, The White House instructed federal agencies to submit their plans for “ large-scale reductions in force ” by March 13. The memo from the White House didn’t provide any specific roles for termination but said to start with workers deemed non-essential during a government shutdown. Furthering their plans to save money, the memo also instructed federal agencies to submit proposals to move their offices out of Washington and into “less costly parts of the country.” It is expected that the immediate cost of the SEC’s buyout offer will be offset by eliminating further expenses on the employees who accept the offer. Additionally, the SEC has instructed all staff, including unionized workers, to return to the office starting April 14, 2025. This instruction follows an order from the president demanding that employees work in person . This order doesn’t come as a surprise, as Donald Trump ordered heads of departments and agencies to “take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements” on his very first day in office. The instructions have been met with pushback from employees as the union’s contract with the agency allows for remote work. The instruction only temporarily excludes employees who already have full-time remote arrangements or whose homes are more than 50 miles from an SEC office. Buyouts in the workforce The SEC buyout program is in line with the Trump administration’s aim of significantly slashing the government workforce. It is one of many other agencies that has offered incentives to workers to voluntarily part with their roles. Black and white photo of US President Donald Trump and DOGE head and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk sitting side by side. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) An average of 62,000 federal workers have retired each year over the past decade, according to data provided by the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), but with the strategies of DOGE and President Trump, that number is expected to rise sharply. The Department of Education offered a $25K incentive to its employees to voluntarily retire or resign. Although it was framed as a voluntary program, the announcement of the incentive also came with the threat of a “significant reduction in force for the US Department of Education” following the deadline for application. The White House also offered all 2.3M federal employees, including 783K civilians in the Defense Department, a buyout worth roughly eight months of their salary and benefits. The offer was reported to be for employees who refused to comply with President Trump’s demand for all workers to return to the office. The email offering the incentive was framed as an easy method for the administration to effectively end remote work for most of the federal workforce. Still, it also carried the threat of the “majority” of agencies seeing reductions in force following the expiration of the offer. The US Postal Service recently offered early retirement incentives of up to $15,000 to mail handlers and other support staff, citing operational changes as the reason behind the move. “The United States Postal Service is continuing to transform its business model and build an organization structured for success. As a result of our capital investments in state-of-the-art mail processing equipment and changes to our network, the Postal Service needs to reduce staffing in those facilities that are overstaffed as we continue to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service to all communities,” the USPS spokesperson said .

His remarks triggered a sharp decline in U.S. stocks during late afternoon trading, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also weakened. “They’re going to have to face a tariff. What they need to do is build their car plants and other facilities in the United States—then they won’t have tariffs,” Trump stated at the White House. Trump doubles down on tariffs, citing fentanyl crisis and trade imbalances Trump stated there was “no room left” for a deal to prevent the tariffs by addressing fentanyl flows into the United States. He also announced that reciprocal tariffs would take effect on April 2 against countries that impose duties on U.S. products. Additionally, he reaffirmed plans to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports from 10% to 20% as a penalty for Beijing’s continued shipment of fentanyl to the U.S., asserting that China “has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis.” CEOs and economists warn that Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico—which would affect over $900 billion in annual U.S. imports—would significantly disrupt the deeply integrated North American economy. The Trump administration confirmed that the tariffs would take effect on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT). At that point, Canada and Mexico will face a 25% tariff, with Canadian energy products subject to a 10% duty. Mexican officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters that Ottawa was prepared to respond. She noted that there’s a level of unpredictability and chaos coming from the Oval Office, and they would be dealing with it. Gustavo Flores-Macias, a public policy professor at Cornell University, said consumers could see price hikes within days. “The automotive sector is expected to face significant negative impacts, not only due to disruptions in the supply chains that span all three countries but also because higher vehicle prices could weaken consumer demand,” said Flores-Macias. Mexico, which first managed to evade Trump’s first round of tariffs by vowing to deploy thousands of troops to its northern border, has stepped up its anti-drug efforts and signalled it might also impose new measures on Chinese goods coming into Mexico. At a press conference on Monday before Trump’s announcement, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that her government was calm while awaiting his decision. She still stressed that Mexico would retaliate if tariffs were enacted. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum holds a press conference a day before the imposition of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico March 3, 2025. REUTERS/Luis Cortes According to Sheinbaum the country has a plan B, C, and D,” Sheinbaum said, without providing specifics. She noted that trade and fentanyl-related cooperation with the U.S. had been “very good.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, synthetic opioids—primarily fentanyl—were responsible for 72,776 deaths in the U.S. in 2023. Lawmakers and economists sound alarm on tariff fallout and inflation risks Representative Suzan DelBene, a Democrat from Washington, warned that imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico would burden American families with higher costs at the grocery store, gas pump, and pharmacy. “No president should have the power to raise taxes without a vote in Congress,” she said in a statement. Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that any inflationary impact from the tariffs would be “second-order small.” He added, “I don’t see the president wavering on this because he understands that to achieve a strong and prosperous America—with rising real wages and more factory jobs—this is the path he has chosen.” On Saturday, Trump levelled up his targeted sanction initiatives by starting a national safety probe into lumber and wood items, which might produce tremendous new tariffs. He particularly delivered to Canada, a nation already dealing with 14.5% tariffs on softwood. The prior week, Trump had actively reprimanded many Western nations for taxing American tech enterprises and threatened to sting more obstacles on billions of products. The same day, he imposed a new investigation into copper tariffs and other trade limitations. Trump intends to impose U.S. “reciprocal tariffs” equivalent to those of other nations and has either removed trade barriers. The European Union might rapidly face this initiative since the VAT taxes imposed by the European Union on its member states considerably affect the result. Nonetheless, Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s Policy Development and Review Department , believes that Trump’s “tariffs on steroids” strategy could fuel inflation and potentially push the global economy into recession.

This price fluctuation has led to millions of dollars in liquidations, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Cardano (ADA) Liquidations Data shows that a total of $40.80 million worth of ADA positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Of these liquidations, $30 million came from the long side, while $11 million came from the short side. Current Price Momentum As a result, ADA has recorded a 25% price drop in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.81. Due to this significant price fluctuation, its trading volume has dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels With the notable price drop, ADA has reached a crucial support level of $0.80. According to expert technical analysis, this support level was previously broken during the recent upside rally. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the asset holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 35% to reach $1.14. However, if the asset fails to hold this level, it could decline by 20% to $0.65 in the coming days. $110 Million Worth of ADA Outflow Despite market uncertainty, investors and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the token, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass .

The task force was announced by SEC acting chairman Mark Uyeda on Jan. 21. The task force has several aims, according to an accompanying description . They include “appropriately distinguish securities from non-securities, … provide realistic paths to registration for both crypto assets and market intermediaries … and make sure that enforcement resources are deployed judiciously.” The task force has familiar faces, and a few new ones Peirce, a vocal crypto advocate in Gary Gensler’s SEC, was named head of the task force on Jan. 21. In addition, Richard Gabbert was named the group’s chief of staff and Taylor Asher was named chief policy adviser. Gabbert and Asher are also senior advisers to Uyeda. There are 15 members of the task force. “The task force is composed of staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and other divisions and offices across the Commission,” Peirce said in the SEC announcement of the appointments. Some of the appointees are longtime SEC staffers. According to LinkedIn, Gabbert, for example, has been at the agency since 2011 and served as Peirce’s counsel for seven years. Others were hired for the task force position. Chief Counsel Michael Selig is joining from law firm Wilkie Farr & Gallagher. Asher was an aide to pro-crypto Senator Bill Hagerty for a year before joining the SEC as an adviser to Uyeda in 2023. The task force has veteran crypto defenders Senior adviser Landon Zinda came to the task force from advocacy group Coin Center, where he had been policy counsel. In October 2022, Coin Center and three individuals filed suit against the Treasury Department and its Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) seeking the removal of OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash and 44 wallets associated with it. The Tornado Cash suit was launched before Zinda joined the organization. During Zinda’s tenure, Coin Center has provided support for the Jarretts’ latest suit against the Internal Revenue Service and for Lewellen v. Garland, in which a software developer sued the Justice Department for targeting developers who create non-custodial crypto wallets for unlicensed money transmission. Before Coin Center, Zinda was counsel for the Senate Committee on Banking focusing on crypto and fintech. Zinda began his career at the Heritage Foundation. Senior adviser Chris Rice is also senior adviser in the SEC Division of Investment Management. He came to the agency in 2023 after working in alternative investments in major financial institutions. New policies precede the task force Mark Uyeda has been on the SEC staff since 2006 and has been a commissioner since 2022. U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkin to be the chair of the SEC. He has not been confirmed by the Senate yet. Atkins comes from a legal background. He was a commissioner at the SEC from 2002 to 2008 under three chairs. He has been on the staff of two SEC commissioners and was also co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance. No date has been set for Atkin’s confirmation hearing. Even without the new chair in place, the SEC has shown indications of a drastic policy change from Gensler’s strident anti-crypto stance. Since Jan. 20, when Uyeda was appointed acting chair, the agency has dropped actions against the Tron Foundation , cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken , decentralized exchange Uniswap , NFT platform Yuga Labs, MetaMask developer Consensus and financial services company Robinhood. The agency has also rescinded the burdensome accounting rule in Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 that required crypto platforms to treat all assets they custodied as liabilities.

With XRP trading at $2.19 and Dogecoin at $0.2, their growth potential appears limited compared to MUTM’s expected spike. Already in its presale phase, this rapidly developing altcoin has already surpassed over $2 million, with Phase 2 ongoing at a price of $0.015. Over 3,800 investors have already jumped on this project, looking to get a 33.33% hike in price during the next stage. Investors who buy now will enjoy a 300% profit when Mutuum Finance goes live at $0.06. Furthermore, with predictions anticipating rising to $16 in 2025, investors will achieve 1600x gains. Limited Upside: Why Dogecoin and Ripple Could Trail Behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been mainstream famous within the crypto market, yet their upside for future appreciation appears to be capped. Dogecoin, while it has a cult following and temporary social media bursts, doesn’t have strong fundamentals and real-world applicability beyond speculation. At the same time, XRP, valued at $2.19, continues to struggle with regulatory challenges, as its price movement heavily relies on legal proceedings and institutional acceptance. While the two coins may see a rise in value in the next market cycle, their potential upside is overshadowed by future projects with greater potential for growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), even at the stage of presale, is already indicating such humongous breakout potential that it’s far more of a good investment in 2025. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big DeFi Thing Mutuum Finance is fast becoming the next big thing in decentralized finance. This upcoming altcoin has already garnered over $2 million in funding and 3,800+ investors in its presale, with its groundbreaking dual-lending mechanism. Trading at $0.015 in Phase 2, investors have not much time before the next 33.33% price surge. With the initial launch price being $0.06, early investors would realize 300% returns, and analysts foresee even bigger gains during the following bull run. From its dual lending program and solid fundamentals, Mutuum Finance is turning into one of the most promising DeFi projects of the year. Mutuum Finance offers an innovative lending model that is a combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows individuals to lock stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-based liquidity pools, earning passive returns while facilitating instant borrowing. The P2P model facilitates direct lending contracts between users in a peer-to-peer manner, cutting out middlemen for greater efficiency, transparency, and autonomy. The hybrid model addresses conservative investors seeking stable yields as well as risk-taking traders seeking higher rewards. A Secure & Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is also launching a collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that offers security and price stability. Unlike volatile algorithmic stablecoins, the model is backed by full asset and therefore avoids devaluations at the click of a button. Deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and strategic liquidity management also aid long-term growth. Mutuum Finance is set to spearhead the next generation of DeFi innovation with its strong architecture and expanding adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) are constrained on the upside, with Dogecoin relying on hype and XRP battling regulation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers genuine utility with its double-lending mechanism, stablecoin and deflationary strategy. On a presale value of $0.015, early birds can earn 300% at launch and 1,600x gain if MUTM hits $16 by 2025. With more than 3,800 investors and $2 million raised, Mutuum is launching. With the next big crypto thing, the time to act is now.

Dogecoin’s goal to achieve a market capitalization resembling Tesla’s would necessitate a 2,990% increase in price to $7.82, presenting a substantial potential gain but reliant on community enthusiasm and the influence of figures like Elon Musk. ADA, currently trading below $0.75, faces downward pressure, with technical evaluations indicating possible drops to $0.70 unless it regains the $0.81-$0.84 resistance zone. Conversely, BlockDAG displays substantial advancement and community-supported expansion. With a $200 million presale, over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold, and initial participants experiencing a 2,380% return, BDAG’s operational foundation is notably strong. Its March beta launch, $30 million grants initiative, and growing user base (over 500,000 X1 Miner application users) suggest sustained value beyond simple market speculation. Dogecoin’s Market Cap Ambitions: A Feasibility Study Dogecoin maintains a broad discussion presence, supported by a dedicated community and endorsements from prominent individuals like Elon Musk. This recognition has contributed to Dogecoin’s continued relevance in the evolving digital currency market. For Dogecoin to match Tesla’s market cap, its price must reach $7.82 per coin, a 2,990% increase from its current $0.25332. Such a rise would transform 15,000 Dogecoin, presently valued at $3,798, into $117,352, attracting those seeking substantial gains. While Tesla’s acceptance of Dogecoin enhances its credibility, substantial demand growth is essential. Its community-driven appeal maintains its ongoing relevance. The examination of BlockDAG in comparison, shows a different trajectory. ADA’s Technical Analysis: Identifying Key Support Levels ADA’s price is under downward pressure, presently trading below the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart. If ADA’s price fails to remain above $0.75, a decline to $0.73 or even $0.70 is possible, indicating further weakness. Technical indicators, such as LuxAlgo Trendline Breaks, suggest a potential breakdown, making support levels crucial. The MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating reduced buying strength, while the RSI at 41.38 suggests ADA is approaching oversold conditions but is not yet at extreme levels. A breakout above $0.81 could shift sentiment, though resistance at $1.16590 and $1.34 may limit gains without sufficient trading volume. Rejection near $0.80-$0.84 validates a supply zone. If ADA’s price reclaims $0.81-$0.84, a recovery towards $1 is possible, but its ability to maintain key levels will determine its subsequent movement. The review of BlockDAG shows a different growth pattern. BlockDAG’s $200M Presale & Beta Launch: An Assessment of 30,000x Potential BlockDAG is gaining traction within the digital currency market with significant growth and strategic plans for 2025. In its recent AMA, attended by over 800 individuals, the team shared key updates, including a March beta test net launch, a $30 million developer grants program, and new team members focused on global expansion. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising $200 million with over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold. Early participants have experienced a 2,380% return, and new participants are securing coins before the next price increase. BlockDAG’s beta test net will enhance network scalability, security, and speed, inviting community participation in testing and earning rewards. The $30 million grants program supports developers in creating innovative dApps, with hackathons planned in collaboration with HackerEarth.

With 10 CEX listings planned and projections of a 30,000x increase, BlockDAG is positioned as a major digital currency opportunity. The examination of BlockDAG’s technological approach is very important. The potential of BlockDAG is very high. The future of BlockDAG is being closely watched. The analysis of BlockDAG’s growth shows real value. The progress of BlockDAG is significant. The review of BlockDAG’s roadmap is critical. Comparative Analysis & Future Outlook While Dogecoin’s market cap aspirations and ADA’s potential recovery may attract traders, BlockDAG’s strategy is based on tangible progress, not just market sentiment. Dogecoin’s path to a Tesla-sized market cap is highly speculative, and ADA’s potential gains depend on overcoming persistent downward pressure. BlockDAG is actively achieving milestones, including a beta test net launch in March and a developer grants program that promotes development. The X1 Miner application’s over 500,000 downloads and planned 10 exchange listings contribute to its expanding ecosystem. With early participants experiencing substantial returns and projections of a 30,000x increase, BDAG offers both immediate gains and potential for sustained growth.

As ADA struggles to regain ground—trading at $0.80 after falling over 40% from its December high—analysts believe a breakout could be on the horizon. A 70% rally isn’t off the table, particularly as Cardano pushes for deeper Bitcoin integration, a move that could reshape its standing in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is drawing serious attention from investors, with its presale exceeding $1.5 million over the weekend. While Cardano fights to reclaim its bullish momentum, Web3Bay is emerging as one of the most intriguing crypto plays of 2025, offering early backers the potential for exponential gains. Cardano’s 70% Upside—Is a Breakout Imminent? ADA’s price has been caught in a volatile range, hovering around $0.80. However, analysts suggest that a 70% rally could be within reach if Cardano can break out of consolidation. Hoskinson’s recent remarks have only added fuel to the speculation. In a lengthy interview, he took aim at Ethereum and Solana, arguing that neither has the infrastructure to build a robust DeFi layer on Bitcoin—a challenge that Cardano is actively addressing. Hoskinson sees Bitcoin integration as a game-changer for Cardano, unlocking access to Bitcoin’s liquidity while establishing a more decentralized financial ecosystem. With the Bitcoin market valued at over $2 trillion, the opportunity remains largely untapped. Other projects like Core and Stacks (STX) have attempted similar integrations, but Hoskinson insists that Cardano’s research-based approach and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) framework offer a superior solution. Technical analysts point to the $1 resistance as a critical barrier. If ADA clears this level, the next target sits at $1.36, aligning with the projected 70% rally. However, sustaining momentum will depend on continued adoption, network advancements, and successful Bitcoin integration. Web3Bay’s Presale Crosses $1.5M—A Sleeping Giant? While Cardano eyes a breakout, Web3Bay’s presale is already hitting major milestones. Surpassing $1.5 million over the weekend, the project has quickly become one of the fastest-growing crypto startups of 2025. Web3Bay is shaking up the e-commerce industry by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes intermediaries, lowers transaction costs, and empowers buyers and sellers through blockchain technology. Unlike centralized giants such as Amazon and eBay—known for high fees and seller restrictions—Web3Bay offers a peer-to-peer ecosystem where users maintain full control over transactions. Investor interest in Web3Bay has been surging, with demand for its 3BAY token driving its presale success. Currently priced at $0.005247, the token is expected to launch at $0.1959, potentially delivering a staggering 3,633% return for early investors. The project’s appeal lies in its ability to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. Blockchain-based e-commerce is still in its infancy, giving Web3Bay a critical first-mover advantage in decentralized marketplaces. Which Crypto Has the Biggest Growth Potential? Both Cardano and Web3Bay offer compelling opportunities, but their appeal depends on investment strategy and risk tolerance. Cardano, an established blockchain with a dedicated community, could see a major upswing if its Bitcoin integration succeeds. However, ADA’s short-term prospects hinge on breaking key resistance levels and gaining broader adoption in the DeFi space. A 70% rally is possible, but long-term growth will depend on Cardano delivering on its ambitious plans. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is in its early adoption phase, meaning its potential upside is far greater. With an estimated ROI of 3,633% for presale participants, it represents a rare opportunity to enter a high-growth project before widespread adoption. For those looking for a more established yet potentially slower-moving investment, Cardano remains a solid choice. But for investors willing to take a chance on an early-stage disruptor with massive potential, Web3Bay stands out as one of the most exciting opportunities in the market. With Cardano pushing toward a breakout and Web3Bay gaining momentum in its presale, the question is clear—will you wait for established cryptos to regain their footing, or will you get ahead of the curve with an emerging project that could redefine its sector?

41126459,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=706124,1741053636,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Will Bitcoin Rise Or Fall Again? QCP Questions Trump-Fueled Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rise-or-fall-again-qcp-questions-trump-rally/,"Bitcoin surged past $95,000 during low-liquidity trading hours on Sunday after US President Donald Trump made a major announcement. The formation of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), set the market ablaze with speculation. Many traders viewed this as a defining moment, one that could solidify crypto’s place in the U.S. financial system, while others remained wary, questioning whether the rally could sustain itself beyond the immediate reaction. Among those skeptical is QCP Capital. A Well-Timed Political Bitcoin Play? The timing of Trump’s announcement is difficult to ignore. Throughout the past week, risk assets faced mounting pressure as global markets reacted negatively to a series of economic and geopolitical developments. Trump’s newly imposed tariffs rattled investor confidence, while shaky Ukraine-Russia peace talks created additional uncertainty. Stock market volatility intensified, weighing heavily on sentiment across the financial sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Average Cost Basis At $90,950 — Why Is It Relevant? Bitcoin broke below its multi-month range, showing signs of weakness before Trump’s announcement. The sudden announcement was a stark contrast to the downward trajectory risk assets had been following. QCP Capital highlighted the political strategy behind the move: “For a president who thrives on being the market’s hero, last week’s risk asset performance performance was anything but inspiring. His slew of new tariffs and shakier than expected Ukraine-Russia peace talks rattled investor confidence. So, while the timing of the SBR was somewhat unexpected, the political calculus was clear — Trump needed a win before his approval ratings starts slipping, a metric he likely takes very personally.” However, questions remain as to whether this move represents a genuine shift in policy toward long-term crypto adoption or simply a well-timed announcement aimed at stabilizing sentiment before further economic strain emerges. While Bitcoin’s rapid ascent over the weekend excited traders, QCP Capital remains unconvinced that this rally represents a meaningful breakout. The firm pointed to several key market signals that indicate Bitcoin is not yet out of the woods. QCP Capital cautioned: “Are we back in the game? Not quite. BTC is still trading near the bottom of its multi-month range and frontend crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March. The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the US administration.” Lessons From The Past: The ‘Xi Candle’ Comparison For seasoned traders, the weekend’s price action is reminiscent of a historical event in the crypto market—the infamous Xi Candle of 2019. Prominent crypto analyst Cold Blooded Shiller took to X to draw comparisons between the two events. Reflecting on the Xi Candle, Cold Blooded Shiller recalled how Bitcoin had been in a prolonged downtrend, trading at fresh lows with market sentiment at rock bottom. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China should embrace blockchain technology. The result was a massive short squeeze, with Bitcoin skyrocketing by 40% in just two days. Traders at the time believed it marked the beginning of a new bullish era for crypto. “Sentiment was very quick to adjust. You’ll be surprised (not) to hear that it didn’t take much back then to shape the whole mindset of Twitter into the positives and ability for the market to now have an infinite bid,” he wrote. However, the euphoria was short-lived. Several weeks later, China backtracked on its pro-blockchain rhetoric, implementing fresh crackdowns on crypto exchanges and warning investors about the risks of digital assets. Bitcoin’s gains slowly eroded, with price action reversing over the following month and ultimately dipping below pre-announcement levels. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Cycle Really Over? This Indicator Suggests Price Could Rebound To $130,000 “We did not immediately reverse the candle. It actually took many weeks to do that, which made it all the more painful for those trading it or those who had their bullish bias,” Cold Blooded Shiller recalled. The similarities between the Xi Candle and Trump’s Crypto Reserve announcement are striking. Both events followed prolonged periods of market weakness, both saw a dramatic shift in sentiment almost overnight, and both created a new bullish narrative that was widely embraced by the market. The key question now is whether Trump’s announcement will lead to a sustained trend shift or if, like the Xi Candle, it will eventually fizzle out, leaving late buyers trapped at the top. Key Events To Watch This Week Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its gains or extend higher will likely depend on key macroeconomic and regulatory developments in the coming days. On Wednesday, markets will receive the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, a crucial economic indicator that could influence expectations for Federal Reserve policy. If PMI data shows signs of economic weakness, it could increase speculation about potential rate cuts, which may provide a tailwind for risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, stronger-than-expected data could reinforce the view that the Fed will maintain its restrictive policy stance, potentially pressuring crypto and equities alike. Friday brings the release of the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, a key employment indicator that has historically influenced market sentiment. A strong jobs report could signal continued economic resilience, reducing the likelihood of near-term rate cuts, which could negatively impact Bitcoin. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected report could fuel risk-on sentiment, further supporting BTC’s momentum. Also on Friday, the White House Crypto Summit is expected to provide critical insights into the future of the US Crypto Strategic Reserve. If tangible announcements emerge, BTC could rise further. However, if the event fails to deliver meaningful policy direction, the market could react negatively, leading to increased volatility. As QCP Capital put it, “Just when we think Trump has exhausted his cards, he may still have more surprises up his sleeve. Will this be the push toward that elusive all-time high? We’ll be watching.” At press time, BTC traded at $90,352.

Qubetics Is Set to Ignite,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-for-significant-returns-in-2025-missed-polygon-qubetics-is-set-to-ignite/,"The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing, with new trends emerging faster than you can refresh your feed. 2025 is no exception. After experiencing a major dip in early 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have regained some ground, sparking conversations about the next big thing. But as the usual heavyweights like Ethereum and Polygon continue to ride their well-worn waves, some fresh contenders are catching everyone’s eye. In fact, some promising cryptos that could’ve been snapped up earlier in 2025 are now considered missed opportunities—Polygon, for instance. But that doesn’t mean the ship has sailed for high returns. If anything, there’s a fresh opportunity on the horizon—Qubetics ($TICS). It’s quickly becoming the next big crypto to look out for in 2025, and the FOMO around it is palpable. While other tokens struggle to bring something new to the table, Qubetics is focused on real-world solutions, setting itself apart from the crowd. From its rapidly growing crypto presale numbers to analysts predicting explosive price surges post-launch, Qubetics is worth paying attention to. Missed Opportunity: Polygon Polygon, once a darling of the Layer-2 scaling solutions, has been making waves for its ability to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities. It was one of the first projects to really show that Ethereum could scale without compromising security or decentralization. And for a while, it seemed like Polygon would only grow bigger. Its aim to support Ethereum’s ecosystem and offer faster, cheaper transactions really caught people’s attention back in 2021 and 2022. Fast forward to 2025, and Polygon’s hype has started to die down. What happened? Well, as the years went on, competition caught up. Layer-2 solutions from various blockchain networks are quickly growing, and other projects have started outpacing Polygon in terms of innovation and adoption. While Polygon still holds some relevance, it no longer holds the same level of excitement or potential as it once did. The crypto world moves fast, and while Polygon did great things, it’s just not as “hot” as it once was. So, if you missed out on Polygon during its prime, you’re probably wishing you’d jumped in a bit earlier. But the good news is, there’s still time to cash in on newer projects with even greater potential. Qubetics: The Crypto You Shouldn’t Miss in 2025 Here’s where things get interesting. If Polygon’s miss was a reminder that the crypto world is always shifting, then Qubetics is the shining example of a project that’s ahead of the curve. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain solution—it’s aiming to tackle real-world problems that others haven’t been able to address. And that’s where it differs from most cryptos. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 24th stage, having sold more than 495 million tokens to over 22,000 holders, raising over $14.5 million. At just $0.0976 per $TICS token, it’s clear that early supporters are about to see massive returns as the presale progresses. If analysts are right, $TICS could skyrocket to $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 155% return on investment. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. After the presale ends, some analysts predict that $TICS could hit $1, which would result in a whopping 923% ROI. And it doesn’t stop there. Post-mainnet launch, the price could reach $5, representing a jaw-dropping 5018% return. What makes Qubetics even more enticing is the real-world application of its blockchain. The flagship product, QubeQode IDE, is a next-gen development platform that’s designed to solve a massive gap in the tech world. Developers and businesses alike are constantly looking for more efficient tools, and Qubetics delivers. By providing a seamless way for developers to write, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps), Qubetics is positioning itself to be a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem. Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner trying to streamline your operations. You could be in e-commerce, retail, or even healthcare—no matter the industry, Qubetics could help you develop a custom blockchain solution tailored to your needs. Or maybe you’re a developer working on the next big dApp. Instead of navigating through complex, fragmented platforms, you can use QubeQode to make your life a whole lot easier. That’s the beauty of Qubetics: it’s solving problems in real ways that businesses and individuals can relate to. Qubetics’ application has already gained significant traction. For example, a freelance developer could use the QubeQode IDE to launch a decentralized app without worrying about hefty upfront costs or complicated integration processes. Similarly, larger enterprises looking to move toward blockchain could integrate Qubetics’ tools to make their processes more efficient, secure, and cost-effective.Given its early momentum and the potential for massive returns, Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025. Popular Crypto Coin To Buy in 2025: Qubetics When you hear about a coin that’s already setting new records, it’s hard to ignore. Analysts are all buzzing about Qubetics and its future potential in 2025. Here’s why this crypto could be the one to watch this year: its use case is far more robust than a lot of the coins making waves right now. Qubetics stands out because it’s one of the few cryptocurrencies solving a real-world issue. Unlike many other coins that are mostly speculative or still struggling to gain solid footing in the blockchain space, Qubetics has proven it’s more than just a “promise.” The platform is actively being used in various sectors, ranging from tech startups to established industries like finance and healthcare. But it’s not just about utility—Qubetics also offers explosive growth potential. As its presale progresses, the $TICS price is set to rise rapidly. This means that anyone who hops on board now could be looking at some seriously impressive returns when the coin hits mainstream exchanges. And given its utility in real-world applications, there’s a high likelihood that $TICS could see long-term, sustained growth after its official mainnet launch. So, why should anyone care about Qubetics in 2025? Well, for starters, it’s tackling a problem that others have yet to touch. The QubeQode IDE is not just a tool for developers—it’s something that could dramatically shift how blockchain technology is used across industries. With blockchain becoming a critical part of various sectors, businesses are actively looking for ways to integrate it smoothly into their operations. Qubetics is the bridge they’ve been waiting for. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics So, here’s the takeaway: if you missed out on Polygon, it’s not too late. But don’t sit around waiting for the next big thing. Qubetics is here and already gaining serious traction. With a revolutionary development tool and real-world applications across multiple industries, Qubetics could very well be the key to massive crypto gains in 2025.

The regulator will take no enforcement action and has not issued any charges against the firm. Yuga Labs confirmed the news in a Mar. 3 post on X, calling it a “huge win” for the NFT industry and creators. The company added, “NFTs are not securities.” After 3+ years, the SEC has officially closed its investigation into Yuga Labs. This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward. NFTs are not securities. — Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) March 3, 2025 The SEC launched its probe into Yuga Labs in October 2022 to determine whether its NFT collections and ApeCoin ( APE ), a token linked to BAYC, should be classified as securities under the Howey Test. The inquiry was part of a larger campaign against NFTs led by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, which also targeted NFT markets and fractionalized NFTs.

The SEC has dropped other investigations involving cryptocurrency companies in recent weeks, which coincides with the decision to conclude the Yuga Labs inquiry. The agency recently settled litigation with Coinbase and Kraken and concluded investigations into OpenSea, Robinhood, Gemini , and Uniswap Labs. The market anticipates that the regulatory shift will have a positive impact on the BAYC NFTS floor price , which is currently trading around13.75 Ethereum ( ETH ), down more than 90% from its peak of 153.7 ETH in May 2022. Meanwhile, on March 3, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force revealed on the regulator’s official website that it will be holding a number of roundtables for the public called “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The goal of these roundtables is to establish more precise rules pertaining to digital assets. The first event, “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” is set for March 21 from 17:00 to 21:00 UTC. These talks will explore important issues in crypto regulation and signal how the agency is changing its stance on digital assets.

Right now, many traders are overly focused on Bitcoin, believing it to be the safest bet. However, historical trends suggest that when altcoin interest is at its lowest, a significant rally is usually on the horizon. Market experts predict that altcoins are gearing up for a strong recovery, with capital expected to shift from Bitcoin to high-growth altcoin projects. While Bitcoin maintains a dominant position, an altcoin boom is approaching, and early investors in the right tokens could see substantial returns. Among the top contenders, three altcoins stand out for their potential in the next market cycle. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain solid picks, but a rising star— Web3Bay (3BAY)—is catching investors’ attention. Ethereum (ETH) — The Smart Contract Leader Ready for Expansion Ethereum has consistently been the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. Despite growing competition from other blockchains, Ethereum remains the primary hub for decentralized applications, with institutional investors increasing their exposure to ETH. With Ethereum-based ETFs gaining traction, demand for ETH is rising, and analysts believe breaking past $3,500 could trigger a strong rally toward new highs. As DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets gain adoption, Ethereum is positioned at the center of blockchain growth, making it a must-have for the next altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are driving optimism by reducing gas fees and improving transaction speeds. With ETH’s supply declining due to its deflationary tokenomics, a supply crunch could send prices soaring in the coming months. Solana (SOL) — The High-Speed Blockchain on the Verge of a 13% Breakout Solana has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a setup that often signals an imminent breakout. Crypto analyst Ali recently pointed out that Solana is primed for a 13% price move, with $193 being a key level to watch. Despite past concerns over network congestion, Solana has continued to deliver high-speed transactions with minimal fees, attracting strong institutional interest. As DeFi and NFTs continue expanding, Solana remains one of the most efficient blockchain networks, positioning it ahead of rivals like Cardano and Avalanche. With trading activity rising and sentiment improving, Solana’s next breakout could push it past key resistance zones, bringing it closer to its all-time high. However, while Solana presents a solid long-term investment, another lesser-known altcoin is gaining momentum—Web3Bay. Web3Bay (3BAY) — The Hidden Gem With 4200% Growth Potential Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which are already established, Web3Bay gives investors the chance to buy in early before its projected surge. Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes middlemen, lowers fees, and enhances security for buyers and sellers. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay impose high fees and centralized control, whereas Web3Bay offers a blockchain-powered alternative with peer-to-peer transactions, transparency, and security. Web3Bay’s presale has already exceeded $1.5 million, reflecting strong demand for 3BAY tokens. Currently priced at $0.004562, its anticipated launch price of $0.1959 suggests a massive 4200% return—far exceeding the potential gains of Ethereum or Solana at this stage. What makes Web3Bay particularly compelling is its real-world application. Many cryptocurrencies rely on speculation, but Web3Bay is solving practical issues within the multi-trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. As demand for decentralized solutions grows, 3BAY is positioned for significant adoption, making it one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. Why This Is the Perfect Time to Buy These Altcoins The market is approaching a major altcoin rally, and history shows that early positioning is key to maximizing gains. Ethereum and Solana are showing strong signs of upward movement, but the biggest opportunity lies in early-stage projects like Web3Bay. With Ethereum aiming to break past $3,500, Solana consolidating before a key move, and Web3Bay still in its presale phase, now is the time to invest before prices skyrocket. Many investors miss out by waiting for confirmation, only to buy when prices have already surged. Those who take action now stand to gain the most. Ethereum and Solana offer solid long-term growth, but Web3Bay remains the most undervalued altcoin with the highest upside. Its disruptive e-commerce model, strong presale momentum, and projected 4200% ROI present a rare investment opportunity before it reaches mainstream markets. The question is—will you act now, or will you watch from the sidelines as another major crypto success story unfolds?

This reserve will include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Following the announcement, XRP’s value surged from $2.23 to $2.99. But can the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could affect everything. Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino pointed out that the case between Ripple and the SEC has big consequences for the future of XRP and the U.S. economy. He believes that if former President Donald Trump doesn’t act soon and the SEC continues its case against Ripple, it could hurt American investments in cryptocurrencies. However, Crypto Law founder and attorney John Deaton pointed out something interesting: the Ripple lawsuit was filed just before the end of Trump’s first term, under the leadership of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. Now, four years later, XRP has a chance to be a part of a major global cryptocurrency reserve. Deaton argues that if Trump does not intervene and the case continues, the U.S. could lose out on big opportunities in the growing crypto market. “He has to drop it,” Deaton said. What’s Next for XRP? The future of XRP and Ripple largely depends on how the case with the SEC plays out. If Ripple can resolve the issue, XRP could become a major part of the digital currency world. As Deaton said, this is a critical moment for the entire crypto industry, not just Ripple. How the SEC case is handled will impact not only XRP but also the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. and beyond. In conclusion, while the road ahead for Ripple and XRP is still uncertain, one thing is clear: the decisions made in this case could shape the future of cryptocurrency, with XRP playing a key role in the new world of digital finance.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|FIAT|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:00:26

Both will serve as senior advisors to the task force, alongside career SEC staff. Taylor Asher, who previously advised former Commissioner Mark Uyeda on policy, will serve as chief policy advisor.

ETH is now back below $2,200 and might decline further in the near term. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,350 support zone. The price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,160 and $2,250 resistance levels to start a recovery wave. Ethereum Price Dives 15% Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,550 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $2,400 and $2,350 support levels. There was a clear move below the $2,250 support zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price even dived below the last low and tested the $2,000 zone. A low was formed at $2,003 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,080 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,150 level. There is also a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $2,275 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,275 resistance might send the price toward the $2,350 resistance. An upside break above the $2,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,450 resistance zone or even $2,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,020 level. The first major support sits near the $2,000 zone. A clear move below the $2,000 support might push the price toward the $1,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,750 support level in the near term.

The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability.

The latest market shakeup has turned the crypto world into a battlefield where only the strongest projects survive. Those who pick wisely now could be sitting on life-changing gains when the next bull run ignites. But here’s the catch—getting in early is the name of the game. That’s why BTFD Coin (BTFD) has taken center stage. This presale is roaring through its 14th stage with investors rushing in for its 90% APY staking, P2E game rewards, and a potential 3650% ROI moonshot. With over $6.25 million already raised and more than 71 billion coins sold, it’s the hottest bet in the meme coin universe right now. Miss it, and you might regret it when the price rockets. Ready to uncover the best meme coin presale to buy this week? Let’s dive in. 1. BTFD (BTFD) – The Meme Revolution Offering 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Ever wished you could buy the dip before a meme coin goes parabolic? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin (BTFD) is delivering—except this time, it’s pre-loaded with opportunities that no other meme coin can match. This isn’t just another pump-and-dump meme token. BTFD’s ecosystem is built to reward its holders long-term, offering a whopping 90% APY staking, a fully playable P2E game, and an ever-growing community that thrives on smart, early-stage investing. Right now, BTFD is in its 14th presale stage, with each coin priced at $0.00016. But when the presale ends, its listing price will shoot up to $0.0006, meaning early investors could already be sitting on 275% gains before the token even hits the market. Imagine throwing in $1500 at today’s presale price of $0.00016. You’d be holding 9,375,000 BTFD coins. If BTFD reaches its predicted moonshot price of $0.006, that same investment would be worth a staggering $56,250. And if that’s not enough, BTFD’s referral program allows you to earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code and invest at least $50. It’s a win-win—stack tokens and stack profits. Why does BTFD deserve a spot on this list? No other meme coin is offering this combination of high-yield staking, gaming rewards, and a presale surge that’s already bringing in millions. This best meme coin presale to buy this week isn’t just a chance—it’s your golden ticket to crypto riches. 2. Book of Meme (BOME) – The Meme Library That’s Breaking the Internet Book of Meme (BOME) is rewriting the history of meme coins—literally. It’s not just a token; it’s an entire archive of the internet’s funniest and most viral memes, stored forever on the blockchain. Its decentralized meme library allows users to create, own, and monetize memes like never before. Recently, BOME has expanded its ecosystem, integrating NFT meme minting and meme staking, where holders can earn passive income by simply owning legendary internet memes. Why is BOME part of this list? Because memes aren’t just a joke anymore—they’re an economy, and BOME is leading the way. 3. Ponke (PONKE) – The Hottest Community-Driven Meme Coin With Explosive Potential Ponke (PONKE) has been on a meteoric rise, thanks to its highly engaged community and aggressive development roadmap. Unlike other meme coins that fizzle out after a few weeks of hype, Ponke has been delivering on its promises. With exclusive airdrops, staking rewards, and a major CEX listing in the pipeline, Ponke is gearing up for another massive breakout. Why does Ponke deserve your attention? Because a strong, loyal community is what separates short-lived meme coins from long-term winners. 4. Bonk (BONK) – The People’s Meme Coin That’s Here to Stay Launched as Solana’s first meme coin, Bonk (BONK) has proven it’s more than just a fun experiment. With massive adoption across NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, and Solana-based games, BONK is showing real-world use cases. The team recently introduced BonkPay, a decentralized payment system allowing users to spend BONK for real-world purchases, making it one of the few meme coins with tangible utility. Why is Bonk a must-watch? Because it has successfully bridged the gap between meme culture and real-world adoption. 5. Brett (BRETT) – The Under-the-Radar Meme Coin Making Quiet Moves Brett (BRETT) might not have the same cult following as some of the bigger meme coins, but that’s exactly what makes it an undervalued gem. It’s been stealthily gaining momentum, with whales accumulating and rumors of upcoming exchange listings swirling around. BRETT has also teased a metaverse integration, potentially making it the next big play-to-earn contender in the meme coin space. Why should Brett be on your radar? Because sometimes, the best gains come from the coins people aren’t talking about yet—but soon will be. Final Thoughts: Time is Running Out! With meme coins making yet another explosive comeback, the question isn’t if they’ll take off, but which ones will leave you behind if you don’t act now. The one project that stands out among the best meme coin presales to buy this week is BTFD Coin. With 90% APY staking, a fully live P2E game, and a presale about to hit its final stages, this could be your last chance to lock in early-stage gains before the moonshot happens. Once it’s listed at $0.0006, the rocket launch is officially on. Are you in, or are you going to be the one watching from the sidelines when BTFD reaches $0.006?

33767162,[object Object],1741059004,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Forms Major CME Gap In Volatile Weekend Price Action, Analysts Discuss",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-forms-major-cme-gap-in-volatile-weekend-price-action-analysts-discuss/,"Although Bitcoin (BTC) managed to recover most of its losses over the weekend after tumbling as low as $78,258 on February 28, the premier cryptocurrency has created a massive new Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap, raising concerns that the digital asset may witness another pullback to the low $80,000 level. Bitcoin Not Out Of The Woods Yet According to an X post by crypto analyst Rekt Capital, BTC filled two key CME gaps over the weekend – one between $78,000 and $80,700, and another between $92,800 and $94,000. The wide range of prices reflects the extreme volatility witnessed by the top cryptocurrency over the weekend. As a result of this volatile price action, BTC has now created a new, massive CME gap between $84,650 and $93,300. Rekt Capital added that while the bottom may have been reached at $78,258 during the downside deviation, it does not necessarily mean that BTC won’t revisit that price level. For the uninitiated, a Bitcoin CME gap is the price difference between Bitcoin’s closing price on the CME futures market and its opening price the next day, created because the CME closes over the weekend while the spot market continues to trade. Past data indicates that CME gaps often work as price magnets. That said, even if BTC hits the lower end of the latest CME gap at $84,650, it would still constitute a higher low relative to Friday’s low of $78,258. Rekt Capital concluded by saying that as long as BTC holds the macro support at $93,500, “any short-term downside volatility will only present opportunities.” Fellow crypto trader Merlijn The Trader remarked that “volatility is about to go parabolic” following the creation of the new massive CME gap. According to data from Coinglass, heightened price volatility has already led to liquidations worth over $900 million in the past 24 hours. Another crypto analyst, Will, noted that the general sentiment around BTC is too euphoric for a retest of a previous accumulation range. The analyst added that they are eyeing the mid $70,000 range to accumulate BTC. Analyst Suggests More Downside For BTC While BTC currently trades close to the $90,000 level, analysts believe that the top digital currency by market cap could slip to $74,700. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted that historically, BTC tends to rebound from long-term support levels, which currently sit in the mid $70,000 range. In related news, Coinbase analysts remarked that BTC’s price is struggling due to the absence of any major near-term positive catalysts. In particular, the recent Bybit hack and heightened macroeconomic uncertainties are likely contributing to BTC’s woes. On a positive note, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are finally starting to see net inflows once again. At press time, BTC is trading at $90,170, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin analysis|Bitcoin support|btc|BTCUSDT|CME gap|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-04 03:30:04

The analyst has pinpointed a critical resistance level that XRP will need to hold lest it crashes to new lows and eradicates recent gains. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.5 TradingView crypto analyst MadWhale has shared a new price analysis focusing on XRP’s future price potential. The analyst emphasized his strong track record of cryptocurrency trends, underscoring that he has accurately identified and hit all the gain targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Pump To $3.35 On The Horizon With Bullish Cup And Handle Pattern Formation MadWhale predicts that the XRP price could crash below $1.9 to $1.5. The analyst revealed that XRP is currently in a downtrend and has been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish structure. According to his price chart, the cryptocurrency is also trading within a descending channel and fast approaching a key resistance level. This critical resistance point at the $2 mark has been tagged as a psychological level where sellers are likely to emerge and trigger further downward pressure on the cryptocurrency. If a rejection occurs at this $2.00 resistance level, MadWhale highlights that the next support area and downside target will be around $1.90, representing a 17.62% value drop. If the resistance level fails completely and the $1.90 support level breaks, the TradingView crypto analyst has forecasted another major breakdown in the XRP price. He predicts that the cryptocurrency could experience a more profound decline of 35%, possibly dropping down to the next major support level at $1.5. This crash target aligns with the lower boundary of the descending channel in which XRP currently resides. MadWhale has revealed that the decline to $1.5 could serve as a pivotal point for price stabilization, hinting at a possible reversal in the cryptocurrency once bearish pressures wane. The analyst’s price chart also shows that XRP recently tested the upper boundary of the descending channel but faced a rejection near the resistance. The main daily resistance area for the XRP price is marked in red on the chart, suggesting that $2.6 is where selling pressure might occur. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.8, already significantly above MadWhale’s daily resistance area. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan Triggers Major XRP Price Surge After experiencing a significant price crash over the past few weeks, the XRP price seems to be recovering at an alarming pace. In just one day, the cryptocurrency saw a double-digit price surge, successfully reversing its previous downtrend. Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring Analysts have attributed this unexpected sharp surge to the recent United States (US) crypto reserve plan announced by Donald Trump. The US President had included XRP in his plans for a crypto reserve aimed at boosting the country’s debt strategy and crypto dominance. As news of this strategic plan spread, the XRP price saw a 24.5% increase, pushing its value significantly above the $2.5 threshold once again.

Last week, it reached an all-time high of $2.98, but has since pulled back by around 41%. This price volatility has raised questions among investors about what’s driving the changes in its value. The token’s future is closely tied to market sentiment and exchange listings. If major exchanges list Pi, it could spark renewed investor interest, pushing the token to new highs. According to CoinCodex, Pi could surge by 234.84% this month, with a potential average price of $3.37—an increase of 101.79% from its current level. The highest price forecast is $5.64. A major factor affecting Pi’s price is the anticipation surrounding its potential listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Recently, Binance held a community vote, with 86% of users supporting the listing of Pi. However, despite this strong support, Pi Network has yet to be listed, which has led to some uncertainty among investors and contributed to the recent price dip. Despite the exchange listing delays, Pi Network is seeing increasing real-world use. Businesses in countries such as the USA, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and India are accepting Pi as payment. In China, BYD Auto Service Company even allowed customers to purchase cars with Pi, selling around 100 vehicles globally. This growing acceptance could help boost Pi’s reputation in the crypto space. March will be a key month for Pi’s future, as it could determine whether the token bounces back or remains under pressure.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:43:12
