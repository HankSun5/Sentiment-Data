Qubetics Joins the Ranks of Top Crypto Assets with a Decentralized VPN Solution,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoins-success-story-repeats-qubetics-joins-the-ranks-of-top-crypto-assets-with-a-decentralized-vpn-solution/,"Bitcoin’s early days were marked by skepticism, uncertainty, and unparalleled opportunity. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009, there was no formal initial coin offering (ICO) or structured fundraising. Bitcoin could be mined with basic computer hardware, and early adopters acquired thousands of coins at virtually no cost. Over the years, Bitcoin’s rise has been nothing short of historic, transforming from an obscure digital experiment into a trillion-dollar asset. Those who recognized its potential early on have seen life-changing returns, as Bitcoin solidified its place among the top crypto assets . While Bitcoin’s best accumulation phase has long passed, the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities with strong long-term potential. Qubetics is one such project making strides in blockchain technology, introducing a decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) that enhances security, privacy, and unrestricted access to the internet. As concerns over digital surveillance and centralized control grow, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the top crypto assets to watch. Bitcoin: The Pioneer of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin emerged as a groundbreaking financial innovation, introducing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminated intermediaries. Unlike modern crypto projects that launch through ICOs or private sales, Bitcoin’s distribution was solely through mining. Those who mined or purchased Bitcoin in its earliest years had access to an asset that would later redefine digital finance. Over time, Bitcoin gained mainstream recognition as the most secure and decentralized network, driving its value from fractions of a cent to all-time highs exceeding $60,000. Bitcoin’s appeal has been strengthened by its limited supply of 21 million coins, censorship resistance, and adoption as a store of value. Institutional investors, corporations, and even governments have integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. However, with its current market maturity, Bitcoin has become more of a long-term asset than an emerging opportunity. Investors seeking projects with high upside potential are turning to the next wave of blockchain innovation, looking for the top crypto assets that offer real-world solutions. Qubetics: A New Opportunity in the Crypto Market Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency project. It is addressing a critical challenge that previous blockchain solutions have overlooked—online privacy. Traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have long been the go-to solution for internet users seeking security and anonymity. However, centralized VPN providers control user data, creating vulnerabilities where governments, hackers, or corporations can intercept or restrict access. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing network infrastructure. Instead of relying on central servers, Qubetics distributes traffic across a blockchain-based network of nodes, ensuring that no single authority has control over user data. This enhances privacy, protects against surveillance, and prevents censorship. Users can browse the internet freely without concerns over restricted access or data tracking. In an era where digital privacy is under constant threat, a decentralized approach to VPN technology positions Qubetics as a solution-driven project within the blockchain industry. With Qubetics integrating dVPN technology into its ecosystem, it is setting itself apart as a project with tangible use cases. As global internet restrictions increase and governments tighten control over digital access, demand for decentralized privacy solutions is expected to rise. Investors searching for top crypto assets with real-world applications are recognizing the significance of Qubetics and its potential in reshaping online security. Qubetics Crypto Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity The earliest opportunities to invest in Qubetics have already passed, and the project has gained momentum among investors. The whitelist stage required no upfront investment, allowing early participants exclusive access. The first presale round introduced $TICS at just $0.01, offering an entry point for those who recognized its potential early. Currently, in its 24th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0976, with over $14.5 million raised and more than 495 million tokens sold to 22,000 holders. Projections indicate that by the presale’s conclusion, $TICS could reach $0.25, offering an ROI of 156% at today’s price. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return jumps to 924%, and at $10 following the mainnet launch, early investors could see a staggering 10,137% ROI. Qubetics’ performance in this crypto presale signals strong investor confidence. With demand growing and privacy-focused blockchain applications gaining traction, its potential for long-term success continues to attract attention. As decentralized solutions become a necessity, the adoption of Qubetics’ technology could drive substantial value appreciation. Conclusion Bitcoin revolutionized finance, creating a decentralized digital asset that disrupted traditional financial systems. However, as Bitcoin transitions into a store of value, new blockchain projects are emerging with innovative applications that solve real-world problems. Qubetics is among the top crypto assets introducing meaningful advancements, particularly with its decentralized VPN, which challenges the vulnerabilities of centralized internet security solutions. As blockchain technology evolves, projects that provide practical utility will stand out in the market. Qubetics’ ongoing crypto presale presents an opportunity for early investors to gain exposure to a project that could shape the future of online privacy. With increasing demand for decentralized services, Qubetics is positioning itself as an investment worth serious consideration.

US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has assembled a dream team cutting across several departments and units of the securities watchdog. US SEC Confirms Crypto Task Force Members The SEC’s newly minted Crypto Task Force is raring to go following the confirmation of team members by Pierce. The US SEC Commissioner disclosed the team’s composition in a press release , hinting at a varied selection process. Pierce stated that the team comprises staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and several divisions within the SEC. Led by Pierce, the Commissioner had a free rein to select the task force members. “The Crypto Task Force exhibits deep expertise and an enthusiastic commitment to identifying -with the help of other talented staff across the Commission and interested members of the public – workable solutions to difficult crypto regulatory problems. The 15-man team comprises a Chief of Staff, a Chief Counsel, a Chief Policy Advisor, and a Chief of Operations. The remaining ranks are made up of 10 senior advisors drawn from various units within the US SEC. The Team Will Solve The Hardest Regulatory Issues Within days of assuming office, Acting US SEC Chair Mark Uyeda launched the Crypto Task Force to give the agency new direction. The agency is tasked with establishing the criteria for determining whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. Weeks after the announcement of the task force, the SEC disclosed that memecoins are not securities , urging the public to remain wary of scams. Pierce has hailed the new direction of the task force while criticizing regulation by enforcement during the Gensler era. The task force will be the main advisory body to the SEC on crypto-related matters. As a show of commitment, the Commission has dismissed Kraken’s case , ditching its actions against Coinbase and Gemini as well.

Kraken emphasized the importance of fact-based regulation and expressed optimism about collaborating with policymakers to create clearer rules. Changes in leadership at the SEC and White House appear to be driving a broader policy shift, offering relief to crypto firms previously targeted by enforcement actions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to a statement from the company. The case will be dropped with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Kraken will not admit to any wrongdoing, pay penalties, or change its business operations. SEC Ends Legal Fight Against Kraken, No Fines or Business Changes The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 , alleging it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, clearing agency, and dealer. The regulator also accused the company of commingling customer and corporate funds. Kraken contested the charges, leading a federal judge to rule the case had enough merit to proceed to trial. However, the exchange maintained that the lawsuit misrepresented its business and called the allegations politically motivated. But in a blog post released on March 3 , the company described the regulator’s case as baseless and politically motivated, doubling down on their claim that “Regulatory actions must be based on facts, not political agendas.” Kraken described the lawsuit as a misguided effort that misrepresented its business practices. “The SEC’s lawsuit, which mischaracterized our consistent business model, was always without merit,” the company said. https://t.co/4Ow50mZWhv pic.twitter.com/aURU02ZHU0 — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) March 3, 2025 The SEC’s move to dismiss the case comes amid a broader shift in regulatory attitudes toward the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. Kraken expressed optimism that the decision to drop the lawsuit may signal the end of an era marked by contentious legal battles between federal agencies and digital asset platforms, , pointing to leadership changes in Washington as a key factor. “We appreciate the new leadership both at the White House and the Commission that led to this change,” said a representative from the crypto platform. The company said it remains committed to working with policymakers to develop transparent regulations that support consumer protection while allowing for technological advancement. Now, pending approval from the SEC’s commissioners, Kraken says the charges will be dropped. Trump-Era SEC Policy Shift: Crypto Firms See Legal Relief Kraken’s victory marks a turning point in the SEC’s approach to crypto enforcement. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the agency pursued lawsuits against major crypto firms, arguing that most digital assets were unregistered securities. Critics condemned this “regulation by enforcement” strategy, saying it stifled innovation and pushed businesses offshore while other countries established clearer rules. Now, the SEC is taking a different path. Since the change in leadership, the agency has dropped multiple lawsuits and investigations, including cases against Consensys , Uniswap , Robinhood , and OpenSea. On February 27, it officially dismissed its case against Coinbase , further signaling a retreat from aggressive enforcement. Great news! After years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week)… pic.twitter.com/IlnoBs7N6n — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 21, 2025 This shift aligns with President Donald Trump’s broader regulatory approach. His nominee for SEC chair, Paul Atkins , is known for his pro-crypto stance, suggesting a massive change from Gensler’s approach. While Atkins awaits confirmation, acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has already begun scaling back enforcement efforts. According to a February report, the SEC has created the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) to fight crypto fraud rather than enforcing sweeping industry crackdowns. In a separate but related development, Coinbase is demanding answers from the SEC. The exchange has filed an FOIA request seeking details on the costs of the SEC’s crypto enforcement actions. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wants transparency on the amount of taxpayer money spent on investigations, lawsuits, and third-party contractors. After years of uncertainty under an enforcement-first approach that pushed innovation overseas, the digital assets industry now faces the prospect of a more balanced framework that could allow American crypto businesses to compete globally while still maintaining necessary consumer protections. This pivot raises important questions about how regulatory agencies should approach emerging technologies. As this new chapter unfolds, the challenge will be striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring market integrity; a balance that, if achieved, could position the U.S. well in a novel yet increasingly crucial sector of the global financial system.

Nasdaq Stock Market LLC made the filing on behalf of the firm as the firm pushes to expand its crypto product list. Grayscale Hedera ETF is Not New Per the filing, Grayscale plans to list the ETF product to track the underlying price of HBAR, the native currency of the Hedera blockchain. The 19b-4 is a crucial filing in the approval process for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) product. If approved, qualified investors can gain exposure to HBAR without directly holding the asset. If approved, the Hedera ETF product will trade on the Nasdaq exchange, like other funds from Grayscale investments. Key details tied to the fund, like the chosen custodian, were not disclosed. However, subsequent filings might confirm the custodian as Coinbase Custody, which the firm tapped for its GBTC and ETHE products. The Grayscale push for Hedera ETF has been spotted as early as January. Over the past few weeks, Canary Capital has pioneered the push for an HBAR ETF with the SEC . This implies that the Grayscale Hedera ETF product will not be the first of its kind. Grayscale Taking Frontline ETF Approach Over the past few weeks, Grayscale Investments has kept up with the crypto trust and ETF filings. To take a frontline position in the crypto ETF push, it has filed for the Cardano ETF , Solana ETF, and XRP ETF, amongst others. Meanwhile, the firm’s confidence in securing approvals hinges on its history with the US SEC. Grayscale won the lawsuit that compelled the markets regulator to revise its decision on Bitcoin ETF applications. Following this directive for review, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF products for trading in January 2024. Spot Ethereum ETF products followed shortly. As one of the largest issuers of these products, Grayscale has created a ready market to boost its push for more altcoin ETFs. US SEC and Crypto ETF Growth Beyond Grayscale, other asset managers are also pushing for crypto ETF approvals with the SEC. To stretch the regulator’s potential flexibility, asset managers like Rex-Osprey and Tuttle Capital have filings for Dogecoin ETF. Popular memecoins like TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK have ETF proposals to track prices. While Bloomberg has issued approval odds for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs, the chances of memecoin ETFs remain uncertain. The regulator is generally more open to the crypto market, as shown in the recently closed Kraken lawsuit . Whether this will translate to more crypto ETF approvals remains to be seen.

And some have suggested Moscow’s recent crypto pivot may be behind the Central Bank’s sudden decision. The Central Bank previously said that its nationwide rollout would take place on July 1, 2025. But in its most recent statements, the bank has announced that the launch will no longer take place as scheduled. Why Has Russia ‘Indefinitely Delayed’ Its CBDC Launch? And it has made no mention of a new launch date, leaving media commentators and analysts confused about the bank’s reasoning. Elvira Nabiullina, the Russian Central Bank Governor. (Source: RBC/Screenshot) Elvira Nabiullina, the Central Bank Governor, told Russian media outlets that Moscow will now “move on with the mass implementation of the digital ruble somewhat later than originally planned.” She added that the Central Bank would take a closer look at the results of its ongoing pilot. And she said that the bank wanted to hold new “consultation” sessions with commercial banks. Nabiullina further suggested that further talks were needed on the “economic model” that is “most attractive to banks’ clients, businesses, and people [in general].” These statements appear to suggest that the Central Bank is prepared – at least to some extent – to go back to the drawing board with some aspects of its CBDC. A Russian Central Bank employee. (Source: Telekanal Afontovo/Dzen/Screenshot) The Crypto Factor The Central Bank’s apparent lack of clarity on the matter has left media outlets with no recourse other than to speculate on the reasons for the delay. One of Russia’s top authorities on CBDCs, Insight Advocates, wrote in a social media post : “It is possible that the delay is due to a change in the Central Bank’s position on the use of cryptocurrencies in international settlements. It is possible that the digital ruble project will resume after inflation stabilizes and tests on new cross-border payment technology are complete.” The Central Bank has traditionally been vehemently opposed to crypto adoption. Nabiullina has repeatedly called for a total, China-style ban on crypto in Russia . She has been the nation’s most vocal champion of CBDCs. She claims they will let Russia do business with its international partners, unheeded by Western sanctions. However, in recent times her voice has been drowned out by Russian pro-crypto advocates. Many people claim that while CBDC-powered trade is a long way off, crypto provides a powerful anti-sanctions solution that many international partners are ready to use. Reluctantly, Nabiullina has had to soften her stance on crypto, particularly after President Vladimir Putin embraced the crypto mining sector last year. Russia has been able to keep loading crude onto ships, but it’s having greater difficulty getting it off again, writes @JLeeEnergy https://t.co/4LkKCDlnYf — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 3, 2025 Trouble at the Central Bank? In an article from the IT-focused media outlet Comnews , the journalist Ivan Ivanov wrote: “The launch of the digital ruble has been postponed indefinitely. The head of the Central Bank claims that the reason is the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of medium and small banks. But perhaps this is only half of the truth.” He added that it was clear that “something has gone wrong.” Ivanov said the “main reason” was likely “the unpreparedness of the infrastructure of banks and businesses.” The journalist added: “To be honest, commerical banks are not interested in the digital ruble. It requires them – at their own expense – to build and integrate a new system that will not bring them any profits. It […] is profitable and even logical for them to try to delay the process for as long as possible.” Ivanov added that most people are “still unclear as to why exactly the digital ruble is needed.” Some of Russia’s biggest banks have previously dragged their feet on digital ruble pilot work. Most notably, the nation’s main banking association has repeatedly called for a delay . Sberbank, arguably the country’s biggest banking and IT player, was also notable by its absence in the first phase of the pilot, which launched in August 2023. In January this year, the same bank also called for a delay that would see the digital ruble launch in 2026 . Ivanov, meanwhile, noted that “despite denials,” a “persistent rumor that Nabiullina wants to leave her post” continues to circulate. Nabiullina has headed the Russian Central Bank since 2013. Prior too this, she served as the nation’s Minister of Economic Development under both Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev. She is known to be one of Putin’s closest political allies.

Official sources have been cagey about the CBDC delay thus far, suggesting that “feedback from partner banks” has “indicated a need for additional technical improvements.” However, Insight Advocates wrote that the ever-changing “international situation” could be another concern, adding: “In the context of sanctions pressure and the threat of restrictions from the United States against BRICS nations, the Russian authorities could begin testing cross-border settlements in digital national currencies.” Currently, only China has the technical capability to carry out cross-border CBDC transactions, Insight Advocates wrote, and “Russia may need more time to develop these capabilities.” The post Confusion Reigns as Russia CBDC Launch Is ‘Delayed Indefinitely’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|CBDC|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-03 23:30:00

His explanation on X sheds light on the trend that has caught the interest of the cryptocurrency community, especially as memecoins gain more popularity. XRPL Memecoin and XRP Price Schwartz explained that while memecoins do not directly affect XRP’s core utility, they can influence XRP’s price because of speculation in the market. Many investors view memecoins as high-risk, high-reward opportunities, often driven by social media trends and popular influencers. This means that sudden increases in interest or trading for certain memecoins can spark more activity on the XRP Ledger, which may then influence the overall market dynamics. Schwartz also pointed out that XRP’s price matches memecoins because of market feelings and speculation. When XRPL memecoin suddenly rises, it can make traders feel they are missing out, leading investors to pay more attention to XRP. As more people trade XRP, its price can increase. However, this rise doesn’t necessarily reflect XRP’s actual value. Furthermore, the Ripple CTO mentioned that speculative trading can cause short-term price changes for XRP, but this does not show its long-term value. He also explained that if the price of XRP goes up, it can lead to a rise in the memecoin’s price. This rise in the memecoin can generate profits, even if no profits are taken from XRP. Ripple CTO on XRP’s Value In an online exchange, David Schwartz passionately defended XRP Ledger against a critic’s claim that it operates as a “zero-sum game.” Ripple’s CTO actively engaged with the critic, dispelling misconceptions and highlighting XRP’s intrinsic value and utility. He countered the criticism by explaining the fundamental operation of the XRPL, portraying it as a platform facilitating seamless XRP transfers and issued assets. The Ripple executive emphasized that users willingly pay transaction fees for the valuable service, asserting that the benefits outweighed the associated costs. Schwartz affirmed that the XRPL is not solely a tool for transferring value but a sophisticated platform supporting various financial activities. Institutional Confidence Grows With XRP Meanwhile, institutional investors are interested in XRP. Ripple’s 2024 third-quarter market report hints at rising interest and suggests that institutional adoption has risen. Notably, 21Shares, Bitwise Invest, and Canary Funds have all filed for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Grayscale Investments has launched an XRP Trust and wishes to gain the regulatory body’s approval to convert its multi-asset fund into an ETF. These moves show that investors see value in XRP as a critical tool for guaranteeing global liquidity .

Schiff’s demand follows controversial posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, which allegedly contributed to a pump and dump scheme. Schiff is calling for transparency regarding the authorship of these posts, the individuals who had prior knowledge of them, and the financial transactions linked to the incident. Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Blasts Trump Over Alleged Crypto Pump and Dump Peter Schiff has raised concerns about the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices following two posts from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account. Schiff claims the posts were strategically timed to manipulate the market, benefiting individuals who had advance knowledge of their release. He has called for a full congressional investigation to determine who was involved. The economist has specifically questioned the authorship of the Truth Social posts. Peter Schiff believes certain individuals may have used insider knowledge to invest in cryptos such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) before selling at inflated prices. He urged lawmakers to trace financial transactions linked to the alleged scheme. More so, the Bitcoin critic is demanding access to emails and text messages from Trump’s staff, family, and employees. He aims to investigate any coordination behind the crypto-related posts on Truth Social. Peter Schiff added, “Donald Trump, the first crypto President, just helped pull off the biggest crypto rug pull of all time. A Congressional investigation is now warranted.” Schiff Questions Insider Trading Schiff has urged authorities to examine whether individuals close to Donald Trump benefited financially from the crypto market movements. He is calling for an investigation into who purchased digital assets before the posts were made public. The Bitcoin critic wants investigators to determine how much money was invested by those with prior knowledge of the posts and the exact timing of any subsequent sales. Schiff claims that if insider trading occurred, it would constitute a major financial scandal. The Bitcoin critic said, “We also need all emails or text messages that involve any members of the President’s staff, his or their family or friends, his campaign donors, or Truth Social employees, that relate to either of the two Sunday Truth Social posts.” Bitcoin Critic Rejects Support for BTC Reserve Meanwhile, Peter Schiff recently distanced himself from previous comments that appeared to support a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He now claims that Bitcoin enthusiasts misrepresented his statements to manipulate public perception. The economist has accused Bitcoin promoters of spreading false information to inflate BTC prices. Schiff insists that his remarks were taken out of context and that he never endorsed Bitcoin as a reserve asset. He has criticized what he calls “fraudulent tactics” used by Bitcoin supporters to influence the market. Despite Peter Schiff’s allegations, the Donald Trump administration has continued to push its crypto agenda. In a recent CoinGape report, US SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce confirmed the members of the newly formed Crypto Task Force, signaling a shift in regulatory approach. The 15-member team includes staff from various SEC divisions, focusing on developing clear guidelines for the crypto industry.

A powerful directive from Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has ignited the conversation around Vietnam crypto regulation . The nation’s leader has called for the urgent establishment of a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, setting a deadline for the end of this very month. This decisive move signals a potential turning point for digital assets in Vietnam, a country with a rapidly growing tech-savvy population. Why is a Crypto Legal Framework Suddenly a Priority in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s instruction underscores the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies’ influence on the global financial landscape. For Vietnam, establishing a crypto legal framework isn’t just about keeping pace with global trends; it’s about strategically positioning itself in the burgeoning digital economy. Several factors are likely driving this urgency: Preventing Illicit Activities: Without clear regulations, the cryptocurrency space can be vulnerable to money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities. A legal framework aims to mitigate these risks and protect citizens. Harnessing Innovation: Vietnam has a vibrant tech sector and a youthful, digitally engaged population. A well-defined regulatory environment can foster innovation and attract investment in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Economic Growth: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have the potential to unlock new avenues for economic growth, including fintech innovation, cross-border payments, and new business models. Investor Protection: Clear rules provide clarity and protection for individuals and businesses engaging with cryptocurrencies, fostering trust and wider cryptocurrency Vietnam adoption. What Challenges Lie Ahead in Crafting Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations? While the Prime Minister’s directive is a significant step, creating a comprehensive and effective crypto legal framework is a complex undertaking. The Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) face several hurdles: Challenge Description Defining Cryptocurrencies: Classifying cryptocurrencies – are they currencies, commodities, or securities? – is crucial for determining applicable regulations. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulations must be robust enough to mitigate risks without stifling innovation and the growth of the crypto sector. International Best Practices: Learning from and adapting regulatory approaches from other countries while tailoring them to Vietnam’s specific context is essential. Enforcement and Compliance: Establishing mechanisms for effective enforcement and ensuring compliance with the new regulations will be critical for success. Public Awareness and Education: Educating the public about cryptocurrency risks and regulations is vital for responsible adoption and preventing scams. The Role of Pham Minh Chinh in Shaping Vietnam’s Crypto Future Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh crypto initiative demonstrates a proactive approach to embracing emerging technologies. His direct involvement signals the government’s commitment to navigating the complexities of the digital asset space. This top-down approach can accelerate the regulatory process and ensure inter-agency cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). His leadership could be instrumental in shaping a regulatory environment that fosters both innovation and responsible growth within the Vietnamese crypto ecosystem. What Could Vietnam’s Crypto Regulations Look Like? Examples from Around the Globe While the specifics of Vietnam’s regulations remain to be seen, we can look at examples from other countries to get an idea of potential approaches: South Korea: Known for its comprehensive approach, South Korea regulates crypto exchanges, requires KYC/AML compliance, and taxes crypto profits. Singapore: Emphasizes a balanced approach, promoting innovation while implementing AML/CFT regulations and consumer protection measures. United States: Takes a fragmented approach with various agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN) overseeing different aspects of the crypto market. European Union: Developing MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation to create a harmonized framework across member states. Vietnam could potentially draw inspiration from these models, adopting a blend of approaches that best suits its economic and regulatory context. It is likely that the framework will address areas such as: Licensing and registration for crypto exchanges and service providers. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Taxation of cryptocurrency transactions and holdings. Consumer protection measures to safeguard investors. Regulations on stablecoins and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Adoption in Vietnam? The Prime Minister’s directive is a bullish signal for crypto adoption Vietnam . A clear legal framework, while potentially introducing stricter rules, will ultimately legitimize the cryptocurrency industry and foster greater trust and participation. Here’s what you should consider: For Crypto Investors in Vietnam: Stay informed about the upcoming regulations. Compliance will be key, so be prepared for potential KYC requirements and tax implications. For Crypto Businesses: Vietnam is becoming an increasingly attractive market. A clear regulatory framework will provide the certainty needed to invest and expand operations in the country. For the Vietnamese Government: A well-designed regulatory framework can position Vietnam as a regional leader in fintech innovation and attract foreign investment. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Vietnam’s Digital Economy Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh’s urgent call for a crypto legal framework marks a pivotal moment for Vietnam’s engagement with the digital asset revolution. While the specifics are yet to unfold, this decisive action signals a proactive and forward-thinking approach. By embracing regulation, Vietnam is not just catching up with global trends but actively shaping its future in the digital economy. The coming month will be crucial in defining the contours of this framework and its long-term impact on Vietnam’s crypto landscape. This bold move has the potential to unlock significant opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and greater financial inclusion in Vietnam, making it a nation to watch in the global crypto space.

41122507,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136357,1741046383,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Power Shift: Trump Aides Join Paradigm’s Policy Council to Revolutionize Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-aides-paradigm-crypto-policy/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, Paradigm, a leading crypto investment firm, has announced the addition of six new members to its Policy Council. What’s truly grabbing headlines is the inclusion of former Trump administration officials, signaling a potential shift in the landscape of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. Are we witnessing a new era of collaboration between traditional political heavyweights and the rapidly evolving digital asset space? Let’s dive into the details. Why is the Paradigm Policy Council attracting such attention? Paradigm is not just any investment firm; it’s a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, known for backing some of the most innovative projects in the space. Their Policy Council is designed to navigate the complex and often murky waters of crypto regulation . By bringing together individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise, Paradigm aims to proactively engage with policymakers and shape the future of digital asset legislation. The recent appointments highlight the growing importance of strategic policy engagement in the crypto industry. The newly inducted members include: Robert O’Brien : Former National Security Advisor during the Trump administration. O’Brien’s experience in national security and international policy brings a significant weight to the council, particularly in discussions around the national security implications of cryptocurrency and its regulation. Van Jones : A well-known CNN host and political commentator. Jones adds a unique perspective, bridging the gap between mainstream media and the crypto world. His understanding of public opinion and communication will be invaluable in shaping the narrative around digital assets. Jen Brown : A Democratic advisor. Brown’s inclusion ensures bipartisan representation and a balanced approach to policy discussions, crucial for navigating the politically charged environment surrounding crypto. And three other unnamed individuals, as reported by The Block. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation? The involvement of former Trump aides , particularly Robert O’Brien, in Paradigm’s Policy Council is noteworthy for several reasons: Legitimacy and Mainstreaming : Having figures from previous administrations on board lends a degree of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency industry. It signals that crypto is no longer a fringe technology but a serious sector engaging with established political players. Policy Influence : These individuals possess deep networks and understanding of Washington D.C.’s policy-making processes. Their involvement could translate to more informed and potentially favorable regulations for the crypto industry. Bipartisan Approach : The inclusion of both Republican and Democratic figures suggests an attempt to build bipartisan consensus around cryptocurrency policy . This is crucial for long-term regulatory stability and industry growth. However, challenges and questions remain: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty Despite these appointments, the overall regulatory landscape for crypto remains unclear in many jurisdictions. The Policy Council will need to navigate diverse and sometimes conflicting regulatory approaches globally. Public Perception Cryptocurrency still faces skepticism from some segments of the public and policymakers. Overcoming negative perceptions and educating stakeholders will be a key task. Balancing Innovation and Regulation The council must strike a delicate balance between advocating for regulations that protect consumers and prevent illicit activities, while also fostering innovation and growth within the crypto space. Robert O’Brien and the Paradigm Vision: A New Direction for Crypto? Robert O’Brien’s background in national security adds a fascinating dimension to the Paradigm Policy Council. His expertise could be particularly valuable in addressing concerns related to: National Security Implications of Crypto : Examining how cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit activities and developing strategies to mitigate these risks while preserving the benefits of the technology. International Crypto Policy Coordination : Navigating the complexities of global crypto regulation and fostering international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. Cybersecurity and Digital Asset Protection : Drawing on his national security experience to enhance cybersecurity measures within the crypto industry and protect digital assets from theft and fraud. The addition of these high-profile individuals to the Paradigm Policy Council underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a clear signal that crypto is moving beyond its early, Wild West days and actively seeking to engage with the established political and regulatory frameworks. This move could pave the way for more constructive dialogue between the crypto industry and policymakers, potentially leading to clearer and more supportive regulations in the future. Actionable Insights: What can we expect next? Here are some actionable insights and things to watch out for: Increased Policy Advocacy : Expect Paradigm and its Policy Council to become more vocal in policy debates and regulatory discussions. Their influence in shaping crypto legislation is likely to grow. Focus on Clear Regulations : The council will likely advocate for clear, consistent, and innovation-friendly regulations that provide businesses with the certainty they need to operate and grow. Bipartisan Engagement : Keep an eye on how effectively the council leverages its bipartisan composition to build consensus and bridge political divides on crypto policy. Global Regulatory Influence : Paradigm’s initiatives could have implications beyond the US, potentially influencing global discussions on crypto regulation . Conclusion: A Powerful Alliance for Crypto’s Future? The formation of a robust Policy Council at Paradigm, bolstered by figures like former Trump aides and prominent political voices, is a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a powerful alliance aimed at shaping the future of cryptocurrency policy and regulation. While challenges undoubtedly remain, this move signals a determined effort to bridge the gap between the crypto world and traditional power structures. The coming months and years will reveal the extent of their impact, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto regulation is becoming more sophisticated and influential, promising a potentially transformative period for the digital asset landscape.

As speculation mounts over its potential to reach $500, investors are tuning in for Litecoin’s next act. Yet, despite being a well-established cryptocurrency, Litecoin’s explosive growth potential is clouded by intense market competition. Conversely, Web3Bay (3BAY) is turning heads for a different reason. This budding decentralized e-commerce platform, still in its presale phase, has not only raised over $1.5 million but also tantalizes with projections of gains surpassing 3,633%. Is Litecoin’s journey to $500 feasible, or does Web3Bay present a more astute investment avenue? Let’s dissect both opportunities to unearth which harbors the greatest growth potential for 2025. Is Litecoin on the Verge of a $500 Breakthrough? The resurgence in Litecoin’s market activity has reignited investor enthusiasm. Recently surging past the critical $100 barrier, LTC’s current trading price of $128 reflects a robust 30% growth in the past fortnight. Technical analysis suggests that breaking the $135 resistance could propel LTC towards ambitious targets of $175 and $240, aligned with key Fibonacci levels, indicating potential for further ascents. Another pivotal development boosting Litecoin’s prospects is the potential U.S. approval of a Litecoin ETF. The SEC’s nod to a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing, coupled with NASDAQ’s proposal to trade ETF shares, could significantly draw institutional investors, potentially catalyzing Litecoin’s value. However, achieving a $500 valuation implies a formidable 290% increase from its present stance—a feat Litecoin has not accomplished in a single cycle since 2017. With the rise of agile and cost-effective blockchains like Solana and Avalanche, sustaining momentum could prove challenging for Litecoin despite a promising setup. Web3Bay’s 3,633% ROI Prospect—Capturing Investor Focus While Litecoin offers modest growth potential, Web3Bay is shaping up as a powerhouse investment with far greater return possibilities. Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce by crafting a decentralized marketplace that omits intermediaries, slashes fees, and grants transactional control to users. This platform stands apart from centralized giants by employing blockchain to foster a transparent, efficient, and community-led shopping environment. With the presale already amassing over $1.5 million, demonstrating robust investor trust, the current presale price of 3BAY at $0.005247 points to an explosive 3,633% ROI, should it hit its projected launch price of $0.1959. What Sets Web3Bay Apart? Real-World Utility: Web3Bay addresses tangible e-commerce pain points, positioning it for sustained adoption and growth. Early Investor Benefits: The ongoing presale offers a prime opportunity to acquire 3BAY at its inception price, ahead of major exchange listings. Vast Market Reach: With the e-commerce market valued at over $6 trillion, Web3Bay’s innovative model stands to capture significant market share by eliminating traditional barriers and costs. Unmatched Growth Potential: Unlike Litecoin’s gradual appreciation path, Web3Bay’s presale stage presents a remarkable opportunity for rapid value increase. Key Insights While Litecoin’s potential climb to $500 is not out of reach, it is fraught with challenges from competitive pressures and the need for sustained, large-scale institutional investment. In contrast, Web3Bay is at a nascent stage where the scope for exponential gains is remarkably higher. As it pioneers a decentralized model in e-commerce and captivates substantial early-stage funding, Web3Bay represents an irresistible prospect. For investors who missed early opportunities in trailblazers like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable foundational investment chance—one that could yield transformative returns for early participants.

SHIB’s Price Prediction Shows Optimism & LTC Could Fall,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-hits-200m-next-target-600m-with-10-upcoming-listings-shibs-price-prediction-shows-optimism-ltc-could-fall/,"Market watchers are keenly observing trends across key cryptocurrencies. The Shiba Inu price prediction is drawing attention after a spike in large-scale purchases suggests a possible price surge. The focus remains on whether these buys will drive substantial price movements or if SHIB will stabilize within its current range. Conversely, the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is causing worry, with forecasts pointing to a potential 25% decline. Reduced trading activity and growing short positions might hinder LTC’s recovery anytime soon. On another note, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making significant strides as it prepares to debut on 10 leading centralized exchanges. With $200 million already raised in its presale and providing a stunning 2,380% ROI to initial supporters, BDAG is positioned as a top crypto to follow as it approaches a whopping $600 million presale target. SHIB Price Prediction: Whale Activity Sparks Hope The Shiba Inu price prediction is once again a hot topic due to an impressive 90% increase in transactions from major holders. This uptick suggests a positive shift, with SHIB’s price prediction potentially turning bullish as large-scale holders continue to buy in. Currently priced near $0.00001424, SHIB faces crucial resistance at $0.00001660. Discussions around the Shiba Inu price prediction suggest breaking this barrier could push prices to $0.00001700 or more, while failure to maintain $0.00001500 could drop SHIB below $0.00001400. The growing whale activity remains a key influence in this Shiba Inu price prediction, with further gains possible if this trend persists. Litecoin (LTC) Bearish Outlook: Is a 25% Drop Looming? The Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook is strengthening with evidence pointing to a possible 25% reduction from its current $117 value. Analysts see $141 as a significant hurdle, enhancing discussions that Litecoin’s (LTC) bearish outlook might solidify if LTC cannot surpass this obstacle. A 23% fall in trade volume contributes to the concerns among those betting short-term. While the 200 EMA indicates some resilience, the overall mood remains pessimistic, reinforcing the LTC’s (LTC) bearish outlook. A jump in short bets now surpassing $67 million this week shows an increasing trend of market players anticipating further losses. Nevertheless, some long-term stakeholders continue to amass, showing not all are swayed by the prevailing negative outlook. BlockDAG Sets Sights on 10 Major CEX Listings BlockDAG is preparing for a significant move with upcoming launches on 10 renowned centralized exchanges. Listings on these platforms not only enhance credibility but also significantly boost trading volume. With these exchanges on board, anticipation is building that their users will soon join the presale frenzy. Currently priced at $0.0248, the coin’s value is soaring thanks to a presale that has already gathered over $200 million. To date, 18.6 billion coins have been claimed, and with the 27th batch now available, early participants are enjoying a remarkable 2,380% ROI. Industry experts have dubbed BDAG a top crypto to buy, eyeing a colossal $600 million funding goal. These listings are anticipated to drive wider adoption, setting the stage for more liquidity and robust trading activity. With plans for a mainnet launch in 2025, the future looks promising for significant value appreciation. Expectations of reaching $20 by 2027 are keeping the community engaged, bolstered by BDAG’s growing network of partnerships and a vibrant supporter base. With the momentum from the presale, anticipated exchange listings, and ambitious price targets, BDAG is on a fast track to gaining broad recognition among both new and experienced crypto traders seeking the next lucrative venture. Market Trends: Optimism & Caution in Crypto Trading The cryptocurrency domain is currently a mix of excitement and caution, with the Shiba Inu price prediction indicating a potential surge thanks to increased interest from major buyers, while the Litecoin (LTC) bearish outlook signals a possible downturn unless it overcomes specific resistance hurdles. In the meantime, BlockDAG is making strides toward becoming a mainstream fixture with 10 significant CEX listings in the pipeline. The crypto presale has been a massive success, securing $200 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. As BDAG moves toward the $600 million mark, its escalating presence in the market positions it as a top crypto to buy, with upcoming listings poised to broaden its trading scope.

California is stepping up its game. Just when you thought the AI safety debate couldn’t get any hotter, the Golden State is back in the ring with a brand-new legislative punch. Senator Scott Wiener, the very lawmaker behind last year’s controversial SB 1047, has just dropped SB 53 – a bill that’s already sending ripples through Silicon Valley and beyond. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals closely watching the intersection of digital innovation and regulation, this is a development you can’t afford to ignore. Let’s dive into what this new California AI Bill means for the future of artificial intelligence and tech innovation. What’s New in California’s AI Regulation Landscape? After the intense discussions surrounding SB 1047, which aimed to put guardrails on potentially dangerous AI systems, Senator Wiener is back with SB 53. This new bill appears to take a more nuanced approach, focusing on two key areas: Tech Whistleblower Protection: Empowering employees at leading AI labs to speak out about potential risks without fear of retaliation. CalCompute Cloud Initiative: Creating a public cloud computing resource to democratize AI development and boost public-interest research. Think of it as a strategic pivot. Instead of directly tackling the ‘existential risk’ aspects that made SB 1047 so contentious, SB 53 carves out specific, arguably less controversial, components. But don’t be fooled – this bill is still packing a punch when it comes to shaping the future of AI regulation in California and potentially setting a precedent for the rest of the nation. Why Whistleblower Protection is a Game-Changer for AI Safety One of the most significant aspects of the California AI Bill , SB 53, is its focus on Tech Whistleblower Protection . Imagine being an engineer at a cutting-edge AI lab and noticing something deeply concerning – a potential flaw that could lead to serious societal harm. Historically, speaking out could mean risking your job and career. SB 53 aims to change that. Key highlights of the whistleblower protection aspect: Protection from Retaliation: AI developers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who report concerns about ‘critical risks’. Clear Definition of ‘Critical Risk’: The bill defines this as a risk of death or serious injury to over 100 people, or damages exceeding $1 billion. Reporting Channels: Whistleblowers can disclose information to the California Attorney General, federal authorities, or even internal colleagues. Follow-up Requirements: Companies must report back to whistleblowers on internal processes related to their concerns. This is a powerful move towards enhancing AI safety . By empowering insiders, SB 53 seeks to create a crucial check-and-balance system within the rapidly evolving AI industry. It acknowledges that those closest to the technology are often best positioned to identify potential dangers. CalCompute Cloud: Democratizing AI Development? Beyond whistleblower protection, SB 53 introduces another intriguing element: the CalCompute Cloud . This initiative proposes creating a public cloud computing cluster to level the playing field in AI development. But what exactly is CalCompute, and why does it matter? Understanding CalCompute Cloud: Public Resource: CalCompute would be a publicly funded cloud computing cluster accessible to researchers and startups. Collaboration Focus: A group consisting of University of California representatives and other experts would guide its development. Boosting Public Interest AI: The goal is to provide resources for developing AI that benefits the public, not just large corporations. Addressing Compute Inequality: It aims to tackle the issue where only a few tech giants have access to massive computing power needed for advanced AI. For startups and researchers, especially those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space exploring AI applications, CalCompute Cloud could be a game-changer. It could lower the barrier to entry, fostering innovation and potentially leading to more diverse and publicly beneficial AI applications. Imagine the possibilities for decentralized AI projects with access to state-of-the-art computing resources! Will SB 53 Face the Same Pushback as SB 1047? Senator Wiener’s previous AI Safety Bill , SB 1047, faced intense opposition, particularly from Silicon Valley. Critics argued it would stifle innovation and put California at a disadvantage in the global AI race. Governor Newsom ultimately vetoed it, citing concerns about its approach. Key Differences and Potential Challenges for SB 53: Feature SB 1047 (Controversial) SB 53 (New Approach) Focus Preventing catastrophic AI risks (existential risk) Whistleblower protection & public computing resources Controversy Level High – sparked accusations of fear-mongering and hindering innovation Potentially lower – focuses on arguably less contentious areas Silicon Valley Reaction (SB 1047) Strong opposition, labeled as harmful to competitiveness TBD – likely to be more receptive to whistleblower protection and CalCompute, but scrutiny expected Political Climate 2024 – heightened AI safety concerns 2025 – potential shift towards prioritizing AI innovation over safety While SB 53 may be seen as less radical than SB 1047, it’s still likely to face scrutiny. The political landscape may also be shifting, with some voices, like Vice President J.D. Vance, suggesting a greater emphasis on AI innovation over stringent AI regulation . The coming months will be crucial in determining SB 53’s fate in the California legislature. The Future of AI Regulation: What to Watch For California’s efforts to shape AI regulation are being closely watched globally. SB 53, regardless of its outcome, will contribute to the ongoing conversation about how to govern this transformative technology. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding these regulatory trends is vital as AI increasingly intersects with decentralized technologies. Key takeaways and what to watch: Silicon Valley’s Response: How will tech giants and startups react to SB 53? Will they see whistleblower protection and CalCompute as constructive or burdensome? Legislative Process: SB 53 still needs to navigate the California legislature. Amendments, debates, and eventual votes will shape its final form. National Impact: California’s actions often influence other states and even federal policy. SB 53 could set a precedent for Tech Whistleblower Protection and public AI infrastructure. Global Dialogue: The debate around AI safety and AI regulation is global. California’s experience will inform international discussions and policy development. In conclusion, SB 53 represents a significant step in California’s ongoing journey to grapple with the complexities of artificial intelligence. By focusing on whistleblower protection and democratizing access to computing resources, it offers a potentially more palatable approach to AI safety than its predecessor, SB 1047. Whether it will successfully navigate the legislative process and ultimately shape the future of AI remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the debate around AI regulation is far from over, and California is determined to remain at the forefront.

41122642,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136399,1741046603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking AI Impact at MWC: Two Visions Divide Tech’s Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-impact-mwc-tech-future/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to be a dominating force in the tech world, sparking both excitement and apprehension. At the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC), this dichotomy was on full display, with two prominent voices presenting radically different perspectives on the AI impact on our lives and society. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-forward individuals, understanding these diverging viewpoints is crucial as AI increasingly intersects with blockchain and the digital economy. Let’s delve into the starkly contrasting visions that emerged from MWC. The Optimistic Vision: AI as Humanity’s Supercharger Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and Google researcher, presented a compelling case for AI’s transformative potential. Speaking virtually, Kurzweil painted a picture of an AI future brimming with unprecedented advancements and benefits for humanity. His core arguments revolved around: Enhanced Longevity and Healthcare: Kurzweil believes AI will revolutionize healthcare, leading to significant extensions in human lifespan. AI-driven diagnostics, personalized medicine, and drug discovery are poised to tackle diseases and improve overall health dramatically. Renewable Energy Revolution: He highlighted AI’s role in optimizing renewable energy technologies. According to Kurzweil, “AI-optimized designs” are making solar and other renewable energy sources increasingly efficient and cost-effective, paving the way for a sustainable energy future. He boldly predicted that renewable energy will “dominate within a decade,” thanks to AI. Ubiquitous Benefits: Kurzweil envisions AI transforming “everything all at once,” showering humanity with benefits across countless domains. From smarter cities to personalized education, he sees AI as a catalyst for progress in virtually every aspect of life. Kurzweil’s presentation was a classic example of technological optimism, emphasizing the immense potential of AI to solve global challenges and elevate the human experience. He urged attendees to pay attention to the “huge gains” already being powered by AI, suggesting we are on the cusp of a technological golden age. The Pessimistic Counterpoint: AI and the Rage Machine In stark contrast to Kurzweil’s utopian vision, Scott Galloway, a tech investor and academic, offered a much more sobering perspective. Galloway’s fireside chat delivered a powerful warning about the darker side of AI, particularly its role in fueling societal division and negativity. His key concerns included: Rage-Fueled Algorithms: Galloway argued that algorithms, particularly those powering social media platforms, have discovered that “rage” is the ultimate engagement driver. These technology platforms, driven by ad revenue, prioritize sensational and divisive content, leading to increased polarization and societal fragmentation. Erosion of Social Cohesion: He painted a grim picture of a nation where AI-driven information sorting amplifies isolation and anti-social attitudes. Galloway pointed to the increasing loneliness and division in the U.S., where neighbors are losing the ability to communicate civilly, attributing this partly to AI’s influence on information consumption. Tech CEO Cowardice and Societal Impact: Galloway went further, criticizing tech billionaires for their silence in the face of democratic backsliding and social issues. He accused them of prioritizing personal gain over speaking out against policies that exacerbate inequality and undermine democratic institutions. He specifically called out CEOs like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook for not challenging what he sees as abuses of power, expressing disappointment at their perceived “cowardice.” Galloway’s message was a stark warning about the unintended consequences of unchecked technological advancement. He argued that while we are stronger technologically than ever, societal bonds are weakening, and AI is playing a significant role in this negative trend. His presentation served as a potent counterpoint to the unbridled optimism surrounding AI, urging for a more critical and responsible approach to its development and deployment. Navigating the AI Divide: Optimism vs. Realism The contrasting viewpoints presented at MWC highlight a crucial debate surrounding AI: Is it a force for unparalleled progress, or does it harbor significant risks that could undermine society? The reality, as with most complex issues, likely lies somewhere in between. Here’s a table summarizing the key differences: Perspective Key Proponent Core Argument Focus Tone Technological Optimism Ray Kurzweil AI will solve major problems, enhance human life, and drive unprecedented progress. Benefits, potential, future possibilities Utopian, enthusiastic, future-oriented Technological Realism/Criticism Scott Galloway AI algorithms can exacerbate societal problems, fuel division, and require careful management. Risks, challenges, current societal impact Sobering, critical, present-focused Actionable Insights and the Path Forward So, what are the key takeaways from these divided views on AI impact , especially for those in the cryptocurrency and tech space? Embrace Innovation with Caution: While the potential of AI and related innovation is undeniable, it’s crucial to approach its development and implementation with a critical eye. We must be mindful of potential downsides and unintended consequences. Ethical Considerations are Paramount: As AI becomes more pervasive, ethical frameworks and responsible AI development practices are essential. This includes addressing algorithmic bias, ensuring data privacy, and mitigating the potential for misuse. Foster Dialogue and Collaboration: Open and honest conversations about the societal implications of AI are crucial. Bringing together diverse perspectives – from technologists to ethicists to social scientists – is vital for navigating the complex challenges and opportunities that AI presents. Demand Accountability from Tech Leaders: Galloway’s critique of tech CEOs raises important questions about responsibility and leadership. As AI’s influence grows, it’s essential to hold tech leaders accountable for the societal impact of their technologies and platforms. Conclusion: A Nuanced Perspective on the AI Future The MWC presentations by Kurzweil and Galloway offer valuable, albeit contrasting, lenses through which to view the AI future . While Kurzweil’s optimism inspires us to imagine the transformative possibilities of AI, Galloway’s realism compels us to confront the potential pitfalls. Ultimately, a balanced and nuanced approach is necessary. We must strive to harness the immense power of AI for good while proactively addressing its risks and ensuring that its development benefits all of humanity, not just a select few. The conversation at MWC underscores that the journey into an AI-driven world requires both visionary enthusiasm and critical foresight.

41122773,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136411,1741046849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Bitwise Files for Spot Dogecoin ETF – A New Era for DOGE?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-files-spot-dogecoin-etf/,"Hold onto your digital wallets, Dogecoin enthusiasts! The crypto world is buzzing with exciting news that could potentially reshape the landscape for everyone’s favorite meme-inspired cryptocurrency. If you’ve been eagerly waiting for more accessible ways to invest in DOGE, you might just be in luck. Let’s dive into the details of this potentially groundbreaking development. What’s the Buzz About a Spot Dogecoin ETF? As reported by Watcher Guru on X, crypto asset manager Bitwise has officially thrown its hat into the ring, filing an application with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to launch a spot Dogecoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This is a significant step because a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Dogecoin – offering investors exposure to DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. But what does this mean for you, the average crypto enthusiast, and the future of Dogecoin? Why is a Spot Crypto ETF a Big Deal? To understand the excitement, let’s break down why a spot crypto ETF, especially a Spot Dogecoin ETF , is such a noteworthy event: Accessibility for Mainstream Investors: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a vast pool of investors who may be hesitant or unfamiliar with navigating cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. This could open Dogecoin to a significantly larger investment audience. Regulation and Security: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of security and investor protection that some may find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto space. Investing through a regulated Bitwise ETF could ease concerns about security and compliance. Simplified Investment Process: Buying and selling ETF shares is straightforward, similar to trading stocks. This simplicity removes the technical hurdles associated with buying, storing, and managing Dogecoin directly, making it more appealing to a broader range of investors. Potential for Increased Liquidity: An ETF can boost liquidity for Dogecoin as it creates another avenue for trading and investment, potentially leading to more robust and stable market conditions. Spot vs. Futures: Understanding the Difference in Crypto ETFs You might be wondering, aren’t there already crypto ETFs? Yes, there are, but the key difference lies in the term “spot.” Many existing crypto ETFs are based on futures contracts, not the actual underlying cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot ETF Futures ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds the cryptocurrency (Dogecoin in this case) Holds futures contracts that predict the future price of the cryptocurrency Price Tracking More closely tracks the actual spot price of the cryptocurrency Price can deviate from the spot price due to futures market dynamics Investor Exposure Direct exposure to the price movements of the cryptocurrency Indirect exposure through futures contracts, potentially leading to tracking errors and roll costs A Spot Dogecoin ETF , like the one Bitwise is proposing, is generally considered more desirable by many investors as it offers more direct and transparent exposure to the price of Dogecoin. Why Bitwise for a Dogecoin ETF? Bitwise is a well-known and respected name in the crypto asset management space. They have a track record of launching innovative crypto investment products. Their decision to file for a DOGE ETF signals a growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the broader meme coin sector. Bitwise’s expertise and reputation could lend credibility and attract investors to this new ETF offering. Challenges and Roadblocks for a Spot DOGE ETF While the filing is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the path to launching a Spot Dogecoin ETF isn’t guaranteed to be smooth. There are potential hurdles: Regulatory Approval: The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in the United States has been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs. Getting the green light from regulators is the biggest hurdle. The SEC needs to be convinced about market surveillance, investor protection, and the maturity of the Dogecoin market. Market Volatility: Dogecoin, like many cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. Regulators may have concerns about the risks associated with a highly volatile asset within an ETF structure. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC is also concerned about potential market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space. Bitwise will need to demonstrate robust measures to prevent manipulation and ensure fair trading of the ETF. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin’s Price and Future? The potential launch of a Spot Dogecoin ETF could have several implications for Dogecoin: Increased Demand: If the ETF is approved and gains traction, it could create significant new demand for Dogecoin as ETF providers need to acquire DOGE to back the ETF shares. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand could potentially drive up the price of Dogecoin. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and price movements are influenced by many factors. Mainstream Adoption: A successful Crypto ETF for Dogecoin could further legitimize Dogecoin as an asset class and contribute to its broader mainstream adoption. Evolution of Meme Coins: The success of a Dogecoin ETF could pave the way for ETFs based on other meme coins, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the meme-driven crypto world. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? While we wait for updates on Bitwise’s Bitwise ETF application, here are some actionable steps you can consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on cryptocurrency news and regulatory developments. Follow reputable sources like Watcher Guru and Bitwise’s official announcements for updates on the ETF application. Do Your Research: Understand the risks and potential rewards associated with Dogecoin and crypto ETFs before making any investment decisions. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Your Investment Strategy: Think about how a Spot Dogecoin ETF might fit into your overall investment portfolio, if at all. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Engage in the Community: Join discussions and communities around Dogecoin and crypto ETFs to learn from others and stay updated on the latest developments. Conclusion: A Promising Development for Dogecoin? Bitwise filing for a Spot Dogecoin ETF is undoubtedly a significant and exciting development for the Dogecoin community and the broader crypto market. It represents a potential step towards mainstream adoption and greater accessibility for DOGE. While regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain factors to consider, this move signals growing institutional interest in Dogecoin and the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Keep watching this space – the journey of the Spot Dogecoin ETF is just beginning, and it promises to be an interesting one!

NFTs are not securities.” SEC ends Yuga Labs probe into BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin after two years In October 2022, the SEC opened a probe into Yuga Labs to examine its NFT offerings and the distribution of ApeCoin. The SEC aimed to determine whether these digital assets qualified as securities under U.S. law, applying the Howey Test—a legal standard established by a 1946 Supreme Court case. The watchdog’s probe began under former Chair Gary Gensler. It was part of a wider investigation into NFTs, including probes into NFT creators and marketplaces, to determine whether some, such as fractional NFTs, were securities. Founded in 2021, Yuga Labs created some of the most sought-after and expensive NFT collections during the market’s peak, including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club. It also bought the rights to CryptoPunks, an early NFT collection that had historically fetched huge sums. The NFT conglomerate achieved a $4 billion valuation after securing $450 million in funding by 2022. The firm’s BAYC collection has generated billions in trading volume, making it a prominent player in the NFT space. SEC softens crypto stance, drops multiple investigations The SEC’s reported decision to abandon its investigation into Yuga Labs aligns with the regulator’s increasingly lenient stance toward the crypto industry under the Trump administration. Most recently, the regulator has dropped its investigation of several major crypto companies, including Robinhood, Gemini, UniSwap Labs, Consensys-owned MetaMask, and OpenSea. The SEC has also reached settlements with Coinbase and is reportedly on track to settle its case against TRON’s Justin Sun. In its announcement that it is dropping its case against Coinbase, the SEC said its Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit will weed out those that are looking to exploit innovation to harm investors, including through fraud related to blockchain technology and crypto assets. The SEC has been reversing multiple crypto-related enforcement actions taken under former Chair Gensler, such as dropping a years-old lawsuit against Kraken on March 3. However, the SEC’s long-standing lawsuit against Ripple remains in active litigation. President Donald Trump recently named XRP one of the coins included in his proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve, alongside Cardano, Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price of ApeCoin , a token linked to the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, has fallen 16% in the past 24 hours amid a broader market pullback. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Following an initial decline in recent days, BTC surged above $94,000 on Sunday. This increase was fueled by reports of an upcoming US strategic crypto reserve that includes BTC and other major digital assets. However, as of today, BTC is trading just below $93,000, signaling an unstable upward momentum in the crypto market. Amid this price movement, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst KriptoBaykusV2 highlights an evolving pattern in Bitcoin’s net exchange flow, offering insight into investor sentiment. This data suggests that exchange inflows and outflows may play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s short-term price direction. Related Reading: Top Bitcoin Inflows Hit Year-High on Binance – Should You Be Concerned? Bitcoin Exchange Flows and Investor Sentiment According to KriptoBaykusV2, on February 25, Bitcoin saw a significant inflow to exchanges, with approximately 8,400 BTC being deposited. Historically, large inflows suggest increased selling pressure, as traders move assets to exchanges in preparation for liquidation. This was followed by a decline in Bitcoin’s price, aligning with previous market trends where increased supply on exchanges often leads to downward price movements. The following day, February 26, Bitcoin experienced a shift, with a substantial amount of BTC being withdrawn from exchanges. Large-scale outflows typically indicate a preference for holding, reducing the available supply on exchanges and potentially supporting price stability. This shift coincided with Bitcoin’s price finding support and beginning to recover, reflecting investor confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. The analyst noted: In summary, those closely monitoring Bitcoin’s exchange movements should take note: Large inflows into exchanges may indicate heightened selling pressure, requiring caution. On the other hand, significant outflows suggest that investors are opting to hold, which could lead to price appreciation. We will see in the coming days how these trends continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Enough—Coinbase CEO Rejects Altcoins For US Reserves Short-Term Selling and Market Trends Meanwhile, a separate analysis by another CryptoQuant analyst, abramchart, suggests that Bitcoin holders have started selling at a loss. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) index, which measures the profitability of short-term investors, according to the analyst recently recorded a value of 0.95. This level, the lowest since August 2024, suggests that more traders are selling BTC at a loss, an indication of capitulation. Historically, such periods have been followed by market recoveries as selling pressure eases and accumulation phases begin. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: The SOPR measures the proportion of Bitcoin wallets that have held Bitcoin for more than 1 hour and less than 155 days. Values over ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a profit. Values below ‘1’ indicate more short-term investors are selling at a loss., which is a sign of capitulation and a return to an upward trend.

He tells his 243,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking to see KAITO rally above the $2.50 level, about 20% higher than current prices. “KAITO just longed around this area, targeting $2.50 and higher. will take profits along the way, hope BTC is stable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, KAITO is worth $2.09. Also in the AI sector, Altcoin Sherpa says AI Rig Complex ( ARC ), a Rust-based AI agent framework, is likely sitting at a local bottom and is ready to head higher. “I still have a bag of this and still feel pretty decent about it. It’s shown a lot of strength relative to other AI coins and, although the volatility is high on it, I still think this is the relative bottom. 200 exponential moving average on the four-hour acting as a stopping point and $0.19 still seems like a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, ARC is trading for $0.22. Looking at the mid-term time frame, the trader names three of his top altcoin picks. His watchlist includes the layer-one blockchain Sonic ( S ), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Maker ( MKR ), and a toss-up of intellectual property-focused project Story ( IP ), Ethereum ( ETH ) virtual machine (EVM) chain Berachain ( BERA ) and KAITO. “If I were to choose three coins to hold for the mid-term, they’d probably be: S: good defi activity, strong rebrand, lots of $$ going on there + Andre MKR: insane chart, continually grinding higher, strong og defi prob one of BERA/KAITO/IP, all these new coins are strong.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s the Crypto Promising a 3,633% Surge.",https://thecoinrise.com/will-shiba-inu-and-cardano-reach-new-peaks-in-2025-heres-the-crypto-promising-a-3633-surge/,"Shiba Inu and Cardano have been pivotal players in the cryptocurrency scene, drawing significant attention and fostering robust communities. Both have weathered varied market cycles, yet the possibility of them surpassing their historical peaks remains a topic of hot debate. Amidst this, Shiba Inu capitalizes on its vibrant community and viral appeal, whereas Cardano continues to push the boundaries with its technological enhancements. However, a new challenger, Web3Bay , is starting to eclipse these familiar faces with its groundbreaking potential and enticing promise of a 3,633% return on investment for early investors, having already accrued over $1.6 million in its presale. Analyzing Shiba Inu’s Market Dynamics Shiba Inu, a frontrunner among meme coins, faces a challenging path to reclaim its peak price levels. Despite achieving impressive highs during the 2021 bull market, it now trades at a significantly lower level, with recent months showing a notable decline. This downturn has sparked concerns among investors about its capability to breach and sustain beyond its previous highs. While there is speculative optimism about its future performance, real traction will likely depend on substantial developments within its ecosystem, such as the successful rollout of Shibarium and other strategic enhancements. Cardano’s Prospects for Setting New Records Cardano stands as a beacon of innovation within the smart contract arena but hasn’t been immune to the market’s downturns. Despite the recent advancements and increasing trading volumes, its price has struggled to keep pace. Yet, with developments like the Chang Hard Fork, Cardano is enhancing its network’s decentralization and functionality, potentially setting the stage for increased adoption across DeFi and enterprise solutions. However, the intense competition from other blockchain networks poses significant hurdles, requiring Cardano to not only innovate but also capture substantial market traction to achieve new price records. Web3Bay: A New Frontier for Crypto Returns While Shiba Inu and Cardano work to recapture their former highs, Web3Bay is making a powerful entrance with its innovative and disruptive approach to e-commerce. This decentralized platform is set to transform the online shopping experience by eliminating middlemen, slashing transaction fees, and bolstering security—all through its trustless, peer-to-peer marketplace. By diving into a trillion-dollar industry, Web3Bay is perfectly positioned to leverage blockchain technology for a monumental shift in how digital commerce operates. Already, Web3Bay’s presale has amassed over $1.6 million, signaling strong investor trust and optimism. Priced attractively at just $0.005247 during its presale, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay offers early investors the chance for a staggering 3,633% return on investment. Such a significant growth opportunity is uncommon among more established cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Cardano, positioning Web3Bay as one of the standout investment opportunities for 2025. The true allure of Web3Bay extends beyond just its financial prospects. Unlike many cryptocurrency ventures that are propelled by mere market excitement, Web3Bay serves a tangible, utilitarian purpose that could fundamentally alter the e-commerce landscape. As conventional online marketplaces grapple with issues like excessive fees, concerns over data privacy, and the pitfalls of centralized governance, Web3Bay’s blockchain solution stands out as a superior alternative that delivers real benefits to both merchants and consumers. This not only enhances its appeal as an investment but also underscores its potential to set a new standard in the e-commerce sector. Choosing the Crypto with the Most Upside for 2025 As investors navigate the choices between Shiba Inu, Cardano, and Web3Bay, the latter presents a compelling case with both immediate and long-term benefits. While Shiba Inu and Cardano require broader market rallies and significant ecosystem developments to reach new highs, Web3Bay offers a clear path to substantial returns based on tangible advancements and market penetration. For those looking to maximize their investment impact in 2025, Web3Bay provides an intriguing alternative, promising not only robust returns but also a revolutionary change in how e-commerce operates. As the crypto landscape evolves, aligning with innovative projects like Web3Bay could prove to be a wise strategy for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, aiming to capture significant gains in the rapidly expanding digital economy.

Turbo (TURBO) is a prime example—launched as an experimental meme coin, it shocked everyone by skyrocketing to a market cap that made early buyers filthy rich. If you missed that wave, here’s your redemption shot with the top new meme coin for significant returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is storming through its presale, offering a 3650% ROI potential, and those who recognize this golden window will be sitting on serious wealth. Right now, BTFD Coin is at $0.00016, but it won’t stay this cheap for long. With over $6.25 million raised, 71 billion coins sold, and 11,200+ holders, the 14th presale stage is near its end. Analysts predict a moonshot to $0.006 after launch, and if you invest now, you could see your portfolio multiply 36.5 times. While others sleep on this gem, smart investors are stacking their bags with the top new meme coin for significant returns before it’s too late. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That Could Mint New Millionaires Every once in a while, a presale emerges that screams opportunity. Right now, that’s BTFD Coin (BTFD). Unlike the wild volatility of post-launch meme coins, presales offer investors a chance to secure assets at rock-bottom prices before the pump. With BTFD’s presale currently at $0.00016, those who get in now are locking in a 275% ROI before it even hits exchanges, and that’s just the beginning. Let’s put it into perspective. A $1,500 investment today at $0.00016 secures you 9.375 million BTFD coins . When the presale wraps up at $0.0006, your holdings would already be worth $5,625—a nearly 4x gain before public trading even starts. But the real magic happens if BTFD hits its predicted moon price of $0.006. That same $1,500 investment? It would be worth $56,250. This isn’t speculation—this is math. BTFD isn’t just hype—it’s built on Ethereum, ensuring security and long-term sustainability. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which launched on January 1, 2025, lets users earn rewards while playing, further boosting community engagement. Staking is another powerhouse feature, offering a 90% APY, meaning passive income while you wait for prices to skyrocket. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad has built a movement—one that embraces buying low, holding strong, and cashing out when the market moons. Did you miss the Bitcoin dips? Ethereum crashes? Dogecoin’s underdog story? This is your shot to BTFD and ride the bull market from the very beginning. And if you’re looking for even more ways to stack up your holdings, BTFD’s referral program makes it simple: To earn big with BTFD, simply connect your wallet on the BTFD official site , grab your unique referral code, and share it with friends, family, or your community. Whenever someone buys $50 or more, they score 10% extra BTFD, while you pocket 10% of their purchase—and if you land in the top 20, your rewards skyrocket even more. Keep an eye on your earnings, stack up BTFD, and secure your spot in the top new meme coin for significant returns before the presale ends! Turbo (TURBO) – The Meme Coin That Turned Peanuts into Fortunes Turbo (TURBO) started as a joke—literally generated by AI—but ended up making millionaires. Its presale days were overlooked, with many laughing at its experimental origins. But while skeptics stayed on the sidelines, early investors quietly loaded up. Back in its launch phase, Turbo traded for fractions of a cent, but its insane rally took it to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.0144 on December 11, 2024. At its peak, investors who had put in a mere $500 during its early days were sitting on millions. The doubters? They were left wishing they had taken the risk when it was still dirt cheap. That story isn’t unique. Dogecoin had the same fate. Shiba Inu followed suit. Every time a meme coin gets dismissed as a fluke, it ends up proving the naysayers wrong. The ones who win? The ones who get in before the hype wave crests. Turbo’s story is a reminder that missing a meme coin’s early days is a costly mistake. History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes—and right now, BTFD is playing the same song Turbo did before it took off. Will you listen this time? Final Call – BTFD Presale Is Almost Over, Are You In? If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing Turbo’s meteoric rise, BTFD is your second chance—and maybe your last. The 14th stage is almost complete, and once this presale ends, prices won’t be this low again. The $0.00016 entry point won’t last forever. When it hits $0.006, your ROI is 3650%. That’s the kind of return that turns small investments into financial freedom. While others hesitate, action-takers secure their future. If you’re waiting for a sign, this is it. The next meme coin explosion is unfolding right now. Get in before the BTFD Coin presale swings into action, or watch the top new meme coin for significant returns from the sidelines again.

BTFD Coin is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a thriving community, a high-yield staking system (90% APY), and a Play-to-Earn game already live. Its presale has raised $6.25 million, and analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, making it one of the hottest meme coins right now. How does BTFD’s presale compare to Turbo’s early days? Like Turbo, BTFD is in its undervalued presale phase, offering a huge upside for early buyers. Turbo’s launch price was dirt cheap, and those who got in made life-changing gains. BTFD’s $0.00016 presale price offers a similar early-stage entry before its moonshot. How much can I make if I invest $1,500 in BTFD? At the current price of $0.00016, a $1,500 investment gets 9.375 million BTFD coins. If BTFD hits its expected post-launch price of $0.006, that $1,500 turns into $56,250. Is there a risk in investing in meme coins like BTFD? Like any investment, meme coins carry risk, but BTFD mitigates it with a strategic presale entry, staking rewards, and a growing ecosystem. Getting in early minimizes exposure to post-launch volatility, unlike buying at an all-time high. How do I join the BTFD Coin presale? Simply visit the official BTFD website, connect your wallet, and buy at the current presale price before the stage sells out. Don’t wait—the price increases at every stage.

The SEC attached a $50K incentive for its employees in what the financial regulator is calling a “voluntary early retirement” program. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) have focused their efforts on significantly slimming the government workforce and saving the government money in several areas. Massive layoffs and federal buyout programs are the results of their efforts so far. Most recently, SEC has offered its long-term employees the chance to resign or retire for a cash prize of $50K. Photo of Elon Musk wielding the chainsaw that Argentine president, Javier Milei gave to him at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) SEC goes the voluntary early retirement route According to an internal memo from SEC Chief Operating Officer Ken Johnson, the voluntary early retirement program is open to permanent employees who were on the agency’s payroll before January 24, 2025. Employees eligible for the offer must make their decision by March 21, 2025, and separate from the agency by April 4, 2025. The program allows these employees to either resign, be transferred to another agency, or immediately retire. The memo also stated that employees who accept the incentive and return to the SEC within five years are obligated to repay the incentive in full. The Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to reduce the federal workforce have already resulted in the elimination of over 100K civilian jobs, and their momentum does not seem to be slowing down. In February, The White House instructed federal agencies to submit their plans for “ large-scale reductions in force ” by March 13. The memo from the White House didn’t provide any specific roles for termination but said to start with workers deemed non-essential during a government shutdown. Furthering their plans to save money, the memo also instructed federal agencies to submit proposals to move their offices out of Washington and into “less costly parts of the country.” It is expected that the immediate cost of the SEC’s buyout offer will be offset by eliminating further expenses on the employees who accept the offer. Additionally, the SEC has instructed all staff, including unionized workers, to return to the office starting April 14, 2025. This instruction follows an order from the president demanding that employees work in person . This order doesn’t come as a surprise, as Donald Trump ordered heads of departments and agencies to “take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements” on his very first day in office. The instructions have been met with pushback from employees as the union’s contract with the agency allows for remote work. The instruction only temporarily excludes employees who already have full-time remote arrangements or whose homes are more than 50 miles from an SEC office. Buyouts in the workforce The SEC buyout program is in line with the Trump administration’s aim of significantly slashing the government workforce. It is one of many other agencies that has offered incentives to workers to voluntarily part with their roles. Black and white photo of US President Donald Trump and DOGE head and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk sitting side by side. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) An average of 62,000 federal workers have retired each year over the past decade, according to data provided by the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), but with the strategies of DOGE and President Trump, that number is expected to rise sharply. The Department of Education offered a $25K incentive to its employees to voluntarily retire or resign. Although it was framed as a voluntary program, the announcement of the incentive also came with the threat of a “significant reduction in force for the US Department of Education” following the deadline for application. The White House also offered all 2.3M federal employees, including 783K civilians in the Defense Department, a buyout worth roughly eight months of their salary and benefits. The offer was reported to be for employees who refused to comply with President Trump’s demand for all workers to return to the office. The email offering the incentive was framed as an easy method for the administration to effectively end remote work for most of the federal workforce. Still, it also carried the threat of the “majority” of agencies seeing reductions in force following the expiration of the offer. The US Postal Service recently offered early retirement incentives of up to $15,000 to mail handlers and other support staff, citing operational changes as the reason behind the move. “The United States Postal Service is continuing to transform its business model and build an organization structured for success. As a result of our capital investments in state-of-the-art mail processing equipment and changes to our network, the Postal Service needs to reduce staffing in those facilities that are overstaffed as we continue to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service to all communities,” the USPS spokesperson said .

His remarks triggered a sharp decline in U.S. stocks during late afternoon trading, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also weakened. “They’re going to have to face a tariff. What they need to do is build their car plants and other facilities in the United States—then they won’t have tariffs,” Trump stated at the White House. Trump doubles down on tariffs, citing fentanyl crisis and trade imbalances Trump stated there was “no room left” for a deal to prevent the tariffs by addressing fentanyl flows into the United States. He also announced that reciprocal tariffs would take effect on April 2 against countries that impose duties on U.S. products. Additionally, he reaffirmed plans to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports from 10% to 20% as a penalty for Beijing’s continued shipment of fentanyl to the U.S., asserting that China “has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis.” CEOs and economists warn that Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico—which would affect over $900 billion in annual U.S. imports—would significantly disrupt the deeply integrated North American economy. The Trump administration confirmed that the tariffs would take effect on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT). At that point, Canada and Mexico will face a 25% tariff, with Canadian energy products subject to a 10% duty. Mexican officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told reporters that Ottawa was prepared to respond. She noted that there’s a level of unpredictability and chaos coming from the Oval Office, and they would be dealing with it. Gustavo Flores-Macias, a public policy professor at Cornell University, said consumers could see price hikes within days. “The automotive sector is expected to face significant negative impacts, not only due to disruptions in the supply chains that span all three countries but also because higher vehicle prices could weaken consumer demand,” said Flores-Macias. Mexico, which first managed to evade Trump’s first round of tariffs by vowing to deploy thousands of troops to its northern border, has stepped up its anti-drug efforts and signalled it might also impose new measures on Chinese goods coming into Mexico. At a press conference on Monday before Trump’s announcement, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that her government was calm while awaiting his decision. She still stressed that Mexico would retaliate if tariffs were enacted. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum holds a press conference a day before the imposition of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico March 3, 2025. REUTERS/Luis Cortes According to Sheinbaum the country has a plan B, C, and D,” Sheinbaum said, without providing specifics. She noted that trade and fentanyl-related cooperation with the U.S. had been “very good.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, synthetic opioids—primarily fentanyl—were responsible for 72,776 deaths in the U.S. in 2023. Lawmakers and economists sound alarm on tariff fallout and inflation risks Representative Suzan DelBene, a Democrat from Washington, warned that imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico would burden American families with higher costs at the grocery store, gas pump, and pharmacy. “No president should have the power to raise taxes without a vote in Congress,” she said in a statement. Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that any inflationary impact from the tariffs would be “second-order small.” He added, “I don’t see the president wavering on this because he understands that to achieve a strong and prosperous America—with rising real wages and more factory jobs—this is the path he has chosen.” On Saturday, Trump levelled up his targeted sanction initiatives by starting a national safety probe into lumber and wood items, which might produce tremendous new tariffs. He particularly delivered to Canada, a nation already dealing with 14.5% tariffs on softwood. The prior week, Trump had actively reprimanded many Western nations for taxing American tech enterprises and threatened to sting more obstacles on billions of products. The same day, he imposed a new investigation into copper tariffs and other trade limitations. Trump intends to impose U.S. “reciprocal tariffs” equivalent to those of other nations and has either removed trade barriers. The European Union might rapidly face this initiative since the VAT taxes imposed by the European Union on its member states considerably affect the result. Nonetheless, Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s Policy Development and Review Department , believes that Trump’s “tariffs on steroids” strategy could fuel inflation and potentially push the global economy into recession.

This price fluctuation has led to millions of dollars in liquidations, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Cardano (ADA) Liquidations Data shows that a total of $40.80 million worth of ADA positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Of these liquidations, $30 million came from the long side, while $11 million came from the short side. Current Price Momentum As a result, ADA has recorded a 25% price drop in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.81. Due to this significant price fluctuation, its trading volume has dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels With the notable price drop, ADA has reached a crucial support level of $0.80. According to expert technical analysis, this support level was previously broken during the recent upside rally. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the asset holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 35% to reach $1.14. However, if the asset fails to hold this level, it could decline by 20% to $0.65 in the coming days. $110 Million Worth of ADA Outflow Despite market uncertainty, investors and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the token, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass .

The task force was announced by SEC acting chairman Mark Uyeda on Jan. 21. The task force has several aims, according to an accompanying description . They include “appropriately distinguish securities from non-securities, … provide realistic paths to registration for both crypto assets and market intermediaries … and make sure that enforcement resources are deployed judiciously.” The task force has familiar faces, and a few new ones Peirce, a vocal crypto advocate in Gary Gensler’s SEC, was named head of the task force on Jan. 21. In addition, Richard Gabbert was named the group’s chief of staff and Taylor Asher was named chief policy adviser. Gabbert and Asher are also senior advisers to Uyeda. There are 15 members of the task force. “The task force is composed of staff from the Acting Chairman’s office and other divisions and offices across the Commission,” Peirce said in the SEC announcement of the appointments. Some of the appointees are longtime SEC staffers. According to LinkedIn, Gabbert, for example, has been at the agency since 2011 and served as Peirce’s counsel for seven years. Others were hired for the task force position. Chief Counsel Michael Selig is joining from law firm Wilkie Farr & Gallagher. Asher was an aide to pro-crypto Senator Bill Hagerty for a year before joining the SEC as an adviser to Uyeda in 2023. The task force has veteran crypto defenders Senior adviser Landon Zinda came to the task force from advocacy group Coin Center, where he had been policy counsel. In October 2022, Coin Center and three individuals filed suit against the Treasury Department and its Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) seeking the removal of OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash and 44 wallets associated with it. The Tornado Cash suit was launched before Zinda joined the organization. During Zinda’s tenure, Coin Center has provided support for the Jarretts’ latest suit against the Internal Revenue Service and for Lewellen v. Garland, in which a software developer sued the Justice Department for targeting developers who create non-custodial crypto wallets for unlicensed money transmission. Before Coin Center, Zinda was counsel for the Senate Committee on Banking focusing on crypto and fintech. Zinda began his career at the Heritage Foundation. Senior adviser Chris Rice is also senior adviser in the SEC Division of Investment Management. He came to the agency in 2023 after working in alternative investments in major financial institutions. New policies precede the task force Mark Uyeda has been on the SEC staff since 2006 and has been a commissioner since 2022. U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkin to be the chair of the SEC. He has not been confirmed by the Senate yet. Atkins comes from a legal background. He was a commissioner at the SEC from 2002 to 2008 under three chairs. He has been on the staff of two SEC commissioners and was also co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance. No date has been set for Atkin’s confirmation hearing. Even without the new chair in place, the SEC has shown indications of a drastic policy change from Gensler’s strident anti-crypto stance. Since Jan. 20, when Uyeda was appointed acting chair, the agency has dropped actions against the Tron Foundation , cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken , decentralized exchange Uniswap , NFT platform Yuga Labs, MetaMask developer Consensus and financial services company Robinhood. The agency has also rescinded the burdensome accounting rule in Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 that required crypto platforms to treat all assets they custodied as liabilities.

With XRP trading at $2.19 and Dogecoin at $0.2, their growth potential appears limited compared to MUTM’s expected spike. Already in its presale phase, this rapidly developing altcoin has already surpassed over $2 million, with Phase 2 ongoing at a price of $0.015. Over 3,800 investors have already jumped on this project, looking to get a 33.33% hike in price during the next stage. Investors who buy now will enjoy a 300% profit when Mutuum Finance goes live at $0.06. Furthermore, with predictions anticipating rising to $16 in 2025, investors will achieve 1600x gains. Limited Upside: Why Dogecoin and Ripple Could Trail Behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been mainstream famous within the crypto market, yet their upside for future appreciation appears to be capped. Dogecoin, while it has a cult following and temporary social media bursts, doesn’t have strong fundamentals and real-world applicability beyond speculation. At the same time, XRP, valued at $2.19, continues to struggle with regulatory challenges, as its price movement heavily relies on legal proceedings and institutional acceptance. While the two coins may see a rise in value in the next market cycle, their potential upside is overshadowed by future projects with greater potential for growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), even at the stage of presale, is already indicating such humongous breakout potential that it’s far more of a good investment in 2025. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big DeFi Thing Mutuum Finance is fast becoming the next big thing in decentralized finance. This upcoming altcoin has already garnered over $2 million in funding and 3,800+ investors in its presale, with its groundbreaking dual-lending mechanism. Trading at $0.015 in Phase 2, investors have not much time before the next 33.33% price surge. With the initial launch price being $0.06, early investors would realize 300% returns, and analysts foresee even bigger gains during the following bull run. From its dual lending program and solid fundamentals, Mutuum Finance is turning into one of the most promising DeFi projects of the year. Mutuum Finance offers an innovative lending model that is a combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows individuals to lock stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-based liquidity pools, earning passive returns while facilitating instant borrowing. The P2P model facilitates direct lending contracts between users in a peer-to-peer manner, cutting out middlemen for greater efficiency, transparency, and autonomy. The hybrid model addresses conservative investors seeking stable yields as well as risk-taking traders seeking higher rewards. A Secure & Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is also launching a collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that offers security and price stability. Unlike volatile algorithmic stablecoins, the model is backed by full asset and therefore avoids devaluations at the click of a button. Deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and strategic liquidity management also aid long-term growth. Mutuum Finance is set to spearhead the next generation of DeFi innovation with its strong architecture and expanding adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) are constrained on the upside, with Dogecoin relying on hype and XRP battling regulation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers genuine utility with its double-lending mechanism, stablecoin and deflationary strategy. On a presale value of $0.015, early birds can earn 300% at launch and 1,600x gain if MUTM hits $16 by 2025. With more than 3,800 investors and $2 million raised, Mutuum is launching. With the next big crypto thing, the time to act is now.

Dogecoin’s goal to achieve a market capitalization resembling Tesla’s would necessitate a 2,990% increase in price to $7.82, presenting a substantial potential gain but reliant on community enthusiasm and the influence of figures like Elon Musk. ADA, currently trading below $0.75, faces downward pressure, with technical evaluations indicating possible drops to $0.70 unless it regains the $0.81-$0.84 resistance zone. Conversely, BlockDAG displays substantial advancement and community-supported expansion. With a $200 million presale, over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold, and initial participants experiencing a 2,380% return, BDAG’s operational foundation is notably strong. Its March beta launch, $30 million grants initiative, and growing user base (over 500,000 X1 Miner application users) suggest sustained value beyond simple market speculation. Dogecoin’s Market Cap Ambitions: A Feasibility Study Dogecoin maintains a broad discussion presence, supported by a dedicated community and endorsements from prominent individuals like Elon Musk. This recognition has contributed to Dogecoin’s continued relevance in the evolving digital currency market. For Dogecoin to match Tesla’s market cap, its price must reach $7.82 per coin, a 2,990% increase from its current $0.25332. Such a rise would transform 15,000 Dogecoin, presently valued at $3,798, into $117,352, attracting those seeking substantial gains. While Tesla’s acceptance of Dogecoin enhances its credibility, substantial demand growth is essential. Its community-driven appeal maintains its ongoing relevance. The examination of BlockDAG in comparison, shows a different trajectory. ADA’s Technical Analysis: Identifying Key Support Levels ADA’s price is under downward pressure, presently trading below the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart. If ADA’s price fails to remain above $0.75, a decline to $0.73 or even $0.70 is possible, indicating further weakness. Technical indicators, such as LuxAlgo Trendline Breaks, suggest a potential breakdown, making support levels crucial. The MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating reduced buying strength, while the RSI at 41.38 suggests ADA is approaching oversold conditions but is not yet at extreme levels. A breakout above $0.81 could shift sentiment, though resistance at $1.16590 and $1.34 may limit gains without sufficient trading volume. Rejection near $0.80-$0.84 validates a supply zone. If ADA’s price reclaims $0.81-$0.84, a recovery towards $1 is possible, but its ability to maintain key levels will determine its subsequent movement. The review of BlockDAG shows a different growth pattern. BlockDAG’s $200M Presale & Beta Launch: An Assessment of 30,000x Potential BlockDAG is gaining traction within the digital currency market with significant growth and strategic plans for 2025. In its recent AMA, attended by over 800 individuals, the team shared key updates, including a March beta test net launch, a $30 million developer grants program, and new team members focused on global expansion. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising $200 million with over 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold. Early participants have experienced a 2,380% return, and new participants are securing coins before the next price increase. BlockDAG’s beta test net will enhance network scalability, security, and speed, inviting community participation in testing and earning rewards. The $30 million grants program supports developers in creating innovative dApps, with hackathons planned in collaboration with HackerEarth.

With 10 CEX listings planned and projections of a 30,000x increase, BlockDAG is positioned as a major digital currency opportunity. The examination of BlockDAG’s technological approach is very important. The potential of BlockDAG is very high. The future of BlockDAG is being closely watched. The analysis of BlockDAG’s growth shows real value. The progress of BlockDAG is significant. The review of BlockDAG’s roadmap is critical. Comparative Analysis & Future Outlook While Dogecoin’s market cap aspirations and ADA’s potential recovery may attract traders, BlockDAG’s strategy is based on tangible progress, not just market sentiment. Dogecoin’s path to a Tesla-sized market cap is highly speculative, and ADA’s potential gains depend on overcoming persistent downward pressure. BlockDAG is actively achieving milestones, including a beta test net launch in March and a developer grants program that promotes development. The X1 Miner application’s over 500,000 downloads and planned 10 exchange listings contribute to its expanding ecosystem. With early participants experiencing substantial returns and projections of a 30,000x increase, BDAG offers both immediate gains and potential for sustained growth.

As ADA struggles to regain ground—trading at $0.80 after falling over 40% from its December high—analysts believe a breakout could be on the horizon. A 70% rally isn’t off the table, particularly as Cardano pushes for deeper Bitcoin integration, a move that could reshape its standing in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is drawing serious attention from investors, with its presale exceeding $1.5 million over the weekend. While Cardano fights to reclaim its bullish momentum, Web3Bay is emerging as one of the most intriguing crypto plays of 2025, offering early backers the potential for exponential gains. Cardano’s 70% Upside—Is a Breakout Imminent? ADA’s price has been caught in a volatile range, hovering around $0.80. However, analysts suggest that a 70% rally could be within reach if Cardano can break out of consolidation. Hoskinson’s recent remarks have only added fuel to the speculation. In a lengthy interview, he took aim at Ethereum and Solana, arguing that neither has the infrastructure to build a robust DeFi layer on Bitcoin—a challenge that Cardano is actively addressing. Hoskinson sees Bitcoin integration as a game-changer for Cardano, unlocking access to Bitcoin’s liquidity while establishing a more decentralized financial ecosystem. With the Bitcoin market valued at over $2 trillion, the opportunity remains largely untapped. Other projects like Core and Stacks (STX) have attempted similar integrations, but Hoskinson insists that Cardano’s research-based approach and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) framework offer a superior solution. Technical analysts point to the $1 resistance as a critical barrier. If ADA clears this level, the next target sits at $1.36, aligning with the projected 70% rally. However, sustaining momentum will depend on continued adoption, network advancements, and successful Bitcoin integration. Web3Bay’s Presale Crosses $1.5M—A Sleeping Giant? While Cardano eyes a breakout, Web3Bay’s presale is already hitting major milestones. Surpassing $1.5 million over the weekend, the project has quickly become one of the fastest-growing crypto startups of 2025. Web3Bay is shaking up the e-commerce industry by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes intermediaries, lowers transaction costs, and empowers buyers and sellers through blockchain technology. Unlike centralized giants such as Amazon and eBay—known for high fees and seller restrictions—Web3Bay offers a peer-to-peer ecosystem where users maintain full control over transactions. Investor interest in Web3Bay has been surging, with demand for its 3BAY token driving its presale success. Currently priced at $0.005247, the token is expected to launch at $0.1959, potentially delivering a staggering 3,633% return for early investors. The project’s appeal lies in its ability to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. Blockchain-based e-commerce is still in its infancy, giving Web3Bay a critical first-mover advantage in decentralized marketplaces. Which Crypto Has the Biggest Growth Potential? Both Cardano and Web3Bay offer compelling opportunities, but their appeal depends on investment strategy and risk tolerance. Cardano, an established blockchain with a dedicated community, could see a major upswing if its Bitcoin integration succeeds. However, ADA’s short-term prospects hinge on breaking key resistance levels and gaining broader adoption in the DeFi space. A 70% rally is possible, but long-term growth will depend on Cardano delivering on its ambitious plans. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is in its early adoption phase, meaning its potential upside is far greater. With an estimated ROI of 3,633% for presale participants, it represents a rare opportunity to enter a high-growth project before widespread adoption. For those looking for a more established yet potentially slower-moving investment, Cardano remains a solid choice. But for investors willing to take a chance on an early-stage disruptor with massive potential, Web3Bay stands out as one of the most exciting opportunities in the market. With Cardano pushing toward a breakout and Web3Bay gaining momentum in its presale, the question is clear—will you wait for established cryptos to regain their footing, or will you get ahead of the curve with an emerging project that could redefine its sector?

41126459,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=706124,1741053636,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Will Bitcoin Rise Or Fall Again? QCP Questions Trump-Fueled Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rise-or-fall-again-qcp-questions-trump-rally/,"Bitcoin surged past $95,000 during low-liquidity trading hours on Sunday after US President Donald Trump made a major announcement. The formation of a US Crypto Strategic Reserve, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), set the market ablaze with speculation. Many traders viewed this as a defining moment, one that could solidify crypto’s place in the U.S. financial system, while others remained wary, questioning whether the rally could sustain itself beyond the immediate reaction. Among those skeptical is QCP Capital. A Well-Timed Political Bitcoin Play? The timing of Trump’s announcement is difficult to ignore. Throughout the past week, risk assets faced mounting pressure as global markets reacted negatively to a series of economic and geopolitical developments. Trump’s newly imposed tariffs rattled investor confidence, while shaky Ukraine-Russia peace talks created additional uncertainty. Stock market volatility intensified, weighing heavily on sentiment across the financial sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Average Cost Basis At $90,950 — Why Is It Relevant? Bitcoin broke below its multi-month range, showing signs of weakness before Trump’s announcement. The sudden announcement was a stark contrast to the downward trajectory risk assets had been following. QCP Capital highlighted the political strategy behind the move: “For a president who thrives on being the market’s hero, last week’s risk asset performance performance was anything but inspiring. His slew of new tariffs and shakier than expected Ukraine-Russia peace talks rattled investor confidence. So, while the timing of the SBR was somewhat unexpected, the political calculus was clear — Trump needed a win before his approval ratings starts slipping, a metric he likely takes very personally.” However, questions remain as to whether this move represents a genuine shift in policy toward long-term crypto adoption or simply a well-timed announcement aimed at stabilizing sentiment before further economic strain emerges. While Bitcoin’s rapid ascent over the weekend excited traders, QCP Capital remains unconvinced that this rally represents a meaningful breakout. The firm pointed to several key market signals that indicate Bitcoin is not yet out of the woods. QCP Capital cautioned: “Are we back in the game? Not quite. BTC is still trading near the bottom of its multi-month range and frontend crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March. The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the US administration.” Lessons From The Past: The ‘Xi Candle’ Comparison For seasoned traders, the weekend’s price action is reminiscent of a historical event in the crypto market—the infamous Xi Candle of 2019. Prominent crypto analyst Cold Blooded Shiller took to X to draw comparisons between the two events. Reflecting on the Xi Candle, Cold Blooded Shiller recalled how Bitcoin had been in a prolonged downtrend, trading at fresh lows with market sentiment at rock bottom. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China should embrace blockchain technology. The result was a massive short squeeze, with Bitcoin skyrocketing by 40% in just two days. Traders at the time believed it marked the beginning of a new bullish era for crypto. “Sentiment was very quick to adjust. You’ll be surprised (not) to hear that it didn’t take much back then to shape the whole mindset of Twitter into the positives and ability for the market to now have an infinite bid,” he wrote. However, the euphoria was short-lived. Several weeks later, China backtracked on its pro-blockchain rhetoric, implementing fresh crackdowns on crypto exchanges and warning investors about the risks of digital assets. Bitcoin’s gains slowly eroded, with price action reversing over the following month and ultimately dipping below pre-announcement levels. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Cycle Really Over? This Indicator Suggests Price Could Rebound To $130,000 “We did not immediately reverse the candle. It actually took many weeks to do that, which made it all the more painful for those trading it or those who had their bullish bias,” Cold Blooded Shiller recalled. The similarities between the Xi Candle and Trump’s Crypto Reserve announcement are striking. Both events followed prolonged periods of market weakness, both saw a dramatic shift in sentiment almost overnight, and both created a new bullish narrative that was widely embraced by the market. The key question now is whether Trump’s announcement will lead to a sustained trend shift or if, like the Xi Candle, it will eventually fizzle out, leaving late buyers trapped at the top. Key Events To Watch This Week Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its gains or extend higher will likely depend on key macroeconomic and regulatory developments in the coming days. On Wednesday, markets will receive the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data, a crucial economic indicator that could influence expectations for Federal Reserve policy. If PMI data shows signs of economic weakness, it could increase speculation about potential rate cuts, which may provide a tailwind for risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, stronger-than-expected data could reinforce the view that the Fed will maintain its restrictive policy stance, potentially pressuring crypto and equities alike. Friday brings the release of the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, a key employment indicator that has historically influenced market sentiment. A strong jobs report could signal continued economic resilience, reducing the likelihood of near-term rate cuts, which could negatively impact Bitcoin. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected report could fuel risk-on sentiment, further supporting BTC’s momentum. Also on Friday, the White House Crypto Summit is expected to provide critical insights into the future of the US Crypto Strategic Reserve. If tangible announcements emerge, BTC could rise further. However, if the event fails to deliver meaningful policy direction, the market could react negatively, leading to increased volatility. As QCP Capital put it, “Just when we think Trump has exhausted his cards, he may still have more surprises up his sleeve. Will this be the push toward that elusive all-time high? We’ll be watching.” At press time, BTC traded at $90,352.

Qubetics Is Set to Ignite,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-for-significant-returns-in-2025-missed-polygon-qubetics-is-set-to-ignite/,"The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing, with new trends emerging faster than you can refresh your feed. 2025 is no exception. After experiencing a major dip in early 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have regained some ground, sparking conversations about the next big thing. But as the usual heavyweights like Ethereum and Polygon continue to ride their well-worn waves, some fresh contenders are catching everyone’s eye. In fact, some promising cryptos that could’ve been snapped up earlier in 2025 are now considered missed opportunities—Polygon, for instance. But that doesn’t mean the ship has sailed for high returns. If anything, there’s a fresh opportunity on the horizon—Qubetics ($TICS). It’s quickly becoming the next big crypto to look out for in 2025, and the FOMO around it is palpable. While other tokens struggle to bring something new to the table, Qubetics is focused on real-world solutions, setting itself apart from the crowd. From its rapidly growing crypto presale numbers to analysts predicting explosive price surges post-launch, Qubetics is worth paying attention to. Missed Opportunity: Polygon Polygon, once a darling of the Layer-2 scaling solutions, has been making waves for its ability to enhance Ethereum’s capabilities. It was one of the first projects to really show that Ethereum could scale without compromising security or decentralization. And for a while, it seemed like Polygon would only grow bigger. Its aim to support Ethereum’s ecosystem and offer faster, cheaper transactions really caught people’s attention back in 2021 and 2022. Fast forward to 2025, and Polygon’s hype has started to die down. What happened? Well, as the years went on, competition caught up. Layer-2 solutions from various blockchain networks are quickly growing, and other projects have started outpacing Polygon in terms of innovation and adoption. While Polygon still holds some relevance, it no longer holds the same level of excitement or potential as it once did. The crypto world moves fast, and while Polygon did great things, it’s just not as “hot” as it once was. So, if you missed out on Polygon during its prime, you’re probably wishing you’d jumped in a bit earlier. But the good news is, there’s still time to cash in on newer projects with even greater potential. Qubetics: The Crypto You Shouldn’t Miss in 2025 Here’s where things get interesting. If Polygon’s miss was a reminder that the crypto world is always shifting, then Qubetics is the shining example of a project that’s ahead of the curve. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain solution—it’s aiming to tackle real-world problems that others haven’t been able to address. And that’s where it differs from most cryptos. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 24th stage, having sold more than 495 million tokens to over 22,000 holders, raising over $14.5 million. At just $0.0976 per $TICS token, it’s clear that early supporters are about to see massive returns as the presale progresses. If analysts are right, $TICS could skyrocket to $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 155% return on investment. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. After the presale ends, some analysts predict that $TICS could hit $1, which would result in a whopping 923% ROI. And it doesn’t stop there. Post-mainnet launch, the price could reach $5, representing a jaw-dropping 5018% return. What makes Qubetics even more enticing is the real-world application of its blockchain. The flagship product, QubeQode IDE, is a next-gen development platform that’s designed to solve a massive gap in the tech world. Developers and businesses alike are constantly looking for more efficient tools, and Qubetics delivers. By providing a seamless way for developers to write, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps), Qubetics is positioning itself to be a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem. Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner trying to streamline your operations. You could be in e-commerce, retail, or even healthcare—no matter the industry, Qubetics could help you develop a custom blockchain solution tailored to your needs. Or maybe you’re a developer working on the next big dApp. Instead of navigating through complex, fragmented platforms, you can use QubeQode to make your life a whole lot easier. That’s the beauty of Qubetics: it’s solving problems in real ways that businesses and individuals can relate to. Qubetics’ application has already gained significant traction. For example, a freelance developer could use the QubeQode IDE to launch a decentralized app without worrying about hefty upfront costs or complicated integration processes. Similarly, larger enterprises looking to move toward blockchain could integrate Qubetics’ tools to make their processes more efficient, secure, and cost-effective.Given its early momentum and the potential for massive returns, Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025. Popular Crypto Coin To Buy in 2025: Qubetics When you hear about a coin that’s already setting new records, it’s hard to ignore. Analysts are all buzzing about Qubetics and its future potential in 2025. Here’s why this crypto could be the one to watch this year: its use case is far more robust than a lot of the coins making waves right now. Qubetics stands out because it’s one of the few cryptocurrencies solving a real-world issue. Unlike many other coins that are mostly speculative or still struggling to gain solid footing in the blockchain space, Qubetics has proven it’s more than just a “promise.” The platform is actively being used in various sectors, ranging from tech startups to established industries like finance and healthcare. But it’s not just about utility—Qubetics also offers explosive growth potential. As its presale progresses, the $TICS price is set to rise rapidly. This means that anyone who hops on board now could be looking at some seriously impressive returns when the coin hits mainstream exchanges. And given its utility in real-world applications, there’s a high likelihood that $TICS could see long-term, sustained growth after its official mainnet launch. So, why should anyone care about Qubetics in 2025? Well, for starters, it’s tackling a problem that others have yet to touch. The QubeQode IDE is not just a tool for developers—it’s something that could dramatically shift how blockchain technology is used across industries. With blockchain becoming a critical part of various sectors, businesses are actively looking for ways to integrate it smoothly into their operations. Qubetics is the bridge they’ve been waiting for. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics So, here’s the takeaway: if you missed out on Polygon, it’s not too late. But don’t sit around waiting for the next big thing. Qubetics is here and already gaining serious traction. With a revolutionary development tool and real-world applications across multiple industries, Qubetics could very well be the key to massive crypto gains in 2025.

The regulator will take no enforcement action and has not issued any charges against the firm. Yuga Labs confirmed the news in a Mar. 3 post on X, calling it a “huge win” for the NFT industry and creators. The company added, “NFTs are not securities.” After 3+ years, the SEC has officially closed its investigation into Yuga Labs. This is a huge win for NFTs and all creators pushing our ecosystem forward. NFTs are not securities. — Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) March 3, 2025 The SEC launched its probe into Yuga Labs in October 2022 to determine whether its NFT collections and ApeCoin ( APE ), a token linked to BAYC, should be classified as securities under the Howey Test. The inquiry was part of a larger campaign against NFTs led by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, which also targeted NFT markets and fractionalized NFTs.

The SEC has dropped other investigations involving cryptocurrency companies in recent weeks, which coincides with the decision to conclude the Yuga Labs inquiry. The agency recently settled litigation with Coinbase and Kraken and concluded investigations into OpenSea, Robinhood, Gemini , and Uniswap Labs. The market anticipates that the regulatory shift will have a positive impact on the BAYC NFTS floor price , which is currently trading around13.75 Ethereum ( ETH ), down more than 90% from its peak of 153.7 ETH in May 2022. Meanwhile, on March 3, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force revealed on the regulator’s official website that it will be holding a number of roundtables for the public called “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The goal of these roundtables is to establish more precise rules pertaining to digital assets. The first event, “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” is set for March 21 from 17:00 to 21:00 UTC. These talks will explore important issues in crypto regulation and signal how the agency is changing its stance on digital assets.

Right now, many traders are overly focused on Bitcoin, believing it to be the safest bet. However, historical trends suggest that when altcoin interest is at its lowest, a significant rally is usually on the horizon. Market experts predict that altcoins are gearing up for a strong recovery, with capital expected to shift from Bitcoin to high-growth altcoin projects. While Bitcoin maintains a dominant position, an altcoin boom is approaching, and early investors in the right tokens could see substantial returns. Among the top contenders, three altcoins stand out for their potential in the next market cycle. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain solid picks, but a rising star— Web3Bay (3BAY)—is catching investors’ attention. Ethereum (ETH) — The Smart Contract Leader Ready for Expansion Ethereum has consistently been the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. Despite growing competition from other blockchains, Ethereum remains the primary hub for decentralized applications, with institutional investors increasing their exposure to ETH. With Ethereum-based ETFs gaining traction, demand for ETH is rising, and analysts believe breaking past $3,500 could trigger a strong rally toward new highs. As DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets gain adoption, Ethereum is positioned at the center of blockchain growth, making it a must-have for the next altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are driving optimism by reducing gas fees and improving transaction speeds. With ETH’s supply declining due to its deflationary tokenomics, a supply crunch could send prices soaring in the coming months. Solana (SOL) — The High-Speed Blockchain on the Verge of a 13% Breakout Solana has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a setup that often signals an imminent breakout. Crypto analyst Ali recently pointed out that Solana is primed for a 13% price move, with $193 being a key level to watch. Despite past concerns over network congestion, Solana has continued to deliver high-speed transactions with minimal fees, attracting strong institutional interest. As DeFi and NFTs continue expanding, Solana remains one of the most efficient blockchain networks, positioning it ahead of rivals like Cardano and Avalanche. With trading activity rising and sentiment improving, Solana’s next breakout could push it past key resistance zones, bringing it closer to its all-time high. However, while Solana presents a solid long-term investment, another lesser-known altcoin is gaining momentum—Web3Bay. Web3Bay (3BAY) — The Hidden Gem With 4200% Growth Potential Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which are already established, Web3Bay gives investors the chance to buy in early before its projected surge. Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by introducing a decentralized marketplace that removes middlemen, lowers fees, and enhances security for buyers and sellers. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay impose high fees and centralized control, whereas Web3Bay offers a blockchain-powered alternative with peer-to-peer transactions, transparency, and security. Web3Bay’s presale has already exceeded $1.5 million, reflecting strong demand for 3BAY tokens. Currently priced at $0.004562, its anticipated launch price of $0.1959 suggests a massive 4200% return—far exceeding the potential gains of Ethereum or Solana at this stage. What makes Web3Bay particularly compelling is its real-world application. Many cryptocurrencies rely on speculation, but Web3Bay is solving practical issues within the multi-trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. As demand for decentralized solutions grows, 3BAY is positioned for significant adoption, making it one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. Why This Is the Perfect Time to Buy These Altcoins The market is approaching a major altcoin rally, and history shows that early positioning is key to maximizing gains. Ethereum and Solana are showing strong signs of upward movement, but the biggest opportunity lies in early-stage projects like Web3Bay. With Ethereum aiming to break past $3,500, Solana consolidating before a key move, and Web3Bay still in its presale phase, now is the time to invest before prices skyrocket. Many investors miss out by waiting for confirmation, only to buy when prices have already surged. Those who take action now stand to gain the most. Ethereum and Solana offer solid long-term growth, but Web3Bay remains the most undervalued altcoin with the highest upside. Its disruptive e-commerce model, strong presale momentum, and projected 4200% ROI present a rare investment opportunity before it reaches mainstream markets. The question is—will you act now, or will you watch from the sidelines as another major crypto success story unfolds?

This reserve will include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Following the announcement, XRP’s value surged from $2.23 to $2.99. But can the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could affect everything. Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino pointed out that the case between Ripple and the SEC has big consequences for the future of XRP and the U.S. economy. He believes that if former President Donald Trump doesn’t act soon and the SEC continues its case against Ripple, it could hurt American investments in cryptocurrencies. However, Crypto Law founder and attorney John Deaton pointed out something interesting: the Ripple lawsuit was filed just before the end of Trump’s first term, under the leadership of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. Now, four years later, XRP has a chance to be a part of a major global cryptocurrency reserve. Deaton argues that if Trump does not intervene and the case continues, the U.S. could lose out on big opportunities in the growing crypto market. “He has to drop it,” Deaton said. What’s Next for XRP? The future of XRP and Ripple largely depends on how the case with the SEC plays out. If Ripple can resolve the issue, XRP could become a major part of the digital currency world. As Deaton said, this is a critical moment for the entire crypto industry, not just Ripple. How the SEC case is handled will impact not only XRP but also the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. and beyond. In conclusion, while the road ahead for Ripple and XRP is still uncertain, one thing is clear: the decisions made in this case could shape the future of cryptocurrency, with XRP playing a key role in the new world of digital finance.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|FIAT|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:00:26

Both will serve as senior advisors to the task force, alongside career SEC staff. Taylor Asher, who previously advised former Commissioner Mark Uyeda on policy, will serve as chief policy advisor.

ETH is now back below $2,200 and might decline further in the near term. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,350 support zone. The price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,160 and $2,250 resistance levels to start a recovery wave. Ethereum Price Dives 15% Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,550 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained bearish momentum below the $2,400 and $2,350 support levels. There was a clear move below the $2,250 support zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price even dived below the last low and tested the $2,000 zone. A low was formed at $2,003 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,080 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,150 level. There is also a new bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,160 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The main resistance is now forming near $2,275 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,275 resistance might send the price toward the $2,350 resistance. An upside break above the $2,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,450 resistance zone or even $2,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,020 level. The first major support sits near the $2,000 zone. A clear move below the $2,000 support might push the price toward the $1,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,750 support level in the near term.

The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability.

The latest market shakeup has turned the crypto world into a battlefield where only the strongest projects survive. Those who pick wisely now could be sitting on life-changing gains when the next bull run ignites. But here’s the catch—getting in early is the name of the game. That’s why BTFD Coin (BTFD) has taken center stage. This presale is roaring through its 14th stage with investors rushing in for its 90% APY staking, P2E game rewards, and a potential 3650% ROI moonshot. With over $6.25 million already raised and more than 71 billion coins sold, it’s the hottest bet in the meme coin universe right now. Miss it, and you might regret it when the price rockets. Ready to uncover the best meme coin presale to buy this week? Let’s dive in. 1. BTFD (BTFD) – The Meme Revolution Offering 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Ever wished you could buy the dip before a meme coin goes parabolic? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin (BTFD) is delivering—except this time, it’s pre-loaded with opportunities that no other meme coin can match. This isn’t just another pump-and-dump meme token. BTFD’s ecosystem is built to reward its holders long-term, offering a whopping 90% APY staking, a fully playable P2E game, and an ever-growing community that thrives on smart, early-stage investing. Right now, BTFD is in its 14th presale stage, with each coin priced at $0.00016. But when the presale ends, its listing price will shoot up to $0.0006, meaning early investors could already be sitting on 275% gains before the token even hits the market. Imagine throwing in $1500 at today’s presale price of $0.00016. You’d be holding 9,375,000 BTFD coins. If BTFD reaches its predicted moonshot price of $0.006, that same investment would be worth a staggering $56,250. And if that’s not enough, BTFD’s referral program allows you to earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code and invest at least $50. It’s a win-win—stack tokens and stack profits. Why does BTFD deserve a spot on this list? No other meme coin is offering this combination of high-yield staking, gaming rewards, and a presale surge that’s already bringing in millions. This best meme coin presale to buy this week isn’t just a chance—it’s your golden ticket to crypto riches. 2. Book of Meme (BOME) – The Meme Library That’s Breaking the Internet Book of Meme (BOME) is rewriting the history of meme coins—literally. It’s not just a token; it’s an entire archive of the internet’s funniest and most viral memes, stored forever on the blockchain. Its decentralized meme library allows users to create, own, and monetize memes like never before. Recently, BOME has expanded its ecosystem, integrating NFT meme minting and meme staking, where holders can earn passive income by simply owning legendary internet memes. Why is BOME part of this list? Because memes aren’t just a joke anymore—they’re an economy, and BOME is leading the way. 3. Ponke (PONKE) – The Hottest Community-Driven Meme Coin With Explosive Potential Ponke (PONKE) has been on a meteoric rise, thanks to its highly engaged community and aggressive development roadmap. Unlike other meme coins that fizzle out after a few weeks of hype, Ponke has been delivering on its promises. With exclusive airdrops, staking rewards, and a major CEX listing in the pipeline, Ponke is gearing up for another massive breakout. Why does Ponke deserve your attention? Because a strong, loyal community is what separates short-lived meme coins from long-term winners. 4. Bonk (BONK) – The People’s Meme Coin That’s Here to Stay Launched as Solana’s first meme coin, Bonk (BONK) has proven it’s more than just a fun experiment. With massive adoption across NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, and Solana-based games, BONK is showing real-world use cases. The team recently introduced BonkPay, a decentralized payment system allowing users to spend BONK for real-world purchases, making it one of the few meme coins with tangible utility. Why is Bonk a must-watch? Because it has successfully bridged the gap between meme culture and real-world adoption. 5. Brett (BRETT) – The Under-the-Radar Meme Coin Making Quiet Moves Brett (BRETT) might not have the same cult following as some of the bigger meme coins, but that’s exactly what makes it an undervalued gem. It’s been stealthily gaining momentum, with whales accumulating and rumors of upcoming exchange listings swirling around. BRETT has also teased a metaverse integration, potentially making it the next big play-to-earn contender in the meme coin space. Why should Brett be on your radar? Because sometimes, the best gains come from the coins people aren’t talking about yet—but soon will be. Final Thoughts: Time is Running Out! With meme coins making yet another explosive comeback, the question isn’t if they’ll take off, but which ones will leave you behind if you don’t act now. The one project that stands out among the best meme coin presales to buy this week is BTFD Coin. With 90% APY staking, a fully live P2E game, and a presale about to hit its final stages, this could be your last chance to lock in early-stage gains before the moonshot happens. Once it’s listed at $0.0006, the rocket launch is officially on. Are you in, or are you going to be the one watching from the sidelines when BTFD reaches $0.006?

The analyst has pinpointed a critical resistance level that XRP will need to hold lest it crashes to new lows and eradicates recent gains. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.5 TradingView crypto analyst MadWhale has shared a new price analysis focusing on XRP’s future price potential. The analyst emphasized his strong track record of cryptocurrency trends, underscoring that he has accurately identified and hit all the gain targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Pump To $3.35 On The Horizon With Bullish Cup And Handle Pattern Formation MadWhale predicts that the XRP price could crash below $1.9 to $1.5. The analyst revealed that XRP is currently in a downtrend and has been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish structure. According to his price chart, the cryptocurrency is also trading within a descending channel and fast approaching a key resistance level. This critical resistance point at the $2 mark has been tagged as a psychological level where sellers are likely to emerge and trigger further downward pressure on the cryptocurrency. If a rejection occurs at this $2.00 resistance level, MadWhale highlights that the next support area and downside target will be around $1.90, representing a 17.62% value drop. If the resistance level fails completely and the $1.90 support level breaks, the TradingView crypto analyst has forecasted another major breakdown in the XRP price. He predicts that the cryptocurrency could experience a more profound decline of 35%, possibly dropping down to the next major support level at $1.5. This crash target aligns with the lower boundary of the descending channel in which XRP currently resides. MadWhale has revealed that the decline to $1.5 could serve as a pivotal point for price stabilization, hinting at a possible reversal in the cryptocurrency once bearish pressures wane. The analyst’s price chart also shows that XRP recently tested the upper boundary of the descending channel but faced a rejection near the resistance. The main daily resistance area for the XRP price is marked in red on the chart, suggesting that $2.6 is where selling pressure might occur. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.8, already significantly above MadWhale’s daily resistance area. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan Triggers Major XRP Price Surge After experiencing a significant price crash over the past few weeks, the XRP price seems to be recovering at an alarming pace. In just one day, the cryptocurrency saw a double-digit price surge, successfully reversing its previous downtrend. Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring Analysts have attributed this unexpected sharp surge to the recent United States (US) crypto reserve plan announced by Donald Trump. The US President had included XRP in his plans for a crypto reserve aimed at boosting the country’s debt strategy and crypto dominance. As news of this strategic plan spread, the XRP price saw a 24.5% increase, pushing its value significantly above the $2.5 threshold once again.

Last week, it reached an all-time high of $2.98, but has since pulled back by around 41%. This price volatility has raised questions among investors about what’s driving the changes in its value. The token’s future is closely tied to market sentiment and exchange listings. If major exchanges list Pi, it could spark renewed investor interest, pushing the token to new highs. According to CoinCodex, Pi could surge by 234.84% this month, with a potential average price of $3.37—an increase of 101.79% from its current level. The highest price forecast is $5.64. A major factor affecting Pi’s price is the anticipation surrounding its potential listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Recently, Binance held a community vote, with 86% of users supporting the listing of Pi. However, despite this strong support, Pi Network has yet to be listed, which has led to some uncertainty among investors and contributed to the recent price dip. Despite the exchange listing delays, Pi Network is seeing increasing real-world use. Businesses in countries such as the USA, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and India are accepting Pi as payment. In China, BYD Auto Service Company even allowed customers to purchase cars with Pi, selling around 100 vehicles globally. This growing acceptance could help boost Pi’s reputation in the crypto space. March will be a key month for Pi’s future, as it could determine whether the token bounces back or remains under pressure.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 03:43:12

Has Bitcoin Bottomed? Bitcoin experienced significant volatility over the past week, dropping from $96,000 on February 23 to $78,258 on February 27. However, it recovered most of its losses yesterday, rebounding to as high as $95,000. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Sell Pressure Fades, Could A Local Bottom Be Forming? Analyst Explains In the Quicktake post, abramchart highlighted the declining Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for BTC holders. For those unfamiliar, the SOPR measures the proportion of BTC wallets that have held the cryptocurrency for more than one hour but less than 155 days. According to SOPR, any value greater than 1 indicates that short-term investors are selling at a profit. Conversely, a value below 1 suggests that short-term investors are incurring losses. While a value under 1 may indicate bearish sentiment, it can also be seen as a sign of market capitulation, often followed by a potential trend reversal. The total crypto market cap surged by more than $200 billion yesterday, driven by US President Donald Trump’s announcement regarding the creation of a crypto reserve. As of today, the SOPR sits at 0.95, the lowest it has been since August 2024 when BTC was trading within a consolidation zone around the mid-$50,000 range. The post concludes: We have likely reached good accumulation zones for Bitcoin and are close to the bottom of the current wave. BTC Showing Signs Of Trend Reversal While predicting crypto markets can be difficult, some indications suggest that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a trend reversal after prolonged selling over the past month. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains For example, during its potential local bottom at $78,258, BTC partially filled a long-standing CME gap between $78,000 and $80,000. CME gaps often act as price magnets, and once filled, BTC typically moves in the opposite direction. Additionally, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that BTC has reached its most oversold level since August 2024. Martinez suggested that the high selling pressure on BTC might be nearing its end, potentially signaling a trend reversal. In related news, Andre Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, noted that despite the market pullback, BTC is flashing a massive contrarian buy signal, presenting an attractive risk-reward opportunity at current prices.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-trader-gains-1-2-million-in-two-hours-heres-how/,"Crypto trader and enthusiast Crypto Beast recently shared a post on X highlighting a substantial gain with XRP trading. According to his tweet, he earned $1.2 million in just two hours, attributing his success to his strong belief in XRP. The tweet quickly gained traction among cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts, prompting various responses from the community. Along with his post, Crypto Beast attached a screenshot of an XRP/USDT chart, showing a sharp price increase. The chart indicates a significant upward movement, with a key price level at $2.9110 and a percentage gain of 33.60%, demonstrating the volatility XRP experienced during that period. I just made $1.2M in 2 hours How? I’m a $XRP believer It’s as simple as that pic.twitter.com/lTGBAxFZpi — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) March 2, 2025 Community Reactions to the Rapid Gains The tweet sparked a conversation among traders, with some praising Crypto Beast’s conviction while others urged caution regarding XRP’s well-known volatility. A user named Crynet responded to the post, saying: “That’s quite the return in such a short time! Just remember, with great gains come great volatility—hope you’re ready for the rollercoaster ride ahead.” Crynet’s comment underscores a common sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. While large gains can be exhilarating, they often come with significant price swings. Many traders who experience rapid profits also face the risk of sharp corrections. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Jacqueline Marjory, took a more optimistic stance, stating : “That’s the power of conviction in your plays! $XRP has been showing signs of massive potential, and if you’ve been holding strong, those gains speak for themselves. It’s not just about the price action; it’s about believing in the long-term vision. Major respect for sticking with it!” Her comment reflects that XRP’s price movements are not just speculative but part of a broader growth trajectory. Many XRP supporters have long maintained that it has strong fundamentals and could see substantial adoption in the financial sector. The Nature of XRP’s Market Movements XRP’s market behavior has often been characterized by sharp price swings, making it attractive to traders looking for short-term opportunities. The 33.60% price surge, as shown in the attached chart, is a testament to XRP’s ability to generate substantial returns in a short period. However, such movements are risky, as corrections can follow rapid price increases. Crypto Beast’s success highlights the opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. It’s also a reminder of the importance of risk management. While his $1.2 million gain is impressive, not all traders will experience the same outcome, and significant price fluctuations can lead to losses just as quickly.

The leading cryptocurrency is down 10% on Tuesday, Mar. 4, according to the price tracker on crypto.news, reversing its weekend rally following Trump’s announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Investor sentiment quickly shifted after Trump reaffirmed 25% tariffs, triggering a major selloff across financial markets. The Dow Jones erased a 300-point gain to drop over 1,100 points, while the S&P 500 lost $1.5 trillion in market cap. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which had surged to $95,000 over the weekend, fell back into consolidation. Analysts had warned that the crypto reserve news lacked immediate impact and that macroeconomic risks could weigh heavier. The broader crypto market also suffered. Ethereum ( ETH ) plunged 15% to $2,067, marking its first drop below $2,100 in 15 months. Stocks linked to crypto, including Coinbase (-4.6%) and Robinhood (-6.4%), reversed earlier gains.

In his March 4 Substack article , he pointed to declining U.S. Treasury liquidity as a bullish sign, though he warned BTC could briefly test $70,000 if risk assets continue selling off.

SOL price is down over 20% and might struggle to recover above the $150 resistance. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $162 and $150 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $150 zone. Solana Price Dips Heavily Solana price struggled to clear the $180 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $165 and $155 support levels. It even dived below the $150 level. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The recent low was formed at $132 and the price is now consolidating losses with a bearish angle. Solana is now trading below $140 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $140 level. The next major resistance is near the $144 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $180 swing high to the $132 swing low. The main resistance could be $156 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $180 swing high to the $132 swing low. A successful close above the $156 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $165. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level.

The first major support is near the $125 level. A break below the $125 level might send the price toward the $120 zone.

While XRP remains a major player in cross-border payments, uncertainty surrounding regulations and price fluctuations has investors seeking new opportunities with high growth potential. Lightchain AI, with its blockchain and AI integration, is gaining traction as a top contender. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.6 million at a presale price of $0.006, reflecting strong confidence in its future. As investors look for stability and innovation, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a smart choice for long-term gains. Ripple Investors Face Market Ambiguity- What’s Driving the Shift Ripple’s XRP investors are navigating a landscape marked by significant market ambiguity. Recent price volatility, including a 4.3% decline to just under $2.02, has raised concerns. This downturn is influenced by the SEC’s ongoing legal actions against Ripple, alleging unregistered securities sales. Additionally, global economic factors, such as recent tariff announcements by President Donald Trump, have heightened market uncertainty, leading to cautious investor behavior. Despite these challenges, some investors remain optimistic, anticipating that a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the current administration could bolster XRP’s prospects. However, the convergence of legal uncertainties and macroeconomic factors continues to drive the current market shift, leaving XRP investors in a state of cautious anticipation. Lightchain AI- Safe Bet Amid Market Uncertainty As market uncertainty continues to impact cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI is emerging as a stable investment due to its well-structured tokenomics and low-latency performance. The platform’s tokenomics is designed for long-term sustainability, ensuring fair distribution and balanced incentives. With a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens , allocations are strategically placed for presale participants, staking rewards, liquidity pools, and ecosystem growth. Additionally, dynamic pricing mechanisms and deflationary elements, such as token burning, help maintain value over time. Beyond tokenomics, Lightchain AI boasts ultra-low latency, making transactions and AI computations seamless. Its high-speed processing allows real-time execution of decentralized applications while maintaining network efficiency. By prioritizing both economic stability and performance, Lightchain AI stands strong amid market fluctuations. Grab Investment Opportunities with Lightchain AI Presale The Lightchain AI presale presents an exciting opportunity for Ripple investors looking to diversify their portfolio. With a presale price of $0.006, participants have the potential to secure LCAI tokens at a discounted rate, anticipating future value appreciation. Moreover, early adopters can also benefit from staking rewards and liquidity pool incentives, further enhancing their investment returns. As the platform continues to grow and expand its use cases, LCAI tokens are expected to increase in value, given its well-structured tokenomics and demand for high-speed blockchain solutions. As such, investing in the Lightchain AI presale offers a unique chance to join an innovative platform with high growth potential. https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://twitter.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 05:10:41

The drop follows a short-lived rally after Donald Trump’s March 2 announcement of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, which briefly pushed ETH above $2,500. However, Trump’s confirmation that fresh tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico will go into force on March 4 has caused market sentiment to shift, raising concerns about broader economic instability. The announcement caused Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price to plummet, dropping below its pre-pump level of about $2190. Decentralized finance activity and the Ethereum futures market both indicate Ethereum’s declining momentum. Open interest in ETH futures has dropped by 10% over the last day, according to Coinglass data .

Staking (90% APY) and Bulls Squad Staking rewards are insanely high—90% APY, making BTFD a passive income machine for long-term holders. Combine that with the Bulls Squad, a unique community concept that gamifies engagement, and it’s easy to see why BTFD’s presale is moving fast. Referral Program: Turn Your Friends into Your Wealth Machine The BTFD referral program is a game-changer for those who want to maximize their profits beyond just holding. If your referral code gets used and you make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard, you’ll earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet : Visit BTFD’s official site and generate your referral code. Share Your Code : Send it to your friends, family, and crypto communities. Get Paid Big Time : If your referrals buy $50+ in BTFD, they get 10% extra tokens. You earn 10% of every purchase through your code if you make it into the top 20 referrers. Track your earnings in real time. This isn’t just a passive reward—it’s a 3650% ROI moonshot opportunity for those who bring in the biggest buys. With the 14th stage nearly complete, the referral competition is heating up, and every second counts. Investment Example: The Math Behind the 3650% ROI Let’s break it down with numbers.

In a post on X, he emphasized the strategic advantage of announcing on a Sunday when traditional financial markets are closed. He pointed out that this smart move by the president gives retail investors a unique opportunity, suggesting that traditional finance must adapt to the evolving landscape of digital assets. “For the first time, retail investors win. Traditional finance better catch up, or it will quickly become extinct,” Eric Trump stated, reinforcing that the financial world is no longer bound by conventional market hours.

The world no longer runs on a Mon-Friday,… pic.twitter.com/EPtbEisbdI — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) March 3, 2025 U.S. Crypto Reserve Announcement Donald Trump confirmed the creation of a U.S. Crypto Reserve on March 2, describing it as a necessary step to protect and elevate the cryptocurrency industry. Eric Trump shared his father’s statements, where the president criticized the regulatory stance of the Biden administration, claiming that it had hindered the growth of the digital asset sector. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration,” Trump stated, underscoring his belief that government policies had previously been detrimental to the sector. An Inclusive Reserve to Advance the Crypto Industry The reserve will reportedly include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Trump also stated that the reserve would contain other valuable assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By establishing a strategic reserve that includes multiple major digital assets, Trump signals a policy shift that could lead to broader adoption and institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. financial system. The inclusion of XRP, SOL, and ADA, in addition to BTC and ETH, suggests a diversified approach rather than focusing solely on the most dominant assets. Before the confirmation of the crypto reserve, Bitcoin maximalists were pushing for a Bitcoin-focused reserve , attempting to remove other digital assets from this monumental development. However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other advocates continually called for multi-token reserve , as involvement from the broader market could help to bolster the crypto space and encourage innovation. Eric Trump’s response underscores the broader implications of his father’s announcement, highlighting a shift in the U.S. government’s approach to digital assets. By establishing a U.S. Crypto Reserve, Trump aims to integrate cryptocurrencies more firmly into the financial system while challenging existing regulatory policies. This move could be a major step in advancing global finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

U.S.-China competition may drive strategic Bitcoin accumulation worldwide. Uncertainty surrounds the scale of Bitcoin holdings attributed to China. China is reportedly holding private discussions about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which is causing intense speculation in the cryptocurrency market. Reports indicate that government officials have been meeting on this topic since the U.S. election. This raises questions about China’s changing stance on digital assets. This development follows years of regulatory restrictions that severely limited Bitcoin trading and mining in the country. Will China Reverse Bitcoin Ban? On March 3, 2025, Crypto Rover, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, reported that China intends to lift its ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2025.

Recent incidents highlight the increasing risks faced by both individual crypto holders and major platforms. Popular streamer Amouranth was the target of a home invasion where attackers allegedly sought access to her digital assets, while Bybit suffered a record-breaking $1.4 billion hack due to a security loophole. Popular Streamer Amouranth Targeted in Home Invasion by Crypto-Seeking Robbers Late in the night on March 2, popular streamer and internet personality Kaitlyn Siragusa, widely known as Amouranth, reported being the victim of a terrifying home invasion. The assailants, allegedly three armed men, broke into her residence while demanding access to her cryptocurrency holdings. According to Amouranth’s posts on X, the robbers were yelling for crypto during the invasion, heightening concerns over the growing trend of physical attacks targeting digital asset holders. In a harrowing series of social media updates, Amouranth detailed the events of the night, explaining that the robbers appeared to be specifically after her cryptocurrency assets. Just hours later, on March 3, she posted a security camera video showing the three men on her property. The footage captured the moment she led them to another section of the house before three loud noises rang out, prompting the invaders to flee the scene. While it remains unclear whether the noises were gunshots, alarms, or some other form of deterrent, the attackers’ swift retreat suggests that their plan was disrupted. Authorities have yet to release official details regarding the incident, including whether any suspects have been identified or apprehended. Amouranth’s prominence in the online world has not only made her a successful content creator but also a known figure in the financial and cryptocurrency sectors. In November 2024, she shared a screenshot of her Coinbase account revealing that she held approximately 211 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at around $20 million at the time. The screenshot also indicated holdings of around $80,000 in Ether (ETH). Given her public transparency regarding her wealth, some speculate that the attackers may have specifically targeted her due to these disclosures. With her significant cryptocurrency holdings and history of financial openness—including appearances on YouTube financial shows—Amouranth has been vocal about investment strategies and wealth accumulation. Amouranth’s ordeal adds to a growing list of “crypto wrench” attacks, a term used to describe physical threats or coercion aimed at forcing victims to transfer their digital assets. These crimes have surged in 2025 as cryptocurrency’s mainstream adoption continues to rise, making high-net-worth holders prime targets for criminals. Several high-profile incidents in recent months have underscored this alarming trend: January 2025: A Canadian volunteer moderator for a crypto forum reportedly went into hiding after kidnappers attempted to abduct him and force him to transfer his Bitcoin holdings. Jan. 21, 2025: David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, was allegedly abducted from his home, with the assailants demanding a crypto ransom before his eventual release. February 2025: Another alleged crypto-related kidnapping attempt occurred in Chicago, reinforcing concerns that such attacks are becoming more frequent and geographically widespread. Speaking on the rising trend of crypto-related physical attacks, security expert “Dr. Anon” explained in an interview that these attacks are “frequently ‘your money or your life’ situations carried out by sophisticated, professional, and organized criminals.” He also advised crypto holders to take proactive security measures, including the use of “decoy” wallets containing only a small portion of funds that can be surrendered under duress. The attack on Amouranth serves as a chilling reminder of the risks associated with holding and publicly discussing large cryptocurrency holdings. With digital assets being decentralized and irreversible once transferred, they remain a prime target for criminals who see an opportunity to exploit high-profile or wealthy individuals. Security experts suggest several precautions that crypto holders should take to mitigate risk: Avoid publicly sharing holdings: Broadcasting crypto balances on social media can make individuals targets. Use hardware wallets: Keeping assets in cold storage rather than online exchanges limits immediate access. Implement multi-signature wallets: Requiring multiple approvals for transactions can make forced transfers more difficult. Have a security plan: Personal safety should be a priority, with home security systems and contingency plans in place. The Bigger Picture: Crime and Cryptocurrency The attempted robbery at Amouranth’s home is part of a broader discussion around the risks and regulatory concerns surrounding cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional bank accounts, which have fraud protection and centralized control, digital assets rely solely on their owners to ensure security. Once funds are transferred, they are nearly impossible to recover. Law enforcement agencies worldwide have been increasingly working on strategies to combat crypto-related crimes, but decentralized technology often complicates tracking and prosecution. Cases like Amouranth’s show the urgent need for heightened security measures, both for individuals and the industry as a whole. While Amouranth appears to have escaped physical harm, the psychological toll of such an invasion cannot be understated. The attack serves as a stark warning to high-profile cryptocurrency holders about the real-world dangers that accompany digital wealth. As crypto adoption continues to expand, so too must the awareness of security risks and the necessary precautions to prevent such terrifying incidents in the future. Crypto Hack Losses Surpass $1.5 Billion, Experts Urge Stronger Bug Bounty Programs In other news, as cryptocurrency-related security breaches continue to escalate, losses from hacks have now surpassed $1.5 billion, according to a report by blockchain security firm CertiK. The staggering amount, fueled largely by the historic $1.4 billion Bybit hack, has prompted cybersecurity experts to call for more robust bug bounty programs to attract top-tier ethical hackers and strengthen platform security. On March 3, CertiK reported that the total losses from cryptocurrency hacks in February alone reached $1.53 billion. The vast majority of this sum—more than $1.4 billion—came from the exploit of Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange. However, even without this incident, the firm found that additional hacks and exploits resulted in $126 million in losses, including a $49 million theft from Infini. This rising wave of attacks sheds light on the increasing sophistication of malicious actors in the crypto space, who continually exploit vulnerabilities in both centralized and decentralized platforms. Ethical hacker Marwan Hachem said recently that these figures signal an urgent need for better bug bounty programs to incentivize white hat hackers to identify vulnerabilities before bad actors do. Hachem, who serves as the chief operating officer at cybersecurity firm FearsOff, criticized the bug bounty framework employed by Safe, the multisignature wallet provider used by Bybit. According to him, Safe’s bug bounty program classified front and back-end bugs as ‘out of scope,’ meaning ethical hackers who discovered these vulnerabilities were not eligible for rewards. This oversight proved disastrous. The Bybit hack occurred due to a vulnerability that was excluded from the bounty program’s scope. As a result, while ethical hackers had no incentive to report such vulnerabilities, criminals exploited them for one of the largest thefts in crypto history. “What they considered out of scope led to the biggest crypto hack in history,” Hachem stated. “We often breach platforms through bugs found in out-of-scope assets. Ethical hackers wouldn’t get rewarded for such findings, but criminals exploited them and stole $1.5 billion from Bybit.” Hachem pointed out that Bybit’s official bug bounty program offers a maximum reward of $4,000 on its website and up to $10,000 on the HackerOne platform. These amounts are negligible compared to the multi-million-dollar sums that malicious hackers can potentially steal. The cybersecurity expert argued that offering larger bounties upfront to ethical hackers would be far cheaper and more effective than trying to recover funds after a breach. He criticized the industry’s tendency to offer 10% of stolen funds as white hat rewards post-hack, stating that such reactive measures only embolden malicious actors rather than preventing attacks in the first place. “Motivating top ethical hackers to dedicate their time and attention to testing an exchange by offering higher rewards will greatly improve its security, will be a lot cheaper, and will safeguard its reputation,” Hachem emphasized. While bug bounty programs are crucial, cybersecurity experts also stress the need for stricter security measures to prevent incidents like the Bybit and Infini hacks from recurring. A spokesperson from CertiK said recently that several industry-standard practices must be adopted, including: Air-gapped signing devices to prevent unauthorized transactions. Non-persistent OS environments for transaction approvals to reduce exposure to malware. Enhanced authentication layers for high-value transactions to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, the firm recommended regular red-team exercises and phishing simulations to mitigate social engineering risks, which remain a major attack vector in the crypto space. CertiK’s report provided insights into the specific vulnerabilities that led to the Bybit and Infini hacks: The Bybit exploit was the result of a phishing attack, where multisignature signers were deceived into approving a malicious contract upgrade, effectively allowing attackers to gain access to users’ funds. The Infini hack occurred due to an admin private key leak, which allowed attackers to make unauthorized withdrawals. Both cases show the dangers of blind signing and inadequate transaction verification. CertiK emphasized that stronger authentication protocols, real-time transaction monitoring, and improved user interface security are necessary to prevent such breaches in the future. The Future of Crypto Security As the cryptocurrency sector continues to evolve, exchanges and other platforms must prioritize prevention over reaction. The rise in large-scale hacks demonstrates that weak security practices and insufficient bug bounty incentives are actively being exploited by criminals. Bybit’s record-breaking $1.4 billion hack should serve as a wake-up call to all crypto exchanges and wallet providers. Security must become a top priority, with an emphasis on: Significantly increasing bug bounty rewards to attract the best ethical hackers. Expanding the scope of security programs to cover all possible vulnerabilities. Implementing stronger authentication measures for both internal and user transactions. Conducting regular penetration tests and security audits to identify risks before attackers do. The surge in cryptocurrency-related hacks, culminating in February’s $1.5 billion losses, highlights the urgent need for stronger proactive security measures. Exchanges must rethink their approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that ethical hackers are adequately incentivized to uncover vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by criminals. With cybercriminals continuously adapting their tactics, the crypto industry must stay ahead of the curve. By offering more competitive bug bounty programs, tightening security protocols, and implementing stricter authentication measures, crypto platforms can significantly reduce their risk exposure and safeguard user funds from future attacks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-04 05:30:00

Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s announcement of a US strategic crypto reserve, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, sparked industry debate about its impact and regulatory clarity. Coinbase is also concerned about regulation, and even recently filed a FOIA request seeking details on SEC spending for crypto enforcement actions. Lawmakers Establish Congressional Crypto Caucus The United States House of Representatives will see the formation of a new pro-crypto group, as Congressmen Ritchie Torres and Tom Emmer announced the launch of the Congressional Crypto Caucus . The bipartisan caucus will advocate for digital asset-friendly policies and serve as a voting bloc to rally support for key crypto legislation. Torres confirmed the news through a post on X on March 3, while Emmer’s office shared that the group will play a crucial role in advancing pending legislation, including stablecoin and market structure bills. The formation of this caucus comes as a more action-oriented counterpart to the existing Congressional Blockchain Caucus, which was established in the later years of the Obama administration to boost and encourage understanding of blockchain technology. While that group largely functioned as an educational and discussion platform, the Congressional Crypto Caucus will actively influence policy decisions by mobilizing votes in favor of digital asset regulation. Currently, lawmakers in the House are reviewing a draft bill that is designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the US. The legislation was introduced by Representatives French Hill and Bryan Steil on Feb. 7, adding to the growing momentum for clear rules around digital assets. Representative Maxine Waters also voiced her support for a stablecoin bill that was introduced in 2024. Steil, who chairs the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, indicated that an updated version of the FIT21 bill, a key market structure proposal that was passed in 2024, may be on the horizon. Both Torres and Emmer have been very vocal supporters of the crypto industry. Torres has consistently advocated for balanced regulations that prevent crises like the FTX collapse while also ensuring the US remains a leader in finance and innovation. He previously expressed his support for FIT21 because of its role in consumer protection and industry oversight. Emmer serves as the House Majority Whip and vice chairman of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, and has also been a strong proponent of advancing crypto-friendly policies. He has positioned digital assets as a matter of American leadership, particularly under the current political climate. The emergence of the Congressional Crypto Caucus certainly aligns with the broader pro-crypto shift in Washington. President Donald Trump recently announced that his Working Group on Digital Assets was instructed to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a strategic crypto reserve. Additionally, Trump is set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Idea Gains Traction but Lacks Clarity Donald Trump’s recent announcement of a strategic crypto reserve generated a lot of discussion in the industry, with some experts seeing it as a positive development but also warning that it does not replace the need for clearer regulation. Patrick Young , go-to-market lead at Web3 app Galxe, believes that while the move signals growing government involvement in digital assets, the long-term impact on the market will depend on regulatory clarity rather than state-led accumulation of cryptocurrencies. Trump’s Truth Social post In a March 2 post on Truth Social , Trump revealed that his administration’s digital assets working group was instructed to include XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a US government crypto stockpile. He later stated that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be at the core of this reserve. Trump has been promoting the idea of a US strategic crypto reserve since mid-2024, and his latest statement had an immediate impact on the market. Bitcoin saw a sharp increase, and briefly jumped past $90,000 before stabilizing. Cardano surged by more than 40% in the first 24 hours after the announcement. Despite the market reaction, Young said that the broader industry is more focused on regulatory progress. He pointed out that a friendlier regulatory environment could serve as a more sustainable driver for crypto markets. Trump’s appointments to key regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raised expectations that clearer guidelines will soon be introduced. The SEC already moved forward with applications for US crypto products that previously stalled under the prior administration, which many believe signals a shift in regulatory approach. The commission also stated in February that meme coins are likely not securities, which also clarified a lot of questions that the industry had. Trump’s decision to include altcoins like XRP and Cardano in the reserve raised some concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Some industry figures suggested that the president could be leveraging the move to increase his own crypto wealth, given his connections to entities that hold various digital assets. Others pointed to the centralization risks that are associated with a government-controlled reserve of decentralized assets. Adam O’Brien , CEO of Bitcoin Well, questioned the rationale behind centralizing cryptocurrencies in a government reserve, and argued that if centralized assets were the goal, traditional blue-chip stocks would be a more logical choice. He also warned that such a move could set a precedent that shifts focus away from the fundamental decentralization principles of blockchain technology. While the creation of a strategic crypto reserve has been received as a step toward legitimizing digital assets at the federal level, many in the industry believe that long-term stability will ultimately depend on regulatory frameworks. Coinbase Seeks SEC Spending Details on Crypto Lawsuits Some in the crypto industry are still holding on to the damage that was caused by the previous administration. In fact, Coinbase filed a Freedom of Information Act request looking for details on how much the SEC spent on enforcement actions against crypto firms. Paul Grewal, the exchange’s chief legal officer, announced the move on March 3, and stated that the request covers investigations and enforcement actions from April 17 of 2021, to Jan. 20 of 2025. Coinbase is looking for information on the number of employees that were involved, third-party contractors used, and the overall cost of these regulatory efforts. Grewal criticized the SEC’s previous regulation-by-enforcement approach, and argued that it costs the US innovation, leadership, and jobs. He also questioned the budget and operational costs of the SEC’s now-defunct Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, which was replaced by the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit on Feb. 20 this year. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is very well known for his strict stance on crypto, resigned on Jan. 20 , 2025, the same day Donald Trump began his second presidential term. Under Gensler’s leadership since 2021, the SEC pursued more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms. After his departure, the agency completely reversed course by dropping multiple lawsuits, including cases against Kraken , Gemini , and Yuga Labs.

The protocol processed $4.66 billion in swaps in the week ended March 2, the highest tally on record, according to data source DefiLlama . The tally exceeded the $1 billion mark on Sunday alone. The surge in activity follows the hack of the crypto exchange Bybit on Feb. 22, which saw the North Korean malicious entity walk away with $1.4 billion in ether. Per observers, the entity used THORChain to swap and launder funds, resulting in a record activity on the platform. ""Starting from the initial Bybit Exploiter wallet, funds were sent across a further stretching net of wallets. With each 'hop' further from the main wallet, there was an increasing amount of intermediary wallets and the value transfers became smaller and smaller,"" blockchain analytics firm Nansen said in a report shared with CoinDesk. ""From hop 2, the hacker started interacting with third-party entities to start swapping and laundering the funds. Entities with the most inflow volume from the hack include THORChain, Paraswap, Mantle, OK DEX and DODO,"" Nansen added. CoinDesk reached out to THORChain for a comment on the matter. Per onchain analyst EmberCN, hackers have laundered the entire ETH balance in ten days, generating record revenue for THORChain. ""Hackers have laundered all 499,000 ETH ($1.39 billion) stolen from Bybit, a process that took 10 days. The ETH price has fallen by 23% in the process (from $2,780 to $2,130 today).

The markets toppled then but bounced back heavily, attracting over $300 billion in liquidity after validating a crypto strategic reserve. In the times when the markets were hoping that these tariffs could get delayed, Trump confirmed that the tariffs would begin on March 4, 2025. With this, the traditional markets plunged, driving the crypto markets back under a strong bearish influence. Bitcoin price and Ethereum price faced a huge pullback as they dropped below their respective psychological barriers at $84,000 & $2100, respectively. Therefore, this suggests that the excitement of the most-awaited announcement of a strategic reserve was very short-lived. Besides, the impact over the crypto markets quickly nullified with the probability of the start of a fresh tariff war. This suggests the market participants do not appear to be confident over the next price action as they continue to remain in fear. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve? Ever since the President announced the creation of a strategic reserve, the demand for only a ‘Bitcoin strategic reserve’ has emerged. Many criticize the inclusion of XRP, SOL, ADA, or other altcoins and push for only a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Besdies, more clarity is yet to be given after the announcement, while the formation is expected to consume more time than expected as it has to be tabled and approved in the parliament. Meanwhile, after a year of the first BTC ETF approval, the round of the first strategic reserve could have a similar impact. As rightly pointed out by a popular analyst, Crypto Rover , the BTC price has experienced a smooth upswing ahead of the expectation of the strategic reserve, and hence the impact of the news is yet to happen as it occurred after the approval of the ETFs. Therefore, the crypto markets are heading towards a very crucial phase, and hence, it would be more interesting to watch what new updates will unfold in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 05:48:27

The firm unstaked and distributed 3.03 million SOL (roughly $431.4 million) to 37 wallets just three hours ago. The company has followed a pattern of similar monthly activity over the past year by redeeming and transferring millions of SOL tokens regularly. The tokens move at regular intervals, mainly around the 12th to the 15th of each month, with amounts approaching 170,000 SOL. Spot On Chain noted that FTX/Alameda’s latest move was the largest unstake since November 2023. The firm also believes that FTX/Alameda’s latest unstaked Solana was likely part of the 11.2M SOL (nearly $2.06B) set to be unlocked in early March. FTX/Alameda Research’s SOL unstaking history. Source: Spot On Chain on X The analytic firm highlighted that FTX/Alameda had unstaked and unloaded 7.83M SOL since November 2023. The firm has now unstaked about $986M SOL to Coinbase and Binance at an average price of $125.8. In the wake of FTX’s unstaking activities, Solana has experienced a slight drop in prices since yesterday. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL has seen a 19.54% drop in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at $135.69 at the time of publication. FTX commences its creditor repayment process FTX’s latest unstaking followed its recent decision to commence its creditor repayment process this month, with an initial distribution of $1.2 billion to smaller claim holders. FTX’s creditor repayment process began officially on February 18 at 3 AM UTC. The repayment of $16 billion will begin with $6.5B to $7B in the first phase. The first batch of repayments will also target creditors with claims under $50,000, totaling approximately $1.2 billion. “It’s estimated that $6-7 Billion are going back into the hands of crypto investors. If a good fraction of that re-enters the market it could provide a boost to liquidity in the near future. – Miles Deutscher , Crypto analyst. Louis Origny, co-founder of FTXcreditor.com, told crypto influencer and journalist Tiffany Tong that account holders with claims over $50,000 may receive 175% of their original claim. He did not provide an official date for the distribution of funds to creditors with larger claims exceeding $50,000. The firm’s executive did reveal that the process is expected to begin in Q2 2025, with an estimated $16 billion to be disbursed in stages. He also highlighted that 50% of the repayment amount will be withheld to cover disputed claims. FTX revealed its reorganization plan that became effective on January 3, which outlined that all creditor repayments should be processed within 60 days of the effective date. Part of the plan tasked crypto custodian BitGo with handling the distribution of funds to creditors. The firm decided to base the payouts on crypto prices from November 2022, when FTX collapsed. Solana has also increased by over 700% since the company declared its bankruptcy, surging from about $22 to price levels slightly above $180. Ethereum holders with Ethereum in FTX will get a full $2500, the same price in 2022. FTX liquidated 41 million SOL in three auctions as part of its bankruptcy proceedings to refund its customers. Galaxy Digital was the largest buyer, acquiring nearly 25.52 million SOL at a price of $64 per token. At current SOL prices, Galaxy’s return rate stood at 187% since Solana’s price rose since the exchange went bankrupt. Pantera was the second-largest buyer, followed by a consortium of buyers who secured 13.67 million SOL at $95 per token. The purchase resulted in a 93% return rate, with other buyers managing to acquire 1.8 million SOL at $102 at 80% profit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

However, despite this bullish outlook, many ADA whales have already shifted their capital toward Rollblock’s presale – a promising GameFi altcoin gaining rapid traction. Rollblock is transforming the $450 billion gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology to eliminate fraud and scams. With over 7,000 games deployed on-chain, the platform has drawn significant investor interest. More than 50,000 investors have contributed nearly $11 million, making Rollblock one of the most promising presale altcoins of 2025. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Breaks the $1 Resistance Level Cardano has surged by 5.20% in the past month and 33% in the last week, and it’s now trading just below $1, with a $34 billion market cap. According to TradingView , its Average Directional Index has dropped below 46.8, signaling a strong uptrend that may persist unless a sell off ensues. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Santiment data shows that whale addresses holding 1 million to 10 million ADA has grown from 2,454 on February 21 to 2,789. This suggests large investors are onboarding ADA, which could trigger further highs for smaller holders. However, Crypto creator Satoshi Talks believes that ADA could test key support at $0.90 if the downtrend resturns. A break below may push it to $0.32, a level not seen since November 2024. However, if $90.0 holds, ADA could attempt a rebound, with resistance at $1,and $1.11. A breakout above these levels may help Cardano flip $1 resistance to support for the first time since late January. Grayscale has also added Cardano to its Smart Contract Fund, making ADA the fund’s third-largest asset at 18.23%. This move indicates confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential, even as its current price action remains volatile. Rollblock Hits $0.06 As 50,000+ Players Enter the Ecosystem Rollblock’s presale has been a massive success, with RBLK surging 500% across ten presale rounds. Now priced at $0.06, the token has attracted over 50,000 investors and raised nearly $11 million, making it one of the most successful GameFi projects of 2025. This growth isn’t just speculation – Rollblock’s innovative gaming ecosystem is driving real adoption backed by tried and tested utility. The platform hosts over 7,000 AI-powered games directly on-chain, ensuring full transparency and eliminating any possibility of fraud. Every outcome is immutably recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, guaranteeing fair play and further boosting investor confidence through superior security standards. Rollblock holds a full e-gaming license from the Anjouan Gaming Authority and has passed a SolidProof audit, verifying its smart contract integrity and solidifying the project’s compliance with the latest regulatory requirements. At the heart of this ecosystem is RBLK, a deflationary utility token with a fixed supply of 1 billion. Unlike inflationary altcoins like Cardano, Rollblock actively reduces the tokens in circulation, increasing scarcity and value over time. Its revenue-sharing model reinforces long-term growth. Up to 30% of platform revenue is used to buy back RBLK, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned and 40% distributed as staking rewards. This ensures constant demand, rewarding early investors while strengthening Rollblock’s ecosystem. Rollblock’s robust gaming ecosystem and deflationary tokenomics have caught the attention of many crypto experts and commentators. Here’s why Freddie Finance believes that this up-and-coming crypto gaming powerhouse could take everyone by surprise in 2025. This Crypto Presale Has INSANE Potential ($6M Already Raised?!) ROLLBLOCK Review Can Rollblock Outperform Cardano in 2025? Rollblock’s presale has skyrocketed 500%, hitting $0.06, with investors and players predicting a 100x surge toward $1.

With market sentiment shifting fast, attention also turns to Panshibi (SHIBI) , a panda-themed newcomer gaining traction in its presale at $0.005. While Cardano’s rapid climb underscores growing confidence in established altcoins, the latest Cardano Price Prediction further amplifies the buzz, and Panshibi’s meme coin appeal backed by locked liquidity and a robust design, offers a fresh angle for traders seeking high-upside meme tokens. Cardano’s Rally and Trump’s Crypto Reserve Observers point to a powerful catalyst in President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that Cardano would be part of a U.S. “Crypto Reserve.” Fueling the altcoin’s rally, Cardano climbed an impressive 60% after weeks in a stubborn downtrend. Now trading around $0.972 , the coin has pushed back above critical resistance at $1.00, an encouraging sign after languishing below that level. Market data reveals that this boost in buyer interest coincided with an uptick in the MVRV Long/Short Difference metric, signaling that long-term holders remain confident. Although the president pegged a lofty sum for the entire reserve package, skeptics caution that official numbers remain sparse. Regardless, the psychological effect of including Cardano in a high-profile initiative has contributed to bullish sentiment. Technical analysts warn that for ADA to maintain its upward path, $1.00 must be reliable support . A break below that threshold could drag the coin toward $0.85 or even lower, unraveling the recent gains. Nonetheless, traders remain watchful, as Cardano’s “living governance” structure and DeFi expansions underscore the network’s ambition. Panshibi (SHIBI): A meme coin Token with Locked Liquidity Amid the excitement over Cardano Price Prediction angles, a new meme coin stands out: Panshibi (SHIBI) . Priced at $0.005, the presale has already raised more than $1.2 million. Panshibi merges meme coin branding with robust tokenomics, locking liquidity for ten years and the team tokens for two. An AI-based “social-fi” model encourages staking and quest-based activities, seeking to sustain engagement well beyond its initial launch. Such a structured approach addresses the volatility typical of meme coins, reassuring those who fear sudden dumps. By building meme coin flair on top of a stable foundation, Panshibi catches the eye of risk-oriented traders looking for potential quick gains. A new meme coin token can sometimes thrive alongside more established altcoins, especially if market attention drifts from older memes or if bullish cycles return. While no meme coin asset is guaranteed success, the token’s mix of humor, locked liquidity, and interactive community fosters expectations of an upward climb possibly rivaling the big leaps of other early-stage meme coins. Conclusion As the crypto sphere buzzes over Cardano Price Prediction , talk of $1.20 or higher, the arrival of Panshibi (SHIBI) signals that meme coin tokens can still grab the spotlight if they blend novelty with security. Cardano’s bounce above $1.00 demonstrates that strong catalysts, like a U.S. Crypto Reserve mentioned, can quickly shape sentiment. Meanwhile, Panshibi’s presale success suggests that some traders prefer a meme coin’s thrill (and potential upside) that attempts to avoid typical pitfalls. Whether both can thrive simultaneously remains an open question, but their contrasting appeals highlight the vast opportunities and risks that define the crypto market.

Ripple (XRP) also experienced a strong surge after the announcement, but investors are still debating whether it can continue the explosive growth after substantial moves in recent months. Meanwhile, after gaining over 800% amid a turbulent market, many DOGE and XRP holders are reinvesting in DTX Exchange (DTX), a hybrid project that aims to transform the trading sector. In the bonus (final) round, the DTX presale is seeing overwhelming demand. Due to a $0.36 projected listing price, a 2x surge from now, it has emerged as the new safe haven for investors seeking a promising investment. Expert investors believe that the DTX Exchange could surpass XRP and Dogecoin prices before mid-2025. Dogecoin Price Reclaims $0.22, New Highs Soon? After 42 days of continuous downtrend, the Dogecoin price formed a pivot candle, surging above the $0.22 support. Last Friday, DOGE plunged to a low of $0.181, the lowest price seen since 7 November 2024. On late Sunday, the Dogecoin price surged over 15%, reaching a high of $0.24. This minor recovery offers hope to holders, but the meme coin remains under heavy pressure, as monthly stats show a loss of 30%. Courtesy: TradingView Commenting on the Dogecoin price prediction, renowned crypto analyst, Ali Martinez said that if it holds above the key support, an uptrending move could occur. Currently, the key level for Dogecoin price is the support range of $0.20 and $0.22. If DOGE manages to surge above the $0.28 resistance, then an uptrend could be confirmed. Can Ripple (XRP) Inclusion in Crypto Reserve Solve Regulatory Challenges? President Trump recently disclosed that the US cryptocurrency strategic reserve will have Ripple (XRP) and several other main digital assets. This information has resulted in the rise in value of the XRP, which rose by more than 36% in one go, reaching above $3.02. Ripple is facing SEC in court and aims to win the case, which could be one of the factors influencing its long-term upward trend. James Murphy, an attorney, expressed his opinion about why the SEC did not drop the suit against Ripple right away. He is a prominent figure in the field of financial services law and often shares his views on cryptocurrency-related legal disputes, particularly the Ripple vs. SEC one. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of uncertainty that drives XRP investors to hedge the risk and seek new industry leaders like DTX Exchange. DTX Presale Soars Past $15.50 Million: Easy 2X Opportunity While turbulent market conditions have affected Ripple and Dogecoin, DTX Exchange’s presale performance has been nothing short of remarkable. Due to the increasing demand, the bonus round is selling out rapidly, and the total raised has crossed $15.50 million. This incredible success demonstrates strong market validation for its innovation of a hybrid trading model, which combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. DTX Exchange’s hybrid protocol allows traders to access more than 120,000 financial assets, including stocks, crypto, ETFs, forex, and bonds. This approach eliminates the necessity of multiple platforms and also saves users from various charges, such as AMC. Experts consider the DTX token’s current valuation of $0.18 to be highly undervalued because, upon listing at $0.36, it will provide early investors with a 200% profit before it even hits major exchanges. Key Takeaways Ripple investors remain cautious due to regulatory hurdles, and the Dogecoin price is still struggling from sentiment shifts, while DTX Exchange has created a stir with its advanced platform being hailed as a one-stop solution for traders. Investors looking for a solid investment contender will most probably find that DTX offers a much superior upside compared to other cryptos.

33767162,[object Object],1741068018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Sleeping Giants Awaken: Old Whales Resurface Amid Price Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-giants-awaken-old-whales-price-surge/,"On-chain data shows the dormant Bitcoin whales have come back alive to make moves following the latest price surge in the cryptocurrency. Old Bitcoin Whales Have Just Made Several Transactions As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, there have been several transfers involving old tokens of the cryptocurrency during the past day. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “ Spent Output Age Bands ,” which tracks the transaction activity of the various Bitcoin ‘age bands.’ An age band defines a time-range inside which the coins contained by it were last moved on the network. The 6 months to 12 months band, for example, includes the tokens that were last involved in a transaction between six and twelve months ago. If the owners of these coins include them in a move, the Spent Output Age Bands would spike for the band. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the latest trend in the indicator for the 7 years to 10 years and 10+ years age bands: As is visible in the above graph, the Spent Output Age Bands has registered a few spikes from each of these age bands in the last 24 hours. This means that coins that were previously dormant for at least seven years have just been brought out of the freezer. Given that the transactions followed the cryptocurrency’s recovery back above $90,000, it’s possible that these old whales made them to take profits. If so, it could be a bearish sign for the asset, considering how long these coins were dormant for. Something to note, though, is the fact that when tokens get older than seven years, they become more likely to have reached their age by being lost, rather than by being HODLed . Coins are said to be ‘lost’ when the keys associated with the wallet holding them become misplaced. Thus, it’s possible that the investors who have made these transactions in the past day only recently rediscovered the keys attached to the addresses. If they were truly HODLing by their own volition thus far, though, them deciding to sell now would suggest these diamond hands don’t believe Bitcoin would get much higher. A cohort that’s more likely to contain willful HODLers is the 5 years to 7 years one and it turns out coins falling in this age band have also seen significant movement in the last 24 hours. BTC Price It would seem that the decision to sell from the dormant whales may not have been such a bad one as Bitcoin has already erased most of its gains from the rally, with its price falling back to $87,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Dormant Whales|Bitcoin Old Whales|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Price Surge|Bitcoin Rally|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-04 06:00:18

The SEC’s decision means no penalties, no changes to Kraken’s business operations, and no admission of wrongdoing. The SEC has closed probes into major companies like OpenSea, Gemini, and Robinhood but continues to investigate others, including Ripple. A Major Legal Victory for Kraken The SEC filed a lawsuit in November 2023, accusing Kraken of mishandling customer funds and operating as an unregistered securities broker. Instead of settling, Kraken chose to fight the charges. A federal judge initially ruled that the SEC had a plausible case, which led to the case heading to trial. However, the SEC has now decided to drop the charges after reaching an agreement with Kraken. Pending approval from the SEC’s Commissioners, the case will be officially closed. “This dismissal lifts that cloud of uncertainty. It reaffirms that businesses like Kraken, which prioritize compliance and consumer protection, should not be subject to arbitrary legal battles,” the company stated. A Turning Point for Crypto in the U.S. Kraken celebrated the SEC’s decision, calling it more than just a legal victory. The company described the move as a turning point for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. The SEC’s decision, Kraken stated, puts an end to what they called a politically motivated campaign, lifting the uncertainty that has hindered innovation and investment in the industry. SEC’s Changing Approach to Crypto Enforcement Kraken’s win comes as the SEC, under new leadership, shifts away from the aggressive enforcement tactics that characterized the tenure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The new leadership has expressed a commitment to developing clear and fair regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, rather than relying on “regulation by enforcement.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 06:09:06

While the announcement initially triggered a jump in crypto trading, markets cooled on Monday as concerns about the implications of the plan surfaced. Trump announced plans on Sunday to establish a government-backed reserve that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano, claiming the move would help the United States become the “Crypto Capital of the World.” But the initiative has drawn criticism, particularly over the inclusion of multiple cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and whether such government intervention contradicts traditional free market principles. Related News: There Will Be Intense Cryptocurrency Spotlight In The US Senate This Week - Here Are The Details Of The Development Expected To Be Positive Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the richest man in American crypto with a net worth of $9.6 billion, expressed his skepticism on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that the reserve should focus solely on Bitcoin, which he called a “successor to gold” for the U.S. government. Billionaire investor Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of AI-focused defense firm Palantir and a staunch Trump supporter, was even more critical. Responding to Trump’s post, Lonsdale condemned the plan, arguing that “it is wrong for crypto brokerage firms to tax themselves” and that government intervention in crypto markets is “not the proper, principled role of government.” Notably, even those connected to Trump’s crypto chief David Sacks have voiced their disapproval of the plan. Jason Calacanis, Sacks’ co-host on the influential “All-In” podcast, called the move an example of “Trump Pump” and “a crazy scam.” Meanwhile, Jeff Park, a strategist at Bitwise, a crypto index fund manager in which Sacks’ venture capital firm was an early investor, called Trump’s decision to include multiple cryptocurrencies “a huge political miscalculation.” *This is not investment advice.

Retail and institutional players reacted differently at several stages of the dip, with the latter making market-swinging sales. United States foreign policies also affected the market despite being tipped to spur market growth during Donald Trump’s second term. Bitcoin Whale Dump Large Holdings In the last 30 days, Bitcoin whales have transferred 60,000 BTC to exchanges, heightening sell pressure. This follows shaky weeks in U.S. tech stocks, sparking bear sentiments in crypto assets. Bitcoin price sank below $100K after the launch of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and has struggled to find its previous momentum. As confidence plummeted further with Trump’s new tariffs, whales began moving assets to prevent losses gained in previous months. Last year, institutional inflow and whale accumulations spiked the asset’s price above $100k with an expected run to $150K this year. These recent outflows have slowed mainstream adoption, lowering sentiments as seen in a drop in the fear and greed index. The mark reaction shows fear as multiple assets dipped below previous support levels. Bitcoin whales dominate the market, and huge sales for large groups result in a plunge in the fear and greed index. Centralized exchange and whale balances are closely monitored to determine the next market direction. Despite these bear factors, investors bought the dip looking for good entry positions ahead of a rebound. Crypto trader Ali Martinez pointed out that the wider market recorded $6 billion in capital inflows as holders set sights on recovery. Rebound Hinged On Spot Bitcoin ETFs The nosedive affected Bitcoin, altcoins, meme tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers. Declined volumes negatively impacted the market leading to a crash in crypto prices. The wider market capitalization dropped from $3.5 trillion to $3.1 trillion, wiping out billions. Bitcoin price trades at $97,746, down 4% in the last seven days while altcoins recorded higher exits. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs which have attracted over $40 billion, dominating the financial markets are a lifeline to BTC price. Institutional appetite is growing as on-chain metrics point upwards despite the status quo. Firms like Standard Chartered made higher projections expecting a massive run before the end of Trump’s second term.

According to a Mar. 4 post on X by on-chain analyst EmberCN, who has been tracking the stolen funds, much of the Ethereum ( ETH ) was funneled through THORChain ( RUNE ), a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol, and converted into Bitcoin ( BTC ). 黑客已经把从 Bybit 盗取的 49.9 万枚 ETH ($13.9 亿) 全部清洗完了，整个过程历时 10 天。 ETH 价格在这个过程中下跌了 23% (从 $2,780 跌到现在的 $2,130)。 而黑客洗钱使用的主要通道 THORChain 也因黑客洗钱获得了 $59 亿的交易量跟 $550 万的手续费收入。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/osoKNzFhkG pic.twitter.com/QUWuMmV6zH — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 4, 2025 THORChain has handled $605 million in transactions in the last 24 hours alone. The platform has received criticism for its involvement in facilitating illegal transactions, after recording $5.9 billion in volume and collecting $5.5 million in fees during the laundering process. One critic on X referred to THORChain’s response as “negligence at best, greed at worst.” While other protocols acted accordingly to stop the movement of stolen funds, THORChain validators did not take any meaningful action. Pluto, a core contributor, resigned in protest after a governance proposal to halt ETH transactions was rejected.

This and… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) March 4, 2025 According to Zhou, 83% of the laundered funds were converted into Bitcoin, distributed across 6,954 wallets, with 72% ($900 million) of these funds passing through THORChain. Moreover, after being transferred through ExCH, 16% of the assets became untraceable, and the OKX Web3 Proxy processed another 8% ($100 million). Bybit has since launched Lazarusbounty.com, a fund-tracking website, and it is providing bounties to exchanges that help recover the stolen assets. So far, $2.17 million in rewards have been paid to 11 bounty hunters, with Mantle, Paraswap, and ZachXBT among the top contributors.

The sharp reversal aligned with a cautious mood among traders after Monday’s market rally following the ambitious plan, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted. Trump’s Sunday declaration that the reserve would include ADA, XRP and SOL, alongside bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) ignited a market frenzy, with ADA soaring over 60%, XRP climbing 33%, and SOL jumping 22% within hours. The promise of a government-backed crypto stockpile was hailed as a game-changer, with analysts predicting it could legitimize digital assets and drive institutional adoption. However, the rally proved short-lived amid profit-taking and a general risk-off mood in broader equity markets. “Trump's latest tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico, and China caused a massive selloff of crypto assets, completely reversing the previous day's crypto strategic reserve gains,” Kevin Guo, director of HashKey Research, said in a Telegram message. “Despite a slew of pro-crypto deregulation initiatives and supportive policies, investors view cryptocurrencies as risk assets strongly bound by the performance of the US equity market.” On Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff on the import of various items after Trump, doubled the tariff on imports from China to 20%. The U.S. President also confirmed that 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would be effective on Tuesday. Bitcoin is down 9% in the past 24 hours amid the macroeconomic chaos, trading at $84,000 as of Asian afternoon hours. Ether lost 12% and trades just above $2,000 — its lowest since 2023.

Regulatory Case Ends Without Penalties The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Kraken with prejudice, preventing the regulator from refiling the case in the future. The crypto exchange confirmed the development, stating that the case was dropped without any admission of wrongdoing, penalties, or required changes to its business operations. Kraken framed the SEC’s decision as a pivotal moment for the crypto industry in the United States, suggesting it signals the end of a politically driven crackdown that has hampered innovation and investment. The exchange expressed optimism about a more stable regulatory landscape moving forward. The announcement from Kraken added, “The SEC’s decision to dismiss its lawsuit against us (and many others) is more than just a legal victory—it’s a turning point for the future of crypto in the US. It ends a wasteful, politically motivated campaign, lifts uncertainty that stifled innovation and investment, and clears the path toward a stable, forward-thinking regulatory regime. Legal Battle and Regulatory Uncertainty The SEC initially sued Kraken in November 2023, accusing the platform of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency. The regulator alleged that Kraken facilitated the trading of crypto asset securities without proper registration, depriving investors of key protections such as audits, disclosures, and oversight. Kraken denied the allegations and countered that the SEC had not provided clear guidelines on whether digital assets should be classified as securities. The exchange filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing regulatory uncertainty and a lack of fair notice. While a federal judge allowed certain aspects of Kraken’s defense to proceed, the SEC continued to pursue its claims until now. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation Kraken acknowledged the role of the new leadership at the SEC and the White House in influencing the decision, suggesting a shift in regulatory priorities. The company credited what it described as “bold and thoughtful” leadership for fostering a new era of crypto innovation. Senior Advisor Marco Santori celebrated the outcome, stating, “We beat the SEC! Congratulations to the best legal team in crypto. Fighting—and beating—the SEC was not foretold. Lawyers, lobbyists, and everyone in between… We had to earn it.” SEC Cases Dropping like Flies The dismissal follows a series of dropped crypto-related enforcement actions by the SEC under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. The regulator recently abandoned cases against Gemini, Consensys, Robinhood, and Uniswap, while also agreeing to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice. With the SEC scaling back its aggressive stance against crypto firms, industry participants are hopeful that future regulatory efforts will provide clearer guidelines rather than rely on enforcement-driven approaches.

Mintoak, an Indian ecommerce startup that facilitates merchant payments, has acquired Digiledge in a deal worth around $3.5 million, marking the first acquisition in India’s CBDC area, Reuters, has learned , citing sources close to the matter. With Digiledge, which specializes in CBDC and bill payments, Mintoak’s partner banks — HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI — could offer payment solutions in e-rupee, India’s form of CBDC.

Initially, only banks could use it, but the scope expanded to payment firms in April 2023. The e-rupee adoption has been sluggish, with the RBI reporting 1 million retail transactions by late June 2024, a milestone reached only after local banks introduced incentives and partially paid employee salaries using the state-issued digital currency. The RBI had previously urged banks to increase transactions to at least 1 million per day by late 2023 to test the system’s scalability. However, this push has since ceased, casting doubt on the future of the digital currency initiative due to the gap between incentivized metrics and actual user adoption.

In the last seven days, the Hedera price has experienced a surge of 17.5%. In the last hour alone, the market has grown by around 0.5%. Let’s analyse the scenario deeper. Nasdaq Files for Grayscale’s Hedera ETF It was on Monday that the Nasdaq filed the form with the US SEC to list and trade the spot HBAR ETF of Grayscale. For an ETF to be traded on a major stock exchange, the exchange needs SEC approval.

As soon as the SEC acknowledges the filing, the regulator beings the approval process. For this reason, the filing is a crucial step in the process. HBAR’s Strong ETF Approval Chances It was not the first time that the Nasdaq approached the SEC to seek its approval to list and trade a spot Hedera ETF. Earlier, a 19b-4 form was submitted to the US SEC for the spot HBAR ETF of Canary Capital. Importantly, renowned ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently predicted that Hedera and Litecoin ETFs have the best chance of winning the approval of the SEC compared to other Altcoin ETFs. Hedera: Everything One Should Know Simply put, Hedera is a public network where anyone can build and use applications. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses a technology called “hashgraph.” This technology is designed to be faster, more secure, and more efficient than many blockchain systems. According to Jonathan Dotan , the founder of EQTYLAB, “Hedera’s enterprise-grade infrastructure, backed by a Council of global leaders like Dell Technologies, sets it apart from other blockchains by providing the scalability and security essential for bringing Verifiable Compute to market. Its visionary leadership team has long shaped the network to meet real-world business needs, positioning it as a trusted platform for enterprise adoption.” HBAR Price Reaction In the last 30 days, the Hedera market has seen a drop of 18.7%. However, in the last seven days, it has experienced a rise of 17.5%. In the last one hour alone, the market has surged by over 0.5%. The total market cap of HBAR is $9,543,646,221.

ETH prices crashed to their lowest levels in 16 months, plunging 15% to $2,035 during early trading in Asia on Tuesday morning. The last time ETH traded below $2,000 was in November 2023, as the asset was slowly thawing from crypto winter. Ethereum has now returned to bear market levels and has dumped 50% since it tapped $4,000 in early December 2024. ETH Death Predicted Analyst ‘Nebraskangooner’ looked at the monthly timeframe chart and identified a double-top formation before predicting that prices would break down to the $1,200 level. This would send ETH back to bear market lows from late 2022 when it bottomed out at around $1,100. $ETH Monthly double top confirmed.

Ethereum may genuinely be one of the worst charts I have ever seen. pic.twitter.com/4nOWi0ZuyH — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) March 3, 2025 The ‘Anonymous Crypto Predictions’ feed said that ETH needed to close above the 200-week moving average as it did last week. This long-term trend indicator is currently around the $2,500 level, and ETH is well below that. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio, or price of ether in terms of bitcoin, fell to a five-year low of 0.024 this week as the asset tanked. #Ethereum – The key level to watch is the 200 weekly (black line). We need to close back above that like we did last week. Expect lots of manipulation and volatility. pic.twitter.com/aIskRebYqV — Anonymous | Crypto Predictions (@Crypto_Twittier) March 4, 2025 Flight to Risk-Off Many were questioning why crypto was crashing in such a bullish environment in the United States following years of being persecuted under the Biden administration. The Kobeissi Letter explained that the real driver here is the global move towards the risk-off trade and assets. “As trade war tensions rise and economic policy uncertainty broadens, ALL risky assets are falling. This was seen in stocks, crypto and oil prices, which all fell sharply today.” Moreover, Bitcoin is no longer seen as a store of value, having decoupled from gold, which hit an all-time high in late February. When Bitcoin falls, the digital lemmings follow, and Ethereum has been the first off the cliff. What is happening with crypto? Crypto markets are now worth -$100 billion LESS than they were prior to the US Crypto Reserve announcement. Over the last 24 hours, crypto has erased -$500 BILLION of market cap in a massive reversal. Here’s what you need to know.

It currently appears strong, but the next direction remains unknown while bearish. As expected, Bitcoin’s price collapsed last week following a strong breakthrough at the crucial $90k level, which has been standing as support for more than three months. It tested $78.2k with a long wick and closed that week’s price well above the lost crucial support. The collapse started after losing grip above the $95k level, but the price interestingly retested that level during yesterday’s surge – completing a break and retest pattern. The level was rejected, and the price dropped to around $93.6k at the time of writing. Retaking the rejected high with a surge could fuel more buying towards the $100k mark. This could signal a trend shift on the daily chart. But looking at the market, there’s no conviction for a shift yet following the latest price rejection. Of course, Bitcoin’s downtrend is still in play on the daily chart, but things are likely to change if the price stays well above the recent low. Otherwise, it may experience more dips in the coming days. Currently, it is gaining traction on the day. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Marking the $95k level as resistance since last weekend, a push above it should advance recovery to $99,550. The $103,278 level is the next resistance to watch, followed by the $109,588 resistance. Towards the downside, the $91k level is providing support along with $85k and $80k. If the price collapses through these levels to reclaim last week’s $78,258 low, the next drop may surface at $71k. Key Resistance Levels: $99,550, $103,278, $109,588 Key Support Levels: $91,000, $85,000, $80,000 Spot Price: $93,615 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It has seen a major recovery following a bounce back but is now losing steam. Ethereum has continued to mirror Bitcoin’s weekly movement but has failed to break below its critical $2,100 level, which has been providing support for the past four months. Respecting this critical level again, it bounced and recovered nicely to where it’s changing hands at around $2,378. The $2,550 level has posted a threat to the buyers in the past hours and is now holding it as resistance. A surge above it could trigger more increases in the coming days. Although it has formed a double-top pattern on the weekly chart, the price may crash soon. The potential target level for such a crash is $1,650. As soon as the price touches this level, a major bounceback is expected. The only condition for a bullish move right now is holding the critical support level. If it continues to strengthen, we may see a strong rally above the important $3k level before considering a reversal. While the trend is still in favour of the bears, they appear set for another rally. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential support levels for selling right now are $2,310 and $2,076. If the price breaks lower, $1,900 and $1,700 are the next support levels to consider for a test. In case of a reversal, ETH must retake a lot of resistance on the way up. For now, the close resistance level to watch for a test is $2,550 and $2,700. Higher resistance levels to keep in mind are $2,920 and $3,213.

China introduced tariffs on US goods and other trade measures on Tuesday in response to US President Donald Trump’s move to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.34% to close at 37,331, while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.71% to 2,710 on Tuesday, erasing gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 149 per dollar on Tuesday, approaching a five-month-high. Japan’s unemployment rate was at 2.5% in January 2025, slightly above market estimates and December's readings of 2.4%. Japanese companies reduced capital spending on plant and equipment by 0.2% year-on-year in Q4 of 2024, missing market expectations of a 4.9% increase and swinging from the strongest growth in three quarters of 8.1% in Q3. The consumer confidence index in Japan unexpectedly declined to 35.0 in February 2025, down from 35.2 in the previous month, below market expectations of 35.7. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.25% closing at 3,324, while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.28% to 10,679 on Tuesday, recovering earlier losses as investors assessed the impact of new tariffs , and the offshore yuan strengthened around 7.28 per dollar. The Trump administration's additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods took effect today, raising total US tariffs on China to 20%. In response, Beijing immediately announced new tariffs of 10%-15% on certain US imports, set to take effect on March 10, and imposed export restrictions on US firms. This new tariffs coincide with the start of a key annual political meeting in China this week. The country is anticipated to roll out fresh stimulus measures to help its economy withstand the impact of the increased tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.44% to 22,631 in the Tuesday morning session, following modest gains in the prior day. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.19% to 72,846 in morning trade on Tuesday, retreating for the third straight session and staying at their lowest level since early June 2024 amid losses in the tech sector, consumer goods, auto, and pharmaceuticals. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.58% to close at 8,189 on Tuesday, nearing its lowest level in two months. The Australian dollar slipped to around $0.62 on Tuesday, nearing a one-month low, after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s February meeting revealed that policymakers were focused on downside risks to the economy, signaling a more dovish stance. Retail sales in Australia increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January 2025, shifting from a 0.1% decline in the previous month and matching market expectations. Australia's current account deficit declined to AUD 12.5 billion in Q4 2024 from a downwardly revised AUD 13.9 billion shortfall in Q3. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended in red prompted by US President Trump’s confirmation that tariffs on key trading partners would take effect today.

Meanwhile, the markets dropped as President Trump confirmed the start of 25% tariffs on Canada & Mexico. While Bitcoin plunged below $84,000 and is struggling to regain the lost momentum, Pi Network is displaying decent strength. The PI price has been trying very hard to keep up the momentum since the early trading hours. What’s next? Will Pi price reclaim $2 this month? Soon after the launch, the PI price spiked high to mark highs close to $3 but failed to surpass the range. Currently, the token has surpassed Hedera and reached the 11th spot of the crypto rankings, which suggests it could be the next big thing in the markets. The price has sustained a notable bullish trend despite the ongoing market crash. Therefore, the price is now believed to reclaim the lost levels and close the quarterly trade on a bullish note. As seen in the above chart, the PI price broke out from the falling wedge in the short term but has yet to validate the upswing. After experiencing massive volatility, the volatility has squeezed as the Bollinger Bands have contracted well. Besides, the stochastic RSI has reached the overbought zone, which suggests that a temporary pullback could be on the horizon. Meanwhile, the local support zone, between $1.6 and $1.62, could offer a strong base, which may trigger a strong rebound to the upper resistance around $1.92. Regardless of the growing strength and potential to surpass the giants, the Pi Network is yet to get listed on Binance. In the times when the newly launched memecoins get listed within minutes, this delay could have a negative impact on the token, instigating a huge whale sell-off.

Dogecoin Price Drops Despite ETF Hype Despite the growing optimism, DOGE has plunged over 15%, dropping to $0.19 amid broader market volatility. The trading volume has also dropped 16.80%, indicating weaker market activity. This decline came after the excitement surrounding Donald Trump’s crypto reserve announcement, which briefly boosted sentiment.

Lately, the chatter has been all about Bitcoin’s resurgence, leaving many wondering about the fate of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal, and it’s time to pay attention. According to CoinMarketCap (CMC), this crucial metric currently sits at a low 16, unchanged from yesterday, as of March 4th, 00:35 UTC. But what exactly does this number mean, and how should it influence your crypto strategy? Let’s dive deep into understanding the nuances of the Altcoin Season Index and what it signals for the current crypto market . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Weather Vane Think of the Altcoin Season Index as a weather vane for the cryptocurrency market. Instead of predicting rain or sunshine, it forecasts whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. This index, meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap , offers a data-driven perspective on market sentiment beyond just price fluctuations. It cuts through the noise and provides a clear, quantifiable measure of market trends. Here’s a breakdown of what makes up the Altcoin Season Index: Scope: It analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure representation of market dynamics. Timeframe: The index evaluates the performance of these cryptocurrencies over the past 90 days, offering a medium-term perspective that smooths out short-term volatility. Benchmark: Bitcoin (BTC) is the benchmark. The index compares the 90-day performance of each of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during the same period. Scoring: The index ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger ‘Altcoin Season’, while a lower score suggests a ‘Bitcoin Season’. To truly grasp its significance, let’s understand the thresholds that define Altcoin and Bitcoin Seasons. Decoding Bitcoin Season: What Does an Index of 16 Really Mean? With the Altcoin Season Index currently at 16, the message is unambiguous: we are in a Bitcoin Season . But what does this practically entail for investors and the broader crypto market ? The index operates on a simple yet powerful principle: Season Index Score Condition Market Characteristic Altcoin Season 75 or higher At least 75% of the top 100 coins outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Altcoins are generally experiencing higher gains than Bitcoin. Capital often flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher percentage returns. Bitcoin Season 25 or lower 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Bitcoin is generally outperforming altcoins. Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven in the crypto space. An index score of 16 firmly places us in Bitcoin Season territory. This means that over the past 90 days, a vast majority (more than 75%) of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have underperformed Bitcoin. Only a small fraction, 25% or less, have managed to outshine the original cryptocurrency. This dominance of Bitcoin has significant implications for the entire crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Strategies and Considerations So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to a Bitcoin Season ? Understanding the dynamics of this market phase is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are some key considerations: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin Season often coincides with increased Bitcoin dominance. This means Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows at a faster rate than the rest of the market, or it declines less during downturns. Keep an eye on Bitcoin dominance charts to gauge the strength of this trend. Altcoin Performance: While it’s called ‘Bitcoin Season’, it doesn’t mean all altcoins will necessarily decline in price. However, their growth may be slower and potentially more volatile compared to Bitcoin. Selectivity is key. Research and focus on fundamentally strong altcoins that can weather the Bitcoin-centric market. Risk Assessment: Bitcoin is generally perceived as less risky than altcoins . During Bitcoin Season, investors often gravitate towards Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven’ within the volatile crypto space. Consider adjusting your portfolio risk profile based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Trading Strategies: Traders might consider strategies that capitalize on Bitcoin’s strength, such as longing Bitcoin or Bitcoin-paired trading. For altcoin enthusiasts, identifying oversold altcoins with strong fundamentals could present buying opportunities, but caution and thorough research are paramount. Long-Term Perspective: Market seasons are cyclical. Bitcoin Season might be followed by an Altcoin Season, and vice versa. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on short-term market trends. Maintain a long-term perspective and focus on the fundamental value of your crypto investments.

The latest Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is flashing red, signaling a significant downturn in market sentiment. For those watching the volatile crypto markets, the shift is palpable. The index, a key metric for gauging investor emotions, has taken a dramatic dive, plunging 18 points to land at a chilling 15. This nosedive propels us from the already cautious “Fear” territory directly into the dreaded “Extreme Fear” zone. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio, and how should you navigate these turbulent times? Let’s delve into the details. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a creation of Alternative.me, is designed to quantify the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a mood ring for crypto investors. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0: Extreme Fear – Signaling a potential buying opportunity, or a sign of further decline? 100: Extreme Greed – Often precedes market corrections, indicating a possible bubble. Currently sitting at 15, the index screams “Extreme Fear.” But what factors contribute to this reading? The index isn’t based on guesswork; it’s a data-driven analysis incorporating six key metrics, each weighted to reflect its influence on market sentiment: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can breed fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume against the 30-day and 90-day averages. Weak momentum and low volume can indicate a lack of investor confidence. Social Media 15% Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. Dominance of negative sentiment fuels fear. Surveys 15% (Currently paused) Previously involved weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during fearful times, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for crypto-related search queries. A spike in searches like “Bitcoin crash” often correlates with market fear. Why is the Crypto Market Sentiment So Fearful Right Now? Several factors could be contributing to the current Extreme Fear in the crypto market . While the provided data doesn’t specify the exact reasons for this sudden 18-point drop, we can consider common drivers of fear in the crypto space: Geopolitical Instability: Global events, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine or rising inflation fears, can trigger widespread market uncertainty and risk aversion, impacting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Concerns about stricter regulations or potential crackdowns on the crypto industry by governments worldwide can induce significant fear among investors. Market Corrections and Liquidations: Significant price drops, like the one seemingly triggering this “Extreme Fear” reading, can lead to cascading liquidations, further amplifying negative sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: Rising interest rates, inflation, and fears of recession in major economies can all contribute to a risk-off environment, pushing investors away from volatile assets like crypto. It’s crucial to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects collective investor emotions, which can be highly reactive and sometimes irrational. However, understanding these emotions can provide valuable insights into potential market movements. Navigating ‘Extreme Fear’: What Should Crypto Investors Do? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes “Extreme Fear,” it’s natural to feel uneasy. However, seasoned crypto investors often view periods of extreme fear as potential opportunities. Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Benefits of ‘Extreme Fear’ Buying Opportunity? : Contrarian investors often see extreme fear as a signal to buy. When fear is rampant, asset prices can be driven down to undervalued levels, presenting potential entry points for long-term investors. The adage “buy when there’s blood in the streets” comes to mind. Market Reset: Extreme fear can purge the market of speculative excesses and unsustainable hype, paving the way for healthier, more sustainable growth in the long run. Challenges and Risks of ‘Extreme Fear’ Further Downturns: Extreme fear can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Panic selling can exacerbate price drops, leading to further declines. It’s impossible to predict the absolute bottom. Emotional Decision Making: Fear can lead to impulsive decisions, such as selling assets at a loss out of panic. It’s crucial to avoid emotionally driven trading. Increased Volatility: Periods of extreme fear are often accompanied by heightened volatility, making it a risky environment for inexperienced traders. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors During ‘Extreme Fear’ Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Is your portfolio positioned to weather potential further downturns? Consider rebalancing if necessary. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t make impulsive decisions based on fear. Instead, double down on your research. Understand the projects you’ve invested in and their long-term potential. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider using dollar-cost averaging to gradually buy into your chosen cryptocurrencies over time. This strategy can mitigate the risk of buying at the absolute peak or trough. Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Keep abreast of market developments, but be wary of fear-mongering headlines and social media hype. Focus on credible news sources and fundamental analysis. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, view periods of extreme fear as temporary setbacks and potential long-term opportunities. Cryptocurrency Analysis : Is ‘Extreme Fear’ a Buying Signal? The million-dollar question: Is this Extreme Fear a screaming buy signal? Historically, periods of extreme fear in the crypto market have often been followed by market rebounds. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Ultimately, whether “Extreme Fear” represents a buying opportunity depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook on the crypto market . It’s a time for caution, careful cryptocurrency analysis , and strategic decision-making, not panic. Conclusion: Navigating the Fearful Crypto Seas The sharp drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to “Extreme Fear” is a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While fear can be unsettling, understanding its drivers and potential implications is crucial for informed decision-making. By staying calm, conducting thorough research, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these fearful times and potentially capitalize on opportunities that may arise. Remember, market sentiment is cyclical; fear eventually gives way to greed, and vice versa. The key is to be prepared and informed, regardless of the prevailing market mood.

However, the momentum appears to have faded, as evidenced by the ongoing retreat in the asset’s price. So, let’s explore the current accumulation trend and see what lies ahead for the crypto. XRP News: Ripple Whales Buy 1 Bln Coin Ripple whales have once again made headlines in the XRP news column with their latest buying trend. Renowned market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the trend , indicating the renewed interest of the market participants towards the asset. For context, Martinez said that whales or large investors have purchased nearly 1 billion coins from yesterday, as the price soared more than 25% nearing the $3 mark. However, despite the massive XRP whale accumulation, the momentum was short-lived. Source: Ali Martinez, X XRP Price Slips: Here’s Why XRP price today was down 13% to $2.31, with its trading volume falling 30% to $13.9 billion. Notably, the 24-hour high and low of the asset were recorded at $2.23 and $2.7, respectively. Further, XRP Futures Open Interest fell 23% to $3.16 billion, indicating a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. It appears that despite XRP whales’ heavy buying, investors grew concerned over the future of the market. Besides, it also comes amid a broader digital assets selloff, with the crypto market facing liquidation of over $1 billion since yesterday. Why Is Crypto Market Falling? The current crypto market crash could be due to Trump tariffs going into effect on Mexico and Canada. This event, alongside other macroeconomic woes, has weighed on the investors’ sentiment, causing a massive selloff in the market. In addition, the impact of the recent announcement from Donald Trump regarding the US Crypto Reserve was also short-lived. While it initially caused a massive spike in prices, some investors might take the opportunity to book profit, triggering the selling pressure in the market. What’s Next For The Crypto? The recent decline in XRP could also be attributed to the delay in Ripple Vs SEC case resolution. While Trump’s announcement to add XRP to the US Reserve asset sparked hopes, legal experts have refuted claims of the development’s impact in speeding up the XRP lawsuit resolution . As the XRP price slipped to the $2.3 level, experts highlighted key support levels for the asset. For context, Rose Premium Signals said that in a bearish case, holding the $2.40 level is key. Breaking below this level could drag down the price to below $2. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Echoing a similar sentiment, EGRAG CRYPTO said that the crypto is likely to retest the $2.3 and $2.2 mark. However, Ripple’s coin holds key support at $2.2, which could help in a strong recovery ahead. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Having said that, the crypto must hold the $2.2 mark to witness a strong recovery ahead. While experts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin, some have warned of a potential crash to below $2 if the bears continue to dominate.

This news, delivered via an X (formerly Twitter) announcement, marks a significant moment of relief for the NFT community and signals potential shifts in the regulatory landscape for digital collectibles. But what exactly does this mean for the future of NFTs and the broader crypto space? Let’s dive into the details of this landmark decision and explore its implications. Why is the End of the SEC Probe into Yuga Labs a Big Deal for Bored Ape NFTs? The conclusion of the SEC probe Yuga Labs faced is more than just a corporate victory; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire NFT ecosystem, especially for prominent collections like Bored Ape NFTs . Since October 2022, when reports first surfaced about the SEC’s inquiry, the shadow of regulatory uncertainty has loomed over Yuga Labs and the broader NFT market. The investigation’s closure brings a sense of clarity and reduces the immediate fear of enforcement actions that could have stifled innovation and growth. Here’s why this development is particularly noteworthy: Validation for NFTs: The SEC’s decision to close the investigation without any enforcement action can be interpreted as a form of implicit validation for the NFT asset class, at least in the context of Yuga Labs’ operations. Boost in Investor Confidence: The resolution of regulatory uncertainty often leads to increased investor confidence. We might see renewed interest and investment in Bored Ape NFTs and other blue-chip NFT collections as the overhang of potential SEC action is removed. Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, this closure could set a precedent for how the SEC approaches other NFT projects. It might suggest a more nuanced approach than initially feared by many in the crypto space. Focus on Innovation: With the legal cloud lifted, Yuga Labs can now fully refocus on innovation and expansion within the metaverse and NFT space, potentially accelerating developments for BAYC and their other projects. What Was the Focus of the Yuga Labs Investigation? While the specifics of the Yuga Labs investigation were never officially disclosed by the SEC, reports indicated that the inquiry centered around whether certain NFTs offered by Yuga Labs, and the distribution of ApeCoin, constituted unregistered securities offerings. This is a critical question that has been hanging over the NFT space as regulators grapple with how to classify and regulate these novel digital assets. The SEC’s scrutiny likely revolved around: Security vs. Collectible: Determining if Bored Ape NFTs and ApeCoin were being marketed and sold in a way that resembled investment contracts, thus falling under securities laws, or if they were legitimately collectibles. Utility and Promises: Examining the utility promised or implied for these assets and whether Yuga Labs’ actions constituted an “investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,” a key aspect of the Howey Test used to define securities. Secondary Market Activity: While Yuga Labs does not control the secondary market, the SEC may have been interested in how the secondary market dynamics and price appreciation of Bored Ape NFTs influenced investor perceptions. Crypto SEC Cases: A Trend of Resolution? The closure of the Crypto SEC cases against Yuga Labs is not an isolated incident. As mentioned, the SEC has recently resolved investigations or reached settlements with several prominent crypto firms, including Robinhood, Gemini, UniSwap Labs, MetaMask, OpenSea, Coinbase, and Kraken. This pattern raises questions about the SEC’s evolving approach to crypto regulation. Is the SEC softening its stance, or is this a strategic shift? Here are a few potential interpretations: Interpretation Possible Reasoning Strategic Focus Shift The SEC may be prioritizing enforcement actions against more egregious cases of fraud or clear violations, while taking a more measured approach to projects that operate in the gray areas of regulation, like NFTs. Resource Allocation The SEC might be re-allocating resources, focusing on areas they deem higher priority or where they believe they have stronger legal footing. Investigations are resource-intensive, and closures could reflect strategic prioritization. Legal Challenges and Setbacks The SEC has faced legal challenges in some of its crypto enforcement actions. These closures might indicate a recalibration based on legal realities and a desire to pursue cases with a higher likelihood of success in court. Dialogue and Engagement Perhaps these closures represent a move towards more dialogue and engagement with the crypto industry to establish clearer regulatory frameworks, rather than solely relying on enforcement actions. Navigating NFT Regulation: What’s Next? While the end of the NFT regulation probe into Yuga Labs is undoubtedly positive news, it doesn’t mean the NFT space is entirely out of the regulatory woods. Clarity on NFT regulation remains a crucial need for the industry to thrive sustainably. Here’s what to consider moving forward: Continued Regulatory Scrutiny: NFT projects should still expect regulatory scrutiny. The SEC and other agencies are likely to continue monitoring the space and may initiate future investigations. Importance of Compliance: NFT projects should prioritize legal compliance, seeking advice to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. This includes understanding securities laws, intellectual property rights, and consumer protection regulations. Industry Self-Regulation: The NFT industry itself can play a role in shaping its regulatory future. Developing best practices, promoting transparency, and engaging in constructive dialogue with regulators can help foster a more favorable regulatory environment. Global Regulatory Landscape: NFT regulation is not just a U.S. issue. Projects need to be aware of and compliant with regulations in different jurisdictions as the global regulatory landscape for digital assets evolves. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air for NFTs and the Metaverse The SEC concluding its investigation into Yuga Labs without any charges is undeniably a significant victory for the company and a breath of fresh air for the NFT community. It signals a potential shift in the regulatory climate and provides a much-needed dose of optimism. While the long-term regulatory framework for NFTs is still being shaped, this development offers a moment to celebrate progress and look forward to continued innovation in the exciting world of digital collectibles and the metaverse. It underscores the resilience and dynamism of the crypto space and its ability to navigate and overcome regulatory hurdles.

With Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs already in place, and Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) expected to follow, attention has now turned to other potential candidates. Here are the possible altcoins next to be added to the crypto reserve. Next Token To Add in Crypto Reserve A recent tweet post by CryptoRank highlights a list of altcoins currently awaiting ETF launches. These include Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche (AVAX), and Aptos (APT).

Dogecoin (DOGE), with a massive $32.4 billion market cap, stands out as a strong contender. Given its popularity and links to prominent figures like Elon Musk, it wouldn’t be surprising if it finds favor in Trump’s strategy with a possibility of Dogecoin ETF getting approval soon. Hedera (HBAR) and Chainlink (LINK), both valued at $10.4 billion, could also be appealing due to their blockchain infrastructure capabilities, which align with national security and financial interests. Litecoin, which was created as a faster alternative to Bitcoin in 2011, is closer to getting SEC approval for a spot Litecoin ETF. Experts believe there is a 90% chance it will be approved by the end of the year. Apart from all Avalanche, Polkadot & Aptos with market caps of $9.6 billion, $7.52 billion, and $3.74 billion, respectively also have strong foundations. These tokens could be next in Trump’s crypto reserves, helping shape the future of U.S. digital assets. Trump’s Crypto Strategy Perhaps CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently expressed concerns that the U.S. is using crypto as a tool for economic dominance. His remarks suggest that the Trump administration’s stance prioritizes digital assets that serve national interests while leaving others unprotected. Trump’s selective support for certain assets has sparked debates about whether crypto is becoming more centralized under political influence. If his administration continues along this path, we could see a major shift in how cryptocurrencies are regulated and adopted in the U.S.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|BTC|LINK|LTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-04 07:45:25

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-in-local-distribution-phase-heres-the-significance/,"Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently noted that XRP whales have been offloading their holdings at unprecedented levels. In a post on X, Deutscher stated that large holders have been “aggressively selling” since the asset’s price surged by over 500% from November. He described the current market behavior as a local distribution phase, indicating that whales are taking profits following the substantial rally. Deutscher also attached a chart highlighting significant selling activity among whales. This pattern suggests a shift in market sentiment, as large-scale distributions typically indicate that investors who accumulated XRP earlier are now selling. The implications of such activity could influence both short-term price movement and broader market trends. $XRP whales are unloading at record levels! Large holders have been aggressively selling since the price rallied over 500% from November. $XRP seems to be in a local distribution phase right now. pic.twitter.com/NgaOoiZkWX — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 3, 2025 XRP’s Remarkable Run In late 2024, XRP began a remarkable run triggered by Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement . The asset rose from around $0.55 in early November, to a multi-year high of $3.39 in January 2025, marking a 516.4% increase. Contrasting Whale Behavior Despite the widespread selling reported by Deutscher, other recent whale movements provide a more complex picture. Some large investors accumulate tokens amid the sell-offs, signaling confidence in the asset. For example, a recent report highlighted that whales had acquired 1 billion XRP during a price dip. In another instance, a single entity purchased 65 million XRP , reinforcing the idea that not all major holders engage in the sell-off. These acquisitions contrast with the broader trend identified by Deutscher and suggest that while some whales are exiting, others see an opportunity to accumulate anticipating further gains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for XRP? The significant movement of tokens by whales extends beyond buying and selling on the open market. Recent blockchain data reveals that Ripple and major holders moved 490 million XRP within 24 hours. Another report pointed out that 520 million XRP had been acquired by whales, further complicating the market outlook. Increased whale activities can impact liquidity, volatility, and overall market sentiment, making them critical indicators for traders and investors monitoring the asset’s trajectory. Deutscher’s observation that XRP is in a local distribution phase aligns with broader market trends where large holders capitalize on price surges to take profits. However, the mixed activity among whales indicates that while some major holders are liquidating their positions, these purchases suggest that other investors view the current price levels as a strategic entry point. At press time, XRP traded at $2.6 after a notable surge caused by Donald Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve including XRP. It will be intriguing to see how the whales react to this development. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

41136693,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136499,1741074786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing: IMF’s Strict Bitcoin Conditions for El Salvador’s $1.4B Loan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/imf-loan-el-salvador-bitcoin/,"In a move that has the crypto world buzzing, El Salvador’s pursuit of a substantial $1.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has come with strings attached – and these strings are tightly wound around Bitcoin . Yes, you heard it right. The IMF is laying down some serious ground rules regarding El Salvador’s favorite cryptocurrency, demanding significant changes to its Bitcoin strategy as a condition for financial assistance. Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating development and what it means for El Salvador and the broader crypto landscape. Why is the IMF imposing strict conditions on El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption? The IMF’s concerns aren’t exactly new. Since El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, the international financial institution has voiced worries about the risks associated with cryptocurrency adoption, particularly its volatility and potential impact on financial stability. For a nation seeking a massive IMF loan to bolster its economy, these concerns have now translated into concrete demands. The core issue? The IMF wants to ensure that public funds are managed responsibly and that the risks associated with Bitcoin are mitigated. Here’s a breakdown of the key conditions El Salvador must meet to secure the IMF loan : Phasing out Public Involvement in Chivo Wallet: By July 2025, El Salvador must cease all public sector engagement with the state-run Chivo wallet. This means no more government funds can be used to support or operate the Chivo wallet. Ending State Funding for Chivo: Following the previous point, the government must completely stop using state resources to finance the Chivo wallet by the specified deadline. Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN (Bitcoin Trust Fund): The controversial Bitcoin Trust Fund, FIDEBITCOIN, is required to be dissolved. This fund was set up to facilitate the conversion of USD to Bitcoin and vice versa when Bitcoin became legal tender. Audited Financial Reports: El Salvador must release fully audited financial reports for FIDEBITCOIN, providing transparency into the fund’s operations and financial status before its dissolution. Implementing a Bitcoin Holdings Management Framework: The government needs to establish a robust framework for managing its Bitcoin holdings. This includes clear policies and procedures for acquisition, storage, and potential sale of Bitcoin . Disclosing Wallet Addresses to the IMF: Transparency is paramount. El Salvador is mandated to disclose all its Bitcoin hot and cold wallet addresses to the IMF. This level of scrutiny is unprecedented in traditional financial agreements. Regular IMF Reviews: Compliance isn’t a one-time event. The IMF will conduct regular reviews until 2025 to monitor El Salvador’s adherence to these Bitcoin -related conditions. What are the potential benefits of these strict cryptocurrency regulations for El Salvador? While these conditions might seem restrictive, they could bring some unexpected benefits to El Salvador. Let’s explore the potential silver linings: Enhanced Financial Stability: By reducing public exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility, El Salvador could achieve greater financial stability. The IMF’s conditions aim to insulate public funds from the unpredictable nature of the Bitcoin market. Improved Investor Confidence: Adhering to international financial standards and demonstrating fiscal responsibility can boost investor confidence in El Salvador. This could attract foreign investment beyond just the crypto sector. Greater Transparency and Accountability: The requirements for audited reports and disclosure of wallet addresses promote transparency and accountability in the management of public funds related to Bitcoin . This can build trust with both international partners and Salvadoran citizens. Streamlined Financial Operations: Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN and phasing out the Chivo wallet could streamline government financial operations, removing complexities and potential inefficiencies associated with managing a parallel Bitcoin system. Securing the Crucial IMF Loan: Ultimately, compliance unlocks access to the $1.4 billion IMF loan , which is vital for El Salvador’s economic stability and development. This financial injection can support crucial public services and infrastructure projects. What challenges does El Salvador face in complying with IMF’s Bitcoin demands? Navigating these cryptocurrency regulation demands from the IMF won’t be a walk in the park for El Salvador. Significant hurdles lie ahead: Political Resistance: Bitcoin adoption is a flagship policy of President Bukele’s administration. Scaling back public involvement in Bitcoin could face political resistance from within the government and among staunch Bitcoin supporters. Technical Complexity: Dissolving FIDEBITCOIN, auditing its finances, and establishing a new Bitcoin management framework are technically complex tasks. El Salvador will need expertise and resources to execute these changes effectively and transparently. Public Perception and Chivo Wallet Users: The Chivo wallet has been widely adopted in El Salvador. Phasing out public support might lead to confusion and dissatisfaction among users who rely on it for transactions and Bitcoin access. Managing public perception during this transition will be critical. Economic Impact of Bitcoin Policy Reversal: While intended to enhance stability, a perceived reversal of Bitcoin policy could have unforeseen economic consequences, potentially impacting tourism and businesses that have embraced Bitcoin . Meeting Tight Deadlines: The July 2025 deadline for many of these conditions is relatively tight. El Salvador will need to act swiftly and decisively to meet these requirements within the given timeframe. Examples of other countries and cryptocurrency regulation El Salvador isn’t alone in grappling with cryptocurrency regulation . Many countries are navigating the complexities of digital assets, each with different approaches: Country Regulatory Approach Key Features United States Fragmented, evolving Multiple agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN) involved, focus on investor protection and anti-money laundering, ongoing debate about classification of cryptocurrencies. European Union MiCA Regulation Comprehensive framework for crypto-asset markets, aiming for harmonization across member states, covers issuers, service providers, and consumer protection. Singapore Pro-innovation, risk-based Supportive of blockchain technology and crypto innovation, but with strict AML/CFT regulations, licensing regime for crypto service providers. China Strictly Regulated, Centralized Digital Currency Banned cryptocurrency trading and mining, focuses on developing its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY. These examples highlight the diverse approaches governments are taking. El Salvador’s situation is unique due to its adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, making the IMF loan conditions particularly significant. Actionable Insights: What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin in El Salvador? The IMF loan conditions signal a significant shift in El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. While Bitcoin remains legal tender, the government’s direct involvement is being curtailed. Here are some actionable insights: Decentralization of Bitcoin in El Salvador: The IMF conditions push for a more decentralized approach to Bitcoin in El Salvador. Reduced government involvement could foster a more organic and community-driven Bitcoin ecosystem. Focus on Private Sector Bitcoin Adoption: With the state stepping back from Chivo, the onus will be on the private sector to drive Bitcoin adoption. Businesses and individuals will need to innovate and create solutions for Bitcoin usage. Increased Scrutiny on Bitcoin Adoption Globally: The IMF’s stance on El Salvador will likely influence how other international institutions and governments view Bitcoin adoption. It sets a precedent for conditional financial assistance related to cryptocurrency policies. Potential for a More Sustainable Bitcoin Ecosystem: By addressing concerns about financial stability and transparency, El Salvador could potentially build a more sustainable and resilient Bitcoin ecosystem in the long run, even if it looks different from the initial vision. Conclusion: A pivotal moment for Bitcoin and El Salvador El Salvador’s journey with Bitcoin has reached a pivotal moment. The IMF loan conditions represent a significant course correction, demanding greater fiscal prudence and transparency in its Bitcoin strategy. While challenges undoubtedly exist, these changes also present opportunities for a more mature and sustainable integration of Bitcoin into El Salvador’s economy. The world will be watching closely to see how El Salvador navigates these new conditions and what it means for the future of Bitcoin adoption globally. This episode serves as a stark reminder that even revolutionary financial technologies must operate within the bounds of sound economic principles and international financial norms.

Shiba Inu, FloppyPepe, and Pepe are top crypto tokens with the potential to grow from $20k to $1 million within a short period of time. Table of Contents FloppyPepe, the million-dollar crypto token Pepe gears for another major pump Shiba Inu works to revive winning ways Final thoughts Turning $20k to $1 million within a short period isn’t uncommon in the crypto world. In 2025, investors can make this happen by investing in some crypto tokens. Based on their potential, Shiba Inu (SHIB), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Pepe (PEPE) can surge massively, turning a $20k portfolio into a million-dollar bag. FloppyPepe, the million-dollar crypto token When Shiba Inu and Pepe first hit the market, these crypto tokens skyrocketed in value and made early investors millions. In 2025, FloppyPepe is hoping to do the same. FloppyPepe is a meme coin that embodies the humor, strong social media presence, community, and virality associated with successful meme cryptos; after all, it’s a Matt-inspired token like Pepe and Brett. While entertainment and humor were the main defining features of past successful meme coins, FloppyPepe is about to add AI technology to improve the meme space. The platform’s community number surged in the past 24 hours after the release of its Meme-o-Matic AI machine, a text-to-image AI tool that can convert text prompts into high-quality meme images. Available for free use on Telegram, tons of users are already discovering how to create viral memes and put them for sale on marketplaces. FloppyPepe is also about to release another AI agent called Floppy X. It’s a video generator that needs only text prompts or images to generate high-resolution videos. Floppy X videos are interactive, can record engagement, and can analyze the data collected. FloppyPepe isn’t limiting itself to AI tech, even though its Floppychain technology, which works like ChatGPT, is also on the way. The meme coin is spreading its wings to touch nature. According to its tokenomics, 1% of every transaction funds the care of wildlife like Hippos and endangered species. Seeing its potential to see a massive rise when it lists on major exchanges soon, investors are rushing to join its presale priced at $0.0000002 to be part of its upcoming rise to the moon shot. You might also like: Matt Furie’s meme created PEPE’s success, could FloppyPepe be the next 1,000x run? Pepe gears for another major pump After its 2021 moonshot, investors didn’t expect Pepe to see a massive pump again. However, in 2024, PEPE rose again to set a new all-time high of $0.000008585. Pepe continues to increase over the years, keeping its community optimistic. In 2025, as Bitcoin’s performance continues to fuel market optimism, Pepe may hit a new high. Despite Pepe’s large market cap, it’s impossible to rule out a 1,000x surge for the crypto token. Shiba Inu works to revive winning ways SHIB’s popularity during the 2021 bull market stemmed from its massive gains, making many early investors millionaires. However, it’s currently facing challenges. Despite this, Shiba Inu is expanding and working on a comeback, with recent efforts like token burns and partnerships with AI companies. In 2025, Shiba Inu could potentially deliver returns of up to 1,000x. Final thoughts Among the three crypto tokens, Shiba Inu, FloppyPepe, and Pepe, FloppyPepe’s introduction of AI technology into meme space and utilities makes it the most promising to deliver high returns of up to 1,000x. So far, the crypto token presale has raised about $900,000 in a few days, a sign of huge buying pressure since its private presale also sold out in a day, raising $1 million. With a superior burn model that removes 1% of each transaction of the crypto token from circulation, FloppyPepe, the SolidProof audited meme coin, is a sustainable investment for savvy investors. Still selling at $0.0000002, investors can join its presale today to get in while it’s still early. For more information on FloppyPepe, visit its website , Telegram , or X .

Bitcoin has retreated to around $84,000, marking a 9% decrease from the previous close. The total crypto market cap has also dropped by around 10% to $2.76 trillion. However, rumors about President Donald Trump considering zero capital gains tax for US-based cryptocurrencies have sparked enthusiasm among traders. If this rumor turns true, how will it impact USA coins and cryptocurrencies price predictions? Will President Trump Announce Zero Capital Gains on Cryptocurrencies? Crypto analyst Mike Alfred has sparked speculation about Trump announcing zero capital gains on crypto. He noted that Trump would announce this move during the White House Crypto summit on Friday. In January, The Street reported that Eric Trump had confirmed that US-based cryptocurrencies such as XRP would be exempt from capital gains tax while non-US-based projects would be subject to a 30% tax. This move will put the US on par with crypto-friendly countries like El Salvador, which exempts foreign investors from capital gains on Bitcoin to attract investors. If Trump confirms this development, it will drive price gains for cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). These three USA coins have already been included in plans for a crypto strategic reserve despite market-wide criticism . XRP Price Defends Support After 16% Decline The XRP price has recorded a sharp 16% drop in 24 hours to trade at $2.35 at press time. The price drop follows broader weakness across the cryptocurrencies market but XRP has managed to defend crucial support at $2.14. Technical indicators show mixed momentum. The CMF indicator is positive signalling underlying accumulation. The Awesome Oscillator remains negative but has flashed green suggesting the bearish momentum is weakening. For a bullish reversal, the XRP price needs to flip resistance at $2.70 for a rally to $3.40. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Cardano Price Drops 23% Amid Crypto Market Volatility Cardano price has dropped by 23% in 24 hours to trade at $0.82. Despite the dip, ADA price still trades above its 200-day SMA, which is a crucial support level. If bulls defend this zone, another rally past $1 could follow, However, if selling pressure continues, it could lead to a bearish Cardano price prediction and a drop to $0.67. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Solana Price Forms a Death Cross Solana price has formed a death cross on its daily chart with the 50-day SMA falling below the 200-day EMA. After falling by more than 18% in 24 hours, SOL trades at $138. The altcoin was struggling to defend multi-month support at $135. The RSI is yet to be oversold, indicating there is room for further downside. With FTX unlocks for SOL tokens weighing on the cryptocurrency price, it could decline towards $100 in the near term. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Bottom Line Speculation around President Trump’s potential zero capital gains tax for US-based cryptocurrencies like XRP, Cardano, and Solana has sparked enthusiasm about price performance. However, heightened volatility in the broader market has prevented these USA coins from making meaningful gains.

At first, it rose to a new ATH but crashed 53% amid a broader market correction and is struggling to recover. Although yesterday marked a significant recovery, the trend changed again, leading to another step down and more risk. With the FTX/ Alameda unstacking millions of SOL, the token is one step closer to a further crash. Will it drop below $100? Let’s discuss this. Solana Price Crash: What’s Happening Today? Today marks another turbulent day, and the entire crypto market is witnessing a crash , including the Solana price. It currently trades at $128.14 after a 19% drop in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization and trading volume are $70.16B after the 19% drop and $9.56B after the 24% drop. Interestingly, this drop is because the tariffs on Mexico and Canada go into effect. However, the most alarming thing is that this drop came after an impressive SOL price rally fueled by Donald Trump’s U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement. At a time when investors anticipated a further uptrend, possibly as high as $200, the SOL price crashed, with the FTX and Alameda unstacking 3.03M SOL, equivalent to $431.3M. FTX Unstake Event and Its Impact on SOL As the crypto exchange begins redistributing the funds of FTX crash-affected investors, the market is witnessing millions of token unlocks, which are affecting their price. The firm recently unstaked 3.03M SOL ($431.3M) and transferred them to multiple crypto wallets. 24,799 SOL ($3.38M) has already been deposited to the Binance exchange, liquidating the asset. More importantly, many similar unlocks will come in April and the month after that, injecting fear into the market. This is because large token unlocks often influence investors’ sentiments and cause price fluctuations. As the crypto market is already under pressure, investors wonder if Solana could crash below $100. Why Wouldn’t Solana Price Crash Below $100? The SOL token’s performance today shows high signs of volatility, and factors like investor sentiments, a drop in network performance, token unlocks, and broader market conditions are to blame. However, considering SOL’s rally yesterday and market sentiments, the Solana price may not crash to $100 despite the odds. This altcoin grew to $177.88 yesterday and witnessed high trading volume and open interest, showcasing high investor interest. This explains the token’s potential for recovery even in adverse market conditions. Although the SOL is on the brink of massive liquidation, a $100 crash is unlikely. According to the Coinglass data, $300M will liquidate if the SOL price crashes to $127. This might initially trigger a drop to $120, but a rebound may occur, making a dip below $100 unlikely. Lastly, the Bitcoin price recovery in March could prevent this altcoin from further falling. The historical data reveals that BTC is bullish this month from the last 4 years, and the same might also happen this year, assisting the altcoins in recovery. Conclusion: A Steep Correction, but No Collapse Despite the ups and downs, Solana’s status in the crypto market is prominent. Although the FTX’s $431.3M unlock puts significant downtrend pressure on the price, the current analysis sees support at $120. Hence, the SOL price crash to $100 is unlikely, but due to liquidation data, it may dip towards $120. Investors must consider the liquidation level, whale data, and Bitcoin’s price movement to better comprehend Solana price predictions.

Analyst Says ADA ‘Could Be Poised’ For Rally To $2.20,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-125-pump-coming-analyst-says-ada-could-be-poised-for-rally-to-2-20/,"On Sunday, Cardano (ADA) saw a massive 80% pump following the US President’s announcement of a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” that will include ADA. As the cryptocurrency retests its key support levels, some analysts believe it might be poised for a 125% rally from current levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Sets $0.43 Target Cardano Attempts Reclaiming $1 On March 2, US President Donald Trump announced the establishment of a “US Crypto Reserve” comprised of Cardano, XRP, and Solana (SOL), with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at the heart of the strategic reserve. On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump stated the strategic reserve would “elevate the critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.” The announcement sent many cryptocurrencies into an end-of-week pump to reclaim some recently lost support levels. ADA has been in a downtrend since December when it hit its 3-year high of $1.32 but failed to hold the $1 support in mid-January. The February market retraces sent the cryptocurrency’s price below several key support zones, with the token hovering between the $0.60-$0.80 price range. Following Trump’s announcement, Cardano rose 60% in two hours, climbing from $0.64 to the $1 barrier for the first time in over a month. ADA continued its surge in the following hours, recovering over 80% from its Friday low of $0.58. On Sunday, ADA hit a two-month high of $1.17 before retracing over 20% to the key $0.90 support zone. Cardano investor Sebastian noted that the retest of the $0.92 level was “perfectly normal after such an insane move.” The investor suggested it could consolidate within the $0.90-$1.00 range for a few days before resuming its ascending trajectory. Moreover, he asserted that If ADA breaks above its December high, the token could likely see a new all-time high (ATH) soon. ADA’s New High Could Be Near Crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that Cardano “could be poised for a rally to $2.20.” According to the post, investors should “watch for a 12-hour candlestick close above $1.19” to confirm the bullish breakout and target an 84% jump from the breakout level. Martinez also highlighted that Cardano whales bought over 420 million ADA in the past 24 hours, which could signal strong sentiment from large-scale investors on the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that Cardano’s chart displays a “big power of 3 in the making.” This pattern divides the price cycle into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Key Levels And Faces Resistance At $97K – Can It Break $100K This Week? The first phase consists of a consolidation near the recent high after a strong price performance. The second phase sees a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level and trades within a range below the recently lost zone. In the third phase, a strong price breakout occurs, with momentum building and participants entering the market. According to Sjuul, “the chart never lies,” and Cardano entered the distribution phase after Sunday’s pump, suggesting that ADA could retest December highs soon. As of this writing, ADA trades at $0.91, a 9.9% retrace in the daily timeframe.

The task force aims to tackle the regulatory challenges surrounding digital assets. This group of experts will help the SEC address critical issues, including compliance and regulatory guidelines, ensuring that crypto regulations are more clear and effective. The leadership team of the task force includes Richard Gabbert as Chief of Staff, Michael Selig as Chief Counsel, Taylor Asher as Chief Policy Advisor, and Sumeera Younis as Chief of Operations. In addition to these leaders, the task force benefits from the input of Senior Advisors, including Landon Zinda, Donald Battle, Bernard Nolan, Laura Powell, Veronica Reynolds, Christopher Rice, Mark Sater, Andrew Schoeffler, Frank Sensenbrenner, and Robert Teply. The combined expertise of these professionals covers key areas such as legal, policy, and operational matters within the cryptocurrency landscape. Formed in January 2025 under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, the Crypto Task Force is tasked with refining existing crypto regulations, creating clearer compliance processes, and improving disclosure standards. By ensuring that enforcement remains focused and effective, the SEC hopes to pave the way for a more secure and transparent crypto market. As part of their initiative to encourage public dialogue on crypto regulations, the task force will be hosting a series of roundtable discussions, named “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The first roundtable, scheduled for March 21, is titled “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status.” This event will be streamed live and is open to the public, with security measures limiting in-person attendance. However, recorded versions of the event will be made available for later viewing. Participants will also be able to engage in smaller, off-air breakout discussions. Commissioner Peirce highlighted the importance of collaboration with the public, noting that these roundtables will be a key part of developing a workable regulatory framework for digital assets. The creation of this task force and the upcoming roundtable events signal a commitment from the SEC to create a well-regulated crypto market.

In a new thread, Ki Young Ju tells his 410,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s surge on Sunday is confirming his belief that Bitcoin’s bull market is far from over – as long as it doesn’t fall significantly below the $75,000 level. “Made a bold call knowing I could be way off, but glad I got it right.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Bitcoin surged over the weekend from around $84,000 to around $94,000, after President Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve for the US that will include the flagship digital asset. Ki Young Ju also says that deep-pocketed investors using the top US crypto exchange Coinbase were propelling Bitcoin to higher price levels over the weekend. “Coinbase whales led this Bitcoin surge.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The CEO points to other metrics that he says continue to signal bullishness, including Bitcoin’s hash rate. The hash rate measures the computational power used by miners to secure the BTC network. A higher hash rate indicates a stronger network and better security. “The chart that backs my belief in Bitcoin. When investment in its network security stops, it has likely absorbed enough capital. That’s the time to sell.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X He also says that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator shows the price of the flagship crypto asset is likely to go up based on historic precedence. MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all BTC at the price they were bought at) and is used to assess whether the crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued. “Bitcoin on-chain indicators feel like this – like something unfinished.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The flagship digital asset did retrace on Monday amid the Trump tariff news that caused a sell-off in the stock market. Bitcoin is trading for $83,284 at time of writing, down 10.4% in the last 24 hours.

This filing follows Bitwise’s earlier submission of an S-1 to the SEC. According to the filing, Coinbase Custody will manage the ETF's Dogecoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon will oversee the cash assets and handle administration tasks. The filing proposes that the ETF will hold Dogecoin as its primary asset, with its Net Asset Value (NAV) calculated daily using the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, an industry-standard pricing benchmark. This would allow the ETF to closely track the market value of Dogecoin, offering investors an opportunity to trade the meme cryptocurrency on traditional markets. Besides Bitwise, other major firms like Grayscale and Rex Shares have also filed for a Dogecoin ETF, with Grayscale’s application further along in the SEC's review process. Grayscale’s filing has already been acknowledged by the SEC, making it a strong competitor in this space. Market sentiment surrounding the approval of a Dogecoin ETF has been increasingly positive. According to Polymarket, the probability of approval has risen to 67%, up from 55% just a day before. Bloomberg analysts have also forecast a 75% chance of approval in 2025. This rising confidence reflects the market’s belief that a regulated Dogecoin ETF may soon become a reality, although approval is still not guaranteed. This potential ETF marks a turning point for Dogecoin, which began as a joke in 2013 but has since grown into the largest meme cryptocurrency, with a market cap surpassing $28 billion. Despite this, DOGE’s price has recently fallen by nearly 16%, with trading volume showing a marked decline of 17%. This drop in price and volume underscores broader market challenges, despite the increasing optimism around the ETF. Market optimism is increasing due to the growing chance of a Dogecoin ETF approval in 2025. Grayscale’s lead in the ETF approval process signals significant regulatory interest. However, DOGE’s price drop highlights the volatility of meme coins despite positive regulatory news.",,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:04:46

While liquidity decreases, the influx of new coins and inflation pressures are only adding to the downward trend. Investors became more cautious after Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and a 20% tariff increase on China, starting later today. The crypto market experienced significant volatility following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. While there was an initial surge in prices, those gains quickly faded as doubts arose over its execution and necessary regulatory approvals. Further, Trump’s announcement about tariffs added extra uncertainty, which led to a larger sell-off across the market. Crypto Liquidations Cross $1 Billion Crypto liquidations have surged to over $1.09 billion, with BTC alone accounting for more than $400 million. The crypto market has faced the most significant selloff of 2025, losing $460 billion in just 24 hours. This equates to an average loss of about $19.1 billion per hour for the last 24 hours staright, according to The Kobeissi Letter. We are seeing crypto's steepest selloff of 2025: Over the last 24 hours, crypto markets are down -$460 billion from their highs.

Market volatility is likely to continue, especially as these tariffs take effect later today. Bitcoin fell 9.8% to $83,725. Alankar Saxena, CTO and co-founder of Mudrex, cautioned the investors to stay careful as volatility could continue if BTC drops below the $81,000 support. However, there is room for recovery with resistance at $92,000 if market sentiment improves. Arthur Hayes Says BTC Could Drop To $70k Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, has expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s current bull market, maintaining that the cryptocurrency is on track for continued growth. However, he also warned that in the worst-case scenario, Bitcoin’s price could drop to around $70,000, aligning with the previous cycle’s all-time high. Altcoins Hit Harder In the last 24 hours, altcoins have taken a bigger hit, with Ethereum dropping to $2,000 and heading towards its worst Q1 performance ever. Ethereum dropped 15% to $2,083. After a brief spike above $2,500 following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement, Ethereum has now collapsed to $2,050, erasing all its weekend gains. The global crypto market cap fell by 10.5% to $2.76 trillion in the last 24 hours. Other altcoins also saw significant losses, with Cardano down 25%, Solana down 19%, Dogecoin down 16%, and XRP down 18%.

Goliath’s primary goal is to offer Visa-level transaction speeds , targeting up to 24,000 transactions per second, making it a strong contender in the competitive world of high-speed blockchain solutions. It aims to accomplish this with a Proof-of-Stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW) and selects validators based on the amount of tokens they stake, thus reducing the network’s carbon footprint. Goliath will provide scalable and secure infrastructure for banks and financial service providers, marking a significant step forward in blockchain technology for the finance sector. Onyx emphasized that while Goliath will be a Layer-1 blockchain , it will remain interoperable with existing financial networks, ensuring it can seamlessly integrate with current systems. The roadmap for Goliath’s development includes a testnet launch scheduled for Q3 2025 , followed by a mainnet release in Q1 2026 . These phases will allow the team to refine the blockchain before it’s fully deployed in the financial sector. In addition to the Goliath project, Onyx is also launching a Points Program for its existing Layer-3 XCN Ledger . Participants who bridge assets like WETH, USDT, and others from the Base blockchain to Onyx will receive rewards. Despite the optimistic announcements, Onyxcoin’s token (XCN) saw a significant drop of over 11% today, continuing a larger trend. The broader crypto market, grappling with bearish news from the Federal Reserve, saw major price declines, impacting XCN’s value. After Onyxcoin had a brief rally earlier this month, a mass exodus of investors occurred, and the token saw a significant 50% loss in February. The Goliath announcement has yet to slow down this downward trend, and while it’s an exciting innovation for the blockchain and financial sectors, it remains to be seen if it can halt XCN’s current struggles. Despite the challenges, Onyx’s Goliath project presents a promising leap forward in blockchain’s role in finance, especially with its focus on scalability, security, and energy efficiency. However, it will face fierce competition as other blockchain networks aim to provide similar solutions for high-speed financial transactions.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:07:24

Ongoing Efforts to Trace and Recover Assets The Bybit team is actively working with blockchain forensics firms and law enforcement to trace and recover the stolen assets. The significant amount that remains traceable suggests that coordinated action could lead to a portion of the funds being frozen or recovered. Crypto exchanges and cybersecurity experts are closely monitoring the movements of these funds, and industry leaders are calling for increased vigilance against cyber threats.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) are tasked with creating the proposal for managing digital assets and cryptocurrencies. This initiative follows a recent directive aimed at promoting national growth and increasing economic stability. The move is seen as crucial in regulating the growing digital asset market in Vietnam, which ranks 7th globally in cryptocurrency ownership, according to data from Triple-A. As of now, cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender in Vietnam, and many businesses that operate in the country register abroad to avoid local regulations. This has created a competitive disadvantage for local companies and has led to a loss in potential tax revenue. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of taking action, stating that all levels of government and the people have shown support for the initiative. With this legal framework, businesses will be able to access capital from financial institutions more easily, and users will benefit from greater transparency, helping minimize risks associated with digital currency transactions. Additionally, the framework will help the government in taxing crypto transactions and digital assets, contributing to the national economy. Currently, the Vietnamese government does not have a clear definition of virtual currencies or digital assets. The country’s previous efforts to regulate digital assets were incorporated into the Law on Digital Technology Industry, classifying crypto as intangible assets. In 2025, the government plans to classify digital assets based on factors like technology and purpose. This is expected to create clearer guidelines for the regulation of digital assets, which will contribute to the growth of the sector. To support these efforts, the Vietnamese government is also exploring the possibility of setting up testing mechanisms, known as sandboxes, to help establish a digital asset exchange. This initiative is expected to boost the financial industry and help Vietnam develop its digital currency market further. Moreover, the country plans to launch financial hubs in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang by 2025. The Prime Minister’s recent directive also mandates the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to draft policies related to digital assets and sandboxes, with deadlines set for Q2 2025. As Vietnam moves forward with these regulatory efforts, the country aims to position itself as a key player in the global digital currency space.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:11:47

McWilliams brings over 20 years of experience in financial management and auditing, and his role is crucial in driving Tether’s strategy to become more transparent amid growing regulatory pressure. Under his leadership, Tether aims to carry out a comprehensive financial audit, which the company hopes will address the long-standing doubts surrounding its reserve backing. In a shift of roles, Giancarlo Devasini, the former CFO, has been moved to the Chairman position, where he will focus on broader strategic initiatives, including advancing Tether’s integration into the U.S. financial system and boosting global digital asset adoption. McWilliams' appointment marks a critical step toward reinforcing Tether’s standing in the $232 billion stablecoin market. For years, Tether has faced skepticism regarding the transparency and legitimacy of its reserves. Until now, the company has only provided quarterly attestations from the accounting firm BDO, but these reports have been criticized for lacking the thoroughness of a full audit. This opacity has fueled doubts, particularly following a 2021 settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office, which exposed that Tether had misrepresented the backing of USDT at a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar. Despite the challenges, Tether has disclosed that a significant portion—82.35%—of its reserves is in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits, with nearly 80% of these holdings in U.S. Treasury bills. Critics, however, argue that only a full audit will truly resolve lingering concerns about the company’s financial stability. Tether's move for a comprehensive audit fits into its broader strategic goals. Recently, the company relocated its headquarters to El Salvador, aiming to secure a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license. This relocation signals Tether’s intention to strengthen its operational foundation and expand within the institutional financial sector. This development also comes as Tether seeks to demonstrate greater accountability and enhance its relationship with regulators, institutional partners, and users. With McWilliams’ appointment, Tether hopes to restore confidence and solidify its position as a leader in the stablecoin market, aligning itself with institutional needs while working toward full regulatory compliance. The company’s focus on transparency and its efforts to provide a more detailed and trustworthy audit process are seen as key factors in achieving long-term success. Tether’s move for greater transparency, led by McWilliams, aligns with its strategy to overcome past criticism and position itself as a key player in the global financial ecosystem. The outcome of the comprehensive audit will be crucial in shaping Tether’s future and its ability to maintain trust among users and investors alike. Simon McWilliams ' expertise is expected to guide Tether through a thorough audit process, addressing concerns about transparency and boosting institutional trust. Tether's future depends on how well it can tackle transparency issues and regulatory demands. McWilliams' leadership comes at a pivotal time as Tether looks to regain its standing amidst growing skepticism and regulatory scrutiny.",,EN,0,0,USDT|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-04 08:14:54
