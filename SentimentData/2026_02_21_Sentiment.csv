58252005,https://bitzo.com/2026/02/stablecoin-loans-at-0-apr-understanding-ltv-ratios-and-repayment-terms,1771620336,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/58252005.jpeg,Stablecoin Loans at 0% APR: Understanding LTV Ratios and Repayment Terms,https://bitzo.com/2026/02/stablecoin-loans-at-0-apr-understanding-ltv-ratios-and-repayment-terms,"Stablecoin loans have become a core liquidity tool for crypto holders who want access to funds without selling their assets. The appeal is straightforward: stablecoins are predictable, borrowing is fast, and—under the right conditions—users can achieve 0% APR on unused or low-risk borrowing. But 0% interest is rarely universal. It depends on how the loan is structured, how much is actually borrowed, and how conservatively the collateral is managed. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and repayment flexibility shape both cost and risk, and understanding these terms is essential before taking out a stablecoin loan. What 0% APR Really Means in Stablecoin Lending When platforms advertise “0% APR,” it seldom means that all borrowed funds are permanently free. In most cases, 0% refers to the unused portion of a crypto credit line , not the borrowed amount itself. Credit lines work differently from traditional loans. Instead of issuing a lump sum where interest begins immediately, a credit line provides access to liquidity but charges interest only when funds are withdrawn. Clapp is a clear example of this approach. Users deposit collateral (BTC, ETH, SOL, or up to 19 supported assets) and receive a borrowing limit. If they borrow 0, interest is 0. If they borrow a fraction of their limit, interest applies only to that portion. This lets users keep liquidity available without paying for borrowed capital they may not need. Why LTV Ratios Determine Cost, Risk, and Borrowing Power Loan-to-value (LTV) is the key metric in stablecoin lending. It measures how much is borrowed relative to the value of collateral. A user who deposits $40,000 worth of BTC or ETH and borrows $6,000 is operating at a 15% LTV. This matters because lower LTV reduces liquidation risk, stabilizes borrowing conditions, and often unlocks lower interest rates. When LTV rises—usually because collateral value falls—risk increases and borrowers may need to reduce exposure. Platforms design their interest structures around this principle: conservative LTV levels create room for lower-cost borrowing, while higher levels require more aggressive pricing. In credit-line models, low LTV is what enables 0% APR on unused credit and lower interest on withdrawn funds. LTV is not just a number; it determines whether borrowing remains safe or becomes precarious when markets move. Credit Lines vs Fixed Stablecoin Loans The model a platform uses determines how interest and repayments work. Fixed-term loans These resemble traditional finance: Borrowers receive a fixed amount. Interest accrues on the entire loan immediately. Repayment is scheduled. While predictable, fixed loans force borrowers to pay for capital they may not need at all times. Credit lines Credit lines separate access from usage. Borrowers receive a limit and can withdraw as needed. Interest is purely usage-based. This structure offers several advantages: Unused credit = 0% APR Repayment is flexible Borrowers maintain tighter control of LTV Liquidity becomes available on-demand Clapp Credit Line fits well into the 0% APR conversation: borrowers decide when and how much to borrow, and can keep interest at zero simply by not using—or minimally using—the available limit. An Example of 0% APR Stablecoin Borrowing Imagine a borrower deposits $50,000 in ETH and receives a $12,500 credit line. Scenario 1: No borrowing Borrowed amount: $0 LTV: 0% APR: 0% Scenario 2: Partial borrowing Borrowed: $4,000 in USDT LTV: 8% Only the $4,000 accrues interest The remaining $8,500 of unused credit carries 0% APR Scenario 3: Repaying early Borrower repays $2,000 LTV drops Interest immediately decreases Credit limit refreshes to full availability This is how borrowers maintain control over interest exposure and risk. Repayment Terms Define Borrower Control Repayment flexibility is central to the stablecoin loan experience. In fixed-term loans, repayment schedules are rigid. Borrowers must meet monthly deadlines and may face penalties for early repayment. Credit lines eliminate these constraints. Borrowers decide when to repay and how much. This matters during market volatility, when reducing LTV quickly can prevent a liquidation event. The structure supports active collateral management and positions borrowing as a strategic tool rather than a long-term obligation. Final Thoughts Stablecoin loans at 0% APR are possible, but only under models where interest aligns with actual borrowing and where LTV remains manageable. Credit-line structures provide the clearest path toward low-cost liquidity, letting borrowers access cash without committing to a full loan or paying for unused capital. Understanding LTV ratios, repayment flexibility, and how interest is applied allows users to borrow confidently and efficiently. For long-term asset holders, stablecoin credit lines transform borrowing from a reactive measure into a strategic financial tool. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One week the market sinks into FUD — fear, uncertainty, and doubt — as prices fall and liquidity thins. The next week, a sudden recovery triggers FOMO, pushing traders to enter positions quickly before the trend accelerates. This emotional volatility is matched by market volatility. And in fast-moving conditions, the method you use to execute swaps can matter as much as the decision itself. Crypto swap aggregators have emerged as a response to this environment. They don’t give financial advice, predict the market, or tell users when to buy or sell. What they do is reduce friction, improve rate transparency, and help users avoid unnecessary delays during periods when execution speed becomes critical. Here’s how they fit into a market driven by sudden fear and equally sudden enthusiasm. Volatile Markets Expose Friction Points During market turbulence, three issues tend to surface: 1. Liquidity FragmentationRates differ across exchanges because liquidity—especially during surges or crashes—doesn’t move uniformly. One venue may offer a much stronger pair price simply because its order book hasn’t adjusted yet. 2. Rate SensitivityWhen Bitcoin or Ethereum moves 5–10% in minutes, a swap that settles 15 minutes later may produce a very different outcome from what a trader intended. 3. Platform BottlenecksCEX traffic spikes during FOMO waves and swap services may widen spreads during FUD periods. Some platforms introduce hidden fees at moments when users are least able to pay attention. These points don’t change the direction of the market — they change the quality of the execution. How Crypto Swap Aggregators Work Instead of acting as a single exchange, a swap aggregator collects offers from multiple liquidity providers and displays them side by side. How it works The aggregator fetches real-time swap rates from multiple venues It updates these as conditions change Users choose the most favorable option at that moment The swap executes directly between the user’s wallet and the chosen provider There is no need to create new accounts or deposit funds into a custodial platform. The aggregator acts as a routing and comparison layer rather than a trading venue. SwapSpace as an Example SwapSpace operates as a crypto exchange aggregator. It compares real-time offers from 37 trusted exchange partners and supports nearly 4,000 cryptocurrencies. The platform’s main value in volatile markets lies in: Showing multiple available rates instead of one Offering fixed and floating execution types Allowing swaps without account registration Maintaining a non-custodial flow Providing continuous rate updates as markets move Offering estimated processing times before you commit This doesn’t mean every swap will be perfect — no platform can override market conditions — but it does indicate operational consistency. Fixed vs Floating Rates in Volatile Conditions Aggregators typically offer two pricing formats: Fixed rateLocks in the amount shown before the swap begins. This shields users from short-term volatility swings. Floating rateFollows live market pricing and may shift slightly before completion — sometimes in your favor, sometimes not. During extreme volatility, fixed rates may reduce uncertainty. During calmer fluctuations, floating rates may provide a more market-aligned result. Final Thoughts Crypto markets move quickly — sometimes too quickly for a single platform to keep up. Swap aggregators don’t change market direction, but they do offer clarity when the environment becomes noisy. In periods of fear, they help users avoid unnecessary losses from poor execution.In periods of excitement, they help avoid rushed decisions based on a single available rate. By acting as a comparison layer — not a trading venue — aggregators like SwapSpace offer structure in moments when markets feel structureless.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2026-02-20 20:49:08

The DeFi derivatives platform has launched the Hyperliquid Policy Center (HPC) in Washington, D.C., structured as an independent research and advocacy nonprofit focused on decentralized finance and on-chain derivatives such as perpetual futures. The Hyper Foundation is seeding the effort with 1,000,000 HYPE tokens — valued at roughly $28 million to $29 million at launch — to fund early operations and build out a policy team that includes a chief of staff and government relations professionals. Jake Chervinsky, a well-known crypto policy lawyer, has announced its appointment as chief executive. It is an attempt to shape the rules that will govern decentralized exchanges and crypto derivatives in the United States. The question is whether this marks a turning point for DeFi’s path to mainstream acceptance — or simply the beginning of a new lobbying era for crypto-native firms. From Code to Congress For much of its history, DeFi operated on the assumption that code could outrun regulation. Protocols deployed on public blockchains were viewed as neutral infrastructure, beyond the practical reach of traditional oversight. By funding a dedicated policy organization, Hyperliquid acknowledges that DeFi’s next phase will be influenced in congressional hearings and agency rulemakings as much as in liquidity pools. The regulatory perimeter around decentralized exchanges is no longer theoretical. It is being defined in real time. How Policy Signals Can Affect PR Strategy Regulatory posture increasingly shapes product design, geographic strategy and capital allocation. A multimillion-dollar HYPE commitment to policy engagement underscores that governance risk now sits alongside smart contract risk and market volatility. Communications strategy must adapt as well. Regulatory milestones, enforcement signals and legislative drafts now drive narrative cycles as much as token listings or total value locked. Agencies advising crypto firms are recalibrating accordingly. Outset PR is a data-driven crypto PR agency that has built its model around tracking structural market shifts and aligning storytelling with those developments. Through its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence, the agency monitors media trendlines, traffic distribution and momentum across crypto and financial outlets to determine when regulatory themes gain traction. Outset PR’s internal tracking tool, the Syndication Map, identifies which publications generate the strongest downstream pickup across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, allowing campaigns to ride broader market narratives rather than compete against them. A New Phase of Crypto Lobbying Crypto advocacy is not new. What distinguishes HPC is its scale and focus. A $28 million to $29 million token allocation gives the center the capacity to hire experienced policy professionals and sustain long-term engagement. For a single DeFi exchange to commit that level of capital signals that regulatory dialogue is strategic infrastructure. For investors, this development may prove as consequential as price action. The future of DeFi derivatives in the United States will hinge not only on liquidity metrics, but on how policymakers define their legitimacy.

Price action has remained fragile in recent weeks, with both major cryptocurrencies and altcoins struggling to regain sustained momentum. Investors are increasingly cautious as liquidity tightens, volatility persists, and macro uncertainty weighs on risk appetite. While corrective phases are not unusual after strong rallies, the current environment suggests the market is still searching for stability rather than transitioning into a clear recovery. A recent CryptoQuant report highlights a significant regulatory development that could influence longer-term market structure. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently indicated there is roughly a 90% probability that the CLARITY Act will pass by the end of April. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to define the regulatory boundary between the SEC and CFTC, establish clearer registration frameworks for exchanges and brokers, formalize custody and asset segregation rules, and codify AML and KYC requirements. Progress has slowed primarily due to debate around stablecoin yield products. While some proposals restrict issuers from paying interest, banks argue that exchange-based rewards may function as indirect yield instruments. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows yield-bearing stablecoin supply expanding rapidly since late 2024, highlighting growing structural demand. Regulatory Uncertainty And Stablecoin Policy Frictions Continue To Shape Market Sentiment Regulatory developments are increasingly shaping sentiment across the crypto market, and recent analysis suggests that the rapid growth of yield-bearing stablecoins has intensified political and financial tensions. Crypto firms are attempting to draw a distinction between interest paid directly by issuers and rewards distributed through exchanges or platforms, arguing that these mechanisms serve different economic functions. Traditional banks, however, are advocating for tighter restrictions, concerned that such products could accelerate deposit outflows from the conventional financial system. Until compromise language is formally codified in legislation, momentum within the Senate remains uncertain. At the same time, legislative complexity continues to increase. The Senate Agriculture Committee has already advanced a separate text focused primarily on Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight. This creates a scenario in which multiple legislative packages will eventually need to be reconciled. Bipartisan vote requirements, questions around federal versus state regulatory authority, and unresolved provisions related to decentralized finance further complicate the timeline. These factors suggest that even broadly supported frameworks may face procedural delays. If enacted, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act could reduce regulatory risk premiums in the short term while gradually reshaping market structure over the longer horizon. However, clarity is unlikely to emerge instantly. Historically, regulatory transitions unfold sequentially — first through political signaling, then formal rulemaking, and ultimately enforcement. Until that process matures, regulatory uncertainty will remain embedded in the market environment. Total Crypto Market Cap Tests Structural Support The total cryptocurrency market capitalization continues to face downward pressure, with the weekly chart showing a clear rejection from the multi-trillion-dollar peak reached during the 2025 rally. After topping near the $4 trillion region, the market has entered a sustained corrective phase, recently pulling back toward the $2.3 trillion area. This zone now functions as a key structural support level, reflecting the midpoint between the previous expansion phase and the ongoing consolidation. Technically, price action remains below the shorter-term moving averages, which have begun to slope downward and act as dynamic resistance. The medium-term average is flattening, suggesting loss of bullish momentum, while the longer-term trend line still trends upward but with a lag typical of macro support indicators. Until capitalization reclaims these levels decisively, upside follow-through may remain limited. Volume patterns also reflect caution. Participation has moderated compared with the peak rally phase, although occasional spikes suggest intermittent repositioning rather than uniform capitulation. Historically, such environments often precede extended consolidation periods as excess leverage unwinds. If support near current levels holds, the market could enter a stabilization phase. A breakdown below this zone, however, would likely confirm continued corrective pressure across the broader crypto ecosystem.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-this-9-year-pattern-could-send-xrp-to-70-heres-why/,"XRP has been forming a long-term technical structure that suggests significant upward potential. Crypto analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) recently shared a chart showing XRP forming a clear technical structure that could drive its price significantly higher. The chart spans 9 years, covering price action from 2017 to 2026. Initially described as a rising wedge, CryptoBull clarified that the structure is an ascending triangle, a pattern widely recognized for its bullish potential. The chart shows XRP consistently making higher lows while facing strong resistance at higher levels. This setup indicates a compression within a defined range. As the lower trend line rises, buying pressure increases, setting the stage for a potential breakout . CryptoBull emphasized that this formation could guide XRP toward substantially higher levels if the pattern completes successfully. This is the chart that will take #XRP to $70: a 9 year rising wedge. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/3736LVXrTx — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 18, 2026 Long-Term Support Strengthens The ascending triangle is anchored by a long-term upward trend that began in 2017. Each yearly low has trended higher, providing a consistent support line that buyers respect. The trend line has held through several market cycles, including the 2018 correction and the extended consolidation from 2020 to 2024. This repeated pattern of higher lows suggests strong accumulation over time and a growing base of long-term holders. CryptoBull’s chart shows the price testing the upper boundary multiple times. The most recent attempt was XRP’s climb to an all-time high in July 2025. Such repeated tests of resistance strengthen the likelihood of a decisive breakout once market conditions align. Analysts often view this as a bullish signal, highlighting the potential for accelerated price growth after extended consolidation. Potential Breakout Targets The ascending triangle points to a breakout target near $70 if XRP sustains momentum and closes above the resistance line. While the exact timing of a breakout cannot be predicted, the structure indicates a clear path toward significant gains. The combination of rising support and horizontal resistance provides traders with a framework for evaluating risk and opportunity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-term movements may remain volatile , but the long-term trend favors buyers. XRP’s consistently higher lows suggest that support levels will continue to hold unless disrupted by unforeseen events. The combination of years of support, repeated resistance tests, and the ascending triangle pattern provides a framework for confidently forecasting higher targets. This technical perspective reinforces confidence in XRP’s ability to deliver meaningful gains for holders who closely track long-term structures.

Price is trapped inside a clear triangle structure, with converging support and resistance squeezing volatility. This kind of compression rarely lasts. When markets tighten like this, they usually explode in one direction, and it could be either way. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Each rejection from resistance and bounce from support has narrowed the range, forming a classic apex setup. As the price approaches that apex, the probability of a sharp move increases. One constructive sign is the formation of higher lows within the triangle. Buyers are stepping in slightly earlier on each to show underlying demand building during consolidation. For now, Bitcoin is balanced but which side of Bitcoin price prediction has more control? Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can This Explode To The Upside Now? Bitcoin is still trading inside a tightening triangle, with descending resistance near $71,000 and rising support climbing from the $64,000 area. Price keeps compressing into the apex, and that type of structure rarely stays like this for long. Source: BTCUSD / TradingView The key detail is that higher lows continue to form on each dip. As long as $64,000 holds, the structure leans constructive. A clean breakout above $71,000 would likely trigger momentum toward $80,000 first, then open the path toward the next major upside target. Still, downside risks remain if the first support fails, exposing $60,000. New Bitcoin Presale Brings Solana Technology to The BTC Blockchain Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new presale built to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. This Bitcoin-focused Layer-2, powered by Solana technology, brings speed, lower fees, and real on-chain functionality while preserving Bitcoin’s core security.

In the face of uncertain trends, some digital assets offer a balanced approach. The article reveals which tokens are poised for potential growth, making them suitable for a cautious yet optimistic investment strategy. Cosmos Gains Momentum: Will ATOM See a Breakthrough Soon? Source: tradingview Cosmos (ATOM) is showing some action between just under $2 and above $2. ATOM has seen a jump in its weekly price with close to 20% growth, landing it slightly above $2. The current price stays close to a known resistance level, around $2.43. Its ease past another barrier could push ATOM up nearly 20% more towards $2.77. However, there's strong support a bit north of $1.70. Despite a drop over the past six months, the rising trend supports the chance of steady gains. This signals potential moves upward if resistance levels are overcome. Render (RENDER) Shows Signs of Growth Amid Crypto Volatility Source: tradingview Render's current price hovers between $1.27 and $1.57. It has seen a weekly rise of over 11% but dropped more than 23% over the past month. The coin shows some promise, with a relative strength index of around 58, indicating it's not overbought or oversold. The price could face a challenge if it nears the resistance level at $1.72 but breaking through could push it toward $2.02. If Render manages this leap, it could represent a potential growth of around 25% from its current range. However, if it slides back, the nearest safety net lies at $1.10 and the next at $0.79. Solana Rises Amidst Challenges: Signs of a Bullish Rebound? Source: tradingview Solana , a popular cryptocurrency, is navigating through a volatile phase. The current price fluctuates between high seventies and low nineties, indicating some resilience. It recently strengthened, growing about 7% in a week despite losing nearly a third of its value over the past month. The crypto faces a key resistance point at just under a hundred dollars. If momentum builds, Solana could potentially climb to around a hundred and fourteen dollars, offering an upside of almost 23% from the upper price range. However, support levels near seventy may cushion any fall, hinting at a foundation for upward potential. Market watchers remain attentive to these movements. Conclusion There is no clear breakout yet, making a neutral allocation strategy practical. Coins like ATOM, RENDER, and SOL are suggested as suitable fits. These coins have shown steady performance and potential for growth. Maintaining a diversified approach with these coins can balance risk and opportunity. This strategy can help navigate the current market conditions effectively. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin is currently down roughly 46% from its all-time high, while Ethereum has fallen about 60% from its record level. The steep declines mark what the publication describes as historically poor year-to-date performances for the assets. Bitcoin, Ethereum Lag While S&P 500, Gold Post Gains While Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with broader crypto prices, have often moved in tandem with equities in recent years, that relationship has weakened over the past two months. Since January, major US stock indices have edged higher. The S&P 500 has gained approximately 0.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 2.3%. Precious metals have also performed strongly. Gold has surged about 17% since the start of the year, while silver has advanced roughly 14%, even after experiencing a brief drop several weeks ago. Related Reading: ‘Sell Bitcoin Now,’ Peter Schiff Warns, Predicts $20,000 Target On Breakdown The disconnect between cryptocurrencies and broader market gains has prompted some industry observers to declare the arrival of another “Crypto Winter.” “We’re certainly in a Crypto Winter,” said Danny Nelson, a research analyst at crypto asset manager Bitwise. He pointed to investor behavior as evidence of deteriorating sentiment. “You can tell by how investors react to good news,” Nelson said. “They don’t.” ‘We’re Really Close To The End’ Despite the current pullback and the increased challenges for prices seen since the October 10 liquidation event, Nelson argues that the underlying foundation of the industry is strengthening. “Crypto’s reality is getting stronger,” he said, adding that the structural changes underway are likely to outlast the current downturn.

In a recent interview, Lee suggested the market may be nearing a turning point, stating, “We’re really close to the end.” Whether the latest slump proves to be a temporary correction or a deeper cycle shift remains uncertain. For now, however, the data underscores a challenging start to the year for the cryptocurrency market, even as other asset classes continue to surge. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,595, which is a slight 1% increase compared to Thursday’s prices. Ethereum is trading at around $1,968, with similar gains over the past 24 hours.

This has led to speculation about the beginning of a selective rotation in the market. The focus now shifts to identifying which coins are showing potential for growth in this shifting landscape. Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes Potential Rebound Amid Volatility Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading between about $8.56 and $9.87. This marks a slight upward shift of around 2.2% over the past week. However, the past month's downturn, with a drop of almost 25%, suggests volatility. The coin faces its nearest resistance at $10, with further resistance at $11, hinting at a possible 25% climb from current levels. Support lies around $7.84, offering a cushion, but a dip below could push it toward $6.53. With an RSI below 60, there’s room for upward momentum. The recent price movements indicate potential growth, though reaching previous highs will require breaking current barriers. Keep watch on resistance levels to gauge future performance. Conclusion AVAX's recent 3% rise indicates positive interest and activity. The Altcoin Season score of 33 suggests a mixed market where selective investment strategies may be forming. Key coins such as AVAX are seeing growth, though not uniformly across all altcoins. This period may present opportunities for investors to focus on specific assets showing upward momentum.

The former FTX CEO, currently serving a 25-year sentence at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, posted a “10 Myths About Me & FTX” thread claiming FTX was never insolvent, customers are being “made whole” with above 100% repayments, and that his November 2023 trial was basically unfair. He even spared time to address the rumors of a sexual nature leveled against him, which have drawn comparisons with the overt nature of the sexual experiences linked with the convicted fixer, Jeffrey Epstein. The truth, according to Bankman-Fried, was: “There were no polycules or orgies.” 2) Myth: There were polycule orgies Truth: There were no polycules or orgies I never partied or took vacation. FTX owned the penthouse; I spent $50k renting 10% of it for 6 months. My personal consumption and donations were less than—and came from—earnings. pic.twitter.com/jAmRJdTu2d — SBF (@SBF_FTX) February 20, 2026 The 119% repayment claim is heavily disputed The main statistic Sam Bankman-Fried (informally known as SBF) used to back his claims was that FTX customers are receiving between 119-143% of their original holdings. However, skeptics have problems with that figure because it seems to be calculated from the day FTX filed for bankruptcy. Using that valuation, a customer holding one Bitcoin on FTX would get around $17,000 in the bankruptcy distribution (119% of the November 2022 valuation). On the other hand, if that person held the same Bitcoin on another exchange, that Bitcoin would now be worth $100,000, meaning a deficit of $80,000 or more. Bankruptcy law requires November 2022 valuation date Under US bankruptcy law, claims are to be valued as of the petition filing date. This means in FTX’s case, the date would remain November 11, 2022, when crypto prices had crashed due to the exchange’s collapse. According to the testimony of John Ray III, the leader of FTX’s restructuring team (and previously oversaw Enron’s liquidation), FTX had recovered between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion in assets. The recovery also includes a 13.56% equity stake in AI company Anthropic as well as the liquidation of real estate holdings. From the approved repayment plan, 98% of customers (that is, those with claims under $50,000) would receive distributions within 60 days once the plan became effective in September 2025. As such, bigger creditors would receive their distributions at a different time. Cooperating witnesses received reduced sentences afte r gu ilty pleas Sam Bankman-Fried’s tweets also claime d Ju dge Lewis Kapla n ga gged him, threw him in jail before trial, and banned evidence of solvency from the case. According to court records, Bankman-Fried was convicted in November 2023 after a federal jury found him guilty on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. He would later be sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024. There were also rumors of polyamory and sex parties flying around at the time of the scandal. The allegations shared a similar style to those leveled against financial mogul Jeffrey Epstein, who, according to recent files released by the DOJ, helped to fund projects like Bitcoin, Coinbase, and Blockstream , going as far back as 2014. However, Bankman-Fried’s X thread has effectively shut down those rumors of sexual impropriety. Prosecutors brought up the testimony of his ex-girlfriend and former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang (co-founder of FTX), and Nishad Singh, the former FTX engineering director, durin g the tr ial. The cooperating witnesses got reduced punishments, with Caroline getting a two-year sentence, Wang also sentenced to time served with supervised release, and Singh spending no time in prison. Bankman-Fried also claimed that the cour t su ppressed evidence of solvency and that lawyers “took over” the company to generate their fees. He also claimed that he had secured funding offers that would have covered the liquidity gap and allowed withdrawals to continue. The court records, however, revealed that after John Ray III took over from Bankman-Fried as the CEO, his team discovered that FTX’s financial records were incomplete and inaccurate, alongsid e sy stemic failure of internal controls. President Trump has ruled out the possibility of a presidential pardon for the convicted executive who was a known Democratic donor. The FTT token has also seen sharp spikes and falls since SBF’s almost daily streak of publicly steering the narrative around his trial and conviction.

The White House administration is convening a third high stakes meeting on stablecoin yields, and Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty is on the invite list alongside legal leaders from Coinbase and a16z. The focus whether stablecoin issuers should be allowed to pass interest earned on reserves directly to users. This debate has stalled key crypto legislation in the Senate. Traditional banks are pushing back hard, arguing that yield bearing stablecoins could pull deposits out of the banking system and weaken their lending power. If you don’t think crypto is the future… Pay attention to how hard traditional banks are fighting against stablecoins paying yield. It’s really that simple. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 20, 2026 Crypto executives counter that allowing yields is a consumer benefit and essential for keeping innovation inside the US rather than offshore. The fact that Ripple has a seat at the table matters. It signals that policymakers are not sidelining major crypto players. Instead, they are actively engaging them as legislation takes shape. That does not mean the US government is about to endorse XRP directly. But it does suggest that regulatory clarity around stablecoins and digital assets is moving closer. XRP Price Prediction: Is That Retest Or Deeper Pullback? XRP pushed above the upper boundary of the descending channel but failed to hold it, getting rejected near the $1.61 zone and slipping back down. That kind of move usually signals unfinished business. Price is now drifting back toward the channel structure, potentially retesting it from the inside. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView If XRP fully falls back into the channel, it could trigger a move toward $1.30 support. A deeper breakdown below would expose $1.10 again, but for now that remains a secondary scenario. Failed breakouts often lead to one more sweep lower before a stronger push. If XRP stabilizes and forms a higher low inside or just at the edge of the channel, it would build pressure for another breakout attempt. A decisive reclaim of $1.50, especially with momentum expanding, would confirm the channel break and shift focus toward $1.90 and beyond.

Despite intermittent rebound attempts, momentum remains fragile, with traders hesitant to commit capital amid elevated volatility and cautious liquidity conditions. The asset has yet to establish a convincing higher high, reinforcing the perception that XRP remains in a transitional phase rather than a confirmed recovery trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks the Final Whale Floor In A 2018-Style Capitulation: What To Expect A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional context through exchange flow data. According to the analysis, Binance recorded a sharp spike in XRP exchange inflows during a previously highlighted period that preceded a strong rally. Large inflows typically reflect tokens moving onto exchanges, a dynamic often interpreted as potential sell pressure since assets become readily available for liquidation. Such spikes can increase short-term supply and amplify volatility. However, inflows do not always result in immediate distribution. In the referenced case, the surge in exchange deposits coincided with rising volatility and ultimately preceded a significant price expansion. This suggests that some inflow events may represent strategic positioning, liquidity preparation, or internal reallocation rather than outright selling. As XRP navigates current uncertainty, monitoring exchange flow behavior remains critical for assessing whether renewed volatility could once again precede a directional breakout. Liquidity Compression Signals Rising Volatility Risk The report explains that liquidity dynamics provide important context for understanding XRP market structure, particularly when evaluating volatility risk and potential price inflection points. USD liquidity measures the depth of capital supporting XRP trading pairs. During the previous rally phase, USD liquidity expanded significantly, allowing price advances to be absorbed without excessive volatility. Recently, however, USD liquidity has been declining, suggesting thinner market depth compared with the expansion period. Reduced depth typically increases sensitivity to order flow and can amplify price swings. Liquidity measured in XRP terms reflects the availability of tokens on the sell side. Prior to the last major breakout, XRP liquidity compressed notably, indicating reduced active supply on exchanges. That contraction phase aligned closely with the beginning of the strong upward move. Currently, XRP liquidity is trending lower again, showing similarities with earlier pre-expansion conditions. Historically, this combination of exchange inflow spikes alongside liquidity compression has preceded volatility expansion. Rising USD liquidity tends to support sustained trends, while declining liquidity often introduces fragility into market structure. At present, exchange inflows remain moderate, but both USD and XRP liquidity are contracting. This suggests a thinner environment where price reactions could become sharper. These indicators provide structural context, but they should be evaluated alongside derivatives positioning, funding trends, and broader macro conditions before drawing directional conclusions. Related Reading: The 200 Million Exodus: Investors Swap Speculation For Private Custody XRP Remains Under Pressure As Key Support Levels Face Ongoing Tests XRP remains under sustained technical pressure, with the weekly chart reflecting a clear corrective phase following the sharp rally that pushed the price above the $3.00 region in 2025. Since that peak, price structure has shifted toward a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, a pattern typically associated with weakening momentum rather than consolidation. The recent move toward the $1.40 area highlights continued selling pressure and cautious positioning among market participants. From a technical standpoint, XRP is currently trading below key moving averages that previously acted as dynamic support. These averages now function as overhead resistance, limiting upside attempts unless price can reclaim them decisively. The shorter-term average has rolled over more aggressively, while the longer-term trend line remains upward sloping but lagging, suggesting residual macro support alongside deteriorating short-term momentum. Related Reading: The Altcoin Exodus: Trading Volumes Halve As Capital Flees To Bitcoin $65,000 Fortress Volume activity has moderated compared with the impulsive rally phase, indicating reduced speculative participation. However, declining volume during corrections can also signal seller exhaustion if accompanied by stabilization in price structure. Immediate support appears concentrated near the recent lows around the $1.30–$1.40 zone, while resistance remains clustered near the $1.80–$2.20 range. Until XRP reclaims higher levels with strong participation, the broader trend remains fragile.

The visit took place at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, where Zhao attended a 500-person convention hosted by the Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial. CZ Makes Appearance at Crypto Event A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report revealed that the gathering brought together prominent figures from finance, technology, and entertainment. Guests included Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, New York Stock Exchange president Lynn Martin, “Shark Tank” personality Kevin O’Leary, and Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong, who had also attended a smaller VIP dinner on Tuesday evening alongside Trump’s sons and CZ. Rapper Nicki Minaj, who has publicly supported the Trump administration, also held a “fireside chat” on that day. Posting on X during the occasion, Zhao shared a photo of himself listening to a top federal crypto regulator, writing, “Learned a lot.” CZ, whose crypto exchange has been barred from operating in the U.S. since 2023 for violating anti-money-laundering rules, pleaded guilty to a related charge that same year. He was then sentenced in April 2024 to four months in prison and officially released in late September after serving his term. Later in October 2025, the crypto entrepreneur received a presidential pardon from President Donald Trump. During a recent interview on the “All-In” podcast, Zhao said he “didn’t do anything” to secure the clemency but noted that it could help the exchange resume its efforts to return to the American market. World Liberty Unveils Ambitious Crypto Vision World Liberty’s leadership used the occasion to lay out its vision for the cryptocurrency industry. CEO Zach Witkoff described the company’s goal as creating a “new digital Bretton Woods system,” referencing the 1944 conference that established a post-war economic order. His co-founders, the Trump sons, talked about the scale of the event, with Donald Trump Jr. joking about how much it would have been unimaginable a year ago. Meanwhile, Eric Trump compared it to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying it offered “better hospitality, better food, better weather, better group of people, less wokeness.” The firm also promoted its stablecoin, USD1, and outlined plans to sell digital tokens that would give accredited investors a share of loan revenues from a Trump resort under development in the Maldives. The president’s sons also addressed questions about foreign investment in World Liberty, including a $500 million deal with a senior Abu Dhabi royal, stressing that such moves are standard in global finance and unrelated to government agreements. Several other Trump administration officials were also in attendance, including Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Michael Selig and Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg.

Below is a breakdown of key narratives gaining traction in headlines and technical chart patterns that hint at powerful tailwinds heading towards summer. Discover: The best meme coins in the world right now. XRP (XRP): Ripple’s Expanding Blockchain Strategy Puts $5 in Focus XRP ($XRP) currently capitalizes a lofty $88 billion, making it the leading asset in global crypto payments. Ripple designed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to modernize international moeney transfers, offering near-instant settlement and ultra-low fees through a blockchain alternative to SWIFT. Its infrastructure is built to serve banks, enterprises, and individual users alike. A recent announcement shows Ripple intensifying its focus on XRPL as a foundation for stablecoin issuance and real-world asset tokenization, while reinforcing XRP’s role as the core liquidity and utility token within the ecosystem. Outside crypto communities, both the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House have recognized XRP as a practical solution for enhancing cross-border payments. Momentum accelerated further after U.S. regulators approved spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), opening the door for compliant institutional and retail exposure. Taken together with a developing bullish flag pattern on the charts, these factors could drive XRP toward the $5 level by Q2. Bitcoin (BTC): Is Another Record High Coming This Summer? Bitcoin ($BTC) , the original and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, set a record high of $126,080 on October 6. Since then, consecutive selloffs sparked by geopolitical uncertainty over potential U.S. military involvement in Iran and Greenland have sunk it 46%, sending it below $70,000. Bitcoin’s maxis maintain their chosen asset is “digital gold”. It’s a compelling narrative that has drawn interest from institutions and retail investors seeking a hedge against inflation, currency debasement, and macroeconomic risk. Growing institutional participation, reduced post-halving supply pressure, and the prospect of clearer U.S. crypto legislation soon could reignite upside momentum and drive multiple new highs this year. Speculation has also intensified around Donald Trump’s proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If implemented, it could seal Bitcoin’s dominance as the flagship crypto for years to come. Ethereum (ETH): The Engine of DeFi Could Return to Record Territory Ethereum ($ETH) is the backbone of decentralized finance with a market capitalization of $236 billion. The network hosts $54 billion TVL , making it the most financially active blockchain by a wide margin. In a renewed bull cycle, ETH could challenge and surpass the $5,000 resistance zone as early as June, exceeding its prior ATH of $4,946 set last August. Looking further ahead, Ethereum’s journey toward five-figures hinges on clearer regulatory guidance in the U.S. and supportive macroeconomic conditions. Both are essential to onboarding institutions, particularly through stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. From a technical perspective, ETH is trading below its 30-day moving average, with the relative strength index sitting near oversold levels around 33. For bullish investors, now is a compelling accumulation opportunity. Bitcoin Hyper Brings Solana-Grade Speed and Functionality to Bitcoin While XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum likely have plenty of growth to come, the biggest gains in bull markets often come from early-stage innovations that reshape the ecosystem. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . The project dramatically upgrades Bitcoin’s usability by introducing Solana-level performance via a Layer-2 protocol. The solution slashes transaction fees while preserving Bitcoin’s security. Users can stake assets, generate yield, trade tokens, and interact with smart contracts directly, all without bridging funds away from the Bitcoin network. With $31.5 million already raised in its ongoing presale, and growing interest from whales and major exchanges, $HYPER is rapidly becoming one of the most closely followed crypto launches of the year. Investors looking to secure $HYPER at its fixed presale price can visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect a supported wallet such as Best Wallet . Tokens can also be purchased using a bank card.

58254895,665274,1771626616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/58254895.jpeg,Ethereum Hits Multi-Year Accumulation High While Price Action Remains Under Pressure,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-multi-year-accumulation-high/,"Ethereum saw a brief bounce on Thursday, but the $2,000 price level proved once again to be a formidable resistance zone, rendering the bullish move void as it pulls back toward $1,900. This brief bounce might be linked to renewed sentiment of investors toward accumulation, which appears to have reached key levels not seen in several years. Falling Ethereum Prices, Rising Conviction After weeks of selling pressure due to waning market conditions , buying activity and interest in Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency asset, have significantly picked up pace. On-chain data suggests that renewed buying pressure from investors has pushed toward historic levels. As outlined in the data shared by Batman, a crypto analyst and investor, ETH is experiencing one of its strongest accumulation phases in years. ETH has managed to remake history even as its price continues to trend lower, making this a pivotal moment for the leading altcoin and its future outlook. Rising buyer conviction and declining values divide, indicating that long-term participants are discreetly positioning amid weakness rather than withdrawing from turbulence. The constant flow of capital from investors demonstrates confidence in Ethereum’s longer-term plan in spite of immediate market pressure . As selling pressure collides with steady accumulation, the current pattern could lay the foundation for the altcoin’s next short-term structural move. In another X post , Batman revealed that accumulation has also increased among newly created wallet addresses. Based on the flow data for Ethereum in a 24-hour period, over $490.9 million has been moved into a freshly created wallet address. Interestingly, this notable fresh capital is 2.4x higher than average, pointing to significantly elevated activity today. During the period, whale wallet addresses also secured approximately $39.2 million inflow, indicating a 30.7x increase above average. Furthermore, top PnL wallets recorded $46.9 million inflow, rising by 12.2x above average, while exchange wallets saw $56.9 million outflow, which is still a bullish signal. Whale buildup, exchange outflows , and large inflows of new wallets all point to the presence of substantial accumulation activity. Investors Are Stacking Up More ETH Than Bitcoin While Ethereum is attracting a wave of aggressive accumulation from large holders , its net buying from these investors now significantly outpaces that of Bitcoin. High-net-worth investors increasing their positions in ETH hints at a robust condition in the altcoin compared to BTC. The disparity in accumulation patterns raises the possibility that capital rotation is taking place as key participants in the ETH ecosystem move ahead of possible catalysts . According to CW, a verified author on CryptoQuant, whales are quietly buying massive amounts of ETH in a volatile market environment. Interestingly, the expert noted that the cohorts are particularly focused on positioning in the futures market. At the time of writing, the price of ETH was trading at $1,957 after recording a more than 1% drop in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has flipped bearish alongside its price, dropping by over 11% within the same time frame, according to CoinMarketCap’s data.",Ethereum|Batman|Bitcoin Large Holders|Coinmarketcap|CryptoQuant|CW|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-20 22:30:16

58255539,https://cryptonews.com/?p=486581,1771628100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/58255539.jpeg,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Dogecoin By the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-ai-claude-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-solana-and-dogecoin-by-the-end-of-2026/,"Feeding a well-crafted prompt into Claude reveals surprising 2026 forecasts for XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. According to Claude’s projections, all three assets could rise at least 5x by Christmas. Here’s a breakdown of why Claude is bullish on them. XRP ($XRP): Claude Charts a Long-Term Path Toward $8 In a recent update , Ripple reaffirmed that XRP ($XRP) sits at the center of its strategy to position the XRP Ledger as a global, enterprise-grade payments network. Source: Claude Thanks to rapid transaction settlement and extremely low fees, XRPL is likely to corner two of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors: stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. With XRP currently trading around $1.39, Claude’s long-range model suggests the token could rally to $8 by the end of 2026, representing a near sixfold increase from today’s levels. Technical indicators support this scenario. XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is relatively low at 38, while the price sits well below its 30-day moving average, signalling an attractive entry point. Several catalysts could accelerate this move, including institutional inflows following the approval of U.S.-listed XRP ETFs, Ripple’s expanding list of partnerships, and the potential passage of the U.S. CLARITY bill this year. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Push Toward $450 Solana ($SOL) currently hosts around $6.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) and has a market capitalization of nearly $48 billion. Institutional interest has also intensified following the launch of Solana-linked exchange-traded funds from asset managers such as Bitwise and Grayscale. Despite these tailwinds, SOL endured a lengthy correction in late 2025 and spent much of February trading below the $100 mark. Under Claude’s most optimistic projection, Solana could climb from its current price near $82 to around $450 by Christmas . That move would deliver more than 5x upside while exceeding Solana’s previous ATH of $293, set in January 2025. Additionally, major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, are issuing tokenized real-world assets on the network, strengthening Solana’s position as a scalable platform for institutional finance. Dogecoin (DOGE): Can the Original Meme Coin Break the $1 Barrier? Launched as a parody in 2013, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a major crypto asset with a market capitalization of roughly $17 billion, representing more than half of the $36 billion meme coin market. DOGE last reached an ATH of $0.7316 during the retail-fueled bull run of 2021. The Doge community has long targeted $1, and Claude’s outlook suggests a strong bull market could push Dogecoin past ATH to come close. From its current price, a fraction under $0.10, a move to $0.90 and beyond would be an easy 9x. Real-world adoption continues to expand. Tesla accepts DOGE for selected merchandise, and major fintech platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions, reinforcing its use beyond speculation. Maxi Doge: As Major Coins Eye New Highs, a New Meme Challenger Steps Forward While XRP, DOGE, and SOL have 5x to 9x potential, the real moonshots can be found in meme coin presales. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most talked-about new meme coins of 2026, raising $4.6 million so far in its ongoing funding round. The project revolves around Maxi Doge, a loud, gym-obsessed, unapologetically degen alpha doge, and a distant cousin and self-declared rival to Dogecoin. The concept taps directly into the irreverent energy that powered the 2021 meme coin explosion. MAXI is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a significantly lower environmental footprint compared to Dogecoin’s proof-of-work design. Early presale participants can currently stake MAXI tokens for yields of up to 68% APY, with staking rewards reducing as the pool grows. The token is priced at $0.0002805 in the current presale phase, with automatic price increases triggered at each funding milestone. Purchases are supported by any wallet, such as MetaMask and Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages. Visit the Official Website Here .

Zach Humphries, a well-known analyst, drew attention to the adjustment, noting that the fund raised Cardano’s weighting from 19.50% to 20.07%. While the change appears incremental, it shows deliberate expansion in exposure to ADA despite volatility across the market . Humphries observed that many investors may be underestimating Cardano’s growth potential as price fluctuations prompt short-term exits. He argued that current market conditions offer an accumulation opportunity , particularly given the significant developments within the ecosystem. Grayscale going back in on Cardano? If you own $ADA you will want to watch this. It's a crowded smart-contract space. Bitcoin DeFi the angle for Cardano? pic.twitter.com/uoarBEWtXx — Zach Humphries (@ZachHumphries) February 20, 2026 Cardano’s Role in Bitcoin DeFi Humphries believes that Cardano’s growing involvement in Bitcoin-based DeFi prompted Grayscale’s recent move. The network is actively developing mechanisms that allow Bitcoin holders to access DeFi services on Cardano without relinquishing custody. By leveraging non-custodial collateral structures and stablecoin-based credit systems, Cardano aims to channel Bitcoin liquidity into its platform, enhancing transactional flexibility while maintaining asset security. This strategy could distinguish Cardano from other major smart contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana. Even limited adoption of Bitcoin DeFi services on Cardano has the potential to attract substantial liquidity. This move would reinforce the network’s competitive position and potentially drive broader institutional interest. Institutional and Market Implications Humphries pointed out that Cardano is often overlooked compared with Ethereum and Solana, despite its growing technical strengths. By focusing on Bitcoin DeFi, the network could attract both institutional and retail investors, bringing significant capital into its ecosystem and reinforcing its relevance in the competitive smart contract landscape . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Humphries emphasized that the potential integration of Bitcoin liquidity could increase ADA’s appeal among institutional players. This will attract those looking for innovative investment avenues beyond the traditional smart contract markets. The strategic expansion into Bitcoin DeFi could enhance ADA’s long-term value proposition. Recent Developments in Cardano’s Ecosystem Cardano has made notable progress in realizing its Bitcoin DeFi ambitions. Last year, Input Output Global (IOG) showcased a live demonstration at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas. Developers successfully conducted an on-chain swap, exchanging Bitcoin for Cardano-based Minswap tokens. Building on this achievement, IOG introduced Cardinal, Cardano’s first operational Bitcoin DeFi protocol. This enables users to bridge and stake BTC directly within the network’s extended UTXO framework . These milestones reinforce Cardano’s growing influence in cross-chain decentralized finance. Grayscale’s gradual increase of ADA in its Smart Contract Fund, together with Cardano’s push into Bitcoin DeFi, highlights the network’s growing potential. As Bitcoin liquidity flows into Cardano, the asset is likely to gain more attention from both institutional and retail investors, further boosting ADA’s visibility and influence.

Large Holder Demand For Bitcoin Has Remained Weak Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the Bitcoin investor behavior has compared between the top and low ends of the market. Related Reading: XRP Social Sentiment Hits 5-Week High—BTC, ETH Mood Still Off The analytics firm has chosen these wallet ranges to represent the two sides: 0 to 0.01 BTC and 10 to 10,000 BTC. The former includes the smallest of retail investors, while the latter includes key investor cohorts like the sharks and whales. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply held by each cohort. As is visible in the graph, the 0 to 0.01 BTC cohort has been expanding its supply since the October price peak. Bitcoin has witnessed a deep drawdown inside this window, but the data would imply that it hasn’t held back retail traders from accumulating. In total, this accumulation has expanded the holdings of these small hands by 2.5%, taking their percentage supply share to the highest level since June 2024. While retail has been buying, the sharks and whales have shown a different trajectory. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 10 to 10,000 BTC holders sold alongside the market drawdown between October and December. In January, these investors participated in some buying, which interestingly coincided with a drop in retail holdings. Then, the drawdown toward the end of the month again kicked off a selloff from the key investors. This selloff was steep, in fact sharper than any part of Q4 2025’s distribution phase. Recently, even as Bitcoin has made some recovery from its $60,000 low and found some stability, the big-money investors haven’t shown any return of bullish conviction. Compared to the October peak, the supply of the 10 to 10,000 BTC holders is now down 0.8%, which has taken the network share of this group to the lowest since May 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidating In A Triangle—Is A 15% Move Next? The analytics firm explained: Optimally, we begin to see these two Bitcoin groups begin to reverse course. Without key stakeholder support, any spark of a rally will tend to be slightly limited due to the lack of large capital. In another X post, Santiment has also discussed the behavior of the mid-tier Bitcoin holders, occupying the space between retail and large investors. As displayed in the chart, the 0.01 to 1 BTC wallets have seen their combined Bitcoin supply hit a 15-month high following a 1.05% increase since October. Meanwhile, the 1 to 10 BTC hands have reduced their holdings by 0.49% in the same period. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $67,400, up 0.7% over the last week.

58257069,665807,1771632026,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/58257069.jpeg,Every Ethereum Whale Cohort Now Underwater: ETH Capitulation Marking The Final Bottom?,https://bitcoinist.com/every-ethereum-whale-underwater-eth-capitulation/,"Ethereum continues to struggle below the $2,000 level as persistent selling pressure and elevated uncertainty weigh on broader crypto market sentiment. Despite occasional rebound attempts, price action remains fragile, with volatility still elevated after months of corrective momentum. The inability to decisively reclaim this psychological threshold has reinforced caution among traders, particularly as liquidity conditions tighten and macro uncertainty continues to influence risk appetite across digital assets. Recent analysis from Darkfost adds further context to the current market structure. According to the data, the ongoing correction is now affecting all investor cohorts, including Ethereum’s largest holders. Notably, the unrealized profit ratio for whale groups has shifted into negative territory across the board. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH show an unrealized profit ratio of approximately -0.21, while those with 10,000 to 100,000 ETH stand near -0.18. Even the largest cohort — addresses holding more than 100,000 ETH — has slipped into negative territory around -0.08. This development is notable because Ethereum has not yet revisited its April lows, suggesting the depth of unrealized losses is expanding earlier than in some previous corrective phases . Such conditions can increase market sensitivity, as even traditionally resilient holders may reassess positioning amid prolonged volatility. Whale Stress Raises Capitulation Risk While Bottom Formation Signals Emerge Darkfost further notes that if Ethereum extends its decline, large holders could face increasing financial pressure. Sustained downside would deepen unrealized losses across whale cohorts, potentially forcing some participants to reduce exposure or liquidate portions of their holdings. Historically, such capitulation events among large investors tend to amplify short-term volatility, particularly when liquidity conditions are already fragile. However, despite the negative profit ratios now visible across whale groups, Ethereum has so far managed to stabilize above recent local support zones. This relative resilience suggests that, while sentiment remains cautious, immediate large-scale distribution from whales has not yet materialized. The distinction is important because unrealized losses alone do not necessarily trigger selling unless accompanied by liquidity stress, leverage pressure, or broader market shocks. Periods in which major holders experience stress have often coincided with medium-term bottom formation phases in previous cycles. As weaker hands exit and leverage unwinds, markets sometimes transition into accumulation regimes characterized by lower volatility and gradual stabilization. Still, this interpretation should be approached cautiously. Whale positioning is only one element of market structure, and confirmation typically requires improving liquidity, stronger spot demand, and supportive macro conditions before a sustained recovery can take hold. Ethereum Price Structure Remains Fragile Below Key Averages Ethereum continues to trade under clear technical pressure, with the weekly chart showing a sustained inability to reclaim the $2,000 region decisively. Following the sharp rejection from the 2025 highs near the $4,800 zone, price action has transitioned into a sequence of lower highs and weakening rebounds, typically associated with corrective market phases rather than accumulation-led recoveries. Technically, ETH is currently positioned below several major moving averages that previously acted as dynamic support. These levels now function as resistance, limiting upside attempts unless a strong reclaim occurs with expanding volume. The recent decline toward the $1,900 area reflects persistent selling pressure, while repeated failures near the mid-$2,000 range reinforce cautious market sentiment. Volume activity has moderated compared with the impulsive rally phase, suggesting reduced speculative participation. While declining volume during corrections can sometimes signal seller exhaustion, confirmation of stabilization usually requires sustained buying interest rather than temporary rebounds. From a structural perspective, immediate support appears concentrated near the recent local lows around the $1,800 region, while resistance remains clustered between roughly $2,200 and $2,600. Until Ethereum reclaims these levels convincingly, the broader technical outlook remains vulnerable, with consolidation or further downside still plausible.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-open-interest-surges-heres-the-implication/,"Shiba Inu has seen a notable increase in derivatives activity over the past 24 hours, signaling growing speculative interest in the asset. However, spot traders remain cautious, contributing to continued pressure on the token’s price. Data from CoinGlass indicates that open interest in Shiba Inu futures has risen by 8% in the last day, reaching $75.6 million. This growth in open interest suggests that more traders are taking positions in anticipation of significant price movements. Despite this heightened activity in the derivatives market, many token holders remain uncertain about Shiba Inu’s short-term trajectory , which has led to continued inflows into cryptocurrency exchanges. Market Activity and Trading Volume Shiba Inu’s price has increased modestly in the past 24 hours, following the broader pattern set by Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. The recovery is mild, and the token remains below previous levels after experiencing a double-digit correction over the last month and notable bearish signals . The rise in derivatives interest coincides with a surge in trading volume, reflecting higher market participation. Shiba Inu’s trading activity has increased over the past 24 hours. CoinGlass shows volume rising 16% to $109.23 million, while CoinMarketCap reports a 20% jump, bringing total activity to $129.8 billion. Futures trading is also picking up, with $9.5 million in contracts entering the market compared with $8.43 million leaving, which helps explain the recent rise in open interest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Spot Market Skepticism Despite the positive signals in the derivatives market, spot traders continue to demonstrate caution. Data reveals that $7.78 million worth of Shiba Inu has flowed into exchanges in the last 24 hours, while $7.35 million has moved out. Despite bullish predictions , these flows suggest that holders are positioning themselves for potential sell-offs, adding pressure to the token. The trend remains consistent over the 3 and 5-day periods, indicating a persistent cautious sentiment among spot traders. This cautious stance highlights the contrast between the optimism in derivatives markets and the conservative approach of spot holders . The activity in both futures and spot markets is likely shaping Shiba Inu’s short-term price movement. The data shows that active market participants are buying at current prices, which has helped support the token’s small recovery. SHIB is currently trading around $0.000006. Capturing $0.0000067 would be an important step toward a possible rebound to $0.0000099 and $0.0000148. Whether Shiba Inu can keep going up will depend on how active both spot and futures markets are. The derivatives market shows renewed trader interest, but caution among spot holders is still noticeable. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Sharpe Ratio Hits Unusual Low The Sharpe Ratio measures returns against volatility. When it drops far below zero over short stretches, it means investors have been taking heavy losses relative to how wildly the market is moving. A -38.38 reading is extreme. Reports note this kind of reading has happened only four times in Bitcoin’s history, and each time followed a stretch of high stress and weak sentiment. That pattern suggests selling can exhaust itself even when the charts look bleak.

Around $287 in 2015, and near $4,100 in early 2019, and again around $15,000 in late 2022, risk measures and mood were at their worst before money flowed back in. Based on reports from on-chain analysts, those moments shared common traits: many traders had capitulated, volume was thin, and volatility spiked. Yet those conditions later coincided with multi-month rallies that erased large parts of the prior losses. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin’s price has been sensitive to headlines lately. It slid under psychological levels as risk assets weakened, and trading has been muted. Markets reacted to diplomatic rows and conflict-related stories, causing bigger moves in thin markets. Sometimes BTC held up and brushed off sharp risk-off flows. Other times it fell further, especially when liquidity dried up. That stop-and-start behavior has left short-term traders cautious, while longer-term holders watch for signs that selling momentum is fading.
