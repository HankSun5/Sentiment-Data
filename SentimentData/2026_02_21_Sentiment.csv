58252005,https://bitzo.com/2026/02/stablecoin-loans-at-0-apr-understanding-ltv-ratios-and-repayment-terms,1771620336,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/58252005.jpeg,Stablecoin Loans at 0% APR: Understanding LTV Ratios and Repayment Terms,https://bitzo.com/2026/02/stablecoin-loans-at-0-apr-understanding-ltv-ratios-and-repayment-terms,"Stablecoin loans have become a core liquidity tool for crypto holders who want access to funds without selling their assets. The appeal is straightforward: stablecoins are predictable, borrowing is fast, and—under the right conditions—users can achieve 0% APR on unused or low-risk borrowing. But 0% interest is rarely universal. It depends on how the loan is structured, how much is actually borrowed, and how conservatively the collateral is managed. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and repayment flexibility shape both cost and risk, and understanding these terms is essential before taking out a stablecoin loan. What 0% APR Really Means in Stablecoin Lending When platforms advertise “0% APR,” it seldom means that all borrowed funds are permanently free. In most cases, 0% refers to the unused portion of a crypto credit line , not the borrowed amount itself. Credit lines work differently from traditional loans. Instead of issuing a lump sum where interest begins immediately, a credit line provides access to liquidity but charges interest only when funds are withdrawn. Clapp is a clear example of this approach. Users deposit collateral (BTC, ETH, SOL, or up to 19 supported assets) and receive a borrowing limit. If they borrow 0, interest is 0. If they borrow a fraction of their limit, interest applies only to that portion. This lets users keep liquidity available without paying for borrowed capital they may not need. Why LTV Ratios Determine Cost, Risk, and Borrowing Power Loan-to-value (LTV) is the key metric in stablecoin lending. It measures how much is borrowed relative to the value of collateral. A user who deposits $40,000 worth of BTC or ETH and borrows $6,000 is operating at a 15% LTV. This matters because lower LTV reduces liquidation risk, stabilizes borrowing conditions, and often unlocks lower interest rates. When LTV rises—usually because collateral value falls—risk increases and borrowers may need to reduce exposure. Platforms design their interest structures around this principle: conservative LTV levels create room for lower-cost borrowing, while higher levels require more aggressive pricing. In credit-line models, low LTV is what enables 0% APR on unused credit and lower interest on withdrawn funds. LTV is not just a number; it determines whether borrowing remains safe or becomes precarious when markets move. Credit Lines vs Fixed Stablecoin Loans The model a platform uses determines how interest and repayments work. Fixed-term loans These resemble traditional finance: Borrowers receive a fixed amount. Interest accrues on the entire loan immediately. Repayment is scheduled. While predictable, fixed loans force borrowers to pay for capital they may not need at all times. Credit lines Credit lines separate access from usage. Borrowers receive a limit and can withdraw as needed. Interest is purely usage-based. This structure offers several advantages: Unused credit = 0% APR Repayment is flexible Borrowers maintain tighter control of LTV Liquidity becomes available on-demand Clapp Credit Line fits well into the 0% APR conversation: borrowers decide when and how much to borrow, and can keep interest at zero simply by not using—or minimally using—the available limit. An Example of 0% APR Stablecoin Borrowing Imagine a borrower deposits $50,000 in ETH and receives a $12,500 credit line. Scenario 1: No borrowing Borrowed amount: $0 LTV: 0% APR: 0% Scenario 2: Partial borrowing Borrowed: $4,000 in USDT LTV: 8% Only the $4,000 accrues interest The remaining $8,500 of unused credit carries 0% APR Scenario 3: Repaying early Borrower repays $2,000 LTV drops Interest immediately decreases Credit limit refreshes to full availability This is how borrowers maintain control over interest exposure and risk. Repayment Terms Define Borrower Control Repayment flexibility is central to the stablecoin loan experience. In fixed-term loans, repayment schedules are rigid. Borrowers must meet monthly deadlines and may face penalties for early repayment. Credit lines eliminate these constraints. Borrowers decide when to repay and how much. This matters during market volatility, when reducing LTV quickly can prevent a liquidation event. The structure supports active collateral management and positions borrowing as a strategic tool rather than a long-term obligation. Final Thoughts Stablecoin loans at 0% APR are possible, but only under models where interest aligns with actual borrowing and where LTV remains manageable. Credit-line structures provide the clearest path toward low-cost liquidity, letting borrowers access cash without committing to a full loan or paying for unused capital. Understanding LTV ratios, repayment flexibility, and how interest is applied allows users to borrow confidently and efficiently. For long-term asset holders, stablecoin credit lines transform borrowing from a reactive measure into a strategic financial tool. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One week the market sinks into FUD — fear, uncertainty, and doubt — as prices fall and liquidity thins. The next week, a sudden recovery triggers FOMO, pushing traders to enter positions quickly before the trend accelerates. This emotional volatility is matched by market volatility. And in fast-moving conditions, the method you use to execute swaps can matter as much as the decision itself. Crypto swap aggregators have emerged as a response to this environment. They don’t give financial advice, predict the market, or tell users when to buy or sell. What they do is reduce friction, improve rate transparency, and help users avoid unnecessary delays during periods when execution speed becomes critical. Here’s how they fit into a market driven by sudden fear and equally sudden enthusiasm. Volatile Markets Expose Friction Points During market turbulence, three issues tend to surface: 1. Liquidity FragmentationRates differ across exchanges because liquidity—especially during surges or crashes—doesn’t move uniformly. One venue may offer a much stronger pair price simply because its order book hasn’t adjusted yet. 2. Rate SensitivityWhen Bitcoin or Ethereum moves 5–10% in minutes, a swap that settles 15 minutes later may produce a very different outcome from what a trader intended. 3. Platform BottlenecksCEX traffic spikes during FOMO waves and swap services may widen spreads during FUD periods. Some platforms introduce hidden fees at moments when users are least able to pay attention. These points don’t change the direction of the market — they change the quality of the execution. How Crypto Swap Aggregators Work Instead of acting as a single exchange, a swap aggregator collects offers from multiple liquidity providers and displays them side by side. How it works The aggregator fetches real-time swap rates from multiple venues It updates these as conditions change Users choose the most favorable option at that moment The swap executes directly between the user’s wallet and the chosen provider There is no need to create new accounts or deposit funds into a custodial platform. The aggregator acts as a routing and comparison layer rather than a trading venue. SwapSpace as an Example SwapSpace operates as a crypto exchange aggregator. It compares real-time offers from 37 trusted exchange partners and supports nearly 4,000 cryptocurrencies. The platform’s main value in volatile markets lies in: Showing multiple available rates instead of one Offering fixed and floating execution types Allowing swaps without account registration Maintaining a non-custodial flow Providing continuous rate updates as markets move Offering estimated processing times before you commit This doesn’t mean every swap will be perfect — no platform can override market conditions — but it does indicate operational consistency. Fixed vs Floating Rates in Volatile Conditions Aggregators typically offer two pricing formats: Fixed rateLocks in the amount shown before the swap begins. This shields users from short-term volatility swings. Floating rateFollows live market pricing and may shift slightly before completion — sometimes in your favor, sometimes not. During extreme volatility, fixed rates may reduce uncertainty. During calmer fluctuations, floating rates may provide a more market-aligned result. Final Thoughts Crypto markets move quickly — sometimes too quickly for a single platform to keep up. Swap aggregators don’t change market direction, but they do offer clarity when the environment becomes noisy. In periods of fear, they help users avoid unnecessary losses from poor execution.In periods of excitement, they help avoid rushed decisions based on a single available rate. By acting as a comparison layer — not a trading venue — aggregators like SwapSpace offer structure in moments when markets feel structureless.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2026-02-20 20:49:08

The DeFi derivatives platform has launched the Hyperliquid Policy Center (HPC) in Washington, D.C., structured as an independent research and advocacy nonprofit focused on decentralized finance and on-chain derivatives such as perpetual futures. The Hyper Foundation is seeding the effort with 1,000,000 HYPE tokens — valued at roughly $28 million to $29 million at launch — to fund early operations and build out a policy team that includes a chief of staff and government relations professionals. Jake Chervinsky, a well-known crypto policy lawyer, has announced its appointment as chief executive. It is an attempt to shape the rules that will govern decentralized exchanges and crypto derivatives in the United States. The question is whether this marks a turning point for DeFi’s path to mainstream acceptance — or simply the beginning of a new lobbying era for crypto-native firms. From Code to Congress For much of its history, DeFi operated on the assumption that code could outrun regulation. Protocols deployed on public blockchains were viewed as neutral infrastructure, beyond the practical reach of traditional oversight. By funding a dedicated policy organization, Hyperliquid acknowledges that DeFi’s next phase will be influenced in congressional hearings and agency rulemakings as much as in liquidity pools. The regulatory perimeter around decentralized exchanges is no longer theoretical. It is being defined in real time. How Policy Signals Can Affect PR Strategy Regulatory posture increasingly shapes product design, geographic strategy and capital allocation. A multimillion-dollar HYPE commitment to policy engagement underscores that governance risk now sits alongside smart contract risk and market volatility. Communications strategy must adapt as well. Regulatory milestones, enforcement signals and legislative drafts now drive narrative cycles as much as token listings or total value locked. Agencies advising crypto firms are recalibrating accordingly. Outset PR is a data-driven crypto PR agency that has built its model around tracking structural market shifts and aligning storytelling with those developments. Through its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence, the agency monitors media trendlines, traffic distribution and momentum across crypto and financial outlets to determine when regulatory themes gain traction. Outset PR’s internal tracking tool, the Syndication Map, identifies which publications generate the strongest downstream pickup across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, allowing campaigns to ride broader market narratives rather than compete against them. A New Phase of Crypto Lobbying Crypto advocacy is not new. What distinguishes HPC is its scale and focus. A $28 million to $29 million token allocation gives the center the capacity to hire experienced policy professionals and sustain long-term engagement. For a single DeFi exchange to commit that level of capital signals that regulatory dialogue is strategic infrastructure. For investors, this development may prove as consequential as price action. The future of DeFi derivatives in the United States will hinge not only on liquidity metrics, but on how policymakers define their legitimacy.

Price action has remained fragile in recent weeks, with both major cryptocurrencies and altcoins struggling to regain sustained momentum. Investors are increasingly cautious as liquidity tightens, volatility persists, and macro uncertainty weighs on risk appetite. While corrective phases are not unusual after strong rallies, the current environment suggests the market is still searching for stability rather than transitioning into a clear recovery. A recent CryptoQuant report highlights a significant regulatory development that could influence longer-term market structure. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently indicated there is roughly a 90% probability that the CLARITY Act will pass by the end of April. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to define the regulatory boundary between the SEC and CFTC, establish clearer registration frameworks for exchanges and brokers, formalize custody and asset segregation rules, and codify AML and KYC requirements. Progress has slowed primarily due to debate around stablecoin yield products. While some proposals restrict issuers from paying interest, banks argue that exchange-based rewards may function as indirect yield instruments. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows yield-bearing stablecoin supply expanding rapidly since late 2024, highlighting growing structural demand. Regulatory Uncertainty And Stablecoin Policy Frictions Continue To Shape Market Sentiment Regulatory developments are increasingly shaping sentiment across the crypto market, and recent analysis suggests that the rapid growth of yield-bearing stablecoins has intensified political and financial tensions. Crypto firms are attempting to draw a distinction between interest paid directly by issuers and rewards distributed through exchanges or platforms, arguing that these mechanisms serve different economic functions. Traditional banks, however, are advocating for tighter restrictions, concerned that such products could accelerate deposit outflows from the conventional financial system. Until compromise language is formally codified in legislation, momentum within the Senate remains uncertain. At the same time, legislative complexity continues to increase. The Senate Agriculture Committee has already advanced a separate text focused primarily on Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight. This creates a scenario in which multiple legislative packages will eventually need to be reconciled. Bipartisan vote requirements, questions around federal versus state regulatory authority, and unresolved provisions related to decentralized finance further complicate the timeline. These factors suggest that even broadly supported frameworks may face procedural delays. If enacted, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act could reduce regulatory risk premiums in the short term while gradually reshaping market structure over the longer horizon. However, clarity is unlikely to emerge instantly. Historically, regulatory transitions unfold sequentially — first through political signaling, then formal rulemaking, and ultimately enforcement. Until that process matures, regulatory uncertainty will remain embedded in the market environment. Total Crypto Market Cap Tests Structural Support The total cryptocurrency market capitalization continues to face downward pressure, with the weekly chart showing a clear rejection from the multi-trillion-dollar peak reached during the 2025 rally. After topping near the $4 trillion region, the market has entered a sustained corrective phase, recently pulling back toward the $2.3 trillion area. This zone now functions as a key structural support level, reflecting the midpoint between the previous expansion phase and the ongoing consolidation. Technically, price action remains below the shorter-term moving averages, which have begun to slope downward and act as dynamic resistance. The medium-term average is flattening, suggesting loss of bullish momentum, while the longer-term trend line still trends upward but with a lag typical of macro support indicators. Until capitalization reclaims these levels decisively, upside follow-through may remain limited. Volume patterns also reflect caution. Participation has moderated compared with the peak rally phase, although occasional spikes suggest intermittent repositioning rather than uniform capitulation. Historically, such environments often precede extended consolidation periods as excess leverage unwinds. If support near current levels holds, the market could enter a stabilization phase. A breakdown below this zone, however, would likely confirm continued corrective pressure across the broader crypto ecosystem.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-this-9-year-pattern-could-send-xrp-to-70-heres-why/,"XRP has been forming a long-term technical structure that suggests significant upward potential. Crypto analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) recently shared a chart showing XRP forming a clear technical structure that could drive its price significantly higher. The chart spans 9 years, covering price action from 2017 to 2026. Initially described as a rising wedge, CryptoBull clarified that the structure is an ascending triangle, a pattern widely recognized for its bullish potential. The chart shows XRP consistently making higher lows while facing strong resistance at higher levels. This setup indicates a compression within a defined range. As the lower trend line rises, buying pressure increases, setting the stage for a potential breakout . CryptoBull emphasized that this formation could guide XRP toward substantially higher levels if the pattern completes successfully. This is the chart that will take #XRP to $70: a 9 year rising wedge. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/3736LVXrTx — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 18, 2026 Long-Term Support Strengthens The ascending triangle is anchored by a long-term upward trend that began in 2017. Each yearly low has trended higher, providing a consistent support line that buyers respect. The trend line has held through several market cycles, including the 2018 correction and the extended consolidation from 2020 to 2024. This repeated pattern of higher lows suggests strong accumulation over time and a growing base of long-term holders. CryptoBull’s chart shows the price testing the upper boundary multiple times. The most recent attempt was XRP’s climb to an all-time high in July 2025. Such repeated tests of resistance strengthen the likelihood of a decisive breakout once market conditions align. Analysts often view this as a bullish signal, highlighting the potential for accelerated price growth after extended consolidation. Potential Breakout Targets The ascending triangle points to a breakout target near $70 if XRP sustains momentum and closes above the resistance line. While the exact timing of a breakout cannot be predicted, the structure indicates a clear path toward significant gains. The combination of rising support and horizontal resistance provides traders with a framework for evaluating risk and opportunity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-term movements may remain volatile , but the long-term trend favors buyers. XRP’s consistently higher lows suggest that support levels will continue to hold unless disrupted by unforeseen events. The combination of years of support, repeated resistance tests, and the ascending triangle pattern provides a framework for confidently forecasting higher targets. This technical perspective reinforces confidence in XRP’s ability to deliver meaningful gains for holders who closely track long-term structures.

Price is trapped inside a clear triangle structure, with converging support and resistance squeezing volatility. This kind of compression rarely lasts. When markets tighten like this, they usually explode in one direction, and it could be either way. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Each rejection from resistance and bounce from support has narrowed the range, forming a classic apex setup. As the price approaches that apex, the probability of a sharp move increases. One constructive sign is the formation of higher lows within the triangle. Buyers are stepping in slightly earlier on each to show underlying demand building during consolidation. For now, Bitcoin is balanced but which side of Bitcoin price prediction has more control? Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can This Explode To The Upside Now? Bitcoin is still trading inside a tightening triangle, with descending resistance near $71,000 and rising support climbing from the $64,000 area. Price keeps compressing into the apex, and that type of structure rarely stays like this for long. Source: BTCUSD / TradingView The key detail is that higher lows continue to form on each dip. As long as $64,000 holds, the structure leans constructive. A clean breakout above $71,000 would likely trigger momentum toward $80,000 first, then open the path toward the next major upside target. Still, downside risks remain if the first support fails, exposing $60,000. New Bitcoin Presale Brings Solana Technology to The BTC Blockchain Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new presale built to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. This Bitcoin-focused Layer-2, powered by Solana technology, brings speed, lower fees, and real on-chain functionality while preserving Bitcoin’s core security.

In the face of uncertain trends, some digital assets offer a balanced approach. The article reveals which tokens are poised for potential growth, making them suitable for a cautious yet optimistic investment strategy. Cosmos Gains Momentum: Will ATOM See a Breakthrough Soon? Source: tradingview Cosmos (ATOM) is showing some action between just under $2 and above $2. ATOM has seen a jump in its weekly price with close to 20% growth, landing it slightly above $2. The current price stays close to a known resistance level, around $2.43. Its ease past another barrier could push ATOM up nearly 20% more towards $2.77. However, there's strong support a bit north of $1.70. Despite a drop over the past six months, the rising trend supports the chance of steady gains. This signals potential moves upward if resistance levels are overcome. Render (RENDER) Shows Signs of Growth Amid Crypto Volatility Source: tradingview Render's current price hovers between $1.27 and $1.57. It has seen a weekly rise of over 11% but dropped more than 23% over the past month. The coin shows some promise, with a relative strength index of around 58, indicating it's not overbought or oversold. The price could face a challenge if it nears the resistance level at $1.72 but breaking through could push it toward $2.02. If Render manages this leap, it could represent a potential growth of around 25% from its current range. However, if it slides back, the nearest safety net lies at $1.10 and the next at $0.79. Solana Rises Amidst Challenges: Signs of a Bullish Rebound? Source: tradingview Solana , a popular cryptocurrency, is navigating through a volatile phase. The current price fluctuates between high seventies and low nineties, indicating some resilience. It recently strengthened, growing about 7% in a week despite losing nearly a third of its value over the past month. The crypto faces a key resistance point at just under a hundred dollars. If momentum builds, Solana could potentially climb to around a hundred and fourteen dollars, offering an upside of almost 23% from the upper price range. However, support levels near seventy may cushion any fall, hinting at a foundation for upward potential. Market watchers remain attentive to these movements. Conclusion There is no clear breakout yet, making a neutral allocation strategy practical. Coins like ATOM, RENDER, and SOL are suggested as suitable fits. These coins have shown steady performance and potential for growth. Maintaining a diversified approach with these coins can balance risk and opportunity. This strategy can help navigate the current market conditions effectively. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin is currently down roughly 46% from its all-time high, while Ethereum has fallen about 60% from its record level. The steep declines mark what the publication describes as historically poor year-to-date performances for the assets. Bitcoin, Ethereum Lag While S&P 500, Gold Post Gains While Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with broader crypto prices, have often moved in tandem with equities in recent years, that relationship has weakened over the past two months. Since January, major US stock indices have edged higher. The S&P 500 has gained approximately 0.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 2.3%. Precious metals have also performed strongly. Gold has surged about 17% since the start of the year, while silver has advanced roughly 14%, even after experiencing a brief drop several weeks ago. Related Reading: ‘Sell Bitcoin Now,’ Peter Schiff Warns, Predicts $20,000 Target On Breakdown The disconnect between cryptocurrencies and broader market gains has prompted some industry observers to declare the arrival of another “Crypto Winter.” “We’re certainly in a Crypto Winter,” said Danny Nelson, a research analyst at crypto asset manager Bitwise. He pointed to investor behavior as evidence of deteriorating sentiment. “You can tell by how investors react to good news,” Nelson said. “They don’t.” ‘We’re Really Close To The End’ Despite the current pullback and the increased challenges for prices seen since the October 10 liquidation event, Nelson argues that the underlying foundation of the industry is strengthening. “Crypto’s reality is getting stronger,” he said, adding that the structural changes underway are likely to outlast the current downturn.

In a recent interview, Lee suggested the market may be nearing a turning point, stating, “We’re really close to the end.” Whether the latest slump proves to be a temporary correction or a deeper cycle shift remains uncertain. For now, however, the data underscores a challenging start to the year for the cryptocurrency market, even as other asset classes continue to surge. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,595, which is a slight 1% increase compared to Thursday’s prices. Ethereum is trading at around $1,968, with similar gains over the past 24 hours.

This has led to speculation about the beginning of a selective rotation in the market. The focus now shifts to identifying which coins are showing potential for growth in this shifting landscape. Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes Potential Rebound Amid Volatility Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading between about $8.56 and $9.87. This marks a slight upward shift of around 2.2% over the past week. However, the past month's downturn, with a drop of almost 25%, suggests volatility. The coin faces its nearest resistance at $10, with further resistance at $11, hinting at a possible 25% climb from current levels. Support lies around $7.84, offering a cushion, but a dip below could push it toward $6.53. With an RSI below 60, there’s room for upward momentum. The recent price movements indicate potential growth, though reaching previous highs will require breaking current barriers. Keep watch on resistance levels to gauge future performance. Conclusion AVAX's recent 3% rise indicates positive interest and activity. The Altcoin Season score of 33 suggests a mixed market where selective investment strategies may be forming. Key coins such as AVAX are seeing growth, though not uniformly across all altcoins. This period may present opportunities for investors to focus on specific assets showing upward momentum.

The former FTX CEO, currently serving a 25-year sentence at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, posted a “10 Myths About Me & FTX” thread claiming FTX was never insolvent, customers are being “made whole” with above 100% repayments, and that his November 2023 trial was basically unfair. He even spared time to address the rumors of a sexual nature leveled against him, which have drawn comparisons with the overt nature of the sexual experiences linked with the convicted fixer, Jeffrey Epstein. The truth, according to Bankman-Fried, was: “There were no polycules or orgies.” 2) Myth: There were polycule orgies Truth: There were no polycules or orgies I never partied or took vacation. FTX owned the penthouse; I spent $50k renting 10% of it for 6 months. My personal consumption and donations were less than—and came from—earnings. pic.twitter.com/jAmRJdTu2d — SBF (@SBF_FTX) February 20, 2026 The 119% repayment claim is heavily disputed The main statistic Sam Bankman-Fried (informally known as SBF) used to back his claims was that FTX customers are receiving between 119-143% of their original holdings. However, skeptics have problems with that figure because it seems to be calculated from the day FTX filed for bankruptcy. Using that valuation, a customer holding one Bitcoin on FTX would get around $17,000 in the bankruptcy distribution (119% of the November 2022 valuation). On the other hand, if that person held the same Bitcoin on another exchange, that Bitcoin would now be worth $100,000, meaning a deficit of $80,000 or more. Bankruptcy law requires November 2022 valuation date Under US bankruptcy law, claims are to be valued as of the petition filing date. This means in FTX’s case, the date would remain November 11, 2022, when crypto prices had crashed due to the exchange’s collapse. According to the testimony of John Ray III, the leader of FTX’s restructuring team (and previously oversaw Enron’s liquidation), FTX had recovered between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion in assets. The recovery also includes a 13.56% equity stake in AI company Anthropic as well as the liquidation of real estate holdings. From the approved repayment plan, 98% of customers (that is, those with claims under $50,000) would receive distributions within 60 days once the plan became effective in September 2025. As such, bigger creditors would receive their distributions at a different time. Cooperating witnesses received reduced sentences afte r gu ilty pleas Sam Bankman-Fried’s tweets also claime d Ju dge Lewis Kapla n ga gged him, threw him in jail before trial, and banned evidence of solvency from the case. According to court records, Bankman-Fried was convicted in November 2023 after a federal jury found him guilty on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. He would later be sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024. There were also rumors of polyamory and sex parties flying around at the time of the scandal. The allegations shared a similar style to those leveled against financial mogul Jeffrey Epstein, who, according to recent files released by the DOJ, helped to fund projects like Bitcoin, Coinbase, and Blockstream , going as far back as 2014. However, Bankman-Fried’s X thread has effectively shut down those rumors of sexual impropriety. Prosecutors brought up the testimony of his ex-girlfriend and former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang (co-founder of FTX), and Nishad Singh, the former FTX engineering director, durin g the tr ial. The cooperating witnesses got reduced punishments, with Caroline getting a two-year sentence, Wang also sentenced to time served with supervised release, and Singh spending no time in prison. Bankman-Fried also claimed that the cour t su ppressed evidence of solvency and that lawyers “took over” the company to generate their fees. He also claimed that he had secured funding offers that would have covered the liquidity gap and allowed withdrawals to continue. The court records, however, revealed that after John Ray III took over from Bankman-Fried as the CEO, his team discovered that FTX’s financial records were incomplete and inaccurate, alongsid e sy stemic failure of internal controls. President Trump has ruled out the possibility of a presidential pardon for the convicted executive who was a known Democratic donor. The FTT token has also seen sharp spikes and falls since SBF’s almost daily streak of publicly steering the narrative around his trial and conviction.

The White House administration is convening a third high stakes meeting on stablecoin yields, and Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty is on the invite list alongside legal leaders from Coinbase and a16z. The focus whether stablecoin issuers should be allowed to pass interest earned on reserves directly to users. This debate has stalled key crypto legislation in the Senate. Traditional banks are pushing back hard, arguing that yield bearing stablecoins could pull deposits out of the banking system and weaken their lending power. If you don’t think crypto is the future… Pay attention to how hard traditional banks are fighting against stablecoins paying yield. It’s really that simple. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 20, 2026 Crypto executives counter that allowing yields is a consumer benefit and essential for keeping innovation inside the US rather than offshore. The fact that Ripple has a seat at the table matters. It signals that policymakers are not sidelining major crypto players. Instead, they are actively engaging them as legislation takes shape. That does not mean the US government is about to endorse XRP directly. But it does suggest that regulatory clarity around stablecoins and digital assets is moving closer. XRP Price Prediction: Is That Retest Or Deeper Pullback? XRP pushed above the upper boundary of the descending channel but failed to hold it, getting rejected near the $1.61 zone and slipping back down. That kind of move usually signals unfinished business. Price is now drifting back toward the channel structure, potentially retesting it from the inside. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView If XRP fully falls back into the channel, it could trigger a move toward $1.30 support. A deeper breakdown below would expose $1.10 again, but for now that remains a secondary scenario. Failed breakouts often lead to one more sweep lower before a stronger push. If XRP stabilizes and forms a higher low inside or just at the edge of the channel, it would build pressure for another breakout attempt. A decisive reclaim of $1.50, especially with momentum expanding, would confirm the channel break and shift focus toward $1.90 and beyond.

Despite intermittent rebound attempts, momentum remains fragile, with traders hesitant to commit capital amid elevated volatility and cautious liquidity conditions. The asset has yet to establish a convincing higher high, reinforcing the perception that XRP remains in a transitional phase rather than a confirmed recovery trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks the Final Whale Floor In A 2018-Style Capitulation: What To Expect A recent CryptoQuant report provides additional context through exchange flow data. According to the analysis, Binance recorded a sharp spike in XRP exchange inflows during a previously highlighted period that preceded a strong rally. Large inflows typically reflect tokens moving onto exchanges, a dynamic often interpreted as potential sell pressure since assets become readily available for liquidation. Such spikes can increase short-term supply and amplify volatility. However, inflows do not always result in immediate distribution. In the referenced case, the surge in exchange deposits coincided with rising volatility and ultimately preceded a significant price expansion. This suggests that some inflow events may represent strategic positioning, liquidity preparation, or internal reallocation rather than outright selling. As XRP navigates current uncertainty, monitoring exchange flow behavior remains critical for assessing whether renewed volatility could once again precede a directional breakout. Liquidity Compression Signals Rising Volatility Risk The report explains that liquidity dynamics provide important context for understanding XRP market structure, particularly when evaluating volatility risk and potential price inflection points. USD liquidity measures the depth of capital supporting XRP trading pairs. During the previous rally phase, USD liquidity expanded significantly, allowing price advances to be absorbed without excessive volatility. Recently, however, USD liquidity has been declining, suggesting thinner market depth compared with the expansion period. Reduced depth typically increases sensitivity to order flow and can amplify price swings. Liquidity measured in XRP terms reflects the availability of tokens on the sell side. Prior to the last major breakout, XRP liquidity compressed notably, indicating reduced active supply on exchanges. That contraction phase aligned closely with the beginning of the strong upward move. Currently, XRP liquidity is trending lower again, showing similarities with earlier pre-expansion conditions. Historically, this combination of exchange inflow spikes alongside liquidity compression has preceded volatility expansion. Rising USD liquidity tends to support sustained trends, while declining liquidity often introduces fragility into market structure. At present, exchange inflows remain moderate, but both USD and XRP liquidity are contracting. This suggests a thinner environment where price reactions could become sharper. These indicators provide structural context, but they should be evaluated alongside derivatives positioning, funding trends, and broader macro conditions before drawing directional conclusions. Related Reading: The 200 Million Exodus: Investors Swap Speculation For Private Custody XRP Remains Under Pressure As Key Support Levels Face Ongoing Tests XRP remains under sustained technical pressure, with the weekly chart reflecting a clear corrective phase following the sharp rally that pushed the price above the $3.00 region in 2025. Since that peak, price structure has shifted toward a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, a pattern typically associated with weakening momentum rather than consolidation. The recent move toward the $1.40 area highlights continued selling pressure and cautious positioning among market participants. From a technical standpoint, XRP is currently trading below key moving averages that previously acted as dynamic support. These averages now function as overhead resistance, limiting upside attempts unless price can reclaim them decisively. The shorter-term average has rolled over more aggressively, while the longer-term trend line remains upward sloping but lagging, suggesting residual macro support alongside deteriorating short-term momentum. Related Reading: The Altcoin Exodus: Trading Volumes Halve As Capital Flees To Bitcoin $65,000 Fortress Volume activity has moderated compared with the impulsive rally phase, indicating reduced speculative participation. However, declining volume during corrections can also signal seller exhaustion if accompanied by stabilization in price structure. Immediate support appears concentrated near the recent lows around the $1.30–$1.40 zone, while resistance remains clustered near the $1.80–$2.20 range. Until XRP reclaims higher levels with strong participation, the broader trend remains fragile.

The visit took place at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, where Zhao attended a 500-person convention hosted by the Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial. CZ Makes Appearance at Crypto Event A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report revealed that the gathering brought together prominent figures from finance, technology, and entertainment. Guests included Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, New York Stock Exchange president Lynn Martin, “Shark Tank” personality Kevin O’Leary, and Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong, who had also attended a smaller VIP dinner on Tuesday evening alongside Trump’s sons and CZ. Rapper Nicki Minaj, who has publicly supported the Trump administration, also held a “fireside chat” on that day. Posting on X during the occasion, Zhao shared a photo of himself listening to a top federal crypto regulator, writing, “Learned a lot.” CZ, whose crypto exchange has been barred from operating in the U.S. since 2023 for violating anti-money-laundering rules, pleaded guilty to a related charge that same year. He was then sentenced in April 2024 to four months in prison and officially released in late September after serving his term. Later in October 2025, the crypto entrepreneur received a presidential pardon from President Donald Trump. During a recent interview on the “All-In” podcast, Zhao said he “didn’t do anything” to secure the clemency but noted that it could help the exchange resume its efforts to return to the American market. World Liberty Unveils Ambitious Crypto Vision World Liberty’s leadership used the occasion to lay out its vision for the cryptocurrency industry. CEO Zach Witkoff described the company’s goal as creating a “new digital Bretton Woods system,” referencing the 1944 conference that established a post-war economic order. His co-founders, the Trump sons, talked about the scale of the event, with Donald Trump Jr. joking about how much it would have been unimaginable a year ago. Meanwhile, Eric Trump compared it to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying it offered “better hospitality, better food, better weather, better group of people, less wokeness.” The firm also promoted its stablecoin, USD1, and outlined plans to sell digital tokens that would give accredited investors a share of loan revenues from a Trump resort under development in the Maldives. The president’s sons also addressed questions about foreign investment in World Liberty, including a $500 million deal with a senior Abu Dhabi royal, stressing that such moves are standard in global finance and unrelated to government agreements. Several other Trump administration officials were also in attendance, including Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Michael Selig and Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg.

Below is a breakdown of key narratives gaining traction in headlines and technical chart patterns that hint at powerful tailwinds heading towards summer. Discover: The best meme coins in the world right now. XRP (XRP): Ripple’s Expanding Blockchain Strategy Puts $5 in Focus XRP ($XRP) currently capitalizes a lofty $88 billion, making it the leading asset in global crypto payments. Ripple designed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to modernize international moeney transfers, offering near-instant settlement and ultra-low fees through a blockchain alternative to SWIFT. Its infrastructure is built to serve banks, enterprises, and individual users alike. A recent announcement shows Ripple intensifying its focus on XRPL as a foundation for stablecoin issuance and real-world asset tokenization, while reinforcing XRP’s role as the core liquidity and utility token within the ecosystem. Outside crypto communities, both the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House have recognized XRP as a practical solution for enhancing cross-border payments. Momentum accelerated further after U.S. regulators approved spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), opening the door for compliant institutional and retail exposure. Taken together with a developing bullish flag pattern on the charts, these factors could drive XRP toward the $5 level by Q2. Bitcoin (BTC): Is Another Record High Coming This Summer? Bitcoin ($BTC) , the original and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, set a record high of $126,080 on October 6. Since then, consecutive selloffs sparked by geopolitical uncertainty over potential U.S. military involvement in Iran and Greenland have sunk it 46%, sending it below $70,000. Bitcoin’s maxis maintain their chosen asset is “digital gold”. It’s a compelling narrative that has drawn interest from institutions and retail investors seeking a hedge against inflation, currency debasement, and macroeconomic risk. Growing institutional participation, reduced post-halving supply pressure, and the prospect of clearer U.S. crypto legislation soon could reignite upside momentum and drive multiple new highs this year. Speculation has also intensified around Donald Trump’s proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If implemented, it could seal Bitcoin’s dominance as the flagship crypto for years to come. Ethereum (ETH): The Engine of DeFi Could Return to Record Territory Ethereum ($ETH) is the backbone of decentralized finance with a market capitalization of $236 billion. The network hosts $54 billion TVL , making it the most financially active blockchain by a wide margin. In a renewed bull cycle, ETH could challenge and surpass the $5,000 resistance zone as early as June, exceeding its prior ATH of $4,946 set last August. Looking further ahead, Ethereum’s journey toward five-figures hinges on clearer regulatory guidance in the U.S. and supportive macroeconomic conditions. Both are essential to onboarding institutions, particularly through stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. From a technical perspective, ETH is trading below its 30-day moving average, with the relative strength index sitting near oversold levels around 33. For bullish investors, now is a compelling accumulation opportunity. Bitcoin Hyper Brings Solana-Grade Speed and Functionality to Bitcoin While XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum likely have plenty of growth to come, the biggest gains in bull markets often come from early-stage innovations that reshape the ecosystem. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . The project dramatically upgrades Bitcoin’s usability by introducing Solana-level performance via a Layer-2 protocol. The solution slashes transaction fees while preserving Bitcoin’s security. Users can stake assets, generate yield, trade tokens, and interact with smart contracts directly, all without bridging funds away from the Bitcoin network. With $31.5 million already raised in its ongoing presale, and growing interest from whales and major exchanges, $HYPER is rapidly becoming one of the most closely followed crypto launches of the year. Investors looking to secure $HYPER at its fixed presale price can visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect a supported wallet such as Best Wallet . Tokens can also be purchased using a bank card.

58254895,665274,1771626616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/58254895.jpeg,Ethereum Hits Multi-Year Accumulation High While Price Action Remains Under Pressure,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-multi-year-accumulation-high/,"Ethereum saw a brief bounce on Thursday, but the $2,000 price level proved once again to be a formidable resistance zone, rendering the bullish move void as it pulls back toward $1,900. This brief bounce might be linked to renewed sentiment of investors toward accumulation, which appears to have reached key levels not seen in several years. Falling Ethereum Prices, Rising Conviction After weeks of selling pressure due to waning market conditions , buying activity and interest in Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency asset, have significantly picked up pace. On-chain data suggests that renewed buying pressure from investors has pushed toward historic levels. As outlined in the data shared by Batman, a crypto analyst and investor, ETH is experiencing one of its strongest accumulation phases in years. ETH has managed to remake history even as its price continues to trend lower, making this a pivotal moment for the leading altcoin and its future outlook. Rising buyer conviction and declining values divide, indicating that long-term participants are discreetly positioning amid weakness rather than withdrawing from turbulence. The constant flow of capital from investors demonstrates confidence in Ethereum’s longer-term plan in spite of immediate market pressure . As selling pressure collides with steady accumulation, the current pattern could lay the foundation for the altcoin’s next short-term structural move. In another X post , Batman revealed that accumulation has also increased among newly created wallet addresses. Based on the flow data for Ethereum in a 24-hour period, over $490.9 million has been moved into a freshly created wallet address. Interestingly, this notable fresh capital is 2.4x higher than average, pointing to significantly elevated activity today. During the period, whale wallet addresses also secured approximately $39.2 million inflow, indicating a 30.7x increase above average. Furthermore, top PnL wallets recorded $46.9 million inflow, rising by 12.2x above average, while exchange wallets saw $56.9 million outflow, which is still a bullish signal. Whale buildup, exchange outflows , and large inflows of new wallets all point to the presence of substantial accumulation activity. Investors Are Stacking Up More ETH Than Bitcoin While Ethereum is attracting a wave of aggressive accumulation from large holders , its net buying from these investors now significantly outpaces that of Bitcoin. High-net-worth investors increasing their positions in ETH hints at a robust condition in the altcoin compared to BTC. The disparity in accumulation patterns raises the possibility that capital rotation is taking place as key participants in the ETH ecosystem move ahead of possible catalysts . According to CW, a verified author on CryptoQuant, whales are quietly buying massive amounts of ETH in a volatile market environment. Interestingly, the expert noted that the cohorts are particularly focused on positioning in the futures market. At the time of writing, the price of ETH was trading at $1,957 after recording a more than 1% drop in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has flipped bearish alongside its price, dropping by over 11% within the same time frame, according to CoinMarketCap’s data.",Ethereum|Batman|Bitcoin Large Holders|Coinmarketcap|CryptoQuant|CW|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-20 22:30:16

58255539,https://cryptonews.com/?p=486581,1771628100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/58255539.jpeg,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Dogecoin By the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-ai-claude-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-solana-and-dogecoin-by-the-end-of-2026/,"Feeding a well-crafted prompt into Claude reveals surprising 2026 forecasts for XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. According to Claude’s projections, all three assets could rise at least 5x by Christmas. Here’s a breakdown of why Claude is bullish on them. XRP ($XRP): Claude Charts a Long-Term Path Toward $8 In a recent update , Ripple reaffirmed that XRP ($XRP) sits at the center of its strategy to position the XRP Ledger as a global, enterprise-grade payments network. Source: Claude Thanks to rapid transaction settlement and extremely low fees, XRPL is likely to corner two of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors: stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. With XRP currently trading around $1.39, Claude’s long-range model suggests the token could rally to $8 by the end of 2026, representing a near sixfold increase from today’s levels. Technical indicators support this scenario. XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is relatively low at 38, while the price sits well below its 30-day moving average, signalling an attractive entry point. Several catalysts could accelerate this move, including institutional inflows following the approval of U.S.-listed XRP ETFs, Ripple’s expanding list of partnerships, and the potential passage of the U.S. CLARITY bill this year. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Push Toward $450 Solana ($SOL) currently hosts around $6.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) and has a market capitalization of nearly $48 billion. Institutional interest has also intensified following the launch of Solana-linked exchange-traded funds from asset managers such as Bitwise and Grayscale. Despite these tailwinds, SOL endured a lengthy correction in late 2025 and spent much of February trading below the $100 mark. Under Claude’s most optimistic projection, Solana could climb from its current price near $82 to around $450 by Christmas . That move would deliver more than 5x upside while exceeding Solana’s previous ATH of $293, set in January 2025. Additionally, major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, are issuing tokenized real-world assets on the network, strengthening Solana’s position as a scalable platform for institutional finance. Dogecoin (DOGE): Can the Original Meme Coin Break the $1 Barrier? Launched as a parody in 2013, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a major crypto asset with a market capitalization of roughly $17 billion, representing more than half of the $36 billion meme coin market. DOGE last reached an ATH of $0.7316 during the retail-fueled bull run of 2021. The Doge community has long targeted $1, and Claude’s outlook suggests a strong bull market could push Dogecoin past ATH to come close. From its current price, a fraction under $0.10, a move to $0.90 and beyond would be an easy 9x. Real-world adoption continues to expand. Tesla accepts DOGE for selected merchandise, and major fintech platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions, reinforcing its use beyond speculation. Maxi Doge: As Major Coins Eye New Highs, a New Meme Challenger Steps Forward While XRP, DOGE, and SOL have 5x to 9x potential, the real moonshots can be found in meme coin presales. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most talked-about new meme coins of 2026, raising $4.6 million so far in its ongoing funding round. The project revolves around Maxi Doge, a loud, gym-obsessed, unapologetically degen alpha doge, and a distant cousin and self-declared rival to Dogecoin. The concept taps directly into the irreverent energy that powered the 2021 meme coin explosion. MAXI is an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a significantly lower environmental footprint compared to Dogecoin’s proof-of-work design. Early presale participants can currently stake MAXI tokens for yields of up to 68% APY, with staking rewards reducing as the pool grows. The token is priced at $0.0002805 in the current presale phase, with automatic price increases triggered at each funding milestone. Purchases are supported by any wallet, such as MetaMask and Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages. Visit the Official Website Here .

Zach Humphries, a well-known analyst, drew attention to the adjustment, noting that the fund raised Cardano’s weighting from 19.50% to 20.07%. While the change appears incremental, it shows deliberate expansion in exposure to ADA despite volatility across the market . Humphries observed that many investors may be underestimating Cardano’s growth potential as price fluctuations prompt short-term exits. He argued that current market conditions offer an accumulation opportunity , particularly given the significant developments within the ecosystem. Grayscale going back in on Cardano? If you own $ADA you will want to watch this. It's a crowded smart-contract space. Bitcoin DeFi the angle for Cardano? pic.twitter.com/uoarBEWtXx — Zach Humphries (@ZachHumphries) February 20, 2026 Cardano’s Role in Bitcoin DeFi Humphries believes that Cardano’s growing involvement in Bitcoin-based DeFi prompted Grayscale’s recent move. The network is actively developing mechanisms that allow Bitcoin holders to access DeFi services on Cardano without relinquishing custody. By leveraging non-custodial collateral structures and stablecoin-based credit systems, Cardano aims to channel Bitcoin liquidity into its platform, enhancing transactional flexibility while maintaining asset security. This strategy could distinguish Cardano from other major smart contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana. Even limited adoption of Bitcoin DeFi services on Cardano has the potential to attract substantial liquidity. This move would reinforce the network’s competitive position and potentially drive broader institutional interest. Institutional and Market Implications Humphries pointed out that Cardano is often overlooked compared with Ethereum and Solana, despite its growing technical strengths. By focusing on Bitcoin DeFi, the network could attract both institutional and retail investors, bringing significant capital into its ecosystem and reinforcing its relevance in the competitive smart contract landscape . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Humphries emphasized that the potential integration of Bitcoin liquidity could increase ADA’s appeal among institutional players. This will attract those looking for innovative investment avenues beyond the traditional smart contract markets. The strategic expansion into Bitcoin DeFi could enhance ADA’s long-term value proposition. Recent Developments in Cardano’s Ecosystem Cardano has made notable progress in realizing its Bitcoin DeFi ambitions. Last year, Input Output Global (IOG) showcased a live demonstration at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas. Developers successfully conducted an on-chain swap, exchanging Bitcoin for Cardano-based Minswap tokens. Building on this achievement, IOG introduced Cardinal, Cardano’s first operational Bitcoin DeFi protocol. This enables users to bridge and stake BTC directly within the network’s extended UTXO framework . These milestones reinforce Cardano’s growing influence in cross-chain decentralized finance. Grayscale’s gradual increase of ADA in its Smart Contract Fund, together with Cardano’s push into Bitcoin DeFi, highlights the network’s growing potential. As Bitcoin liquidity flows into Cardano, the asset is likely to gain more attention from both institutional and retail investors, further boosting ADA’s visibility and influence.

Large Holder Demand For Bitcoin Has Remained Weak Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the Bitcoin investor behavior has compared between the top and low ends of the market. Related Reading: XRP Social Sentiment Hits 5-Week High—BTC, ETH Mood Still Off The analytics firm has chosen these wallet ranges to represent the two sides: 0 to 0.01 BTC and 10 to 10,000 BTC. The former includes the smallest of retail investors, while the latter includes key investor cohorts like the sharks and whales. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply held by each cohort. As is visible in the graph, the 0 to 0.01 BTC cohort has been expanding its supply since the October price peak. Bitcoin has witnessed a deep drawdown inside this window, but the data would imply that it hasn’t held back retail traders from accumulating. In total, this accumulation has expanded the holdings of these small hands by 2.5%, taking their percentage supply share to the highest level since June 2024. While retail has been buying, the sharks and whales have shown a different trajectory. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 10 to 10,000 BTC holders sold alongside the market drawdown between October and December. In January, these investors participated in some buying, which interestingly coincided with a drop in retail holdings. Then, the drawdown toward the end of the month again kicked off a selloff from the key investors. This selloff was steep, in fact sharper than any part of Q4 2025’s distribution phase. Recently, even as Bitcoin has made some recovery from its $60,000 low and found some stability, the big-money investors haven’t shown any return of bullish conviction. Compared to the October peak, the supply of the 10 to 10,000 BTC holders is now down 0.8%, which has taken the network share of this group to the lowest since May 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidating In A Triangle—Is A 15% Move Next? The analytics firm explained: Optimally, we begin to see these two Bitcoin groups begin to reverse course. Without key stakeholder support, any spark of a rally will tend to be slightly limited due to the lack of large capital. In another X post, Santiment has also discussed the behavior of the mid-tier Bitcoin holders, occupying the space between retail and large investors. As displayed in the chart, the 0.01 to 1 BTC wallets have seen their combined Bitcoin supply hit a 15-month high following a 1.05% increase since October. Meanwhile, the 1 to 10 BTC hands have reduced their holdings by 0.49% in the same period. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $67,400, up 0.7% over the last week.

According to recent on-chain data, cryptocurrency whales have added a staggering 98,000 BTC to their reserves within a single month. This aggressive accumulation not only marks a pivotal shift in sentiment but also returns their collective holdings to levels unseen since before the October 2025 market downturn. The move provides a critical signal about the underlying health and future trajectory of the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Whales Drive a Historic Accumulation Phase Data from analytics firm CryptoQuant, reported by Cointelegraph, reveals a decisive trend among Bitcoin’s most substantial holders. Addresses containing over 1,000 BTC, commonly referred to as ‘whales,’ have purchased approximately 98,000 BTC over the past 30 days. Furthermore, this activity is part of a broader, sustained accumulation pattern that began in December 2025. During this period, these large-scale entities have collectively acquired a total of 236,000 BTC. Consequently, the total BTC held in these whale addresses has now climbed to 3.09 million BTC. This figure is particularly significant because it represents a full recovery to the holding levels observed prior to the sharp market correction on October 10, 2025. The rapid replenishment of reserves suggests these sophisticated investors view current prices as a strategic buying opportunity. Moreover, it indicates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite recent volatility. Analyzing the Velocity of Whale Withdrawals Complementary data from the on-chain intelligence platform Glassnode provides deeper context for this accumulation trend. The report highlights that the ratio of total whale withdrawals to the amount of BTC held on centralized exchanges has averaged 3.5% over the same 30-day window. This metric is crucial for understanding market dynamics. Withdrawal Ratio: This measures the proportion of Bitcoin moving from exchange wallets to private, custodial wallets. Market Implication: A high ratio typically signals that large holders are moving assets off exchanges for long-term storage, reducing immediate selling pressure. Historical Context: The current 3.5% average marks the fastest withdrawal rate since November 2024, suggesting an acceleration in the shift from trading to holding. Therefore, the combination of direct accumulation and accelerated off-exchange withdrawals paints a clear picture. Whales are not only buying more Bitcoin but are also securing it in cold storage. This behavior strongly aligns with a classic ‘hodling’ mentality, often preceding periods of reduced market supply. The Broader Market Impact of Whale Movements Whale activity serves as a leading indicator for the broader cryptocurrency market. Their movements often precede retail investor trends and can significantly impact liquidity and price stability. The recent data suggests several potential outcomes for the market structure. First, the reduction of BTC on exchanges, driven by whale withdrawals, directly decreases the liquid supply available for trading. Basic economic principles of supply and demand suggest that a shrinking available supply, coupled with steady or increasing demand, can create upward pressure on price. Second, the return to pre-crash holding levels demonstrates resilience. It shows that the October 2025 downturn did not permanently scare off major capital. Instead, it provided a strategic entry point. Finally, this activity must be viewed within the macroeconomic landscape of early 2026. Factors such as institutional adoption, regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions, and the maturation of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset for corporations all contribute to the fundamental thesis driving whale accumulation. Their actions reflect a calculated response to these evolving conditions, not mere speculation. Understanding Whale Psychology and Market Cycles Historically, periods of intense whale accumulation have correlated with the later stages of market consolidation or the early phases of a new bullish cycle. These investors typically possess significant resources for market analysis and operate with a longer time horizon than the average trader. Their current buying spree likely stems from a combination of technical, on-chain, and fundamental analysis. Key on-chain metrics beyond simple holdings, such as the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio, may have entered ranges that whales identify as undervalued. Additionally, the stabilization of the hash rate following previous adjustments and the continued growth of the Lightning Network for scalability contribute to a stronger fundamental network outlook. Whale accumulation at this scale is rarely a short-term bet; it is a strategic position built on a comprehensive assessment of Bitcoin’s health and potential. Comparative Analysis: Whale Behavior Across Cycles To fully grasp the significance of the current 98,000 BTC accumulation, a brief historical comparison is useful. The following table outlines notable whale accumulation phases from previous market cycles: Time Period Approximate BTC Accumulated Market Context Subsequent Price Action (6-12 Months) Q4 2020 ~120,000 BTC Post-COVID crash recovery Major bull run to all-time highs H2 2022 ~80,000 BTC Following LUNA/FTX collapse lows Significant price recovery and consolidation Present (Last 30 Days) 98,000 BTC Post-Oct 2025 crash recovery To be determined While past performance never guarantees future results, the pattern is instructive. Substantial whale buying during periods of fear or consolidation has frequently marked inflection points. The velocity of the current accumulation, returning holdings to pre-crash levels in just a few months, underscores the confidence of these market-moving participants. Conclusion The data is unequivocal: Bitcoin whales have executed a monumental accumulation strategy, adding 98,000 BTC in 30 days and restoring their holdings to pre-October 2025 crash levels. This action, coupled with the fastest exchange withdrawal rate in over a year, sends a potent signal about market sentiment among the most capitalized players. It reflects a strategic assessment of value, a reduction in readily available supply, and a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring fundamentals. For market observers, this whale behavior provides a critical, data-driven insight into the potential next phase of the market cycle, highlighting a significant recovery in institutional and large-scale investor confidence. FAQs Q1: What defines a ‘Bitcoin whale’? A Bitcoin whale is commonly defined as a wallet address holding a very large amount of BTC, typically over 1,000 coins. These entities can be individuals, institutions, investment funds, or custodians representing multiple investors. Q2: Why is whale accumulation considered a bullish signal? Accumulation by whales is often seen as bullish because it indicates that large, presumably sophisticated investors are buying at current prices for the long term. It also reduces the liquid supply of BTC on exchanges, which can decrease selling pressure and support price stability or appreciation. Q3: How does the withdrawal ratio from exchanges impact the market? A high withdrawal ratio means whales are moving BTC off trading platforms into private storage. This action directly lowers the amount of Bitcoin available for immediate sale on the market, which can lead to a supply squeeze if demand increases or remains constant. Q4: Does whale activity guarantee a price increase? No, whale activity is a strong indicator but not a guarantee. While accumulation reduces supply and shows confidence, broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment also play decisive roles in price direction. Q5: What are the risks of reading too much into whale movements? Whale addresses can sometimes represent exchange cold wallets or custodial services, not a single entity making an investment decision. Furthermore, whales can also sell, creating downward pressure. Therefore, while a valuable metric, it should be analyzed alongside other fundamental and technical indicators.

Announced via social media platform X on March 15, 2025, Armstrong confirmed Coinbase acts as custodian for over 80% of the assets within these groundbreaking investment vehicles, which collectively attracted a staggering $31 billion in total inflows to the platform in 2025 alone. This data point solidifies Coinbase’s position not merely as an exchange, but as the foundational infrastructure for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Coinbase ETF Custodian Role: The Backbone of Institutional Crypto The role of a custodian is critical yet often overlooked in financial markets. Essentially, a custodian is responsible for holding and securing the actual assets—in this case, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)—on behalf of the ETF issuer and, ultimately, the investors. Consequently, Coinbase’s dominance in this space means the vast majority of BTC and ETH purchased through U.S.-listed ETFs physically reside in Coinbase’s secure, insured cold storage systems. This custodianship involves: Secure Storage: Holding private keys offline in geographically distributed vaults. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to stringent state and federal regulations for asset guardianship. Insurance Coverage: Maintaining comprehensive insurance policies to protect against theft or loss. Audit and Reporting: Providing transparent proof-of-reserves and regular audits to issuers. Therefore, the 80% figure is not a measure of trading volume but of physical asset security . It represents a profound vote of confidence from major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, all of which utilize Coinbase Custody for their respective ETFs. This trust stems from Coinbase’s established regulatory track record and its status as a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: COIN) subject to SEC oversight. Analyzing the $31 Billion ETF Inflow Impact Brian Armstrong’s disclosure of $31 billion in ETF-related inflows for 2025 provides a quantifiable metric for the seismic impact these products have had on the crypto ecosystem. To contextualize this figure, analysts often compare it to the launch of gold-backed ETFs in the early 2000s, which fundamentally altered that market’s liquidity and investor base. Similarly, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have opened a massive, compliant conduit for traditional capital. The inflows have several direct and indirect effects: Market Liquidity: Massive, steady buying pressure from ETFs reduces volatility and increases market depth. Price Discovery: A significant portion of trading now ties to regulated, U.S.-based products. Infrastructure Growth: Demand for high-grade custody and security services has skyrocketed, benefiting the entire sector. Moreover, these inflows are largely considered “sticky” capital. Unlike speculative traders, ETF investors typically buy and hold for long-term portfolio allocation. This creates a more stable underlying asset base for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The chart below illustrates a simplified flow of these assets: Step Action Key Player 1 Investor buys ETF shares Retail/Institutional Investor 2 ETF issuer receives cash e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity 3 Issuer uses cash to buy BTC/ETH Authorized Participant 4 Purchased crypto sent to custodian Coinbase (80%+ of time) 5 Custodian secures assets in cold storage Coinbase Custody Expert Perspective: Why Custody Concentration Matters Financial analysts and blockchain experts note that such concentration in custody carries both significant advantages and points of consideration. On one hand, it creates a highly efficient and standardized security model. Coinbase’s scale allows it to invest in security measures that smaller players cannot match. Conversely, some market observers highlight systemic risk considerations, advocating for a more diversified custodian landscape over time to enhance network resilience. Historically, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024 marked the turning point. The subsequent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs later that year cemented the trend. Coinbase, having engaged with regulators for years and built its custody business since 2018, was uniquely positioned to meet the rigorous requirements demanded by these issuers. Its early investment in compliance technology and security protocols is now yielding dominant market positioning. The Evolving Landscape of Digital Asset Security Coinbase’s announcement arrives amid a broader evolution in how institutional investors perceive and handle digital asset security. The era of “not your keys, not your coins” now coexists with a professional framework where regulated, insured custody is a prerequisite for large-scale participation. This dual model—self-custody for some, institutional custody for others—is maturing the entire asset class. Furthermore, the success of these ETFs and their chosen custodians puts pressure on competitors and regulators alike. Other custody providers are incentivized to enhance their offerings, while regulators gain a clearer, more auditable window into the movement and holding of substantial crypto assets. This transparency, facilitated by companies like Coinbase reporting to both issuers and regulators, may ultimately support more informed and balanced policymaking. Conclusion Brian Armstrong’s revelation that Coinbase custodies over 80% of U.S. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF assets, coupled with $31 billion in associated 2025 inflows, is more than a corporate milestone. It is a definitive indicator of how deeply the traditional financial system has integrated with the digital asset ecosystem. Coinbase’s role as the predominant Coinbase ETF custodian underscores the critical importance of security, compliance, and trust in enabling widespread institutional adoption. As these ETFs continue to mature and attract capital, the infrastructure supporting them—exemplified by Coinbase’s custody dominance—will remain a cornerstone of the market’s stability and growth. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Coinbase is a “custodian” for Bitcoin ETFs? A1: As a custodian, Coinbase is responsible for physically holding and securing the actual Bitcoin or Ethereum that an ETF owns. They safeguard the private keys in insured, offline storage, ensuring the assets backing the ETF shares are protected. Q2: Why do most ETF issuers choose Coinbase for custody? A2: Issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity likely choose Coinbase due to its long-standing regulatory compliance, status as a publicly traded U.S. company, robust insurance coverage, and proven track record in secure digital asset storage, which meets strict due diligence requirements. Q3: Does the $31 billion inflow represent profit for Coinbase? A3: Not directly as profit. The $31 billion refers to the total value of assets that flowed into ETFs and were subsequently placed under Coinbase’s custody. Coinbase earns custody fees based on the assets under management (AUM), so this inflow significantly increases its fee-generating AUM. Q4: Are there risks associated with one company holding such a large share of ETF assets? A4: Some analysts point to concentration risk, where a technical or operational issue at a single custodian could impact many ETFs simultaneously. However, proponents argue that a large, regulated custodian like Coinbase can implement more rigorous and scalable security measures than a fragmented group of smaller providers. Q5: How does this custody role differ from Coinbase’s exchange business? A5: The exchange business facilitates buying and selling cryptocurrencies for customers. The custody business is purely about secure storage. They are separate divisions with different operational and security protocols, though both fall under the Coinbase corporate umbrella.

Consequently, regional central banks now face complex challenges as they navigate between domestic inflation targets and external financial stability concerns. This policy fragmentation fundamentally alters capital flows and exchange rate dynamics across the Asia-Pacific region. Asian Currencies Confront a Fractured Global Policy Landscape Monetary policy paths among major economies have diverged sharply in early 2025. The Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts despite easing inflation, while the European Central Bank progresses with its normalization cycle. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan cautiously tightens its ultra-loose yield curve control framework. This triad of differing approaches exerts simultaneous and often contradictory pressures on Asian financial markets. Therefore, analysts at MUFG highlight that regional currencies no longer move in unison but respond uniquely to these crosscurrents based on individual economic fundamentals and policy credibility. For instance, higher-for-longer U.S. rates traditionally strengthen the dollar and pressure emerging market currencies. However, the current environment presents a more nuanced picture. Some Asian economies with robust external balances and hawkish central banks demonstrate surprising resilience. Conversely, nations with higher debt burdens or current account deficits face amplified volatility. This selective pressure underscores the growing importance of domestic policy frameworks in determining currency outcomes. The Mechanics of Policy Transmission to Regional FX Markets Policy divergence influences Asian currencies through three primary channels: interest rate differentials, risk sentiment, and trade competitiveness. First, widening rate gaps directly impact capital allocation decisions by global investors. Second, shifting global risk appetite, often driven by U.S. monetary policy expectations, affects inflows into Asian assets. Third, exchange rate movements alter export dynamics, a critical factor for many trade-dependent Asian economies. MUFG’s research indicates that the relative strength of each channel varies significantly across the region. Central Bank Responses and Strategic Dilemmas Asian monetary authorities actively manage these external shocks. Their policy toolkits include direct foreign exchange intervention, adjustments to policy rates, and macroprudential measures. The Bank of Korea, for example, has recently signaled a data-dependent pause, balancing growth concerns against currency stability. Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore continues its managed float regime, allowing the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate to appreciate gradually to combat imported inflation. These actions reflect a sophisticated understanding of the trilemma in international finance: the impossible trinity of fixed exchange rates, free capital movement, and independent monetary policy. The following table illustrates recent policy stances and currency performance for key Asian economies: Economy Central Bank Stance (Q1 2025) Key FX Pressure YTD Currency Change vs USD* Japan Gradual policy normalization Yield differentials, intervention thresholds +2.1% South Korea Hawkish pause Export competitiveness, household debt -1.5% Singapore Modest S$NEER appreciation Imported inflation management +0.8% India Focus on disinflation Oil import bill, portfolio flows -0.9% Indonesia Stability-focused intervention Commodity prices, bond market inflows +0.3% *Illustrative data based on recent market trends. Historical Context and the Evolution of Asian FX Resilience Today’s policy divergence evokes memories of the 2013 “Taper Tantrum” and the 2018 Fed hiking cycle. However, regional defenses have strengthened considerably since then. Most Asian nations now possess: Substantially larger foreign exchange reserves to buffer against speculative flows. More flexible exchange rate regimes that act as automatic shock absorbers. Deeper local currency bond markets reducing foreign currency borrowing risks. Improved current account positions in major economies like Thailand and the Philippines. This enhanced resilience allows central banks to focus more on domestic objectives rather than purely defending a currency peg. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities persist, particularly in economies with less developed financial markets or higher corporate external debt. MUFG analysts caution that while the region is better insulated, it is not immune to sustained dollar strength or a sudden global risk-off episode. Future Trajectories and Key Risk Factors for 2025 The outlook for Asian currencies remains tightly coupled to the resolution of global policy divergence. A key determinant will be the timing and pace of the Fed’s eventual pivot. A delayed easing cycle could prolong pressure on funding-sensitive currencies. Alternatively, a synchronized global slowdown could see defensive flows into traditionally stable Asian units like the Singapore dollar and Taiwanese dollar. Furthermore, geopolitical developments and commodity price swings, especially for energy and food, will introduce additional volatility. Market participants should monitor several indicators closely: U.S. inflation and labor market data for Fed policy signals. China’s economic recovery pace and policy support measures. Asian inflation prints and central bank meeting minutes. Regional export growth and manufacturing PMI figures. Conclusion In conclusion, the trajectory of Asian currencies in 2025 is fundamentally shaped by global monetary policy divergence. While the region exhibits greater structural resilience than in past cycles, navigating these crosscurrents requires careful calibration by policymakers. The analysis from MUFG underscores that currencies with strong fundamentals, credible policy frameworks, and healthy external balances are best positioned to withstand volatility. Ultimately, the era of synchronized global easing has ended, ushering in a more complex phase where domestic economic management and strategic foreign exchange policy will dictate the winners and losers in the Asian FX landscape. FAQs Q1: What is monetary policy divergence? A1: Monetary policy divergence refers to a situation where major central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan, pursue different interest rate paths or policy stances. This creates varying yields and investment attractiveness across economies, driving capital flows and currency movements. Q2: Why does U.S. monetary policy particularly affect Asian currencies? A2: The U.S. dollar is the world’s primary reserve and trade currency. Changes in U.S. interest rates directly impact global dollar liquidity, risk appetite, and the relative return on holding Asian assets. Many Asian economies also have significant trade and financial linkages with the U.S., making their currencies sensitive to dollar strength. Q3: How do Asian central banks typically respond to currency volatility? A3: Responses can include direct intervention in foreign exchange markets (buying or selling their own currency), adjusting domestic policy interest rates, using verbal guidance to manage market expectations, and implementing macroprudential measures to control speculative capital flows. Q4: Which Asian currencies are considered most resilient to external shocks? A4: Currencies of economies with strong external positions—such as large foreign exchange reserves, consistent current account surpluses, and low external debt—tend to be more resilient. Historically, the Singapore dollar, Taiwanese dollar, and, to an extent, the Japanese yen have shown defensive characteristics during periods of global stress. Q5: What does “policy credibility” mean for a central bank in this context? A5: Policy credibility refers to the market’s trust that a central bank will act consistently and effectively to achieve its stated goals, such as price stability. A credible central bank can manage inflation expectations, which reduces volatility and can allow for more policy flexibility without triggering destabilizing currency moves.

58257069,665807,1771632026,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/58257069.jpeg,Every Ethereum Whale Cohort Now Underwater: ETH Capitulation Marking The Final Bottom?,https://bitcoinist.com/every-ethereum-whale-underwater-eth-capitulation/,"Ethereum continues to struggle below the $2,000 level as persistent selling pressure and elevated uncertainty weigh on broader crypto market sentiment. Despite occasional rebound attempts, price action remains fragile, with volatility still elevated after months of corrective momentum. The inability to decisively reclaim this psychological threshold has reinforced caution among traders, particularly as liquidity conditions tighten and macro uncertainty continues to influence risk appetite across digital assets. Recent analysis from Darkfost adds further context to the current market structure. According to the data, the ongoing correction is now affecting all investor cohorts, including Ethereum’s largest holders. Notably, the unrealized profit ratio for whale groups has shifted into negative territory across the board. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH show an unrealized profit ratio of approximately -0.21, while those with 10,000 to 100,000 ETH stand near -0.18. Even the largest cohort — addresses holding more than 100,000 ETH — has slipped into negative territory around -0.08. This development is notable because Ethereum has not yet revisited its April lows, suggesting the depth of unrealized losses is expanding earlier than in some previous corrective phases . Such conditions can increase market sensitivity, as even traditionally resilient holders may reassess positioning amid prolonged volatility. Whale Stress Raises Capitulation Risk While Bottom Formation Signals Emerge Darkfost further notes that if Ethereum extends its decline, large holders could face increasing financial pressure. Sustained downside would deepen unrealized losses across whale cohorts, potentially forcing some participants to reduce exposure or liquidate portions of their holdings. Historically, such capitulation events among large investors tend to amplify short-term volatility, particularly when liquidity conditions are already fragile. However, despite the negative profit ratios now visible across whale groups, Ethereum has so far managed to stabilize above recent local support zones. This relative resilience suggests that, while sentiment remains cautious, immediate large-scale distribution from whales has not yet materialized. The distinction is important because unrealized losses alone do not necessarily trigger selling unless accompanied by liquidity stress, leverage pressure, or broader market shocks. Periods in which major holders experience stress have often coincided with medium-term bottom formation phases in previous cycles. As weaker hands exit and leverage unwinds, markets sometimes transition into accumulation regimes characterized by lower volatility and gradual stabilization. Still, this interpretation should be approached cautiously. Whale positioning is only one element of market structure, and confirmation typically requires improving liquidity, stronger spot demand, and supportive macro conditions before a sustained recovery can take hold. Ethereum Price Structure Remains Fragile Below Key Averages Ethereum continues to trade under clear technical pressure, with the weekly chart showing a sustained inability to reclaim the $2,000 region decisively. Following the sharp rejection from the 2025 highs near the $4,800 zone, price action has transitioned into a sequence of lower highs and weakening rebounds, typically associated with corrective market phases rather than accumulation-led recoveries. Technically, ETH is currently positioned below several major moving averages that previously acted as dynamic support. These levels now function as resistance, limiting upside attempts unless a strong reclaim occurs with expanding volume. The recent decline toward the $1,900 area reflects persistent selling pressure, while repeated failures near the mid-$2,000 range reinforce cautious market sentiment. Volume activity has moderated compared with the impulsive rally phase, suggesting reduced speculative participation. While declining volume during corrections can sometimes signal seller exhaustion, confirmation of stabilization usually requires sustained buying interest rather than temporary rebounds. From a structural perspective, immediate support appears concentrated near the recent local lows around the $1,800 region, while resistance remains clustered between roughly $2,200 and $2,600. Until Ethereum reclaims these levels convincingly, the broader technical outlook remains vulnerable, with consolidation or further downside still plausible.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-open-interest-surges-heres-the-implication/,"Shiba Inu has seen a notable increase in derivatives activity over the past 24 hours, signaling growing speculative interest in the asset. However, spot traders remain cautious, contributing to continued pressure on the token’s price. Data from CoinGlass indicates that open interest in Shiba Inu futures has risen by 8% in the last day, reaching $75.6 million. This growth in open interest suggests that more traders are taking positions in anticipation of significant price movements. Despite this heightened activity in the derivatives market, many token holders remain uncertain about Shiba Inu’s short-term trajectory , which has led to continued inflows into cryptocurrency exchanges. Market Activity and Trading Volume Shiba Inu’s price has increased modestly in the past 24 hours, following the broader pattern set by Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. The recovery is mild, and the token remains below previous levels after experiencing a double-digit correction over the last month and notable bearish signals . The rise in derivatives interest coincides with a surge in trading volume, reflecting higher market participation. Shiba Inu’s trading activity has increased over the past 24 hours. CoinGlass shows volume rising 16% to $109.23 million, while CoinMarketCap reports a 20% jump, bringing total activity to $129.8 billion. Futures trading is also picking up, with $9.5 million in contracts entering the market compared with $8.43 million leaving, which helps explain the recent rise in open interest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Spot Market Skepticism Despite the positive signals in the derivatives market, spot traders continue to demonstrate caution. Data reveals that $7.78 million worth of Shiba Inu has flowed into exchanges in the last 24 hours, while $7.35 million has moved out. Despite bullish predictions , these flows suggest that holders are positioning themselves for potential sell-offs, adding pressure to the token. The trend remains consistent over the 3 and 5-day periods, indicating a persistent cautious sentiment among spot traders. This cautious stance highlights the contrast between the optimism in derivatives markets and the conservative approach of spot holders . The activity in both futures and spot markets is likely shaping Shiba Inu’s short-term price movement. The data shows that active market participants are buying at current prices, which has helped support the token’s small recovery. SHIB is currently trading around $0.000006. Capturing $0.0000067 would be an important step toward a possible rebound to $0.0000099 and $0.0000148. Whether Shiba Inu can keep going up will depend on how active both spot and futures markets are. The derivatives market shows renewed trader interest, but caution among spot holders is still noticeable. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This dual evolution represents a significant shift in digital entrepreneurship and global technology leadership. The creator economy’s pivot toward diversified revenue streams coincides with India’s strategic push to become an AI superpower, creating parallel narratives of innovation and economic transformation. The Creator Economy’s Ad Revenue Challenge Digital creators face mounting pressure from platform algorithm changes, advertising market volatility, and audience saturation. Consequently, reliance on platform ad revenue alone has become unsustainable for serious content businesses. Major platforms like YouTube and Instagram continue to adjust their revenue-sharing models, often reducing creator payouts while increasing platform profits. This economic reality forces creators to develop alternative income sources beyond traditional advertising partnerships. Platform revenue instability has accelerated business model innovation across the creator landscape. Many successful creators now generate less than 30% of their total income from platform advertising. This percentage continues to decline as they build more sustainable business structures. The transition represents a maturation of the creator economy from hobbyist content production to professional business management. MrBeast’s Business Empire Evolution Jimmy Donaldson, known professionally as MrBeast, exemplifies this strategic shift. His company recently acquired fintech startup Step, demonstrating vertical integration beyond content creation. More significantly, his Feastables chocolate business now reportedly generates more revenue than his entire media operation. This development signals a fundamental rethinking of creator business models where content serves as customer acquisition rather than the primary revenue source. The Feastables case study reveals several important trends. First, successful creators leverage their audience trust to enter traditional consumer goods markets. Second, these ventures often achieve profitability faster than content businesses due to clearer monetization pathways. Third, product businesses provide more predictable revenue streams compared to the volatility of digital advertising markets. Beyond Advertising: The New Creator Playbook Modern creators employ multiple diversification strategies to build sustainable businesses. These approaches typically combine several revenue streams to create financial stability and growth opportunities. The most successful creators now operate more like traditional entrepreneurs than media personalities. Key diversification strategies include: Product Development: Physical goods, digital products, and software solutions Service Offerings: Consulting, coaching, and agency services Investment Activities: Startup acquisitions and venture capital participation Community Building: Subscription models and membership platforms Intellectual Property: Licensing deals and franchise development This multi-pronged approach reduces dependency on any single platform or revenue source. Creators who successfully implement these strategies typically achieve greater financial stability and business longevity. The transition requires different skill sets than traditional content creation, including business management, product development, and financial planning capabilities. India’s Artificial Intelligence Ambitions Parallel to the creator economy’s evolution, India has positioned itself as a major player in artificial intelligence development. The country combines several strategic advantages including a massive technical talent pool, growing venture capital ecosystem, and supportive government policies. India’s AI strategy focuses on both domestic innovation and global market participation. The Indian government launched the National AI Strategy in 2023, allocating substantial resources to research and development. This initiative targets several key sectors including healthcare, agriculture, education, and smart cities. Indian AI startups attracted over $4 billion in venture funding during 2024, representing a 150% increase from the previous year. India’s AI Development Progress (2023-2024) Metric 2023 2024 Growth AI Startup Funding $1.6B $4.1B 156% AI Research Papers 8,742 12,893 47% AI Professionals 416,000 598,000 44% Government Investment $940M $1.8B 91% Strategic Advantages and Challenges India possesses unique advantages in AI development including demographic diversity, which provides varied training data, and English language proficiency, facilitating global collaboration. The country’s extensive digital infrastructure, particularly the India Stack digital public goods, creates fertile ground for AI implementation. However, challenges remain including data privacy concerns, infrastructure limitations in rural areas, and international competition for talent. Indian AI companies increasingly focus on solving local problems with global applications. Healthcare diagnostics, agricultural optimization, and language translation represent particularly strong areas of innovation. These solutions often prove relevant to other developing markets, creating export opportunities for Indian AI technology. Converging Trends: Creators and AI Development The creator economy’s business diversification and India’s AI advancement share several common themes. Both represent responses to changing economic realities and technological opportunities. Each demonstrates how digital platforms enable new forms of entrepreneurship and innovation. AI tools increasingly support creator businesses through content optimization, audience analysis, and operational automation. Meanwhile, successful creators provide use cases and market validation for AI applications in content creation and audience engagement. This symbiotic relationship accelerates innovation in both domains. Indian creators particularly benefit from the country’s AI development. Local AI tools designed for Indian languages and cultural contexts help creators reach broader audiences. Additionally, AI-powered business management tools help creators optimize their diversified revenue streams more effectively. Global Implications and Future Outlook The creator economy’s shift toward diversified business models has significant implications for digital platforms, traditional businesses, and economic policy. Platforms must adapt to creators who view them as customer acquisition channels rather than primary revenue sources. Traditional businesses face new competition from creator-led brands that benefit from built-in audience trust and engagement. India’s AI ambitions could reshape global technology leadership patterns. The country’s scale and innovation capacity position it to influence AI development standards and applications. Successful Indian AI implementation in diverse sectors could provide models for other developing economies. Looking toward 2025, several trends appear likely to continue. Creator businesses will become increasingly sophisticated, often resembling traditional corporations in structure and operation. India will probably accelerate its AI development, potentially challenging established technology leaders in specific applications and markets. Conclusion The creator economy’s evolution beyond advertising dependency and India’s artificial intelligence ambitions represent two significant transformations in the global digital landscape. Creators building diversified business empires demonstrate the maturation of digital entrepreneurship, while India’s strategic AI push highlights shifting technology leadership patterns. These parallel developments reflect broader trends toward business model innovation and technological sovereignty in the digital age. The creator economy’s business diversification provides a roadmap for sustainable digital entrepreneurship, while India’s AI development offers insights into emerging technology power dynamics.

Platform algorithm changes, advertising market volatility, and audience saturation have reduced the reliability and growth potential of advertising income. Additionally, platforms frequently adjust revenue-sharing terms, often to the disadvantage of creators. Q2: What are the most successful diversification strategies for creators? Product development, service offerings, investment activities, community building through subscriptions, and intellectual property licensing represent the most effective diversification approaches. Successful creators typically combine multiple strategies. Q3: How does India’s AI strategy differ from other countries? India focuses on solving local problems with global applications, leverages its demographic diversity for training data, and builds upon existing digital infrastructure like India Stack. The strategy emphasizes practical implementation across sectors like healthcare and agriculture. Q4: What challenges does India face in AI development? Key challenges include data privacy concerns, infrastructure limitations in rural areas, international competition for technical talent, and the need for substantial continued investment in research and development. Q5: How might AI tools specifically help creator businesses? AI can optimize content creation, analyze audience behavior, automate business operations, personalize customer interactions, and identify new revenue opportunities. These tools help creators manage increasingly complex business operations more efficiently.

This figure, calculated by data provider Alternative.me, represents a landscape of extreme fear, having inched up only a single point from the previous day’s reading. The index serves as a crucial barometer for investor psychology, oscillating between 0, which signifies maximum fear, and 100, which indicates extreme greed. Consequently, a reading of 8 places current sentiment firmly at the bearish extreme of the spectrum, reflecting deep-seated anxiety among market participants. This persistent negativity follows a period of significant volatility and regulatory scrutiny, shaping the investment climate for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major digital assets. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Mechanics and Current Breakdown Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index requires a detailed look at its composite methodology. The index does not rely on a single data point. Instead, it synthesizes multiple market and social signals into a cohesive score. This multi-factor approach aims to provide a more nuanced view than price action alone. The current weightings for the index are volatility (25%), market momentum and volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), survey data (15%), Bitcoin’s dominance over the total crypto market cap (10%), and Google Trends search volume for cryptocurrency terms (10%). Each component feeds into the algorithm that produces the final score. For instance, high volatility typically correlates with fear, as rapid price swings create uncertainty. Similarly, a surge in social media mentions often accompanies market panic or euphoria. The index’s rise to 8 from 7, while minor, suggests a potential stabilization in one or more of these underlying metrics, though not enough to shift the overall categorization. Analysts often scrutinize these sub-components to identify which specific factor is driving sentiment. Currently, the extreme fear reading suggests that across all six metrics, the data points overwhelmingly toward risk aversion and negative outlooks among traders and investors worldwide. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis of Market Sentiment To fully grasp the significance of an “Extreme Fear” reading of 8, one must examine historical precedents. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has existed since 2018, capturing several major market cycles. Periods of extreme fear have consistently coincided with significant market bottoms or periods of intense stress. For example, during the market capitulation in late 2022, the index repeatedly touched single-digit figures, mirroring the current environment. Conversely, during the bull market peaks of late 2021, the index frequently entered the “Extreme Greed” zone, often scoring above 90. The table below illustrates key historical readings and their market context: Index Score Sentiment Approximate Period Market Context 95 Extreme Greed Q4 2021 Bitcoin near all-time high above $65,000 10 Extreme Fear Q2 2022 Terra/LUNA collapse and broad deleveraging 8 Extreme Fear March 2025 Current reading amid macro uncertainty This historical lens reveals that while extreme fear is painful for holders, it has often presented long-term buying opportunities for contrarian investors. However, it also signals high risk and potential for further downside, as negative sentiment can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The persistence of this fear, rather than a brief spike, is what analysts find particularly noteworthy in the current climate, indicating that the market has not found a convincing floor. Expert Insights on Prolonged Negative Sentiment Market strategists and behavioral finance experts often analyze sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index to gauge crowd psychology. Dr. Anya Petrova, a financial psychologist at the Global Digital Asset Research Institute, notes, “Prolonged periods in ‘Extreme Fear’ territory, such as the current streak, typically reflect more than just price drops. They indicate a fundamental crisis of confidence. Investors are not just reacting to charts; they are processing macroeconomic headlines, regulatory developments, and technological narratives. The index captures this aggregate emotional state, which can often diverge from underlying on-chain fundamentals.” Furthermore, the index’s incorporation of social media data is critical. A high volume of fearful or negative mentions can amplify anxiety, creating a feedback loop. Trading volume and volatility, the two largest components of the index, have likely been elevated due to reactive selling and a lack of consistent buy-side pressure. This environment makes sustained rallies difficult, as any price increase is quickly met with selling from relieved investors looking to exit positions. The current reading suggests the market is in a classic phase of capitulation, where weak hands are being shaken out, a process that often precedes a sentiment shift, though its timing is never certain. Impact on Bitcoin, Altcoins, and Broader Market Dynamics The extreme fear sentiment permeates all segments of the cryptocurrency market, but its impact varies. Bitcoin, as the largest asset by market capitalization, often serves as a sentiment anchor. Its price action heavily influences the index, particularly through the volatility and dominance metrics. When Bitcoin dominance rises in a fear environment, it often signals a “flight to quality” within crypto, where investors sell riskier altcoins to hold the more established Bitcoin. This dynamic can be observed in current market structures, where altcoin losses have frequently outpaced Bitcoin’s declines. Key market impacts of sustained extreme fear include: Reduced Liquidity: Trading may become more concentrated, with larger spreads between buy and sell orders. Heightened Sensitivity to News: Markets can overreact to negative headlines and underreact to positive developments. Stalled Innovation Funding: Venture capital for new blockchain projects may slow, affecting ecosystem growth. Opportunistic Accumulation: Large, long-term focused entities often use these periods to accumulate assets at lower prices. For retail investors, this environment demands heightened risk management. The extreme fear reading is a clear signal of high market stress. It underscores the importance of position sizing, avoiding excessive leverage, and focusing on fundamental research rather than emotional reactions. While sentiment indicators are not timing tools, they provide essential context for understanding the market’s psychological state, which is a powerful driver of short- to medium-term price action. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 8 is a stark quantitative representation of the extreme fear dominating cryptocurrency markets in early 2025. This sentiment, derived from volatility, volume, social data, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and search trends, highlights a period of significant investor anxiety and risk aversion. Historically, such depths of pessimism have marked challenging phases but have also preceded major sentiment reversals. For market participants, this index serves not as a crystal ball but as a vital gauge of crowd psychology. It reminds investors that markets are cyclical and that understanding sentiment is as crucial as analyzing charts and fundamentals. The path out of extreme fear will likely require a catalyst—whether in the form of clarifying regulation, positive macroeconomic shifts, or renewed institutional adoption—to restore confidence and shift the needle toward a more balanced or greedy market psyche. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 8 mean? A score of 8 falls into the “Extreme Fear” category. It indicates that current market data and social sentiment overwhelmingly reflect panic, anxiety, and risk aversion among cryptocurrency investors, based on factors like volatility, trading volume, and social media buzz. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and maintained by the data website Alternative.me. It is updated daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment using an automated algorithm that processes its six core data components. Q3: Is extreme fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? From a contrarian investment perspective, extreme fear has historically coincided with market lows, presenting potential long-term buying opportunities. However, it is not a timing signal. Extreme fear can persist, and prices can fall further. Any investment decision should be based on thorough research and personal risk tolerance, not sentiment alone. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s price affect the Fear & Greed Index? Bitcoin’s price influences several index components directly, especially volatility (25% weight) and market volume (25% weight). Sharp Bitcoin drops increase volatility and often volume, pushing the score lower toward fear. Bitcoin’s market dominance (10% weight) also plays a role, indicating whether capital is flowing into or out of the leading asset. Q5: Can the Fear & Greed Index predict future price movements? The index is a descriptive tool for current sentiment, not a predictive model. While sustained extreme fear often precedes market recoveries, and extreme greed often precedes corrections, the index does not forecast the timing or magnitude of these moves. It is best used as one of many tools for understanding market context.

This strategic framework emerges as China navigates complex economic transitions and global financial uncertainties. PBOC’s Monetary Policy Framework in 2025 The People’s Bank of China continues to refine its monetary policy toolkit, emphasizing precision and gradualism. Unlike traditional broad-based easing, structural tools target specific economic sectors and vulnerabilities. Consequently, the central bank maintains greater control over liquidity distribution. This approach reflects lessons from previous economic cycles and evolving global monetary conditions. Structural easing instruments include several specialized mechanisms: Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) : Provides medium-term liquidity to financial institutions Targeted Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) Cuts : Sector-specific liquidity injections Relending Programs : Directed credit toward priority sectors like green energy and technology Standing Lending Facility (SLF) : Short-term liquidity support for temporary needs DBS Analysis of China’s Monetary Strategy DBS economists highlight the PBOC’s multi-layered approach to monetary management. Their research indicates the central bank prioritizes financial stability over aggressive stimulus. Therefore, policy adjustments occur incrementally rather than through dramatic shifts. This methodology helps prevent asset bubbles while supporting genuine economic needs. The cautious stance stems from several considerations: Consideration Impact on Policy Debt Sustainability Limits broad stimulus to control leverage ratios Currency Stability Maintains renminbi equilibrium against major currencies Inflation Management Prevents consumer price volatility through measured liquidity Financial System Health Strengthens banking sector resilience through targeted support Expert Perspectives on Structural Tools Financial analysts emphasize the sophistication of China’s current monetary approach. Structural tools allow the PBOC to address specific economic pain points without flooding the entire system with liquidity. For instance, targeted RRR cuts for small banks directly support micro and small enterprises. Similarly, green relending programs accelerate China’s energy transition without overheating traditional sectors. Historical context reveals this evolution. Following the 2008 global financial crisis, China employed massive stimulus measures. However, subsequent debt accumulation necessitated more refined approaches. Today’s structural tools represent a maturation of China’s monetary policy framework. They demonstrate increased confidence in market mechanisms alongside strategic state guidance. Economic Impacts and Market Implications The PBOC’s cautious structural easing generates significant economic effects. First, it supports employment in strategic sectors without triggering widespread inflation. Second, it maintains interest rate differentials that influence capital flows. Third, it provides stability during global financial volatility. Market participants particularly note the predictability this approach creates for long-term investment decisions. Several key indicators reflect this policy’s effectiveness: Stable interbank lending rates within target corridors Controlled growth in aggregate financing to the real economy Gradual improvement in credit allocation efficiency Reduced volatility in bond and equity markets Global Context and Comparative Analysis China’s monetary strategy contrasts with approaches in other major economies. While some central banks pursue rapid rate adjustments, the PBOC emphasizes stability and gradualism. This divergence reflects China’s unique economic structure and development stage. Furthermore, the renminbi’s managed float requires careful liquidity management to maintain exchange rate stability. International observers monitor several transmission channels. Cross-border capital flows respond to China’s interest rate differentials. Trade financing conditions affect global supply chains. Additionally, commodity prices react to China’s demand signals. Therefore, the PBOC’s cautious structural easing influences global economic conditions beyond China’s borders. Future Policy Trajectory and Considerations Looking forward, several factors will shape PBOC policy evolution. Demographic shifts, technological transformation, and climate objectives create new monetary policy challenges. Consequently, the central bank will likely develop more specialized structural tools. Digital currency integration and green finance initiatives represent particularly promising directions. DBS analysts anticipate continued refinement rather than radical change. The PBOC will probably introduce sector-specific refinancing facilities and expand targeted lending programs. However, the overarching cautious stance will persist. This continuity provides stability for economic actors navigating complex transitions. Conclusion The PBOC’s cautious monetary policy framework, utilizing structural easing tools, represents a sophisticated approach to contemporary economic challenges. DBS analysis highlights how targeted liquidity measures support specific sectors while maintaining overall financial stability. This balanced strategy helps China navigate global uncertainties and domestic transitions. As economic conditions evolve, the PBOC’s structural tools will likely adapt while preserving their cautious, measured character. FAQs Q1: What are structural easing tools in monetary policy? Structural easing tools are targeted monetary instruments that provide liquidity to specific economic sectors or address particular vulnerabilities, unlike broad-based measures that affect the entire economy simultaneously. Q2: Why is the PBOC taking a cautious approach to monetary policy? The PBOC exercises caution to maintain financial stability, control debt levels, manage inflation expectations, and preserve currency stability amid complex domestic and global economic conditions. Q3: How do structural easing tools differ from quantitative easing? Structural tools target specific sectors with precision, while quantitative easing involves large-scale asset purchases that increase money supply broadly across financial markets. Q4: What economic sectors benefit most from PBOC’s structural easing? Priority sectors include small and medium enterprises, green energy projects, technological innovation initiatives, and rural development programs that receive targeted credit support. Q5: How does DBS analyze central bank policies like the PBOC’s approach? DBS economists employ comprehensive frameworks examining liquidity conditions, transmission mechanisms, economic indicators, and comparative international analysis to assess central bank strategies and their implications.

Around $287 in 2015, and near $4,100 in early 2019, and again around $15,000 in late 2022, risk measures and mood were at their worst before money flowed back in. Based on reports from on-chain analysts, those moments shared common traits: many traders had capitulated, volume was thin, and volatility spiked. Yet those conditions later coincided with multi-month rallies that erased large parts of the prior losses. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin’s price has been sensitive to headlines lately. It slid under psychological levels as risk assets weakened, and trading has been muted. Markets reacted to diplomatic rows and conflict-related stories, causing bigger moves in thin markets. Sometimes BTC held up and brushed off sharp risk-off flows. Other times it fell further, especially when liquidity dried up. That stop-and-start behavior has left short-term traders cautious, while longer-term holders watch for signs that selling momentum is fading. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Record Red Month May Be Setting Up A Reversal: Analysts Clear Coast Ahead? Based on reports and the data, this signal is not a magic ticket. External forces — such as tightening liquidity or a macro shock — can keep downward pressure longer than statistical patterns alone would predict. The recent 50% fall from an all-time high near $126,200 in October 2025 to about $65,700 shows much of the move is already behind us, but it does not rule out more pain. Risk management matters. Position sizing and clear entry plans will help anyone who decides to act around these levels.

This move, reported by the analytics platform Lookonchain, forms part of a broader weekly accumulation pattern totaling over $123 million. Consequently, this activity provides a clear window into institutional-grade cryptocurrency strategy and market sentiment. Analyzing the Bitmine ETH Accumulation Pattern On-chain data reveals a coordinated acquisition strategy. According to Lookonchain’s analysis, three addresses linked to Bitmine have collectively purchased 62,722 ETH this week. Therefore, the recent $34.7 million withdrawal represents a continuation of this aggressive buying trend. Withdrawals from centralized exchanges like Kraken are a critical on-chain metric. Analysts typically interpret such movements as a shift from liquid trading assets to long-term storage solutions. This action strongly suggests an intention to hold, or ‘HODL,’ rather than engage in short-term trading. Furthermore, this pattern aligns with observed behaviors of large-scale investors, often called ‘whales.’ These entities frequently move assets off exchanges to mitigate counterparty risk and signal conviction in an asset’s future value. The scale of this Bitmine ETH accumulation places it among notable market movements for the current quarter, potentially influencing trader psychology and market structure. The Broader Context of Ethereum and Exchange Flows To understand the impact, one must examine exchange flow metrics. Exchange net flows measure the difference between deposits and withdrawals. Sustained negative net flow, where withdrawals outpace deposits, often indicates rising holder confidence and a potential reduction in immediate selling pressure. Bitmine’s action contributes directly to this metric for Kraken and the broader Ethereum network. For comparison, here is a simplified view of large ETH movements this week: Entity / Label ETH Withdrawn Approx. Value (USD) From Exchange Bitmine (Address Set 1) 17,722 ETH $34.74M Kraken Bitmine (Total Week) 62,722 ETH $123M Multiple Other Known Whale ~9,500 ETH $18.6M Binance This data, sourced from public blockchain explorers and aggregated by firms like Lookonchain and Glassnode, provides transparency. It allows the market to gauge institutional behavior. Moreover, Ethereum’s ongoing network upgrades, like the transition to proof-of-stake, continue to influence long-term investment theses for major holders. Expert Interpretation of Holding Signals Market analysts emphasize the importance of context. A single withdrawal can be an operational move. However, a repeated pattern of accumulation across linked addresses, as seen with Bitmine, builds a stronger narrative. “Consistent exchange outflow from identified entities is one of the clearest on-chain signals for accumulation,” notes a report from CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics firm. This behavior often precedes periods of reduced supply liquidity on exchanges, which can amplify price movements if demand increases. Additionally, the timing is noteworthy. These accumulations occur within a specific macroeconomic and regulatory landscape. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing asset custody and the inherent risks of leaving digital assets on exchanges. Therefore, movements to private wallets reflect both strategic positioning and evolving best practices for security in digital asset management. Implications for Market Sentiment and Structure The Bitmine ETH accumulation has several potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. First, it reduces the immediately sellable supply of ETH on the Kraken exchange. Second, it may encourage other investors to adopt a similar holding strategy, creating a network effect. Third, large-scale holdings can increase market stability by reducing the volume of tokens available for panic selling during downturns. Key potential impacts include: Supply Shock Precursor: Sustained withdrawals can lead to a supply shock if retail and institutional demand rises concurrently. Price Support: Large holdings in cold storage act as a form of price support, as these tokens are not actively sold. Sentiment Indicator: The market often views such moves bullishly, interpreting them as ‘smart money’ betting on future appreciation. However, analysts caution against over-interpreting a single data point. A comprehensive view requires monitoring subsequent wallet activity. For instance, if the withdrawn ETH is later moved to a lending protocol or decentralized exchange, the initial ‘holding’ signal changes. Continuous on-chain surveillance provides the necessary depth for accurate analysis. Conclusion The reported Bitmine ETH accumulation of $34.7 million from Kraken is a significant on-chain event. It underscores a strategic shift towards long-term holding by a major market participant. When viewed as part of a $123 million weekly acquisition, this move highlights growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s underlying value proposition. Ultimately, such transparent blockchain data offers invaluable insights into market structure, providing all participants with evidence to inform their understanding of cryptocurrency investment trends. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when an entity like Bitmine withdraws ETH from an exchange? A1: Withdrawing cryptocurrency from an exchange to a private wallet typically signals an intention to hold the asset long-term. It reduces immediate selling pressure on the exchange and is often interpreted as a bullish, accumulation-focused move. Q2: How do analysts know the withdrawal is linked to Bitmine? A2: On-chain analysis firms like Lookonchain use heuristic clustering. They track wallet addresses based on transaction patterns, funding sources, and sometimes publicly known information to label addresses. While not 100% certain, these labels are based on probabilistic analysis of blockchain data. Q3: Why is the withdrawal amount of 17,722 ETH significant? A3: The significance lies in its size ($34.7M) and its context as part of a larger pattern. Large withdrawals directly impact exchange liquidity and are closely watched as indicators of ‘whale’ or institutional behavior, which can influence market sentiment. Q4: Could this move be for purposes other than holding, like staking or DeFi? A4: It is possible. The initial withdrawal from an exchange primarily indicates the asset is not intended for immediate spot trading. The ETH could later be deployed in staking contracts or decentralized finance protocols. Continued on-chain monitoring is required to determine its final use. Q5: How does this affect the average Ethereum investor? A5: For average investors, large accumulations can signal broader market sentiment and potential future price trends. They also demonstrate real-world use of blockchain transparency. However, investors should base decisions on comprehensive research, not single transactions.

This measurable drop provides a critical, data-driven snapshot of current market dynamics, indicating a continued period of Bitcoin outperformance relative to the broader altcoin market. Consequently, investors and analysts are closely examining the underlying factors and potential implications of this trend. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Drop The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market cycles. Specifically, CoinMarketCap’s proprietary metric analyzes the performance of the top 100 digital assets by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day window. An official ‘altcoin season’ triggers only when 75% of these assets outperform Bitcoin during that period, corresponding to an index score of 75 or higher. Therefore, the current score of 33, moving further from that threshold, signals a clear and persistent dominance by the flagship cryptocurrency. This metric offers an objective alternative to speculative narratives, grounding market analysis in verifiable, comparative performance data. The Mechanics of Market Sentiment Measurement CoinMarketCap calculates this index using a rigorous, automated methodology. The process involves daily tracking of percentage price changes for each eligible asset against Bitcoin’s performance. Subsequently, the platform aggregates this data to determine what proportion of the altcoin universe is beating Bitcoin’s returns. A score closer to 100 indicates a strong, broad-based altcoin season, while a lower score reflects Bitcoin’s strength. The recent two-point decline, while seemingly small, continues a consolidation trend observed throughout early 2025, following the volatility of the previous year’s post-halving period. Historical data from the platform shows that sustained periods below 50 often correlate with capital rotation into Bitcoin and large-cap assets perceived as safer harbors. Contextualizing the Current Crypto Market Cycle The index’s movement does not occur in a vacuum. It reflects broader macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions influencing investor behavior in 2025. Firstly, increased regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions has often benefited established assets like Bitcoin first. Secondly, institutional investment vehicles continue to show a pronounced preference for Bitcoin-centric products, as evidenced by quarterly fund flow reports from entities like CoinShares. Thirdly, network activity metrics for several major altcoins have plateaued, failing to demonstrate the explosive growth that typically precedes a sustained altcoin season. This combination of factors creates a headwind for broad altcoin outperformance, providing context for the index’s subdued reading. Key characteristics of the current market phase include: Bitcoin Dominance Stability: The Bitcoin Dominance metric (BTC.D) has held above 55% for consecutive weeks. Sector Rotation: Capital flows show rotation within the altcoin sector rather than from Bitcoin into altcoins. Volatility Compression: Realized volatility across major altcoins has decreased relative to Bitcoin’s. Historical Precedents and Analyst Perspectives Reviewing past index behavior provides essential insight. For instance, the last major altcoin season, declared in late 2023, saw the index sustain readings above 75 for nearly 11 weeks. Transition periods where the index fluctuates between 25 and 50, as seen currently, have historically lasted several months. Market analysts from firms like Glassnode and IntoTheBlock often correlate these phases with accumulation periods for select altcoins with strong fundamentals, even as the broader index remains low. Their on-chain analysis suggests that while retail sentiment may be cautious, strategic investors are actively evaluating projects based on development activity and utility, rather than short-term price momentum alone. This divergence between sentiment indicators and on-chain accumulation can signal a potential setup for future market movements. Implications for Investors and the Market Structure The practical implications of a low Altcoin Season Index are multifaceted for different market participants. For long-term investors, it may emphasize a strategy of dollar-cost averaging into fundamentally sound projects during a period of relative underperformance. For traders, it highlights the continued relevance of Bitcoin as the primary market benchmark and risk asset. Furthermore, the index acts as a risk-management tool, warning against overexposure to broad altcoin bets when conditions do not support them. Market structure evolves during these phases, often with derivatives markets showing reduced altcoin leverage and spot markets experiencing lower volumes for small-cap tokens. This environment typically rewards selective, research-driven investment over momentum chasing. Comparative Table: Index Readings and Typical Market Phases Index Range Market Phase Typical Investor Action 75-100 Altcoin Season Broad altcoin accumulation, profit-taking in BTC 50-75 Transition / Warning Sector rotation, increased selectivity 25-50 Bitcoin Dominance BTC and large-cap focus, altcoin research phase 0-25 Strong BTC Rally Heavy capital flow into Bitcoin, altcoin stagnation Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index decline to 33 provides a clear, quantitative signal of the current market structure favoring Bitcoin. This data point, derived from CoinMarketCap’s analysis of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, underscores a period of comparative strength for the market leader amidst a cautious altcoin environment. Understanding this metric allows investors to align their strategies with demonstrable market trends rather than sentiment alone. While the index does not predict immediate price movements, it offers a vital framework for assessing market cycle positioning and risk, reminding participants that cryptocurrency markets move through distinct, measurable phases of dominance and rotation. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 33 mean? An index score of 33 means that only a minority of the top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It indicates Bitcoin is demonstrating stronger relative performance, and the market is not in an ‘altcoin season.’ Q2: Who creates the Altcoin Season Index and how is it calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates the index. It compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance. The score reflects the percentage of those altcoins beating Bitcoin. Q3: Can the index predict future price increases for altcoins? No, the index is a lagging indicator of relative performance, not a predictive tool. It describes what has already happened over the previous quarter. However, sustained low readings can indicate market phases that have historically preceded periods of altcoin accumulation. Q4: Should I sell my altcoins if the index is low? Not necessarily. The index measures broad market trends. Individual altcoins with strong fundamentals can outperform regardless of the overall index reading. It may suggest a more selective, research-driven approach rather than broad selling. Q5: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling window of performance data. This allows for timely tracking of shifts in market sentiment and dominance trends.

This launch, confirmed on Friday, positions the homegrown company directly against international powerhouses like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic in what has rapidly become one of the world’s most critical markets for generative AI adoption. The Indus app serves as the primary interface for Sarvam’s newly announced, massive 105-billion-parameter large language model, marking a significant step in India’s quest for technological sovereignty. Indus AI Chat App Enters a Crowded but Vital Market The debut of the Indus application arrives during a period of explosive growth for AI in India. Global leaders have already identified the subcontinent as a pivotal region. For instance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently revealed that ChatGPT boasts over 100 million weekly active users in India. Similarly, Anthropic reported that India accounts for 5.8% of total usage for its Claude model, ranking second only to the United States. Consequently, Sarvam’s entry represents a deliberate effort to capture a share of this vast, engaged user base with a product built specifically for local linguistic and cultural contexts. Currently available in beta on iOS, Android, and the web, the Indus app allows users to interact through typed or spoken queries. It delivers responses in both text and audio formats. Sign-in options include phone numbers, Google accounts, or Apple IDs. However, access appears geographically restricted to India for the initial rollout phase. The company has cautioned that due to limited computational capacity, some users may encounter a waitlist as Sarvam manages a gradual expansion of access. The Power Behind the Chat: Sarvam’s 105B Parameter Model The launch of the Indus app follows closely on the heels of Sarvam’s major model announcement at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. At this event, the Bengaluru-based startup unveiled two foundational models: the flagship Sarvam 105B and a smaller 30-billion-parameter variant. These models are the core engines powering the Indus chat experience. Significantly, they are architected and trained with a focus on Indian languages and use-case scenarios, a key differentiator from globally-trained models. Sarvam, founded just last year in 2023, has rapidly secured substantial backing to pursue this vision. To date, the startup has raised $41 million from prominent investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Peak XV Partners, and Khosla Ventures. This funding underscores investor confidence in the potential for regionally-tailored AI solutions. The company’s roadmap extends beyond consumer chat, encompassing ambitious enterprise initiatives and hardware collaborations announced at the summit. Strategic Partnerships and Enterprise Ambitions Sarvam’s strategy involves embedding its AI technology into diverse hardware and industry verticals. Notably, the startup has announced partnerships with HMD to integrate AI capabilities into Nokia feature phones, a move aimed at democratizing access for users across the economic spectrum. Furthermore, a collaboration with Bosch seeks to develop AI-enabled applications for the automotive sector. These partnerships illustrate a multifaceted approach to market penetration, combining direct consumer access via the Indus app with deep enterprise and OEM integrations. Navigating Initial Limitations and User Feedback As with many beta launches, the Indus app currently operates with certain constraints that Sarvam acknowledges openly. Users cannot delete individual chat histories without deleting their entire account. Additionally, there is no option to disable the app’s reasoning feature, which the company notes can occasionally slow down response times. Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar addressed these points directly on social media platform X, stating the company is actively seeking user feedback to refine the product during this limited-capacity rollout phase. This transparent communication aligns with broader industry practices for managing user expectations during early access periods. The company’s warning about potential waitlists due to compute constraints also highlights the immense infrastructure demands of running large language models at scale, a challenge faced by even the most well-funded AI firms globally. India’s Push for AI Self-Reliance Sarvam is not operating in a vacuum; it is part of a burgeoning cohort of Indian startups striving to create domestic alternatives to foreign AI platforms. This movement aligns with national interests in gaining greater control over critical digital infrastructure. The development of local AI models is seen as essential for several reasons: Linguistic Relevance: Global models often underperform on India’s diverse array of languages and dialects. Cultural Context: AI needs to understand local nuances, idioms, and societal structures. Data Sovereignty: Building models domestically can address concerns about where training data is processed and stored. Economic Tailoring: Solutions can be optimized for India’s unique economic and business environments. The competitive landscape is therefore not merely commercial but also geopolitical, with India seeking to establish itself as a hub for AI innovation rather than just a consumption market. The Road Ahead for Sarvam and Indus The immediate future for Sarvam will involve scaling its compute infrastructure to meet user demand, iterating on the Indus app based on beta feedback, and executing on its announced partnerships. Success will be measured by user adoption rates, the performance of its models on local tasks compared to global rivals, and its ability to secure further enterprise contracts. The company’s progress will be a key indicator of whether specialized, region-focused AI models can carve out sustainable market positions against the scale and resources of international tech giants. Conclusion The launch of the Indus AI chat app by Sarvam marks a definitive moment in India’s technology landscape. It represents a confident, well-funded challenge to global AI leaders within one of their most important growth markets. By leveraging its 105-billion-parameter model tailored for Indian languages and forging strategic hardware partnerships, Sarvam is pursuing a dual-path strategy of direct consumer engagement and deep industry integration. While the initial beta phase comes with expected limitations, the move signals India’s serious ambition to develop homegrown AI sovereignty. The performance and adoption of the Indus app will be closely watched as a bellwether for the future of localized artificial intelligence platforms worldwide. FAQs Q1: What is the Sarvam Indus AI chat app? The Indus app is a new generative AI chat interface launched by Indian startup Sarvam AI. It provides text and audio responses to user queries and is powered by Sarvam’s own large language models, specifically designed for Indian languages and contexts. Q2: How does Sarvam’s model compare to ChatGPT or Gemini? While global models like ChatGPT are trained on vast, international datasets, Sarvam’s 105B parameter model is specifically optimized for Indian linguistic diversity and cultural nuances. This focus aims to provide more accurate and relevant responses for users in India, though it may have less breadth on global topics. Q3: Is the Indus app available outside of India? Currently, the Indus app appears to be geographically restricted to users within India. The service requires sign-in via an Indian phone number or associated account, and Sarvam’s initial rollout and partnerships are focused on the domestic market. Q4: What are the main limitations of the Indus app in its beta phase? Key limitations include the inability to delete chat history without deleting the entire account, no option to turn off the reasoning feature (which can slow responses), and potential waitlist access due to limited compute capacity as Sarvam scales its infrastructure. Q5: Why is India considered such an important market for AI companies? India has a massive, tech-savvy population with high rates of smartphone adoption and a rapidly digitizing economy. It represents one of the largest potential user bases for AI tools globally, making it a critical battleground for market share between international giants and emerging domestic players like Sarvam.

58259233,665834,1771637409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/58259233.jpeg,Lightning Strikes Big: Bitcoin Layer-2 Surpasses $1 Billion In Monthly Activity,https://bitcoinist.com/lightning-strikes-big-bitcoin-layer-2-surpasses-1-billion-in-monthly-activity/,"A clear sign of more than hobbyist use: monthly Lightning activity climbed past a big mark late last year. According to a report from River, November saw about $1.1 billion flow over the Bitcoin network. That money, according to a report shared by River’s marketing chief Sam Wouters, moved through over 5 million transactions , which shows both volume and movement. It matters because money actually changed hands on Bitcoin’s second layer, not just price bets. Adoption Driven By Bigger Players Reports say many of the biggest gains were not from tiny tips or in-app experiments this time. Exchanges and merchant integrations are carrying a lot of the load. Back in 2023, monthly transactions peaked at 6.6 million as apps tried out micropayments in gaming and chat. Now the shape of use looks different. Average payment sizes appear larger and the profile of users has shifted toward trading desks and businesses. https://t.co/5Kmor1eA1n — Sam Wouters (@SDWouters) February 19, 2026 Institutional Transfers Show Network Muscle A striking example came when Secure Digital Markets routed a million-dollar Lightning Network transfer to Kraken. That move showed big sums can be shifted quickly without waiting for on-chain confirmation. Network capacity, which measures BTC tied up to keep channels open, reached 5,606 BTC in December. That increased liquidity matters for larger deals because it lowers the chance a large payment will fail for lack of routed funds. Bitcoin Price Action And Market Mood Market conditions were mixed as the network grew. Bitcoin slid under key levels this week, and traders grew cautious as geopolitical headlines piled up. Volume in spot markets has been muted at times, yet Lightning traffic rose despite that. Price swings still happen, and low trading days tend to amplify those moves, but the network’s payment activity did not simply mirror price spikes. In short, payments rose while BTC sometimes moved sideways. Why Lightning Is Different The Lightning Network moves payments off the main chain by opening channels between parties. Transactions inside a channel settle almost instantly and at a fraction of the cost of a typical on-chain transfer. Only the channel’s net balance is posted to Bitcoin when it’s closed. That design makes small and frequent payments practical, and it removes the 10-minute wait that can ruin buying something at a store. Reports say Lightning transactions could climb if AI systems begin making automatic micro-payments for data and computing, but that shift still needs better software and clearer business models. For the time being, the network’s growth signals progress toward everyday Bitcoin payments, though broader exchange support, deeper liquidity, and stronger merchant use will decide whether it becomes a common payment rail or stays a niche tool.

The address in question deposited an additional 6,318 BTC, valued at approximately $424.86 million, to the Binance exchange platform, following a previous transfer of 5,000 BTC from the same wallet. This Garrett Jin BTC deposit activity has captured immediate attention across global financial markets, regulatory circles, and cryptocurrency communities, raising questions about market timing, regulatory implications, and broader Bitcoin liquidity trends. Garrett Jin BTC Deposit Analysis and Transaction Details Blockchain investigators identified the transaction through on-chain analysis tools that track large cryptocurrency movements. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit represents approximately 0.03% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, a substantial amount that can influence market dynamics. According to transaction records, the address executed the transfer in a single transaction, paying network fees that reflected current Bitcoin blockchain congestion levels. Furthermore, the timing coincided with specific market conditions that experts have analyzed for potential strategic implications. Market analysts immediately noted several key characteristics of this Garrett Jin BTC deposit. First, the transaction size exceeds typical institutional movements, placing it in the “whale” category that often signals significant market events. Second, the destination—Binance—represents the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, suggesting potential liquidity needs or trading intentions. Third, the sequential nature of the deposits, following the earlier 5,000 BTC transfer, indicates a planned strategy rather than spontaneous action. Historical Context and Bitfinex Connections The suspected connection to Garrett Jin adds substantial historical context to this transaction analysis. Jin co-founded Bitfinex in 2012, which grew to become one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges before facing regulatory challenges in multiple jurisdictions. Industry observers recall that Bitfinex experienced a major security breach in 2016, resulting in the loss of approximately 120,000 BTC, though subsequent recovery efforts returned most funds to users. This background informs current analysis of the Garrett Jin BTC deposit patterns and potential motivations. Cryptocurrency historians note that former exchange founders often maintain substantial cryptocurrency holdings from early industry participation. These individuals typically demonstrate sophisticated understanding of market cycles, regulatory environments, and technical infrastructure. Consequently, their transaction patterns frequently receive disproportionate attention from market participants seeking insights into potential price movements or sector developments. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit activity fits this established pattern of influential early adopters making strategically timed market moves. Market Impact and Liquidity Considerations Financial analysts have examined several immediate effects following the Garrett Jin BTC deposit announcement. Bitcoin’s price showed moderate volatility in subsequent trading sessions, though direct causation remains difficult to establish conclusively. Exchange order books displayed increased selling pressure in the hours following the transaction visibility, with market depth indicators suggesting absorption of approximately 40% of the deposited BTC within the first twelve hours. This absorption rate indicates substantial underlying demand despite the large supply injection. Liquidity metrics provide additional context for understanding the Garrett Jin BTC deposit significance. The table below illustrates key market liquidity indicators before and after the transaction: Metric Pre-Transaction Post-Transaction Binance BTC Bid-Ask Spread $12.50 $18.75 Market Depth (100 BTC) 0.15% 0.22% 24-Hour Exchange Volume $18.2B $21.7B These metrics demonstrate measurable market impact, though within normal volatility ranges for large cryptocurrency transactions. Market makers adjusted their algorithms to accommodate the additional liquidity, with several major trading firms confirming routine operational responses to large deposit events. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit therefore represents a significant but manageable market event rather than a disruptive anomaly. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Framework The current regulatory landscape adds important dimensions to analyzing the Garrett Jin BTC deposit. Since 2023, global cryptocurrency regulations have evolved substantially, with particular emphasis on: Travel Rule compliance requiring exchanges to share sender/receiver information for transactions above certain thresholds Enhanced due diligence for politically exposed persons and former industry executives Transaction monitoring systems that flag unusual patterns for regulatory review Tax reporting requirements that vary by jurisdiction but generally cover large cryptocurrency movements Industry compliance experts note that exchanges like Binance have implemented sophisticated monitoring systems that automatically review large deposits for potential regulatory concerns. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit would trigger multiple review protocols, including source-of-funds verification, anti-money laundering checks, and sanctions screening. These processes typically occur transparently to users while ensuring regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions where Binance operates. Legal analysts emphasize that former exchange founders face particular scrutiny regarding cryptocurrency transactions. Regulatory bodies in major financial centers have increased monitoring of industry insiders following several high-profile enforcement actions. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit therefore occurs within a carefully monitored environment where both the sender and receiving exchange maintain robust compliance programs. This regulatory context distinguishes current cryptocurrency transactions from earlier industry periods with less oversight. Technical Analysis and Blockchain Forensics Blockchain analytics firms employ multiple methodologies to track and analyze transactions like the Garrett Jin BTC deposit. Lookonchain, which initially reported the transaction, utilizes clustering algorithms that group addresses based on behavioral patterns and common ownership indicators. These techniques have evolved significantly since 2020, with current systems achieving approximately 85-90% accuracy in entity identification for well-known cryptocurrency figures. The technical characteristics of this particular transaction reveal several noteworthy elements: The transaction utilized SegWit addresses, optimizing fee efficiency No coin mixing or privacy techniques obscured the transfer path The sending address showed previous activity dating to 2017 Wallet composition included only Bitcoin, with no other cryptocurrency assets These technical details provide forensic analysts with substantial data for understanding transaction patterns and potential future movements. The transparency of Bitcoin’s blockchain enables this level of analysis, distinguishing it from traditional financial systems where similar large transfers might receive less public scrutiny. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit therefore contributes to the growing body of blockchain data that researchers analyze for market intelligence and regulatory insights. Broader Market Implications and Sector Trends The Garrett Jin BTC deposit occurs within specific macroeconomic and sector conditions that inform its interpretation. Bitcoin has demonstrated relative stability through early 2025, with institutional adoption continuing despite regulatory uncertainties. Several parallel developments provide context for understanding this transaction’s significance: First, cryptocurrency exchange reserves have fluctuated throughout 2025, with some analysts noting gradual decreases in exchange BTC balances since January. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit temporarily reverses this trend at Binance specifically, though overall exchange balances remain below 2024 peaks. Second, derivative market positioning showed increased long exposure preceding the deposit, potentially indicating sophisticated traders anticipating volatility events. Third, regulatory developments in multiple jurisdictions have created uncertainty about cryptocurrency treatment, possibly influencing timing decisions for large transactions. Industry observers also note parallel developments in cryptocurrency markets during the same period as the Garrett Jin BTC deposit. Ethereum network activity increased approximately 15% week-over-week, suggesting broader cryptocurrency sector momentum rather than Bitcoin-specific developments. Additionally, several institutional investment firms announced new cryptocurrency products, continuing the trend of traditional finance integration that began accelerating in 2020. These contextual factors help distinguish transaction-specific impacts from broader market movements. Conclusion The Garrett Jin BTC deposit of $425 million to Binance represents a significant cryptocurrency market event with multiple dimensions for analysis. Transaction details reveal careful planning and execution within existing regulatory frameworks, while market impact remains measurable but contained. Historical context connecting the transaction to Bitfinex’s founding adds narrative interest but doesn’t fundamentally alter the economic implications. As cryptocurrency markets mature, large transactions increasingly occur within established compliance systems and predictable market structures. The Garrett Jin BTC deposit ultimately demonstrates this maturation process, where even substantial individual movements integrate smoothly into global cryptocurrency infrastructure while providing valuable data points for analysts, regulators, and market participants monitoring Bitcoin’s evolving role in global finance. FAQs Q1: How do analysts connect this transaction to Garrett Jin specifically? Blockchain analytics firms use address clustering techniques that identify patterns linking multiple addresses to known entities. These methods analyze transaction timing, amount patterns, and historical connections to establish probable ownership with high confidence levels. Q2: What immediate market impact did this deposit create? The transaction increased selling pressure temporarily, with Bitcoin’s price showing moderate volatility. Exchange liquidity absorbed approximately 40% of deposited BTC within twelve hours, indicating substantial underlying market demand despite the large supply injection. Q3: Are such large deposits to exchanges unusual? While individually substantial, large cryptocurrency deposits occur regularly as part of normal market operations. Exchange infrastructure handles such transactions routinely, with established protocols for liquidity management and regulatory compliance. Q4: What regulatory implications might this transaction have? Exchanges automatically review large deposits for compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, sanctions screening, and source-of-funds verification. The transaction would trigger these standard protocols without necessarily indicating regulatory concerns. Q5: How does this affect ordinary cryptocurrency investors? For most investors, such transactions represent background market noise rather than actionable events. Diversified portfolios and long-term strategies typically prove more significant than individual transactions, regardless of size or origin.

58259782,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=916753,1771638192,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/58259782.jpeg,Ethereum’s hard turn signals rising pressure from high-performance rivals,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereums-hard-turn-signals-rising-pressure/,"Ethereum’s recent protocol upgrades suggest more than incremental improvements as high-performance competitors chip away at its dominance. Vitalik Buterin detailed the plan to build what he called a “cypherpunk principled non-ugly Ethereum” — not as a replacement chain, but as a tightly integrated evolution of the existing system. The proposal follows ETH developers formally scheduling Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) for the forthcoming Hegota hard fork (currently targeted for late 2026). And with account abstraction updates and long-term architectural changes, that transition signals a broader recalibration of Ethereum’s roadmap at a time when rivals are catching up. The development comes as BNP Paribas Asset Management taps Ethereum for a new blockchain pilot, this time issuing a tokenised share class of a French‑domiciled money market fund. The tokenized shares, issued onchain using BNP Paribas’ AssetFoundryTM platform, will give gated access via a “permissioned access model on ETH … whereby holdings and transfers are restricted to eligible and authorised participants, in line with applicable regulatory requirements,” according to the announcement. Ethereum targets rival chains with Base-Layer overhaul and ZK integration FOCIL, known as EIP-7805, aims to improve Ethereum’s censorship resistance at the protocol level by forcing validators to include all transactions. The mechanism would allow validator committees to apply fork-choice rules and inclusion lists to force the inclusion of transactions. If the proposed block fails to include legitimate public mempool transactions, the chain can fork, allowing inclusion within a limited number of slots at once. The native account abstraction mechanism is introduced in EIP-8141 and is also in the pipeline for Hegota. Ethereum’s scaling strategy has relied for years on a rollup-first roadmap, driving execution into Layer 2 networks but leaving the base layer relatively lean. But Buterin’s recent rhetoric points to a different emphasis. Instead of relying solely on rollups to improve scalability and ease user experience, Ethereum is turning its attention to improving the architecture of its base layer. Buterin has also advised longer-term structural changes. This includes embedding zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs into Layer 1 validation in a proposed “Beam Chain”. The timing is notable. High-performance Layer 1 chains like Solana have become popular for their high throughput, low fees, and simplified user experience, despite their monolithic architecture. With Ethereum’s growing modularity, these networks handle transaction processing on a single layer, reducing fragmentation. While the blockchain network’s multiple rollup model has improved scalability, it has also made issues more complex — specifically around liquidity, bridging, and user experience. As rival ecosystems seek simplicity and speed, Ethereum seems set to recalibrate. Buterin recently likened those upcoming changes to what he described as a “jet engine changes in-flight” of sorts, referencing the network’s 2022 move to proof-of-stake. He even considered multiple potentially larger transformations of Ethereum (state tree rewrites, leaner consensus, ZK-native validation, virtual machine changes). Base-layer upgrades reinforce security and neutrality Instead of fragmentation through Layer 2s and competing EVM-based chains, Ethereum’s leadership seems set upon recapturing architectural control back at the base layer. The “hard turn” has less to do with delivering throughput and more with upholding the features that the network itself was built around: censorship resistance, neutrality, and cryptographic robustness. The extent to which this recalibration is a defensive move, a stand against its high-performance rivals, or a natural evolution of Ethereum’s roadmap remains open to debate. But what is unambiguous is that Ethereum is no longer willing to rely solely on rollups for its future growth. To that end, as high-speed rivals recalibrate expectations for blockchain performance, Ethereum is betting that hardening its core — while streamlining its long-term architecture — will help position it as the industry’s bedrock settlement layer. The bet may pay off in the next phase, starting with Hegota. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Token payments in this project would be backed up and secured by Ripple Custody, with XRP Ledger facilitating on-chain real estate transactions. News of the project’s progress coincided with a modest price uptick for XRP. According to real-time market data, XRP has been trading around $1.43, posting roughly a 2 % gain over recent sessions. The digital transformation program, known as Prypco Mint, is expected to drive the Dubai Property Regulatory Authority’s ambition to digitize $16 billion in real estate by 2033. To create that incredible experience, the DLD collaborated with the prop-tech firm Prypco, based in Dubai. This move prompted several reporters to reach out to the Land Department for comment. In response to this request, the government entity shared a press release stating that this project will allow investors to purchase fractional ownership of Dubai properties in local currency, starting at 2,000 dirhams (AED), or $540. In the initial phase, the platform will be restricted to United Arab Emirates (UAE) residents with a valid Emirates ID and will only accept transactions in AED. Nonetheless, sources confirmed that the Dubai Real Estate Governing Body made clear its intentions to accelerate international expansion and broaden platform integration soon. Dubai embraces a significant strategic move in its real estate sector Just recently, the Dubai Land Department announced its intention to initiate the second phase of a pilot program focused on real estate tokenization. The Land Department adopted this decision after $5 million in Dubai-based property was successfully tokenized, making around 7.8 million tokens representing fractional ownership in various Dubai properties available for resale. Interestingly, the pilot phase saw properties sell out in under two minutes. It is worth noting that Ctrl Alt, a London-based, regulated technology provider serving as the partner supplying this pilot’s tokenization technology, will issue Asset-Referenced Virtual Asset management tokens to facilitate secondary-market transfers of these tokens. Following this announcement, several analysts shared that Dubai’s property market and crypto-friendly regulations have positioned the city as a global leader. After conducting thorough research, the analysts noted that Ctrl Alt made public the Asset-Referenced Virtual Asset management tokens project just after DarGlobal, a London Stock Exchange-listed international real estate developer, and World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol backed by US President Donald Trump and his sons, revealed plans for the tokenization of a Trump-branded resort, which is under development in the Maldives. Regarding DLD’s first blockchain-based real estate platform, reports highlighted that Zand Digital Bank serves as the venture’s banking partner, while the UAE Central Bank, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), and the Dubai Future Foundation provide oversight. The Dubai Future Foundation will offer these measures using its dedicated PropTech Sandbox, designed to test and scale real estate technologies. In a statement, the Founder and CEO of Ctrl Alt, Matt Ong, pointed out that, “We are excited to build the tokenization infrastructure that allows DLD’s partners to provide fractional real estate opportunities to investors. Dubai’s leadership in adopting advanced financial technologies is truly exceptional, and this project signals great things ahead.” At this moment, sources with knowledge of the situation who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the matter revealed that the Dubai Real Estate Governing Body chose the XRPL for its project due to its unique characteristics: swift transaction speeds, lower fees, and compliance with local regulatory frameworks. Several individuals demonstrated heightened interest in XRPL’s infrastructure Ripple has conscientiously developed the XRPL’s infrastructure, specifically gearing it toward institutional and enterprise use cases. Last year, reports highlighted that the San Francisco-based financial technology company allocated about $10 million into OpenEden as part of a broader move to support tokenized Treasury bills. Afterwards, it pledged $5 million to Abrdn’s Luxembourg-based tokenized fund. In the meantime, analysts discovered that tokenization on XRPL has surged by more than 2,200%, attributing this increase to transparent regulations adopted after the SEC’s crucial decision in August 2025 and to new collaborations, such as Archax and Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road. At this point, several individuals wondered whether the increased adoption of XRP in DeFi would continue this year and whether it could boost the token’s value.

The pitch is simple: turn pay-per-request into a native part of the web stack, no accounts, no API keys, and settlement that happens on-chain. AI Agents Can Now Pay Via XRP Ledger The release plugs XRPL into x402, an open payments standard built around the long-reserved HTTP status code 402 Payment Required. In an x402 flow, a client requests a resource, the server replies with a 402 and machine-readable payment requirements, and the client retries the request with proof of payment. Coinbase’s x402 documentation frames the goal as programmatic access “without accounts, sessions, or complex authentication,” so both humans and autonomous agents can pay for usage-based services directly over HTTP. Related Reading: The 200 Million XRP Exodus: Investors Swap Speculation For Private Custody On X, t54.ai described the facilitator as “now live on the XRPL,” adding that agents can pay with “XRP and RLUSD – no API keys, no accounts, no friction.” Another post positioned x402 as “the open standard for machine-native payments,” where the server responds with HTTP 402 “Payment Required” and the agent pays immediately, with the facilitator handling verification and settlement on-chain. Popular XRP community account BankXRP wrote via X: “t54ai just launched the x402 facilitator AI agents can now pay for API calls and services with frictionless $XRP or $RLUSD micropayments using the HTTP 402 standard. No API keys. No accounts. Instant, sub-cent fees. Real machine-to-machine economy on the fastest, most scalable ledger in crypto.” t54’s XRPL deployment is designed to be “plug and play,” emphasizing no custody and no API keys. The public documentation for the XRPL x402 facilitator says it processes x402 payments on XRPL using payer-signed presigned Payment transaction blobs, and supports XRP plus IOU tokens including RLUSD (and USDC). Resource servers verify and settle by calling standard facilitator endpoints like /verify and /settle, mirroring the core x402 architecture where the facilitator is the chain-aware component that validates payment payloads and executes settlement. Related Reading: This Korean XRP Exchange Data Has The Community Losing It t54.ai also claims the system is already “in production” with BlockRunAI, a unified gateway that provides agents access to “30+ models (GPT, Claude, Grok, etc.).” In that integration, agents pay per request via x402, and the resulting payment volume “is now settling on XRPL,” effectively turning model inference and tool calls into metered on-chain commerce. Why This Is Bullish For XRP The “bullish” framing here isn’t about a single partnership logo, it’s about inserting XRPL into a broader emerging standard for agent-native commerce. x402 is explicitly designed to be network-agnostic, but in practice, standards only become real once developers can ship them with minimal ceremony. A working facilitator on XRPL means one more credible rail for high-frequency, low-value payments where the unit economics break traditional billing. It also cleanly links XRPL’s identity—fast settlement and low fees—to a use case that’s structurally growing: autonomous software paying other software. x402’s ecosystem pages and docs emphasize pay-per-use pricing and minimal integration overhead; that aligns with agent workflows where “thousands of API calls” and tool invocations need granular billing rather than subscriptions. None of this guarantees meaningful volume. But it does make the path to volume legible: more x402-enabled endpoints, more agent clients, and more facilitators that can clear payments cheaply and predictably.

That replaces the earlier $1.4 trillion infrastructure figure that CEO Sam Altman had discussed months ago. The new number comes with a clearer timeline. US media alleges that the lower target follows concern that expansion plans were too aggressive compared with expected revenue. OpenAI is now projecting more than $280 billion in total revenue by 2030, with consumer and enterprise segments contributing almost equally. Reportedly , the revised spending plan ties directly to that revenue outlook. OpenAI resets spending plan As Cryptopolitan reported during the second half of last year, OpenAI announced many multibillion-dollar infrastructure agreements after partnering with major chipmakers and cloud providers to expand supercomputing capacity. Meanwhile, Nvidia has confirmed that it is in talks to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI as part of a funding round. That round could value OpenAI at a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The potential $30 billion investment is separate from the $100 billion infrastructure agreement announced in September between Nvidia and OpenAI. A person familiar with the matter said the $30 billion is not tied to deployment milestones. The September framework was different. It outlined Nvidia investing over several years as new supercomputing facilities came online. At the time, it was said that Nvidia’s first $10 billion would be deployed once the first gigawatt facility was completed. The possible $30 billion investment does not follow that same structure. However, the person said Nvidia could still participate in future rounds that align with the September framework. OpenAI reported $13.1 billion in revenue for 2025. That exceeded its $10 billion target. The company burned $8 billion during the year, below its earlier $9 billion spending target. These numbers were shared by sources familiar with internal figures. Nvidia faces earnings spotlight OpenAI started in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. It became mainstream after launching ChatGPT in 2022. ChatGPT now serves more than 900 million weekly active users, up from 800 million in October, according to people with knowledge of the data. The coding tool Codex has passed 1.5 million weekly active users. Codex competes with Anthropic’s Claude Code, which has gained adoption over the past year. Nvidia is set to release quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Investors are watching closely as concerns grow about returns on artificial intelligence spending. Nvidia is currently the largest company in the world by market capitalization. Its stock surged after ChatGPT launched in late 2022. So far in 2026, shares of Nvidia and other Magnificent Seven companies have stalled. Markets are also watching upcoming earnings from Salesforce and Intuit. Software stocks have fallen this year. Investors worry that artificial intelligence will disrupt traditional business models. In November, Nvidia stated in its quarterly report that there was “no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity or other potential investments.” Sam Altman responded to speculation on X, writing that OpenAI loves working with Nvidia and that he does not “get where all this insanity is coming from.” Earlier this month, Jensen Huang told Jim Cramer there was “no question” Nvidia would invest in OpenAI’s next funding round.

Buyers have shown renewed confidence after recent weakness and are actively defending key price levels. Price has reclaimed the $0.0975 area, helping shift sentiment in a more positive direction. This recovery reflects increasing demand and improved participation from traders. If buying pressure remains steady, DOGE could attempt a move toward the $0.0995 to $0.100 resistance zone. Dogecoin Eyes $0.73905 as Key Upside Targets Remain in Play According to JAVON⚡️MARKS’ chart highlights Dogecoin’s repeating macro breakout structure. After each correction, DOGE forms a falling wedge before launching higher. Every breakout previously pushed the price to a new all-time high. The last major peak reached approximately $0.73905. Current price action is holding above a rising macro trendline. This support structure mirrors previous pre-expansion phases. The pattern suggests the broader bullish cycle remains intact. The analyst states there are no targets below $0.6533. A move toward $0.73905 would retest the prior all-time high. From the $0.10–$0.12 region, this implies massive upside potential. The projected move represents roughly 550% to 640% gains. Similar percentage rallies occurred in prior cycles. Holding higher lows keeps the bullish structure valid. A breakout could send DOGE toward $0.65–$0.74 and beyond. Dogecoin Shows Signs of Short-Term Bounce Amid Prolonged Downtrend Dogecoin remains in a clear downtrend on the daily chart, with price trading near $0.098. Lower highs are visible after repeated rejections below the $0.100–$0.102 resistance zone. Support has weakened around $0.095, with sellers defending rallies aggressively. Unless price reclaims above $0.10, the bearish structure stays intact.

Still, a new report from data and research firm Ecoinometrics suggests that the market may not be building a base for recovery. Instead, the firm argues that the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to another downward move, driven by three overlapping forces: weakening equity momentum, structural changes in Bitcoin’s volatility profile, and a Federal Reserve (Fed) that is steady but not supportive. Structural Headwinds For Bitcoin According to the report, Bitcoin no longer trades in isolation. It has become increasingly linked to equity markets, capital flows, and broader macroeconomic conditions. At the moment, that linkage is not working in its favor. Bitcoin is already showing signs of weakness, equity markets are losing steam, and the Federal Reserve is maintaining a neutral stance that offers little additional liquidity support. Together, those factors keep downside risks elevated. Related Reading: ‘Sell Bitcoin Now,’ Peter Schiff Warns, Predicts $20,000 Target On Breakdown While Bitcoin has attempted to stabilize in recent weeks, Ecoinometrics cautions that this does not resemble a clear bottoming pattern. Rather, it looks more like a pause within an ongoing bear phase. Structural headwinds are already in place, as highlighted by the firm, including continued outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a broader “risk-off” environment in financial markets. The report noted that Bitcoin is trading below its long-term trend, with its 200-day moving average (currently above $100,000) turning downward and rallies repeatedly failing beneath that level — a classic sign of a bearish structure. By contrast, the Nasdaq 100 has stalled for roughly three months, but its 200-day moving average is still rising. That suggests equities are slowing but have not yet entered a confirmed structural downturn. The distinction is important. When Bitcoin weakens on its own, declines can unfold gradually. However, history shows that when equities roll over decisively, Bitcoin tends to fall sharply alongside them. Lower Volatility, Higher Correlation Beyond price action, the firm highlights a deeper structural shift in Bitcoin’s behavior: a marked compression in volatility. In prior cycles, 12-month realized volatility surged dramatically during both bull markets and subsequent crashes. This time, even after a full bear-bull-bear sequence since 2022, volatility has not returned to those previous extremes. In fact, peak volatility in the current cycle has been materially lower. This change reflects who is driving demand. ETF flows now play a dominant role in shaping trends. These flows are typically larger, steadier, and more systematic than the retail-driven surges that characterized earlier cycles. Bitcoin, in other words, has become embedded within institutional portfolios, often sitting alongside technology and growth stocks. That shift brings advantages, including lower volatility and more predictable flow patterns. It may also strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term durability. However, it comes with a trade-off: deeper sensitivity to equity market drawdowns. Ecoinometrics asserts that as BTC becomes more integrated into the broader risk-on complex, it behaves more like a component of that system rather than a detached speculative asset. Downside Risks Grow On the policy front, Ecoinometrics suggests the Fed’s posture remains largely unchanged: inflation has improved but is not fully contained, and the labor market remains resilient.

The communications index sits well below the tightening peak seen in 2022 and far above the crisis-level dovishness of 2020, placing current policy in the middle ground. For Bitcoin, that steady stance removes the risk of a sudden policy shock, but it does not provide a tailwind. The firm said in a fragile market, stability may be preferable to tightening, yet it offers little support if risk assets begin to slide.

This decision, communicated from its global operations base, highlights the volatile dynamics of the cryptocurrency sector and the challenges of launching region-specific stablecoins. Consequently, this strategic withdrawal marks a pivotal moment for both Tether and the broader digital asset ecosystem, prompting analysis of market saturation and demand. Tether CNH₮: The End of an Offshore Yuan Experiment Tether, the issuer behind the dominant USDT stablecoin, launched CNH₮ in December 2022. The stablecoin aimed to provide a digital proxy for the offshore yuan (CNH), a currency traded outside mainland China. Market analysts initially viewed the launch as a strategic expansion into Asian markets. However, Tether’s latest announcement cites insufficient scale and limited demand as primary reasons for discontinuing the project. New token issuance stops immediately, but the company will facilitate redemptions for one full year. This development follows a period of intense scrutiny and evolution within the stablecoin sector. Regulatory frameworks globally have tightened, especially concerning currencies pegged to national monetary systems. Furthermore, the offshore yuan market itself presents unique complexities involving capital controls and geopolitical factors. Tether’s operational decision reflects a pragmatic assessment of these overlapping challenges. The company will now reallocate resources toward its core, high-demand products like USDT and its euro-pegged EURT. Analyzing the Stablecoin Market’s Demands The discontinuation of CNH₮ offers a clear case study in cryptocurrency product viability. Stablecoins serve as crucial bridges between traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems. Their success depends heavily on liquidity, trust, and clear utility. For instance, USDT maintains dominance due to its deep integration with global crypto exchanges and DeFi protocols. In contrast, CNH₮ struggled to achieve similar network effects. Several factors contributed to the limited adoption of the offshore yuan stablecoin. First, the existing infrastructure for trading and settling CNH in traditional markets is already efficient. Second, demand for a digital yuan alternative is partly met by China’s own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan (e-CNY). Third, geopolitical tensions influence currency markets, potentially affecting the stability and appeal of CNH-pegged assets. The table below contrasts key metrics between USDT and the discontinued CNH₮. Metric Tether USDT Tether CNH₮ Launch Date 2014 December 2022 Underlying Peg US Dollar Offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH) Primary Use Case Global trading, DeFi collateral Regional trade, yuan exposure Market Capitalization (Approx.) > $110 Billion Negligible (Not in top 100) Regulatory Spotlight High (Global) High (Region-specific) Moreover, the decision underscores a broader industry trend. Companies now prioritize products with proven, scalable demand over exploratory niche offerings. This consolidation phase aims to ensure long-term sustainability, especially ahead of anticipated comprehensive regulations in 2025. Expert Perspectives on Strategic Crypto Pivots Financial technology experts note that Tether’s move is neither a failure nor an anomaly. Instead, it represents rational portfolio management in a competitive sector. Dr. Lena Zhou, a fintech researcher at the Digital Asset Governance Institute, explains, “The stablecoin market exhibits winner-takes-most characteristics. Liquidity begets more liquidity. A new stablecoin needs immediate, massive utility to overcome that inertia. CNH₮, despite its technical soundness, could not achieve critical mass in a market already served by established instruments.” Historical data supports this analysis. Over the past five years, dozens of algorithmic and fiat-backed stablecoins have launched only to shutter later. The common thread among discontinued projects is a lack of distinct competitive advantage or insufficient market depth. For holders of CNH₮, the guaranteed one-year redemption window provides ample time to exit positions without panic. This orderly wind-down process itself reinforces Tether’s operational experience and commitment to user protection. The Ripple Effects on Digital Yuan Adoption Tether’s exit from the CNH-pegged market inevitably influences conversations around China’s digital currency ambitions. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) continues to advance the pilot and adoption of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-CNY. Some analysts speculated that private stablecoins like CNH₮ could complement or compete with the digital yuan. However, the discontinuation suggests limited space for private offshore alternatives at this stage. The immediate impacts are multifaceted: Market Signal: Other firms may reconsider plans for yuan-linked digital assets. User Migration: Traders and institutions using CNH₮ must transition to other yuan exposure tools. Regulatory Dialogue: The move may inform ongoing discussions about stablecoin governance. Furthermore, this event highlights the intricate balance between innovation and market reality. Blockchain technology enables the creation of countless digital assets, but sustainable economic models are far rarer. Tether’s decision, based on operational data and market conditions, demonstrates a mature, metrics-driven approach to product lifecycle management. Conclusion Tether’s discontinuation of the CNH₮ offshore yuan stablecoin marks a strategic recalibration focused on core strengths. Driven by limited demand and market conditions, this decision reflects the harsh realities of the cryptocurrency sector, where even well-backed projects require sustained adoption. The guaranteed redemption period ensures a responsible transition for existing users. Ultimately, this move underscores the increasing maturity and strategic focus within the stablecoin industry, as leading players like Tether optimize their offerings for a regulated, competitive future. The Tether CNH₮ chapter closes, but the evolution of digital currency continues unabated. FAQs Q1: What is Tether CNH₮ and why is it being discontinued? Tether CNH₮ was an offshore Chinese yuan-pegged stablecoin. Tether is discontinuing it due to insufficient market demand and scale, making continued operational support unjustifiable. Q2: Can I still redeem my Tether CNH₮ tokens? Yes. Tether has committed to honoring redemptions for CNH₮ for one full year from the announcement date. You should follow official Tether channels for redemption procedures. Q3: How does this affect Tether’s main USDT stablecoin? This decision does not directly affect USDT. Tether states it is reallocating resources to its core products, like USDT and EURT, which continue normal operations. Q4: What are the alternatives for holding a digital yuan exposure now? Alternatives include direct trading of the offshore yuan (CNH) in forex markets, using China’s official digital yuan (e-CNY) within its pilot zones, or exploring other digital asset instruments with yuan exposure, though options are now more limited. Q5: Does this signal a regulatory crackdown on stablecoins? Not directly. Tether cited market conditions, not regulatory action, as the cause. However, the move occurs within a global context of increasing regulatory scrutiny on all stablecoins, which may influence broader market strategies.

Related Reading: Analyst ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ About Dogecoin As Price Rally Stalls Trump Family Memecoins Leave Investors In Red On Friday, a CryptoRank report shared how retail investors have lost billions on the official Trump family memecoins while insiders seemingly pocketed millions of dollars. Over a year ago, President Trump surprised the industry by launching his official token ahead of the start of his second term. The memecoin rapidly skyrocketed to an all-time high (ATH) of $75, bringing massive profits for many early investors. Two days later, the US First Lady, Melania Trump, announced the launch of her memecoin, which quickly surged to an ATH of $13.05 in less than 24 hours. However, the tokens faced significant backlash from the crypto community, with some X users calling the memecoins a “big red flag” as later reports revealed that one of the faces behind the MELANIA memecoin was Hayden Davis, the mastermind behind the LIBRA Token disaster. A year after their launch, the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins have sunk, collapsing 92% and 99%, respectively, from their January 2025 highs. As of this writing, the token based on the US President trades around $3.55, while the First Lady’s token hovers around $0.11. According to CryptoRank, the damage to retail investors has been staggering, with holders absorbing losses at a 20-to-1 ratio. “For every dollar insiders earned, ordinary investors lost $20,” the report noted. As a result, retail losses have exceeded $4.3 billion from nearly two million wallets currently underwater. Citing data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, CNBC shared that most wallets that lost money held smaller amounts of the token. Insiders And Crypto Exchanges Generate Millions While retail holders bear the losses, CryptoRank highlighted that insiders have cashed out over $600 million through fees and token sales. Notably, 45 wallets extracted approximately $1.2 billion combined, and 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC data shows. The report also noted that the selloff may not be over, as $2.7 billion in insider tokens that will be locked until 2028 suggests significant selling pressure is still on the horizon for the memecoins. As reported by NewsBTC, a Reuters analysis claimed that crypto exchanges were major beneficiaries of the presidential family’s memecoins, with the TRUMP token generating millions of dollars in revenue for some of the largest exchanges. Based on standard fee estimates compiled by the news outlet, the reviewed crypto platforms allegedly made more than $172 million in trading fees just six months after the token’s listing.
