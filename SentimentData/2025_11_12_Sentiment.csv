However, SOL ETFs managed to close the week with positive inflows, a clear sign that institutional investors still favor a bullish Solana price prediction . Bitcoin ETFs took the strongest hit as investors withdrew nearly $1 billion from these products, while ETH-linked funds saw their assets drop by $432 million. In contrast, Solana ETFs, including spot versions like the ones managed by REX-Osprey and Bitwise, received $118 million. Investors seem to have taken advantage of the strong sell-off that SOL experienced, which managed to push the token below $150 at some point last week, to scoop up the asset at a discount. At the time of writing, the two spot ETFs tied to Solana have attracted a combined $782 million in assets. Among them, the Bitwise Solana ETF (BSOL) has already taken the lead, despite launching only weeks ago, thanks to its higher staking reward structure which has drawn in more yield-focused investors. Solana Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout Out of Price Channel Could Push SOL to $300 The daily chart for Solana shows that the token hit a key area of demand at $155, from which it has apparently bounced in the past few days. The price has been on a downtrend since mid-September as it failed to stay above $200. Nonetheless, ETF inflows lately could be indicating that SOL has hit a local bottom. If the recovery commences, the price should first break out of that descending price channel. This would also mean a move above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). If that happens, we could see SOL recapturing the $200 area, and it could keep rising to $300 in the near term to finally make a new all-time high. If SOL manages to reclaim the $200 mark, it could quickly build momentum toward $300 and set the stage for a new all-time high. For those looking to get ahead of the next breakout, early-stage presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) offer a high-upside alternative. This unique mine-to-earn (M2E) crypto game has already pulled in millions from early investors by enabling users to mine meme coins using virtual mining rigs – no hardware needed. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Meme Coin Mining Easy and Hardware-Free Pepenode ($PEPENODE) reinvents crypto mining by eliminating the biggest barrier for most users — the need for costly equipment. Instead of setting up physical rigs, players can launch virtual servers, deploy mining rigs instantly, and scale their operations entirely online. This gamified approach makes mining more accessible, letting anyone join the action without the technical hassle or upfront hardware investment. The project fosters a competitive environment and rewards top miners with attractive meme coin airdrops like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN). In addition, 70% of the $PEPENODE spent on upgrades is burned to reduce the token’s circulating supply. As the game’s popularity increases, so will the demand for its utility token. Hence, analysts expect that $PEPENODE will rise rapidly once the presale ends. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card instead to complete the transaction. Buy $PEPENODE Here.

Prices lifted yesterday after the U.S. federal government shutdown came to an end , yet fears still remain that an AI-caused stock market bubble may be close to bursting. This is why the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are down slightly today, but some altcoins are showing signs that they could rally strongly in the coming weeks. One of these is the new Ethereum-based token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which recently opened its presale and is gaining serious momentum as it prepares to launch soon. New Crypto to Buy Today: Under $0.01 and About to List on Exchanges In fact, PEPENODE has now raised $2.1 million in its ongoing sale, which has been attracting investors largely by virtue of the coin’s unique fundamentals. These fundamentals revolve around the fact that PEPENODE is launching a first-of-its-kind mine-to-earn platform, which will provide users with the ability to mine cryptocurrencies without having to invest in expensive equipment. There's no better feeling than seeing those mined coins hit your wallet. It's ok.. Go ahead. Take as MANY as you can! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tVh4WSRNay — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 8, 2025 The way the platform works is by enabling users to build their own virtual mining rigs, which will consist of virtual mining nodes that participants can purchase using the PEPENODE token itself. The more nodes users buy, the greater their mining rewards will be, with PEPENODE paying out rewards in external tokens, such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin. Because more nodes equal more rewards, there will be a clear and strong incentive to accumulate more PEPENODE, something which should drive its price up over time. Added to this, holders of the coin will be able to stake, earning themselves an annual return that currently stands at 611%. These factors mean that PEPENODE arguably benefits from a much greater stimulus to growth than many other meme coins, giving it an edge over its competition. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with its allocation breakdown as follows: economics and treasury (35%), development (35%), infrastructure (15%), node rewards (7.5%), and listings (7.5%). How to Buy PEPENODE Before the Presale Closes PEPENODE’s presale doesn’t have that much time left before it closes, and before the token is listed on exchanges. However, investors can still join at the PEPENODE website, where they can connect a suitable wallet and buy the token in exchange for ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat currency. The coin is currently available at the price of $0.0011408, although this will rise later today. And it will continue to rise for the duration of the sale, meaning that interested investors should buy sooner rather than later. It’s likely that its launch could coincide with a market-wide recovery, with the imminent launch of altcoin ETFs having the potential to boost demand across the board. This is why PEPENODE is one of the best new cryptos to buy today, since its fundamentals and timing could result in big gains in the not-too-distant future.

According to commentary from community figure Skipper, approval of such a fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could open the floodgates to institutional capital and fundamentally shift XRP’s outlook. Skipper argues that once the SEC grants approval for an XRP ETF, large‐scale financial firms will gain a regulated route to exposure. He maintains that Wall Street would find it difficult to ignore a payments-oriented asset still trading relatively modestly. With institutions entering via an ETF, demand could rapidly absorb available supply. That dynamic, according to him, would place upward pressure on the token’s value. Built-in Supply Reduction Mechanism A second pillar of the case focuses on XRP’s deflationary characteristics. Skipper highlighted that every transaction on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) destroys a small amount of XRP, gradually reducing its total circulating supply. Unlike fixed-supply tokens such as Bitcoin, XRP’s adaptive supply model introduces a built-in tightening mechanism. In the combination of rising institutional demand and shrinking supply, Skipper sees the potential for meaningful value appreciation. Stablecoin Integration and Ecosystem Expansion Skipper also drew attention to RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Ripple Labs and built on the XRPL. He views RLUSD as a strategic lever to drive transaction volume across the XRPL, which in turn would increase the rate of XRP burns and reinforce the supply-contraction thesis. He pointed out that RLUSD achieved roughly a 604 % increase in circulation over six months and became one of the fastest-growing stablecoins globally, indicating that the project may still be in its early scaling phase. Ripple’s Strategic Choice and Competitive Advantage According to Skipper, the launch of RLUSD was not necessary for Ripple’s success, yet it was chosen deliberately. By issuing its own stablecoin rather than relying entirely on third‐party options, Ripple retains greater control over value flows, transaction settlement, and the utility of the XRPL. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skipper argues this approach gives the company a strategic edge. When an organization controls both the payment infrastructure and the settlement layer, the core token (XRP) can gain relevance beyond speculative usage. He contends that as investors grasp this integrated vision, institutional demand for XRP may rise sharply. Regulatory developments are advancing quickly. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) now lists several proposed XRP ETFs, including filings from Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton , Bitwise, and 21Shares. Canary Capital has targeted November 13 for launch, pending Nasdaq approval, while Franklin Templeton recently amended its filing to remove prior delay provisions, aiming for a late-November decision. ETF analyst Nate Geraci commented that the first XRP ETF registered under the Securities Act of 1933 could debut as soon as this week if approvals align. Meanwhile, Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, estimated potential inflows of roughly $10 billion within the first month of trading, a level of demand that could significantly impact market liquidity and price stability. The potential launch of a spot-XRP ETF may represent more than simply another financial product. For XRP, it could cause a shift into regulated institutional waters, matched with micro-supply contraction via transaction burns, and supported by an expanding stablecoin ecosystem built by Ripple. If these forces converge, the token may be positioned for meaningful price growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitwise’s spot Chainlink ETF has just appeared on the DTCC website under the ticker CLNK, marking a significant milestone in the journey toward mainstream crypto adoption. This development could open up new investment opportunities for those looking to gain exposure to Chainlink’s oracle network through traditional financial channels. What Does the Chainlink ETF Listing Mean for Investors? The appearance of Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation website represents a crucial step forward. However, it’s important to understand that this DTCC listing differs from SEC approval. The DTCC primarily handles clearing and settlement services, while the SEC focuses on regulatory compliance and investor protection. This Chainlink ETF development follows the successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Many industry experts see this as part of a broader trend toward cryptocurrency integration with traditional finance. The potential benefits include: Easier access for traditional investors Enhanced liquidity for Chainlink tokens Regulatory clarity through established frameworks Mainstream validation of blockchain technology How Does This Chainlink ETF Compare to Previous Crypto Funds? Unlike Bitcoin ETFs that track the price of Bitcoin directly, this Chainlink ETF would provide exposure to LINK tokens. Chainlink serves as a critical infrastructure component in the blockchain ecosystem, powering decentralized oracle networks that connect smart contracts with real-world data. The timing of this Chainlink ETF filing comes during a period of growing institutional interest in blockchain technology. Major financial institutions increasingly recognize the value of decentralized oracle networks for various applications, including: Decentralized finance protocols Insurance smart contracts Gaming and NFT platforms Supply chain management What Challenges Remain for the Chainlink ETF Approval? While the DTCC listing generates optimism, several hurdles remain before investors can actually trade this Chainlink ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission must still review and approve the application, a process that typically involves extensive scrutiny of market manipulation concerns, custody solutions, and investor protection measures. Market experts suggest that the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency ETFs has evolved gradually. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs established important precedents, but each new digital asset faces unique regulatory considerations. The Chainlink ETF application will likely undergo similar rigorous examination focused on: Market surveillance capabilities Custody and security arrangements Liquidity and price discovery mechanisms Investor education requirements Why This Chainlink ETF Matters for Crypto’s Future The potential approval of a Chainlink ETF represents more than just another investment product. It signals growing recognition of blockchain infrastructure’s importance beyond simple currency applications. Chainlink’s oracle technology enables smart contracts to interact with external data, making it fundamental to many real-world blockchain implementations. This Chainlink ETF development could pave the way for similar products focused on other essential blockchain infrastructure tokens. The success of such funds would demonstrate that investors value the underlying technology powering the decentralized web, not just speculative digital assets. Final Thoughts on the Chainlink ETF Opportunity The appearance of Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF on the DTCC website marks an exciting development in cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream financial acceptance. While regulatory approval remains uncertain, this progress indicates growing institutional confidence in blockchain infrastructure investments. As the crypto industry continues maturing, products like the Chainlink ETF bridge the gap between traditional finance and innovative blockchain technology. Investors should monitor this development closely, as it could signal new opportunities for diversified cryptocurrency exposure through regulated financial channels. Frequently Asked Questions What is the ticker symbol for Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF? The proposed Chainlink ETF carries the ticker symbol CLNK on the DTCC website. Does DTCC listing guarantee SEC approval? No, DTCC listing is separate from SEC review and doesn’t guarantee eventual exchange listing or regulatory approval. When can investors expect to trade this Chainlink ETF? There’s no confirmed timeline. The ETF must first receive SEC approval before becoming available for trading. How does a Chainlink ETF differ from buying LINK directly? An ETF provides regulated, traditional market exposure without dealing with crypto wallets or exchanges directly. What advantages does a Chainlink ETF offer? It offers easier access for traditional investors, potential tax advantages, and regulated custody solutions. Are there other cryptocurrency ETFs in development? Yes, several asset managers are exploring ETFs for various cryptocurrencies following Bitcoin ETF approvals. Found this analysis helpful?

Michael Selig is scheduled to appear on November 19 before the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has oversight of the CFTC. The nomination comes at a time of unusual uncertainty for the agency. The CFTC, whose primary responsibility has been to regulate derivatives and commodity markets, is likely to be given additional power to regulate cryptocurrencies. Legislators are also debating a bill that could transfer supervision of a broad swath of the crypto market from the SEC to the CFTC. President Donald Trump selected Selig to chair the commission earlier this month, after the previous nominee , Brian Quintenz, was removed. Quintenz’s nomination was stalled over the summer due to disagreements among influential industry figures. Senate to grill Selig on crypto oversight plan If approved, Selig would take over an agency currently run by a single commissioner . Acting Chair Caroline Pham has been the CFTC’s sole member since September, when the agency typically has five commissioners to foster balanced decision-making. Pham has said she will resign if a permanent chair is confirmed. That makes Selig likely to find himself initially at the helm of the CFTC without reinforcements at a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny and rapid developments in the crypto space. His supporters argue that his experience equips him with the technical expertise to regulate markets during a period of rapid innovation and structural change. He’ll still undoubtedly face the question among some lawmakers and policy analysts about whether his past ties him too closely to the interests of the crypto industry, especially at a time when regulators are facing mounting pressure to ramp up their oversight and enforcement. Senators are reportedly preparing to grill Selig over his views on the CFTC’s role in the crypto world. They will likely explore how aggressively the agency should pursue enforcement cases, how it should determine whether a digital asset falls within the jurisdiction of either the CFTC or SEC, and how to cooperate with the two regulators to avoid regulatory gaps. Questions may also revolve around whether Selig at the helm would be more inclined to foster innovative markets or solidify investors’ protections. Lawmakers pass crypto market structure bills Selig’s confirmation hearing will take place as Congress is rethinking the way the United States regulates digital assets. In July, the House of Representatives approved the CLARITY Act, which would clarify the line between what it sees as the roles of the SEC and CFTC in regulating cryptocurrencies and other new financial instruments. Under this proposed system, digital assets such as Bitcoin and other decentralized tokens would be overseen by the CFTC. The SEC’s authority would extend to crypto assets that fall within the definition of securities, such as those associated with investment contracts or issued by private companies. Traders’ platforms and exchanges would need to comply with new registration and reporting requirements aimed at increasing transparency and safeguarding consumers. In the most serious sections of the bill, much work remains for senators on the Agriculture and Banking Committees to hammer out compromises. Senate Republicans on the Agriculture Committee released a new discussion draft on Monday, signalling that more serious work has begun on the legislation, which had stalled as funding fights and last month’s government shutdown took precedence. These are high-stakes negotiations for the cryptocurrency industry. How the bill ultimately winds up will determine how crypto firms are allowed to raise capital, list assets, and interact with customers. It could also significantly expand the CFTC’s role in the financial system, setting the parameters of its authority for years to come. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This happened after a wave of selling by big-time holders and leftover tension from the October 10th liquidations, when Donald Trump’s surprise tariff announcement triggered a meltdown across crypto. Trading activity reflects the same sluggish tone. Open interest on Bitcoin futures has dropped to around $68 billion, down from $94 billion last month. That’s a massive drop in appetite. Funding rates are sitting flat, meaning no one’s loading up on leverage. The mood on exchange-traded products is just as sleepy. US-listed Bitcoin ETFs only pulled in $1 million in net inflows Monday, even as equities and credit climbed following Washington’s move to end the federal shutdown. Bitcoin futures dip, technicals stall, whales sell hard Technically, the coin’s stuck under the 200-day moving average, now near $110,000, which many traders see as a must-break level to shift the trend upward. Since the early October chaos, Bitcoin has bled about $340 billion in market value. And despite finishing the year with gains, it’s trailing both gold and tech stocks badly, something that hasn’t gone unnoticed by fast-moving investors looking for stronger trends elsewhere. George Mandres, senior trader at XBTO Trading, said: “It feels like a dead cat bounce. Equities are trading risk-on, but in crypto, it’s different. OG whales have been offloading serious amounts of coins, and that supply combined with weak ETF flows and pressure on premiums from crypto treasury firms is crushing sentiment.” Momentum traders aren’t seeing much hope either. Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG Australia, said what caught his attention was how Bitcoin mirrored the recent rebound in other risk assets, after that correlation broke down last month. “We need more than one session to confirm the link is back,” Tony said. “But I’d argue the correction from the $126,272 top might’ve ended at the recent $98,898 low. If we move above the 200-day average near $110,000, that’ll back that idea up.” Resistance caps rebound while key support looks fragile Overall crypto market cap slipped 1.1% Monday after gaining earlier in the day, with the 50-day average near $3.62 trillion holding as resistance. The rally stalled out at $3.6 trillion, and Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, warned the market could be forming another short-term top. “We’re still in a downtrend,” Alex said, “and the reduction in corporate buying is being felt.” Rachael Lucas, analyst at BTC Markets, called the recent price lift a “short-covering rally,” plus some institutional fear of missing out. She pointed to Bitcoin’s bounce off the 50-week SMA at around $103,000 after briefly dipping near $98,900. Now it’s eyeing the next resistance zone at $110,400, and if that’s cleared, Rachael said we could be heading to $115,600 or even $118,000. But the flip side isn’t pretty. If Bitcoin breaks below $103,000, the next stop could be $86,000. And if that doesn’t hold, deeper support sits at $82,000, near the 100-week SMA. Rachael warned that slipping below those numbers could spark another round of heavy selling.

The trend in 2025 is clear. Investors no longer want promises; they want verifiable returns and sustainable growth. And in this new race, one name is emerging with strength: RentStac (RNS). From Memes to Bricks: DeFi Gets Real While meme coins struggle to find practical applications, RentStac (RNS) has brought blockchain into the real world, transforming physical properties into digital assets. Each token represents a legal share of ownership within registered Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) that generate rental income, distributed monthly to investors. For the first time, DeFi is moving beyond pure speculation to become a genuine investment tool, with cash flows traceable and verifiable on-chain. Mathematical Potential: +1,980% Already Structured The RentStac (RNS) presale is in Phase 1 at $0.025 per token and has already surpassed $675,000 raised. By the end of the presale, in Phase 7, the price will rise to $0.52, guaranteeing an automatic +1,980% gain for those who enter now. And this is not a hypothetical estimate, it is the official price progression built into the project’s structure. A $10,000 investment today becomes $416,000 at the end of the presale, not counting the possibility of reaching $1 post-listing, which would lift the value to $800,000. While SHIB and DOGE must rely on new waves of enthusiasm to recover, RentStac (RNS) already has a growth plan integrated and supported by tangible assets. DeFi With Returns, Not Tweets Dogecoin built its fame on Elon Musk’s tweets. Shiba Inu thrived on community hype and expectations. But the market has changed: investors now look for real economic models. RentStac has introduced a dual-yield model, a system that combines token appreciation with monthly rental distributions. Capital inflows fuel periodic buybacks and burns, reducing supply and increasing token value over time. It is a solid financial logic, much closer to institutional portfolio management than to a retail gamble. Transparency and Security That Attract Institutions Beyond growth, RentStac (RNS) stands out for its focus on security. The project has achieved a 92.48% score on SolidityScan, is officially listed on CoinMarketCap, and is undergoing a CertiK audit. All funds are protected in multi-signature wallets, with independent oracle validations ensuring on-chain data integrity. This level of oversight, once reserved only for regulated funds, is now accessible to anyone through blockchain. Real-World Assets Are the New Frontier According to the latest forecasts from the World Economic Forum, more than $10 trillion in traditional assets will be tokenized by 2030. This market, known as RWA (Real-World Assets), represents the biggest expansion opportunity for DeFi since 2020. RentStac (RNS) is one of the few projects already operating in this space, and its multi-chain strategy across Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC positions it for global growth in the coming years. While SHIB and DOGE face a downward cycle and investors exit losing positions, smart capital is shifting toward projects that offer monthly income, fractional ownership, and transparent governance. An Inevitable Paradigm Shift The market is changing its skin. The “to the moon” narrative that sustained meme tokens is giving way to a more mature approach based on value, yield, and utility. RentStac (RNS) does not promise miracles; it delivers measurable results. A +1,980% return based on official data and an ecosystem built on concrete assets. It is the logical evolution of the crypto market: from digital speculation to the construction of real wealth.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-12 00:00:00
54287545,625319,1762905621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54287545.jpeg,Ethereum Supply on Binance Hits Lowest Level Since May – Long-Term Accumulation?,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-supply-binance-hits-lowest-level-since/,"Ethereum has regained the $3,500 level after a volatile week marked by heavy selling pressure and uncertainty across the crypto market. Bulls, who briefly lost control as ETH dipped below key support levels, are showing renewed strength as liquidity surges and sentiment begins to shift. According to a recent CryptoQuant report, data from Binance — the world’s largest Ethereum trading platform by volume — reveals a notable on-chain trend that could signal deeper structural strength. The ETH supply on Binance has been in steady decline since mid-year, following a peak between June and July. By November, it had dropped to its lowest level since last May, now sitting around the 0.0327 level. This consistent decrease in available ETH on exchanges typically reflects a migration of coins into cold storage or private wallets, suggesting that investors are opting to hold rather than sell. Historically, this behavior has been viewed as bullish in the medium to long term, as it reduces the amount of Ethereum available for immediate sale and relieves market pressure. Ethereum Exchange Supply Decline Signals Market Accumulation Phase In the CryptoQuant report , analyst Arab Chain highlights a notable divergence between Ethereum’s price action and exchange supply dynamics. The price of Ethereum (black line) climbed to consecutive highs near $4,500–$5,000 in August and September 2025 before retracing to around $3,500 today. Interestingly, this decline coincided with a sharp drop in exchange-held ETH supply, suggesting that many traders withdrew their coins after securing profits — likely moving them into cold storage in anticipation of longer-term accumulation. If this trend of declining Ethereum supply on Binance persists, market liquidity for ETH sales could tighten further. Such a contraction in sell-side supply often supports price stabilization, as reduced availability of tokens on exchanges lessens immediate selling pressure. In favorable macro or on-chain conditions, this setup could even help catalyze a renewed upward phase, especially if risk appetite among institutional and retail investors strengthens. However, Arab Chain cautions that continued weak demand or reduced network activity might limit any near-term upside, keeping prices in a sideways range. Despite short-term uncertainty, the broader on-chain picture reflects a transitional accumulation phase, where long-term holders dominate flows. This ongoing migration of ETH off exchanges — paired with increasing self-custody behavior — underlines growing investor conviction. If fundamental catalysts such as network upgrades, ETF approvals, or renewed DeFi activity align, Ethereum could be setting the stage for the next bullish leg of the cycle. ETH Price Analysis: Reclaiming Key Support Levels Ethereum is showing early signs of stabilization after reclaiming the $3,500 level, marking a modest but significant recovery from the recent capitulation phase that drove prices near $3,200. As seen in the daily chart, ETH has found temporary support at the 200-day moving average (red line), a historically reliable level that often defines the boundary between bullish and bearish cycles. The price is now testing resistance near the $3,600–$3,700 zone, where both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages converge. A breakout above this area could confirm renewed bullish momentum, potentially setting the stage for a move toward $3,900–$4,000, aligning with previous range highs. However, the overall structure still reflects caution. The failure to hold above $4,000 earlier this month underscores the ongoing battle between buyers attempting to regain control and sellers taking profits amid market uncertainty. Trading volume remains subdued compared to the August–September rally, suggesting that conviction among market participants is still rebuilding.

This is a redefinition of BTC’s role in the global financial architecture, opening pathways for integration that could finally merge the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized networks. Why Interoperability Is The Key To Bitcoin’s Next Phase The crypto world has grappled with a fundamental paradox, and Beyond is building the bridge that Bitcoin has been waiting for. The Founder of DrAlphaweb3 and ordinalcarrots, Dr.OVG, has highlighted that BTC will remain the leading store of value, but in many decentralized finance (DeFi) setups, it is either locked out or wrapped. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Holds $100K as Investors Move Toward This New DeFi Crypto Project By enabling BTC liquidity to move natively across chains, like layer 1s, layer 2s, and various DeFi protocols, Beyond is set to unleash BTCFi. Specifically, the initiative will enable BTC holders to lend, borrow, earn yield, and deploy their BTC without sacrificing decentralisation and security. This innovation is critical because it will unlock BTC utility as it grows to transition into an active player in the global DeFi economy. Dr.OVG concluded that traders might see some crazy runners, so individuals should position themselves accordingly. A project and protocol writer, Mattcrypted, has also mentioned that BTCFi thrives with seamless UX powered by LayerZero’s Omni-chain Fungible Token (OFT) technology. Meanwhile, Beyond bridges connections with Echoport Ordinals to 140+ chains and 200+ partners for users to move BTC and LSTs effortlessly. With Beyond mainnet set to go live in Q4, the network will support the meta protocol, sidechain wrappers, and L2 integrations. In this innovation, the dual sale structure behind the upcoming project is also designed to deliver bear market-proof valuation for token sales. The combination of a token launchpad and Ordinals participation will ensure wide accessibility during the token sales. On the technical front, EVMs would seamlessly operate as a trusted protocol backed by Animoca Brands and vVv, which is bullish, and Beyond would pioneer BTC connections across the ecosystem. Why Bitcoin Next Chapter Demands Interoperability Bitcoin is not meant to stay siloed. According to a Web3 builder, Jaouad, Beyond is a native BTC L1 interoperability layer that enables seamless movement of any token within Bitcoin while linking the flagship crypto, BRC-20s, Runes, and more to over 100 chains. Related Reading: Big Bitcoin Holders Are Selling, But Few Buyers Are Stepping In As Demand Weakens Jaouad stated that as a Wallchain Quaker, he’s actively grinding on the Beyond Mindshare Leaderboard, as 4% of the total BYD supply is dedicated to contributors, with 2% reserved for Epoch 1, which will wrap up on December 8. “If you are serious about BTCFi, this is the bridge you cannot ignore,” Jaouad noted.

The DTCC platform, which includes funds in the pre-launch phase, has already listed vehicles from Canary Capital, Bitwise, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton, among others, that will provide spot exposure to the native asset of the XRP Ledger. Sometime in next two weeks, I expect launch of first spot xrp ETFs… SEC had open litigation against Ripple for past five years, up until three months ago. IMO, launch of spot xrp ETFs represents final nail in coffin of previous anti-crypto regulators. Have come a *LONG* way. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 3, 2025 According to ETF expert Nate Geraci, these funds should be listed in a couple of weeks. Once they do, They could open up the floodgates for millions of dollars coming from both retail and institutional investors who will now have a regulated alternative to get exposure to the token. We could expect that the combined AUMs of these vehicles will rapidly surpass $1 billion, similar to what happened to Solana after Bitwise’s spot ETF entered the market. XRP Price Prediction: $4 In Sight if U.S. Government Shutdown Ends The 4-hour chart shows that XRP experienced strong selling pressure as it hit $2.50. The token could now retreat to the nearest relevant area at $2.38 to retest a former resistance from above. If buying pressure keeps building, XRP could attempt a breakout toward $3 this week, especially if news of the U.S. government shutdown resolution triggers renewed market optimism. Momentum is already picking up fast. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing overbought levels on the lower time frames, signaling strong demand and accelerating interest. If XRP pushes past the $3 resistance, it could open the door to a sharp move toward $4, particularly if ETF listings proceed as anticipated and market conditions keep improving. To make the most of potential gains, keeping your XRP secure is essential.

In a recent exclusive interview, he revealed that Bitcoin mining operations are confronting a perfect storm of threats that could reshape the entire cryptocurrency landscape. This alarming situation affects everyone from individual miners to large-scale operations. What Exactly Are the Three Threats to Bitcoin Mining? Fred Thiel identified three major challenges currently threatening Bitcoin mining profitability. First, intensifying competition makes it harder for miners to earn rewards. Second, rising energy costs squeeze profit margins. Third, declining revenue creates unsustainable business conditions. These three factors combine to create what Thiel describes as a ‘triple threat’ to the industry. Why Is Competition Becoming So Fierce in Bitcoin Mining? The Bitcoin mining space has become increasingly crowded as more players enter the market. Thiel explained that Bitcoin mining operates as a zero-sum game. When one company increases its mining capacity, it automatically reduces opportunities for others. This creates an environment where: New mining operations constantly join the network Existing miners upgrade their equipment regularly Everyone competes for the same block rewards Profit margins continue shrinking across the board How Are Rising Costs Impacting Bitcoin Mining Operations? Energy expenses represent the single largest cost for Bitcoin mining operations. Recent global energy price increases have hit miners particularly hard. Many operations that were profitable six months ago now struggle to break even. The situation becomes even more challenging because: Energy costs show no signs of decreasing Mining difficulty continues rising Equipment maintenance costs increase over time Cooling requirements add additional expenses What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Mining? The landscape of Bitcoin mining is undergoing significant transformation. Thiel highlighted an interesting trend where equipment manufacturers are now entering the mining space directly. This shift occurs because traditional mining companies have slowed their equipment purchases. This development suggests that the Bitcoin mining industry may be consolidating, with only the most efficient operations surviving. Can Bitcoin Mining Survive These Challenges? Despite the current difficulties, Thiel believes adaptation and innovation will determine which Bitcoin mining operations thrive. The most successful miners will likely be those who can optimize their energy efficiency and reduce operational costs. However, the current period represents a crucial test for the entire Bitcoin mining ecosystem. The Bitcoin mining industry stands at a crossroads, facing its most significant challenges since inception. While the triple threat of competition, costs, and falling revenue creates substantial pressure, it also forces innovation and efficiency improvements. The coming months will reveal which Bitcoin mining operations have the resilience and adaptability to navigate these turbulent waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main problem facing Bitcoin mining today? The main problem is the combination of three factors: intense competition from new miners, rising energy costs, and decreasing revenue from mining rewards. How does competition affect Bitcoin mining profitability? Increased competition means more miners are competing for the same block rewards, which reduces individual profitability and makes it harder to recover mining costs. Why are energy costs so important for Bitcoin mining? Energy represents the largest operational expense for Bitcoin mining. Higher energy costs directly reduce profit margins and can make mining unprofitable for many operations. What happens if Bitcoin mining becomes unprofitable? If Bitcoin mining becomes unprofitable, smaller operations may shut down, leading to industry consolidation and potentially affecting network security. Are equipment manufacturers really becoming miners themselves? Yes, according to Thiel, some equipment manufacturers are entering Bitcoin mining directly since traditional mining companies have reduced their equipment purchases. Can Bitcoin mining adapt to these challenges? Yes, through improved efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and technological innovation, Bitcoin mining can potentially overcome current challenges.

The report , titled “Digital Assets: How Can Valuation Differ From Traditional Assets?”, concluded that most of Ripple’s economic worth stems from its XRP holdings rather than its private-equity value. How Blockchain Valuations Differ from Conventional Models Houlihan Lokey’s analysis outlined how assessing blockchain companies diverges from traditional valuation methods. In conventional finance, equity ownership and cash flow typically determine worth. However, for firms built around blockchain networks, the report argued that native tokens frequently represent the primary store of value and the mechanism through which economic activity occurs. The firm observed that after the 2022 downturn, marked by exchange collapses and fraud scandals, many investors retreated from digital assets. Yet, the rebound in market confidence following Ripple’s legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), renewed institutional participation, and the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs signaled a shift back toward crypto exposure. Houlihan Lokey emphasized that, in blockchain ventures, investors often hold both equity and token positions because most of a project’s future returns are captured by its token rather than its shares. Ripple was used as a central example of this dynamic. XRP Holdings Influences Ripple’s Valuation The report highlighted that Ripple’s payments network is built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), where XRP acts as the native utility token. This link, the bank noted, ties Ripple’s financial value directly to XRP’s market price. At the time of the study, XRP traded around $0.60. Houlihan Lokey estimated that Ripple controlled roughly 46 billion XRP and maintained about $1 billion in cash and securities, assuming no liabilities. Using this data, the report modeled three valuation scenarios: Secondary-market pricing valued Ripple at $4.5 billion, implying an XRP price of $0.076 and an 84 percent discount to the underlying token value. Tender-offer pricing placed Ripple’s valuation at $11.3 billion, implying $0.224 per XRP and a 60 percent discount. Market-price alignment, using XRP’s actual price of $0.60, produced a theoretical valuation of $28.6 billion. The wide gap between these figures, the bank noted, illustrates how token fluctuations can meaningfully alter a blockchain firm’s estimated worth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Effect of Accounting Standards on Ripple’s Value Houlihan Lokey referenced the FASB ASU 2023-08 accounting rule, which requires digital assets to be reported at fair market value. If Ripple applied this standard, its XRP holdings would appear on the balance sheet at market prices rather than at cost. Under that approach, the company’s reported valuation would align closer to the upper-end figure of $28.6 billion. Applying the same methodology today yields significantly larger numbers. Ripple currently holds about 40 billion XRP, including 5 billion readily accessible tokens and 35 billion locked in escrow. With XRP recently trading around $2.44 , those tokens alone represent approximately $92 billion in value. Adding the company’s $1 billion in cash and securities brings the theoretical valuation to roughly $93 billion, more than triple the estimate from early 2024. At the Ripple Swell 2025 conference , the company announced a $500 million capital raise that lifted its private-market valuation to about $40 billion. Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse stated earlier in the year that a public listing remains a possibility, although not an immediate goal. Ripple President Monica Long later confirmed there is no timeline for an initial public offering (IPO). Houlihan Lokey’s findings highlight that Ripple’s corporate worth cannot be separated from XRP’s price. As long as the company’s core utility and assets are tied to the XRPL ecosystem, changes in XRP’s market value will continue to exert a major influence on Ripple’s perceived and reported valuation.

According to a report from CNBC, Lisa said the company’s data center unit will lead that growth with an 80% annual increase, pushing it toward tens of billions in sales by 2027. She said that forecast is based on the strength of existing deals and “customers that are currently working very closely with us.” Lisa also told analysts that AMD sees itself grabbing a double-digit share of the AI data center market over the same time frame. She framed it as a goal they are actively working toward. The AI hardware market is currently dominated by Nvidia, which holds more than 90% of the space and sits on a $4.6 trillion valuation. In comparison, AMD has a market cap around $387 billion, and Lisa made it clear they’re coming for more. AMD signs multi‑billion dollar deals to push GPU sales While Nvidia continues to rule the GPU space, AMD remains the only other serious player building this kind of AI hardware at scale. Lisa pointed to a multi-year deal with OpenAI signed in October, where the startup committed to buying billions worth of AMD’s Instinct AI chips, starting with a 1-gigawatt deployment in 2026. The agreement could also give OpenAI a 10% stake in AMD, depending on how things play out. Lisa didn’t stop there. She also mentioned fresh long-term agreements with both Oracle and Meta, showing that AMD is being actively chosen by big names. Shares of AMD have nearly doubled in 2025, even though the stock dropped 3% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the event. The decline came despite Lisa revealing a gross margin forecast between 55% and 58%, which was better than what most analysts expected. The company is also working closely with OpenAI to launch its next-gen Instinct MI400X chips, which are scheduled to ship in 2026. Lisa said these chips will be assembled into rack-scale systems, with 72 GPUs acting as one, a crucial design for massive AI workloads. This would put AMD in the same league as Nvidia, whose rack systems have already gone through three product cycles. AMD raises total AI market forecast and doubles down on CPUs Lisa laid out a new forecast: the total market for AI data center components and systems could hit $1 trillion per year by 2030, up from their previous estimate of $500 billion by 2028. That’s based on expected 40% annual growth, and the new projection now includes central processing units (CPUs) alongside GPUs. Lisa stressed that AMD’s Epyc CPUs remain the company’s best-selling product, going head-to-head with Intel and Arm-based designs in a competitive market. The company also continues making chips for game consoles, networking, and other devices. While Tuesday’s focus was AI, Lisa told shareholders not to ignore everything else. “The other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders, and that’s actually a very nice place to be,” said Lisa. This was AMD’s first financial analyst day since 2022, held as the company sits in the middle of a global AI arms race, where tech companies are spending hundreds of billions to build out AI infrastructure.

Mike said the quarter went as planned except for a setback involving what he called “a singular data center provider.” CNBC host Jim Cramer pushed harder during their live interview, saying some believed the delays were tied to multiple sites, not just one. Jim named data center facilities in Texas, Oklahoma, and North Carolina, all of which are associated with Core Scientific, the same company CoreWeave tried to acquire earlier this year for $9 billion before shareholders at Core Scientific voted against the deal. Mike did not confirm that connection. He kept repeating that the issue involved one provider. Shares of Core Scientific also closed 10% lower on Tuesday. Company sticks to one-provider explanation During CoreWeave’s quarterly earnings call on Monday, Mark Murphy, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities, asked Mike directly whether Core Scientific was the provider behind the delay. Mike declined to name the partner, and then at one point in the call, he said only one data center was affected out of 41 data centers in the company’s broader portfolio. But at another moment, Nitin Agrawal, the company’s CFO, said the issue came from “a single provider, data center provider partner.” When asked afterward how many sites were impacted, Mike allegedly told CNBC that teams were physically onsite with contractors and Core Scientific workers “every single day” trying to move construction and readiness forward after noticing the slowdown during the third quarter. He said the company responded by sending its own staff to the facilities to speed up progress and ensure the planned capacity expansion would not fall further behind schedule. Mike also told analysts that the delays would not affect the company’s backlog or prevent it from realizing the full value of signed contracts. Revenue rises, guidance falls, deal pipeline remains large CoreWeave reported $1.36 billion in revenue for its third quarter, a 134% increase from the $583.9 million posted one year earlier. Even with the strong revenue growth, the company now forecasts 2025 revenue between $5.05 billion and $5.15 billion, lower than the $5.29 billion average estimate from analysts. The lowered outlook, along with the data center delays, led JPMorgan to downgrade CoreWeave from Overweight to Neutral and reduce its December 2025 price target from $135 to $110, citing rising pressure across infrastructure supply chains. Despite the downgrade, the analysts said their view of the company’s broader long-term position “remains unchanged,” pointing to increasing demand for high-performance computing capacity across AI development and training workloads. JPMorgan also said that CoreWeave revenue growth could bounce back in early 2026, assuming the current bottlenecks resolve and planned infrastructure comes online. CoreWeave has been expanding rapidly as major tech firms compete for GPU-heavy compute. In September, the company announced a $14.2 billion AI cloud infrastructure agreement with Meta, only days after expanding its existing deal with OpenAI to $22.4 billion. Its backlog nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter to $56 billion, with new customers such as CrowdStrike, Poolside, Rakuten, and Jasper joining the platform. The delays have become an important test of how fast CoreWeave can turn demand into working infrastructure at scale. For now, Mike is choosing to hold the line: the company will not publicly blame Core Scientific, even if everyone already knows who the “single provider” is.

The earlier price for the same Digital Edition in Japan was ¥72,980, and the global price for the standard PS5 unit is $499. Orders open Thursday, and the console goes on sale November 21. This is a Japan-only product, not intended for global use. The company said it wants to make the system easier for Japanese players to afford. Hideaki Nishino, chief executive officer of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said during the livestream announcement that the company wants “many players in Japan to enjoy the PS5 and its great lineup of games.” After his statement, the livestream moved directly into details about the model and how it fits into the company’s current market strategy. Sony’s Japan-only pricing mimics Nintendo Switch 2 launch method Sony’s decision closely mimics the strategy of Nintendo, which recently released a Japan-only, Japanese-language edition of the Switch 2 alongside its global versions, which at the time helped drive the fastest launch sales the industry has seen. Nintendo has dominated the console market in Japan across several hardware generations for decades now. This price change also lands not long after Sony was forced to raise PS5 prices globally. Those increases were tied to US tariffs placed on imported goods under President Donald Trump. At the time, those tariffs pushed production and shipping costs higher, and the company said it needed to protect its margins. But in any case, Japan has been a difficult market for the PlayStation platform for years, with local tastes leaning heavily toward Nintendo’s lineup and handheld-oriented play styles. Sony’s profit forecast surges as its entertainment and camera divisions strengthen At the same time, Sony Group Corp. raised its operating profit outlook to ¥1.43 trillion ($9.3 billion) for the fiscal year ending in March, up 8% from its previous projection. That revision came after the company reported ¥429 billion in operating profit for the quarter ending in September. Those numbers beat analyst expectations. Strong performance came from several parts of the company, including entertainment and mobile camera sensors. Recent major anime film releases, including Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, contributed to increased revenue in its entertainment segment. Shares of the company surged as much as 6.7% in Tokyo on Wednesday, reaching the highest intraday level in more than a month. Along with that, Sony announced a ¥100 billion share buyback, matching a similar move from Nintendo following its Switch 2 success. The company also lifted sales and profit forecasts for its smart sensing division, which provides high-end smartphone camera sensors to companies such as Apple, even though it has recently lost some ground to Samsung in that space. Expectations for smartphone demand improved as this year’s iPhone lineup sold better than last year’s. In gaming performance, the company sold 3.9 million PS5 units in the most recent quarter, which is higher than the number sold in the same period last year. Software sales also increased, including titles from Sony’s own first-party development studios. But active PlayStation users measured 119 million, a huge decline from the previous quarter. Sony heads into the year-end sales season facing competition from Nintendo’s Switch 2, which is compatible with the entire existing Switch library and is expected to be one of the most in-demand items during holiday gift purchases in Japan and worldwide.

The deal had advanced to the due diligence stage before both parties “mutually agreed to not move forward.” News of the deal falling through has generated curiosity among crypto enthusiasts; many eyes had been monitoring its progress, as it was one of the largest deals ever for a stablecoin startup. Why did Coinbase call off the BVNK deal? Unfortunately, as at the time of this coverage, it hasn’t been made clear why the two companies chose not to move forward with the deal, even though they had both gone as far as entering into exclusivity in October, meaning the startup temporarily lost the right to entertain offers from other bidders. Had the deal gone through , Coinbase would have paid about $2 billion as acquisition price for BVNK, which is nearly double the $1.1 billion the fintech icon Stripe paid to acquire the stablecoin startup Bridge in a deal that concluded in February. “We’re continuously seeking opportunities to expand on our mission and product offerings,” said Coinbase’s spokesperson in a statement . “After discussing a potential acquisition of BVNK, both parties mutually agreed to not move forward.” The botched deal was one of the high-value acquisitions targeting stablecoin infrastructure, an area Coinbase has been spending massively on during President Trump’s second term. Back in August, the exchange acquired derivatives trading platform Deribit for $2.9 billion and maintains a close relationship with its USDC issuer, Circle. Stablecoin M&A is still at an all-time high Coinbase has been on an M&A spending spree this year, and according to Brian Armstrong, the company’s CEO, the purpose of all the wheeling and dealing is to service the company’s core focus, which revolves around trading and payments. Of course, it is not the only company doing this, and its massive deal with BVNK falling through does not affect the trend, nor does it look like it can discourage the other well-capitalized crypto natives who want to capitalize on the novel application. Over the past year, stablecoin M&A has remained a hot trend in crypto and fintech, with proponents claiming stablecoins can upscale legacy financial infrastructure, speed up cross-border payments, and reduce transaction fees. They have been around for quite some time, but the big banks are only just waking up to their merits, setting off an unprecedented scramble for innovation in the sector. Banks and the largest payments networks like Mastercard and Stripe have been exploring stablecoin acquisitions of their own. Mastercard, one of the most notable TradiFi companies to explore the stablecoin sector, previously expressed interest in acquiring BVNK but is now in discussions to acquire the crypto and stablecoin infrastructure company Zerohash for between $1.5 and $2 billion. Smaller FinTechs and crypto companies are not left out of the race either, with the likes of Modern Treasury, the late-stage payments company, spending about $40 million on acquiring the stablecoin startup Beam.

This significant transaction highlights the continued accumulation strategy of one of Ethereum’s largest holders, now controlling a staggering 355,000 ETH valued at $1.21 billion. Who Is This Mysterious Ethereum Whale? The whale address beginning with 0xE5C has been consistently building its Ethereum position through strategic withdrawals from major exchanges. This investor’s pattern reveals a long-term accumulation strategy rather than short-term trading. The same Ethereum whale previously withdrew 60,000 ETH from Binance and deposited those funds into Aave, demonstrating sophisticated portfolio management. What Does This Massive Withdrawal Signal? Large withdrawals from exchanges typically indicate several possible scenarios: Long-term holding strategy – Moving assets off exchanges suggests reduced intention to sell immediately Confidence in price appreciation – Accumulating during market fluctuations shows belief in future growth DeFi integration plans – Previous Aave deposits hint at potential yield farming strategies This Ethereum whale activity often serves as a market indicator that experienced traders watch closely. When major holders move significant amounts off exchanges, it typically reduces immediate selling pressure and can signal bullish sentiment. How Do Whale Movements Impact Ethereum’s Market? Whale transactions create substantial market effects that ripple through the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The actions of this particular Ethereum whale influence market psychology and can trigger following behaviors among smaller investors. Moreover, reduced exchange supply often precedes price increases as available liquid assets decrease. However, it’s crucial to understand that whale watching requires context. While this withdrawal appears bullish, comprehensive market analysis should consider multiple factors including: Overall market trends and sentiment Broader cryptocurrency adoption rates Regulatory developments affecting Ethereum Technical analysis of price charts What Can Retail Investors Learn From This Ethereum Whale? While most investors don’t have billions to move markets, there are valuable lessons from observing this Ethereum whale ‘s behavior. The consistent accumulation pattern demonstrates conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Additionally, the strategic movement between exchanges and DeFi protocols shows sophisticated asset management that retail investors can emulate on smaller scales. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing often involves: Patience and long-term perspective Strategic accumulation during market dips Proper security practices for stored assets Diversification across different protocols Conclusion: Understanding the Big Picture The recent movements by this substantial Ethereum whale provide fascinating insights into high-level cryptocurrency strategy. While individual transactions shouldn’t dictate investment decisions, they offer valuable context about market sentiment and large investor behavior. The continued accumulation of Ethereum by major holders suggests underlying confidence in the network’s future despite short-term market volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What is a cryptocurrency whale? A cryptocurrency whale is an individual or entity that holds large amounts of a particular digital asset, enough to potentially influence market prices through their trading activities. Why do whales move assets off exchanges? Whales typically move assets off exchanges for long-term storage, enhanced security, participation in DeFi protocols, or to reduce immediate selling pressure on markets. How can I track whale movements? You can monitor whale activity through blockchain explorers like Etherscan, specialized tracking platforms like Whale Alert, or on-chain analysis tools that identify large transactions. Should I follow whale investment strategies? While observing whale movements provides valuable market insights, always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. What risks do whale movements create? Large whale transactions can cause price volatility, create temporary liquidity issues, and sometimes trigger cascading effects in leveraged positions across exchanges. How significant is this particular Ethereum whale? This whale holds approximately 0.3% of all circulating Ethereum, making them one of the largest individual holders and their movements particularly noteworthy for market analysts.

This trend is now rippling through the bond market. Bonds issued by leading “hyperscalers”—tech giants such as Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Oracle Corp. , which are heavily investing in massive data centre projects—have declined in recent weeks. Such bonds are yielding 0.78 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to Bank of America data — the most since April, when volatility erupted in markets following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. In September, the spread was only 0.5 percentage points — a notable shift in investor attitudes. The widening spread reflects growing investor unease over the way tech giants are turning to debt markets to finance their massive investments in AI infrastructure. “The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management. Trillion-dollar AI buildout raises debt and energy concerns JPMorgan estimates that building AI infrastructure will cost more than $5 trillion, requiring financing from every corner of public and private markets—ranging from traditional bonds to private credit and even potential government participation. The enormous scale of AI investment has raised concerns over potential overcapacity, long-term profitability, and energy consumption. Tech titans Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are expected to spend more than $400 billion on data centres in 2026, on top of over $350 billion this year. Large tech firms, including mainstream tech companies, are increasing their borrowing for AI-related infrastructure, despite holding around $350 billion in liquid assets. Analysts estimate that the companies may produce $725 billion in operating cash flow by 2026. Yet, despite this strong position of liquidity, a flood of debt from such high-rated issuers is chasing new money into credit markets, indicative of a wider push towards more leverage to fuel the AI capital expenditure boom. In recent weeks, Meta, Alphabet, and Oracle have each hit the bond market with massive offerings—some extending up to 40 years in maturity. Meta last month secured a $27 billion private debt deal with investors, including Pimco and Blue Owl Capital, to finance its “Hyperion” data centre in Louisiana. The company followed that up with a $30 billion bond sale at the end of October—the largest corporate bond issuance since 2023. Alphabet issued $25 billion in bonds in early November, including $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $7.5 billion in Europe. Meanwhile, Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds in September to fund infrastructure leases such as OpenAI’s “Stargate” data centre in Abilene, Texas. Oracle’s bonds under pressure Analysts say Oracle’s debt has been particularly hard hit. A Financial Times index tracking Oracle’s bonds issued before its latest sale has dropped nearly 5% since mid-September, compared to a 1% decline for the broader Ice Data Services index of U.S. high-grade tech debt. Oracle now has approximately $96 billion in long-term debt, accumulated through deals to lease computing power to the makers of ChatGPT. This OpenAI collaboration is expected to generate $300 billion in revenue over five years. However, Moody’s has cautioned that there are risks associated with Oracle’s dependence on a handful of AI firms to aid growth. Some analysts view the recent sell-off as a healthy sign of price discovery in a new credit cycle. George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group, noted that as long as they are still pricing incremental risk, it’s a good sign. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Her comments come a day after the central bank released a set of long-awaited proposals for regulating systemic stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies and designed for use in everyday payments. Breeden recalls 2023 stress lessons from SVB and Circle depeg The proposal states individual holdings of stablecoins would be limited to £20,000 and require issuers to deposit 40% of the assets backing their tokens with the Bank of England, where they would earn no interest. According to Breeden , the proposed deposit requirement was based on lessons from past stress events, such as the March 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. At the time, even the USDC stablecoin issued by Circle briefly lost its $1 peg after $3.3 billion of its reserves were trapped at the failed bank when depositors rushed to withdraw funds. “Look at what happened with SVB, with Circle – those numbers are broadly in line with that,” she said. “That’s why we’re proposing 40% rather than a smaller number.” Breeden is also in support of the temporary cap of £20,000 per person and £10 million for most businesses, stating that such limits would halve the stress on banks and credit creation caused by deposit outflows into stablecoins. In a banking system like Britain’s, where around 85% of mortgages and consumer loans are funded directly through bank deposits, such a shift could constrict credit availability, she noted. “We have a different set of risks to manage as we transition to bringing in this new form of money,” Breeden said, contrasting the UK’s bank-dependent financial structure with the non-bank finance markets in the United States, which are relatively larger and more liquid than the UK’s. The Bank of England’s latest framework replaces a 2023 plan that would have forced stablecoin issuers to hold 100% of reserves as unremunerated deposits at the central bank, a proposal that industry participants had called unworkable. Diverging path between the US and the UK Breeden’s remarks highlight how differently the United Kingdom is treating stablecoins compared to the United States, where US regulators and the President Donald Trump-led administration have taken a more permissive view of stablecoins and crypto innovation. The current administration has even advanced legislation, such as the GENIUS Act to make extensive provisions for stablecoins as well as their issuers. The Bank’s proposals cover only systemic stablecoins, those intended for use in retail and wholesale payments, leaving the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to supervise non-systemic tokens used primarily for crypto trading. Breeden also stressed the importance of ensuring that consumers can identify which coins are genuinely backed by safe assets and which are not. Without naming specific issuers, she pointed to the global dominance of dollar-based stablecoins such as Tether and Circle, making a reference to El Salvador, where Tether moved its headquarters to earlier this year. Bank of England wants to balance stability and innovation While industry groups continue to say that the proposed caps and liquidity rules could negatively impact the sector’s growth as other parts of the world continue to advance and adopt friendlier regulations, Breeden stated that banks and stablecoin issuers will need to adapt. If stablecoins gain traction, she said, the bank would expect lenders to develop new wholesale funding sources to replace lost deposits. The Bank of England has stated that it will not remove the £20,000 cap until it is satisfied that doing so poses no threat to financial stability.

This dramatic shift indicates changing market dynamics that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital barometer for market sentiment, and this recent decline suggests we might be entering a period of Bitcoin dominance. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Measure? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index provides a clear snapshot of market performance by comparing the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. This important metric excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins to give us a pure view of market dynamics. The index operates on a simple but powerful principle: when 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, we officially enter an altcoin season. The current reading of 26 sits far below the 75 threshold needed to declare an altcoin season. This significant gap tells us that most alternative cryptocurrencies are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. Understanding this Altcoin Season Index movement helps investors make informed decisions about their portfolio allocations. Why Should You Care About This 4-Point Drop? The four-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index represents more than just a number change. It signals a potential shift in market leadership from altcoins back to Bitcoin. Several factors could be driving this movement: Increased institutional Bitcoin interest through ETF approvals Market uncertainty driving investors toward established assets Regulatory developments affecting smaller cryptocurrencies more significantly Risk aversion during periods of economic uncertainty This Altcoin Season Index movement suggests that traders are becoming more cautious about speculative altcoin investments. The index serves as an early warning system for changing market conditions. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Smart investors use the Altcoin Season Index as part of their broader market analysis toolkit. When the index reads below 50, it typically indicates Bitcoin season dominance. However, this doesn’t mean you should completely avoid altcoins. Instead, consider these strategic approaches: Increase Bitcoin exposure during low Altcoin Season Index periods Research fundamentally strong altcoins that may recover quickly Dollar-cost average into promising projects during market dips Monitor the index for signs of reversal above 50 The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 26 suggests that patience and selective investing may be the wisest approach. Remember that market conditions can change rapidly, and the index provides real-time guidance for these shifts. What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Current Levels Historical analysis of the Altcoin Season Index reveals interesting patterns. Periods with readings below 30 have often preceded significant market movements. However, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. The cryptocurrency market evolves constantly, and each cycle brings new dynamics. Previous instances where the Altcoin Season Index dropped to similar levels have typically lasted several weeks to months. During these periods, Bitcoin often demonstrates relative strength while altcoins consolidate or decline. This current movement in the Altcoin Season Index aligns with traditional market rotation patterns seen in other asset classes. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors The Altcoin Season Index decline to 26 provides valuable insights for market participants. First, it confirms that Bitcoin continues to maintain its leadership position in the cryptocurrency space. Second, it suggests that altcoin investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making new investments. Most importantly, the Altcoin Season Index reminds us that cryptocurrency markets move in cycles. While we’re currently in a Bitcoin-dominant phase, conditions can change quickly. Successful investors maintain balanced portfolios and use tools like the Altcoin Season Index to inform their decisions rather than dictate them. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps identify market trends and investor sentiment shifts. How often does the index update? The index updates daily, providing current market conditions and trend analysis for cryptocurrency investors. What does a score of 26 mean? A score of 26 indicates that only 26% of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting strong Bitcoin dominance in the current market. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. The index provides context for market conditions, but investment decisions should consider your strategy, risk tolerance, and research on individual projects. How accurate is the Altcoin Season Index for predicting trends? While helpful for identifying current market conditions, the index works best when combined with other analysis tools and shouldn’t be used alone for predictions. Can the index help with timing investments? It can provide context for market cycles, but successful investing typically involves long-term strategies rather than short-term timing based on single indicators. Found this analysis helpful?

Reports indicate that the regulators’ decision demonstrates the country’s commitment to strengthening digital finance regulations. It also highlights a significant shift in how digital assets in the UK can be traded, cleared, and settled, establishing a significant step towards creating advanced regulated market systems. With this approval, ClearToken solidifies its position as the 57th company to secure approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since the start of the UK’s Cryptoasset Register on January 10, 2020. The FCA approves ClearToken’s cryptocurrency settlement platform ClearToken announced on Tuesday that it had obtained approval from the FCA to operate CT Settle, its Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement platform. Following this approval , analysts noted that the platform will enable users to effectively spot trading stablecoins , regular currencies, and crypto assets. Additionally, they said that once CT Settle is operational, regulated financial institutions will have access to a digital asset settlement system that complies with certain regulatory standards, similar to traditional financial systems. When reporters reached out to ClearToken to comment on the topic of discussion, the company stated that the primary goal of CT Settle is to eliminate obstacles that institutions are reluctant to adopt digital assets, particularly due to concerns over counterparty risk, market efficiency, and liquidity. Niki Beattie, the chair of ClearToken, also weighed in on the situation. As a strategic expert in financial market structure with over 30 years of experience in technology and capital markets, Beattie acknowledged that this authorisation will catalyse the widespread adoption of digital assets. The FCA’s decision to approve ClearToken marks an emerging trend in the UK, where relevant companies are incorporating digital assets into the regular financial system. The UK government intends to integrate digital assets into mainstream finance Reliable sources reported that the Bank of England initiated discussions regarding stablecoins earlier this week and is seeking feedback on new rules that might be implemented next year. This announcement followed reports that the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, had softened his stance on the potential risks that stablecoins pose to financial stability, demonstrating a more pragmatic approach towards regulation. This move comes as individuals raise concerns about the UK falling behind other countries in adopting stablecoins. These worries escalate particularly because the UK is lagging behind the US, which has advanced with the GENIUS Act . Meanwhile, HM Treasury published a draft policy paper in April, outlining its plans to regulate crypto assets. This document aims to describe specific types of digital assets with precision, including crucial activities such as issuance, custody, and trading, while adhering to the UK regulatory framework. The UK government has also made the market for crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) accessible to everyday investors, indicating a broader effort to integrate digital assets into mainstream finance.

While giants such as Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) continue to be huge long-term hold assets, attention is being drawn to newer, high-growth coins that are significantly undervalued compared to their utilizable worth. It is here that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts attention. Valued at a considerably low price of $0.035, MUTM coin is making headlines as one of the best cryptos to buy at the moment, thanks to increasing use cases within DeFi credit markets, tokenized lending systems, as well as a hot presale phase which has garnered substantial interest from investors. With a forecast of a huge 10x-50x price appreciation as it becomes a public asset, Mutuum Finance is increasingly becoming the top crypto to hold before the start of a huge market rally. Cardano (ADA) Stalled at Strong Support as Market Conditions Remain Unclear Cardano (ADA) is presently supported at the level of $0.50, but buyers have not demonstrated adequate strength for a change in trend. A breach of this level would mean a fall to about $0.40, demonstrating the token’s volatility in a stabilization environment. But a breakthrough at $0.61 could mean a rise to $0.75, a level beyond which a possible correction could follow. The condition of ADA, though cautious, lingers behind some of the prominent altcoins, as investors increasingly search for alternatives having potent initial development, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a token witnessing a dramatically growing DeFi ecosystem and becoming one of the best cryptos to buy for early adopters. XRP Extends Consolidation Around Significant Support-Level The current status for Ripple (XRP) indicates a consolidation phase surrounding the $2.16 level, implying a possible upcoming recovery as long as the purchase momentum picks up. Observers are particularly interested in the $2.36–$2.43 region, as a return to this level could potentially set the stage for a rise towards $2.78. Nevertheless, a breach of the $2.16 level could bring about a significant downturn, making investors cautious about the upcoming period. Meanwhile, XRP is facing this complicated market condition, investors have become interested in newer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has continued to receive attention concerning the novel DeFi ecosystem and is widely regarded as the top crypto to watch in 2025. Mutuum Finance is Close to Reaching a Full Capacity Level in Current Phase Mutuum Finance is progressing quite well in the DeFi market, as it is about to enter Phase 7 of its presale, which will reach the maximum limit soon. The tokens can be bought for $0.035, making it the best investment opportunity for buyers as the token price will increase by 20% in Phase 7 to $0.04. After five successful presale phases, Mutuum Finance has become one of the most awaited crypto launches of 2025. The presale event has so far raised over $18.58 million from more than 17,850 investors, undoubtedly marking worldwide acceptance of the project concept. Its transparency, innovation, and sustainable model have brought MUTM into the limelight as one of the best cryptos to buy as the next bull market draws near, cementing its reputation as a top crypto in early-stage DeFi. Stablecoin Launch to Transform DeFi Among the upcoming milestones for Mutuum Finance is the development and deployment of a collateralized stablecoin, which will be pegged to the value of the US dollar. The stablecoin will form the basis for lending on the Mutuum Finance platform. By integrating stable assets into their transactions, Mutuum Finance will be able to offer returns to all of its members, from the common trader to the institutional investors. The development of such a stablecoin increases the strength of Mutuum Finance, making MUTM one of the best cryptos to buy for utility-focused investors. Mutuum Finance has so far raised over $18.58 million from more than 17,850 investors, with the presale’s Phase 6 being close to sold out at $0.035. The fact that the token has a genuine DeFi use case, under-collateralized lending, tokenized lending, as well as a planned stablecoin, means MUTM has huge upside potential as an investment and is considered the top crypto for early investors. The upcoming presale price for Phase 7, at $0.04, is the last chance investment opportunity. Acquire MUTM tokens today in the presale so you can be ready for the next crypto bull market, which may bring 10x-50x returns and establish MUTM as the next big crypto in the DeFi market.

54289062,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=852133,1762909202,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54289062.jpeg,Most Reliable Bitcoin Boom Indicator Just Went Off-Script: Expert,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/most-reliable-bitcoin-boom-indicator-off-script/,"Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony “The Bull” Severino argues that Bitcoin’s most dependable macro tell—the copper-to-gold ratio—has broken character at the very moment the market typically enters a parabolic phase, leaving the post-halving script in disarray and altcoins without their usual rotation. Why The Copper/Gold Ratio Is Crucial For Bitcoin In a 16-minute video analysis published on November 10, Severino frames the copper/gold ratio as a “growth versus fear index,” where copper strength signals expansion, rising yields and appetite for risk, while gold outperformance maps to recession risk, falling yields and risk-off behavior. “When gold is performing better than copper, it typically means economic slowdown [and] general recession fears,” he said, adding that copper’s industrial demand anchors the ratio to the business cycle. The punchline: the ratio’s cyclical turn that historically coincides with Bitcoin’s vertical phase simply never arrived. “They say the most dangerous thing to say in investing is that this time is different. Well, this time is different,” Severino said. “The business cycle based on the copper versus gold ratio did not turn back up.” Severino contends that the four-year halving lore is at best incomplete and at worst misattributed. He overlays prior halving dates with a Fisher Transform signal on the copper/gold ratio and observes that the true inflection has historically been macro, not supply-driven. “I never really thought it was the halving,” he said. “The same halving date started a bull run in the Nasdaq the halving in Bitcoin would not really have any effect on tech stocks.” In his construction, the halving has coincided with, rather than caused, the ratio’s upswing and a risk-on impulse that typically propels Bitcoin beyond prior highs into a final, parabolic leg. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? Key Reasons Explained This cycle diverged. After briefly producing a “higher high” in the ratio—the first since roughly 2010—copper/gold failed to establish a higher low and instead printed “another lower low,” marking, in Severino’s words, the lowest reading in about 15 years on his chart—“since pretty much since the Great Recession.” The Fisher Transform that had historically flipped up to confirm the risk-on window never delivered the full follow-through. “It was supposed to send Bitcoin into the final stage of its parabolic rally […] we didn’t go parabolic after going above all-time high. We’re just kind of meandering sideways.” Is The Bitcoin Cycle Top In? Timing-wise, that failure matters. Severino measures roughly a year between the ratio’s go-signal and Bitcoin’s cycle top in prior episodes. By that yardstick, “we really should have topped” already or, if anchored to the March breakout above the 2021 high, would at least be entering a risk-off window. But without the definitive risk-on impulse, the cycle landmarks blur. “Because we didn’t get the full risk on, I don’t know where the risk off signal is,” he said. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Analysis: Pre-Rally Signals Point To $180,000 Target In Q1 2026 The implications extend to altcoins and Bitcoin dominance. Historically, the ratio’s green “risk-on” phase lined up with “alt season,” but this time the setup never materialized. “You normally get your alt season at these green points […] We didn’t get it here,” Severino said, noting Bitcoin dominance is holding key support on higher-timeframe views. He also highlights an “extremely strong negative correlation” between Bitcoin and the copper/gold ratio at present; in past cycles, correlation drifting toward zero tended to coincide with altseason. “None of the conditions for altcoin season seem to be here based on past economic signals,” he added. Severino stops short of a deterministic call. The ratio’s trend structure is ambiguous—one failed breakout from a long downtrend does not make an uptrend—and the Fisher signal could still turn. But until it does, he argues, macro says caution. “We’re still in the fear sort of side of this ratio. We need to still be defensive and we should be risk off. When this starts to turn back up, we can consider being bullish risk assets again.” That ambiguity, he suggests, is precisely why Bitcoin’s post-ATH drift has defied the well-worn four-year narrative: “It just didn’t do the same thing as it did in the past […] We are different. It is genuinely different this time.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,486.

Related Reading: Hedera Hashgraph Added To Google BigQuery Public Datasets The new guidance, issued under Revenue Procedure 2025-31, allows ETFs and trusts holding proof-of-stake (PoS) assets such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to stake their holdings and distribute staking rewards directly to investors, without jeopardizing their tax status. U.S. Treasury Opens Door for Crypto ETF Staking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the advances as a major step in keeping the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain innovation. The framework introduces a “ safe harbor ” for regulated funds, clarifying how staking rewards will be taxed and distributed. Investors will now pay taxes only when they take control of rewards, while the ETFs themselves remain exempt from trust-level taxation. Industry experts hailed the decision as the final piece of regulatory clarity needed to unlock institutional participation in staking. Analysts estimate the change could bring $3 billion to $6 billion in new inflows to staking-based crypto products within the next year. Strict Compliance Rules for Fund Managers To qualify under the new framework, ETFs must meet specific conditions. Funds can only hold a single digital asset and cash, work with qualified custodians for key management, and engage independent staking providers to handle validator operations. This structure ensures investor protection while bridging traditional finance and decentralized blockchain systems. It mirrors earlier SEC approvals from September 2025, which cleared listing rules for crypto ETFs and confirmed that certain staking operations do not constitute unregistered securities. Bill Hughes, senior counsel at Consensys, said the policy “eliminates the biggest legal and tax uncertainty that kept institutions from integrating staking into regulated products.” The guidance, he added, gives fund sponsors confidence to offer yield-bearing ETFs that generate passive income for investors through network validation. From Policy Uncertainty to Passive Income Until now, U.S. fund managers had avoided staking due to regulatory ambiguity and fear of losing favorable tax treatment. With this guidance, both retail and institutional investors can earn 3–7% annual staking rewards on assets like ETH and SOL through ETFs, without running their own nodes or managing wallets. The announcement follows weeks of government inactivity during the record 40-day U.S. shutdown , making it one of the first major regulatory actions since the reopening. It signals a return to policy momentum and a broader embrace of digital assets by Washington. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dump Finally Over?

The Scion Asset Management founder said that the major cloud and AI infrastructure companies, what he called “hyperscalers,” are bending accounting rules to make their earnings look stronger than they really are. Burry warns of overstated profits in ORCL, META through 2028 In a post Monday on X, Burry said these tech giants are understating depreciation expenses by pretending their AI chips and servers will last longer than they actually do. “Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings—one of the more common frauds of the modern era,” he wrote. Burry added that companies massively increasing capital spending on Nvidia chips and servers with two-to-three-year product cycles should not be extending the lifespan of that hardware on paper. Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, this accounting method will understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the AI industry. He said Oracle’s profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and Meta’s by about 21% by 2028. Burry’s accusation points at how GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) lets companies decide the “useful life” of an asset. When a business buys big-ticket equipment like servers or semiconductors, it spreads the cost over several years. If the company claims those assets last longer, the annual depreciation expense becomes smaller, which makes profits appear larger. Burry said this practice distorts the truth about how quickly AI infrastructure loses value. CNBC reported it was unable to independently verify whether these companies are doing this. Burry doubles down with new shorts and industry backlash Burry, famous for betting against the housing market before the 2008 financial crisis, had last week revealed new put options against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, with about $187 million in puts against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir, though the exact strike prices and expiration dates weren’t listed in his SEC filing. Cryptopolitan later reported that Alex Karp, the Palantir CEO, hit back at Burry’s bet, calling it “super weird” and “bats— crazy.” Despite his comments, Nvidia stock surged nearly 6% on Monday after a 7% crash last week, while Palantir rose by 9% following an 11% decline before. But Tuesday was not so good for Nvidia’s stock, specifically SoftBank announced it had sold its entire stake in what is the most valuable company on earth (about 32.1 million shares worth $5.83 billion). That made NVDA lose around 3% while SoftBank itself had slid by more than 7% as Wednesday.

If Republicans vote for him, Deaton would gain the party’s ballot line, a significant boost to his campaign heading into November. Deaton’s introduction to national politics came as he followed a plethora of news stories in the case filed against Ripple Labs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He was one of thousands of XRP investors who claimed they believed the SEC had harmed ordinary people with its delayed actions. Over the years, his work and the criticism he has heaped upon federal agencies have made him a figure of authority to many crypto investors on what is known as “Crypto Twitter.” Massachusetts remains a tough political ground for him. The state has one of the most reliably Democratic electorates in the country. Deaton lost to Warren in 2024 by almost 20 percentage points. Deaton paints himself as the reform candidate Deaton is defining his new campaign as a larger effort focused on government accountability, transparency, and economic equity . His website addresses issues such as supporting working families, combating inflation, improving services for veterans, and enhancing public safety. Unlike his last race, crypto isn’t the basis of his platform. This strategic shift appears deliberate. Five years later, in 2024, Deaton is running as an unabashed crypto rights candidate at a time when the industry thought it was fighting for regulatory existence. His race against Warren — a vocal critic of digital assets — spurred donors and online supporters to action. But circumstances have changed. The friendlier tone of the second Trump administration toward digital asset policy has alleviated some anxieties in the industry. By contrast, Sen. Markey, who is not a pro-crypto stalwart, lacks the same national profile or emotional impact in the crypto industry that Warren holds. That means, political analysts say, that Deaton will need to start reaching out more broadly, especially to independents and working-class conservatives outside the state’s urban centres. Crypto plays less of a visible role this time Although crypto is less visible in his campaign messaging, the industry remains associated with his brand and fundraising operation. His campaign donation page accepts donations in a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. His bio also mentions his previous defence of XRP’s investors and his criticism of how the SEC is handling this endeavour. One major variable that could determine how far his campaign gets: backing from one of crypto’s big political action committees, notably Fairshake. Against that backdrop, the PAC invested tens of millions in Senate and House races in 2024, influencing outcomes in states with close margins. Deaton has publicly expressed his belief that he could win if Fairshake and other industry groups decide to invest in the race. Last year, however, Fairshake did not support his race against Warren and instead sought to target races in battleground states. To date, the PAC has not indicated that it will support him in 2026. Without that support, Deaton could be at a disadvantage in matching Sen. Markey’s fundraising muscle — the senator has deep ties to both state and national Democratic donor networks. It’s still early in the race. Deaton needs first to gain the support of the state GOP, continue growing his grassroots base, and demonstrate that he can become more than just a candidate adored by crypto advocates. If he is successful, the race could once again draw national attention.

54289510,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/the-importance-of-education-and-awareness-in-improving-cryptos-public-perception,1762909924,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/54289510.jpeg,The Importance of Education and Awareness in Improving Crypto’s Public Perception,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/the-importance-of-education-and-awareness-in-improving-cryptos-public-perception,"As blockchain technology and cryptocurrency become more prevalent in mainstream finance and society, the need for clear, effective education and awareness is growing. Many people are still unfamiliar with basic blockchain and crypto concepts like digital wallets, NFTs, and crypto exchanges. Increasing public knowledge of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies is an important initiative to assist people new to these concepts in dispelling myths and reducing public scepticism. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Knowledge Gaps There exist many gaps in public understanding of blockchain technology. Recent studies have indicated that more than 70% of American adults do not invest in cryptocurrency since nearly half of non-investors lack the basic understanding of how it works. In addition, nearly 60% can define cryptocurrency, and roughly 80% have difficulty explaining the basics of blockchain infrastructure. These gaps further worsen the barriers to integrating blockchain technology into mainstream financial systems and society, and lead to unavoidable issues such as vulnerabilities to scams, technology misuse, and investment losses. Education Through Entertainment and Gamification Bridging knowledge gaps in blockchain understanding requires creative and strategic educational approaches. One such approach is using entertainment platforms such as iGaming to introduce people to basic blockchain and crypto concepts while they play. Play-to-earn systems made possible by the blockchain and casual mobile app crypto games make the learning experience interactive and demystify crypto mechanics through gameplay. Online casinos are great examples of how entertainment and gaming not only introduce people to crypto concepts but also help to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Many online casinos support various cryptocurrencies, allowing players to gain experience with Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Players exploring online gaming casinos with Cardplayer get to experience gamified rewards and utilise the fast, secure payment systems powered by cryptocurrencies. The Importance of Community Learning Resources In addition to gamified learning resources, many free community learning resources have started providing crypto education to the public. These resources are often created by crypto industry experts and advocates with the intent of enabling decentralised education. Free resources such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer structured online educational programs, while online communities, such as BitcoinTalk and Reddit, provide community-driven forums and posts created by industry experts. These community resources are crucial tools required for increasing accessibility to crypto education. Educational Programs Offered by Traditional Educational Institutions In addition to community-led educational resources, many traditional educational institutions are now offering accredited crypto academic programs. These programs include full online and in-person courses on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency that are created by industry experts and developers. Accredited academic courses are playing an important role in legitimising crypto education and increasing public trust in crypto services. Major universities and educational institutions like MIT, Duke, and NYU provide crypto education with scholarly credibility, as these institutions validate blockchain and crypto learning as a new field of computer science. The Role of Media in Crypto Education The media plays an important role in changing the negative perceptions of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Leveraging media platforms provides a convenient way to reach the broader public and educate people on crypto through the means of documentaries, news features, and talk shows. Mainstream media’s ubiquity and accessibility provide an unobtrusive entry point for blockchain technology and crypto education. These platforms allow for knowledge to be packaged in bite-sized and balanced educational resources. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The dramatic increase has prompted comparisons to digital assets, with analysts exploring how such a gain would translate for cryptocurrencies like XRP. Gold’s Market Value Surged by Over $700 Billion in a Day Over the past week, gold prices have recovered sharply from a low of $3,928 per ounce on November 4, climbing above $4,000 and posting four consecutive daily advances. On November 10, the asset saw its steepest single-day increase since early May, rising 2.85 % to close near $4,115 per ounce. Data from the World Gold Council show that global above-ground gold reserves currently total about 216,265 metric tons, equivalent to 6.954 billion ounces. Using those figures, gold’s estimated market capitalization at the start of November 10 stood near $27.85 trillion, based on the $4,005 opening price. By the close of the day, the value of those reserves reached approximately $28.62 trillion, reflecting a one-day increase of $765.1 billion. This sharp expansion underscores gold’s continued strength as a global store of value amid changing market conditions. XRP’s Market Potential Under a Similar Condition For context, even the entire cryptocurrency market, valued at roughly $3.48 trillion, has not experienced a single-day increase on the scale of gold’s $765 billion surge. The largest daily market-wide gain in recent weeks was about $203 billion, recorded on October 12 during a 5.57 % rise across major tokens. On November 10, XRP also performed well, appreciating 6.76 %, surpassing gold’s percentage gain. However, due to its smaller overall valuation, the move translated to a more modest $9.6 billion addition, bringing its market capitalization to $151.82 billion. To assess the implications of a comparable $765 billion rise for XRP, it helps to apply the same scale of market growth. If XRP’s valuation expanded by that amount from its current level of about $146.88 billion, its market capitalization would reach approximately $911.88 billion. With an estimated 60 billion XRP tokens in circulation, a total valuation of $911.88 billion would correspond to a theoretical price of roughly $15.20 per token. This figure does not represent a forecast but a mathematical extrapolation based on gold’s one-day performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The comparison highlights how market capitalization changes directly affect token pricing in finite-supply digital assets. While such an increase is unlikely to occur within a single trading session, it provides insight into the potential scale of XRP’s valuation under extreme liquidity conditions. Analyst Expectations and Broader Market Context Interestingly, several market analysts have cited $15 as a realistic long-term target for XRP under favorable conditions. Commentators, including Vincent Van Code, CryptoInsightUK, and EGRAG Crypto, have all suggested similar price levels, referencing macroeconomic trends and growing institutional adoption. While XRP’s daily market movements remain influenced by broader crypto volatility, gold’s latest surge serves as a useful benchmark for understanding how large-scale capital inflows could affect digital-asset valuations if comparable momentum ever reached the sector. Gold’s $765 billion daily increase underscores the magnitude of value shifts that can occur in high-liquidity markets. Applying the same growth scale to XRP would place its price near $15 , aligning with some analysts’ long-term projections. Although such an outcome remains hypothetical, it illustrates the vast potential that large-scale investment inflows could have on digital-asset capitalization.

Despite uncertainty among traders, key on-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that a new surge may be brewing — provided current momentum continues to build. According to top analyst MorenoDV, Bitcoin is entering a liquidity configuration that has only appeared a handful of times since 2020, each marking a pivotal turning point in the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. He explains that when stablecoin reserves reach extreme levels relative to Bitcoin’s market cap, the market rarely stays quiet for long. This setup typically signals an imbalance between available liquidity and Bitcoin’s valuation — meaning that a large pool of “dry powder” is sitting on the sidelines, waiting to be deployed. Historically, such conditions have preceded strong directional moves, either upward or downward, depending on how confidence returns to the market. Stablecoin Liquidity Suggests a Critical Turning Point for Bitcoin According to MorenoDV, one of the most important indicators to watch right now is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) — a metric that compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total market cap of all stablecoins. When SSR drops, it means stablecoin liquidity is expanding relative to Bitcoin’s value — or, in simpler terms, there’s more “dry powder” sitting on the sidelines waiting to be deployed. Currently, the SSR has fallen back to its lower historical range around 13, the same zone that marked market bottoms in mid-2021 and again throughout 2024. In each of those instances, Bitcoin was consolidating quietly before launching into strong recovery rallies. A similar pattern can be seen in the Binance Bitcoin/Stablecoin Reserve Ratio, which shows stablecoin reserves rising while BTC reserves continue to decline. This dynamic often signals that investors are positioning capital for accumulation — a sign of seller exhaustion and structural capitulation where weak hands exit, and strong hands begin quietly rebuilding positions. MorenoDV notes that from a risk/reward standpoint, these phases historically present asymmetric opportunities — limited downside, but expanding upside as liquidity rotates back into Bitcoin. Still, this zone acts as both an accumulation opportunity and a final support line. If these liquidity levels hold, Bitcoin could soon see another upward impulse toward new highs. But if they break decisively, it may confirm the end of the current cycle’s structure and trigger a deeper revaluation phase before the next growth leg begins. Holding the Line Above $100K Bitcoin continues to defend the $100K–$105K range, a key structural zone that has served as both support and consolidation throughout the cycle. On the weekly chart, BTC remains above its 50-week moving average (blue line) — a level that has historically acted as a springboard for mid-cycle recoveries. The current candle shows a mild rebound after testing the $104K region, signaling that bulls are attempting to regain control. However, volume remains subdued compared to previous rallies, indicating a cautious tone among market participants following recent liquidations. A decisive close above $108K–$110K would strengthen bullish momentum and confirm a potential continuation toward the $115K–$120K resistance zone. Conversely, losing the 50-week MA could trigger a retest of lower supports near $95K–$98K, marking a deeper correction phase. Despite the mixed sentiment, the structure remains intact within a broader uptrend. The long-term moving averages — particularly the 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) — continue to slope upward, confirming that Bitcoin’s macro trend is still bullish.

Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Flipped Positive Recently In a new post on X, Julio Moreno, head of research at on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, has talked about the latest trend in the Apparent Demand for Bitcoin. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the amount of spot demand that’s currently present for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark The indicator’s value is calculated by taking the difference between BTC’s production and changes in its inventory. “Production” here refers to the amount that miners are introducing into circulation each day. Similarly, the asset’s “inventory” is the amount stashed away in the 1-year inactive supply. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows how the 30-day sum of the Apparent Demand has changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day sum of the Bitcoin Apparent Demand fell into the negative territory last month, suggesting demand for the asset was decreasing. Recently, however, the metric has witnessed a sharp surge back into the positive territory. Thus, it would appear that, for the first time since early October, demand for BTC is growing again. While spot buying demand may be growing now, attention over in the perpetual futures market is down. As on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post, the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest has remained at low levels since last month’s leverage flush. The Futures Open Interest here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to Bitcoin that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. From the chart, it’s visible this metric saw a huge plunge in October as the drawdown in the BTC price liquidated a large amount of positions. The indicator has remained at its lows since this decline, indicating that there isn’t much speculative buildup happening in the market. “Derivatives activity has slowed materially, mirroring the broader backdrop of subdued market sentiment,” noted Glassnode. Related Reading: XRP Jumps To $2.56 Despite 240% Increase In Profit Taking Another side of the sector where demand has been weak is the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As the chart shared by Glassnode in a separate X post shows, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs have mostly seen outflows since early October. “This trend points to a broader de-risking phase among ETF investors,” explained the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced some of its latest recovery as its price has come down to $103,200.

Fortune reported the companies were in late-stage discussions pending due diligence, and the firms entered exclusivity in October, which barred BVNK from engaging other bidders. It was not immediately clear why the deal collapsed. The deal was expected to be closed later this year or early next, given the pace of diligence and the exclusivity terms. Coinbase has ended acquisition talks with U.K.-based stablecoin infrastructure firm BVNK, which had been valued at around $2 billion. A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that the two companies entered an exclusivity period in October and conducted due diligence, but… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 11, 2025 Coinbase didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Coinbase Deal Collapse Terminates What Could Have Been Largest Stablecoin Acquisition Yet The move ends what would have been one of the largest stablecoin-focused acquisitions to date. BVNK helps customers use stablecoins for payments and cross-border transfers, and had become a target as exchanges and payments companies race to build settlement rails around dollar-linked tokens. For scale, Stripe paid about $1.1b to acquire stablecoin startup Bridge in a deal that closed in February. At $2b, the BVNK purchase would have nearly doubled that price tag. Coinbase’s interest came with an inside view. Coinbase Ventures is an investor in BVNK, alongside Haun Ventures, Tiger Global, and the venture arms of Visa and Citi. BVNK raised $50m in December and was valued at roughly $750m at the time. BVNK May Attract New Suitors After Coinbase Walks Away From $2B Deal Fortune previously noted both Coinbase and Mastercard were in advanced discussions about a BVNK deal , signaling strong demand for assets that can speed settlement and lower costs in global payments. The decision now removes a key uncertainty from Coinbase’s short-term strategy. Even so, the exchange remains central to rising stablecoin flows. Meanwhile, BVNK continues to be well-funded and active in a market still attracting major buyers. Looking ahead, investors will be watching closely. BVNK may reopen talks with new bidders, while Coinbase could turn its focus to smaller acquisitions or partnerships to expand its stablecoin and payments business.

Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden has issued a stark warning that could reshape how Britain approaches digital currency regulation. Her recent statements highlight how easing stablecoin rules might create dangerous vulnerabilities in our financial system. Why Stablecoin Rules Matter for Financial Security Sarah Breeden’s interview with Reuters revealed serious concerns about the potential consequences of relaxed stablecoin regulations. She emphasized that these digital assets represent more than just technological innovation – they introduce significant risks that must be carefully managed. The stability of our entire financial ecosystem could depend on getting these stablecoin rules right. According to Breeden, the introduction of new forms of money through stablecoins presents challenges that regulators cannot ignore. She specifically warned that inadequate stablecoin rules could undermine financial stability and potentially trigger a credit crisis. This isn’t just theoretical – we’ve seen how quickly digital asset volatility can spread to traditional markets. How Holding Limits Protect Against Bank Runs The Bank of England has taken concrete steps to address these concerns through specific holding limitations. Here’s what you need to know about the new caps: Individual investors: £10,000 maximum (approximately $12,700) Businesses: £10 million maximum (approximately $12.7 million) These stablecoin rules serve a crucial purpose. Breeden explained that setting holding limits helps reduce pressure on banks during potential crisis situations. When people can only hold limited amounts of stablecoins, it prevents massive, rapid withdrawals that could overwhelm traditional banking institutions. The Hidden Dangers of Inadequate Stablecoin Regulation What makes these stablecoin rules so essential? The answer lies in understanding the interconnected nature of modern finance. Stablecoins aren’t isolated digital tokens – they’re increasingly linked to traditional banking systems and credit markets. Weak stablecoin rules could create domino effects that spread throughout the entire financial ecosystem. Breeden’s warning comes at a critical time as more countries consider their approach to digital currency regulation. The UK’s cautious stance on stablecoin rules reflects lessons learned from previous financial crises and recent crypto market turbulence. Proper stablecoin rules aren’t about stifling innovation but about ensuring that progress doesn’t come at the cost of financial stability. What These Stablecoin Rules Mean for Investors and Businesses For individual investors and corporations, understanding these stablecoin rules is essential for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. The holding limits provide clear boundaries while the broader regulatory framework aims to create a safer environment for everyone participating in the crypto economy. The Bank of England’s approach to stablecoin rules demonstrates how central banks worldwide are grappling with the challenge of integrating new financial technologies while maintaining system stability. As Breeden noted, getting these stablecoin rules wrong could have consequences far beyond the crypto sector alone. Conclusion: Balancing Innovation and Protection The Bank of England’s position on stablecoin rules represents a careful balancing act between encouraging financial innovation and protecting economic stability. While some may view the regulations as restrictive, Breeden’s warnings highlight the genuine risks of moving too quickly without proper safeguards. The future of digital finance depends on getting these stablecoin rules right from the beginning. Frequently Asked Questions What are the main concerns about easing stablecoin regulations? The primary concern is that relaxed stablecoin rules could undermine financial stability and potentially trigger a credit crisis by creating vulnerabilities in the banking system. What are the specific holding limits for stablecoins in the UK? The Bank of England has set caps of £10,000 for individual investors and £10 million for businesses regarding stablecoin holdings. How do holding limits protect against bank runs? Setting maximum holding amounts reduces the pressure on banks during crisis situations by preventing massive, rapid withdrawals that could overwhelm traditional banking institutions. Why does the Bank of England consider stablecoins risky? Stablecoins introduce new forms of money that present significant risks to financial stability, particularly because of their potential connections to traditional banking and credit systems. Are other countries implementing similar stablecoin rules? Many countries are developing their own approaches to stablecoin regulation, with the UK taking a particularly cautious stance based on financial stability concerns. How might these rules affect cryptocurrency innovation? While the rules create boundaries, they’re designed to allow innovation to continue within a framework that protects overall financial stability. Found this analysis of stablecoin regulation helpful?

Bitwise launched the first U.S. Solana ETF, drawing $420mn despite the SEC shutdown, while SoFi Bank became the first in the U.S. to enable direct Bitcoin trading for 12.6mn users. At the same time, China’s hacking accusations against the U.S. added fresh geopolitical tension to an already volatile market. Bitwise Launches First U.S. Solana ETF Despite SEC Shutdown Bitwise Asset Management has made history by launching the first spot Solana ETF (ticker: BSOL) on the New York Stock Exchange. The fund debuted on October 28, becoming the first U.S. altcoin-based ETF and marking a major milestone for the crypto industry.

The product gives investors a regulated and secure way to gain exposure to Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SoFi Becomes First U.S. Bank to Offer Bitcoin Trading SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) has become the first national bank in the United States to let customers buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin directly within their bank accounts. The feature is part of the new SoFi Crypto platform, which will roll out to 12.6 million users by the end of 2025. JUST IN: SoFi became the first national chartered bank to allow #Bitcoin and crypto trading. pic.twitter.com/NRt3xZLHO6 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 11, 2025 CEO Anthony Noto called it a “pivotal moment when banking meets crypto,” describing it as a secure and regulated way for consumers to enter digital assets. The launch follows new OCC and FDIC guidelines under President Trump’s deregulatory agenda, allowing banks to handle cryptocurrency trading and custody. Unlike exchanges, SoFi provides FDIC-insured accounts and strict compliance monitoring, appealing to cautious investors. SoFi also plans to launch crypto-integrated lending and a stablecoin, signaling its deeper move into blockchain finance and boosting confidence in Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption. China Accuses U.S. of Role in Massive Bitcoin Hack China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) has accused the United States of involvement in one of the largest Bitcoin thefts in history, the 2020 hack of the LuBian mining pool, which resulted in the loss of 127,000 BTC. Beijing claims the breach was part of a coordinated cyber operation linked to U.S. intelligence agencies. The stolen Bitcoin, worth billions of dollars, has reportedly been traced across multiple wallets and mixers. The accusation adds new tension to the ongoing U.S.–China tech and cybersecurity rivalry, as both nations ramp up blockchain oversight and digital finance security measures. Bitcoin Holds $103K as Bulls Defend Key Support Zone Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading near $103,300, consolidating after last week’s high around $107,500. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is forming a rising wedge, a pattern that often signals short-term pullbacks after strong rallies. The latest rejection near the wedge top came with a bearish engulfing candle, hinting at profit-taking. Despite the dip, BTC stays above the 20-EMA, showing that bullish sentiment remains intact. The RSI at 45 points to neutral momentum, leaving room for a rebound if buyers step in near support. The next key levels sit at $101,400 and $99,200, both areas where demand previously returned. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A move above $104,500 could confirm renewed bullish momentum, targeting $107,500 and $110,500 — the wedge’s upper boundary. But a break below $101,400 risks deeper losses toward $99,200. For traders, buying dips around $101K–$103K with stops below $99K remains the preferred setup. If momentum rebuilds, Bitcoin could aim for $111,000, supported by rising institutional inflows and steady macro sentiment. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $26.8 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013255 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

According to court documents, Qian – also known as the Chinese “Goddess Of Wealth” – pleaded guilty on September 29, 2025 to acquiring and possessing criminal property in the form of Bitcoin. Reports have disclosed that police seized more than 61,000 BTC during a 2018 raid, an amount worth at least $6.5 billion at current market rates. Major Seizure Prompts Court Action Investigators say the haul came from an investment scheme run in China between 2014 and 2017. Prosecutors link the activity to a company named Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology Co Ltd, which allegedly promised high returns to thousands of people. Reports put the number of victims at more than 128,000. That figure has raised questions about how any recovered funds could be shared among so many claimants. China’s “Goddess Of Wealth” Faces Jail In UK Over $6 Billion Bitcoin Scam https://t.co/LdnTWVl3xz pic.twitter.com/M7b329kEkB — NDTV WORLD (@NDTVWORLD) November 10, 2025 The Arrest And The Evidence Trail According to police statements, Qian left China around 2017 and later used false travel documents, including a St Kitts & Nevis passport, to live in the UK. In 2018, officers searched a property in Hampstead and found wallets and devices that helped them trace the crypto holdings. Records shown in court link transfers and accounts to the scheme that defrauded investors . The items seized in that operation are central to the Crown’s case and to plans for victim compensation. Compensation And Cross-Border Challenges Reports have outlined the legal and practical hurdles ahead. The Bitcoin seized in 2018 has risen massively in value since then, which complicates decisions about how to return money to those harmed. Lawyers say cross-border claims between UK authorities and Chinese victims could take years to sort out. Based on reports, one worry is conflicting claims over who is entitled to the assets and whether victims will receive the current market value of the Bitcoin or the value at the time of seizure. Sentencing Timeline And Possible Penalties According to court sources, Qian could face up to 14 years behind bars under the charges she admitted. Sentencing was expected to take place soon after the guilty plea, although exact dates have not been confirmed publicly by the court in all outlets. Judges will consider the scale of the loss, the number of victims, and the role Qian played in moving or hiding the funds when deciding the sentence. Investigations And Next Steps UK authorities including the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service are coordinating efforts to secure the remaining assets and to set up processes for victims to claim funds.

Bitcoin Is Struggling At This Make-Or-Break Zone,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-at-make-or-break-zone/,"Bitcoin is currently locked in a decisive struggle at a make-or-break resistance zone. After a strong attempt to push higher, BTC was rejected and has retreated to a pivotal support area. The next few sessions are crucial: bulls must quickly reclaim the critical overhead resistance, or risk triggering a wider market retreat back toward lower support levels. Battle At Resistance: Can Bitcoin Reclaim $107,000–$108,000? In a recent update, Crypto Candy noted that Bitcoin’s price action continues to unfold largely as anticipated, maintaining strength and structure across key levels. After enduring a volatile period, BTC held firmly within the $99,000–$101,000 support zone. This strong defense from buyers set the stage for a rebound toward the upper resistance area around $107,000–$108,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Valuation Reset: MVRV Slides Into Macro Correction Territory — What This Means At present, the $107,000–$108,000 range is acting as a critical barrier, and Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim this zone could determine its short-term direction. The current consolidation suggests a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with buyers aiming to push for a breakout, while sellers are attempting to cap further upside. The outcome of this battle may set the tone for the next decisive move in the market. If the current momentum fails to hold, Crypto Candy suggests a pullback to lower levels could follow, giving bears another short-term edge. However, Crypto Candy added that if Bitcoin successfully reclaims the $107,000–$108,000 range, the market could shift back in favor of the bulls. Such a breakout would likely trigger renewed buying pressure, potentially driving the price higher toward the $116,000–$118,000 zone or even beyond. BTC Faces Rejection At Resistance, Support At $105,000 In Focus Presenting an outlook, Crypto VIP Signal revealed that BTC has recently reached a key resistance area but was immediately rejected on its first attempt. This initial failure suggests that a significant pocket of selling pressure is positioned at that level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Lacks Conviction, Market Signals Another Pullback Risk Following this rejection, the price has now moved down to the $105,000 support level. The analyst stresses that the market must hold this specific price point, as it represents a crucial line of defense against a deeper pullback. Crypto VIP Signal warns that if there is a decisive break and a close below $105,000, the market could see a significant drop toward the next major support in the $103,000 zone. However, the crypto analyst highlighted that another attempt to retest the initial resistance area is expected in the coming days. This implies the rejection may be a healthy setback before bulls try to breach the critical ceiling again.

The past 24 hours revealed staggering numbers that every cryptocurrency trader needs to understand. Massive crypto futures liquidations totaling over $260 million have shaken the market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the carnage. These dramatic moves highlight the intense volatility and risks inherent in leveraged trading. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Crypto futures liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close traders’ positions due to insufficient margin. This happens when price movements go against leveraged positions. Understanding these crypto futures liquidations helps traders gauge market sentiment and potential price pressure points. Moreover, large-scale liquidations often create cascading effects that amplify market moves. Breaking Down the 24-Hour Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The recent crypto futures liquidations data reveals some concerning patterns. Bitcoin saw $114 million in liquidations, with an overwhelming 84.86% being long positions. Similarly, Ethereum experienced $108 million in crypto futures liquidations, with longs comprising 90.26% of the total. Zecoin followed with $38.22 million liquidated, though its long ratio was slightly lower at 74.85%. Bitcoin: $114 million liquidated (84.86% longs) Ethereum: $108 million liquidated (90.26% longs) Zcash: $38.22 million liquidated (74.85% longs) Why Are Long Positions Dominating These Crypto Futures Liquidations? The dominance of long positions in recent crypto futures liquidations suggests most traders were betting on price increases. When markets move against these expectations, leveraged long positions become vulnerable. Several factors contribute to this pattern, including over-optimistic sentiment, excessive leverage usage, and sudden market reversals that catch traders off guard. How Can Traders Protect Against Crypto Futures Liquidations? Managing risk is crucial when trading futures to avoid becoming part of crypto futures liquidations statistics. Consider these strategies to protect your positions: Use appropriate position sizing and avoid over-leveraging Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Monitor funding rates and market sentiment indicators Maintain adequate margin buffers for volatility spikes What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Signal for Market Direction? Large-scale crypto futures liquidations often indicate potential trend changes or consolidation periods. The current data suggests significant long positioning was cleared, which might relieve some selling pressure. However, traders should watch for follow-through price action and volume confirmation before making new directional bets. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidations What triggers crypto futures liquidations? Crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s position loses enough value that their remaining margin cannot cover potential losses, triggering automatic closure by the exchange. Why are long positions more vulnerable to liquidation? Long positions become vulnerable during price declines because traders using leverage have less room for error before hitting margin call thresholds. How can I monitor upcoming liquidation levels? Many trading platforms and analytics websites provide liquidation heatmaps showing potential liquidation clusters at different price levels. Do large liquidations always lead to price reversals? Not necessarily. While large liquidations can create temporary price extremes, they don’t guarantee immediate reversals without other confirming factors. What’s the difference between partial and full liquidation? Partial liquidation closes only enough position to restore margin requirements, while full liquidation closes the entire position. How do funding rates affect liquidation risk? High funding rates in perpetual contracts increase holding costs for positions, adding to the financial pressure during adverse price moves.

At an event in Worcester on Monday, Deaton declared his candidacy, saying in a campaign video, “I’m winning this time.” Deaton previously ran as the Republican challenger against Senator Elizabeth Warren in 2024, losing by approximately 700,000 votes. Focus Shifts Beyond Crypto Policy While his latest announcement did not focus heavily on digital asset regulation, Deaton’s name remains closely tied to the crypto world. He gained prominence representing XRP holders in Ripple’s long-running legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Deaton confirmed that he would again run as a Republican to unseat Markey, who has been a vocal critic of cryptocurrency mining and voted against the GENIUS stablecoin bill. Political Landscape and Early Challenges Massachusetts remains a Democratic stronghold, and Deaton’s path to victory may face significant hurdles. Representative Seth Moulton, a Democrat from Massachusetts’s 6th Congressional District, has already emerged as a potential contender for the Senate seat. Markey, now 79, has held the position since 2013 and continues to attract strong support among Democratic voters. Crypto Community Backs Deaton’s Effort Despite the uphill battle, Deaton retains a loyal base within the crypto community. “We’re never going to not be excited about someone advocating for [crypto] policy,” said Mason Lynaugh, community director at Stand With Crypto. “He’s going to have his own voters he’s going to cultivate that are very excited to see someone like him saying these types of things publicly.” During his 2024 campaign, Deaton raised over $360,000 in the first quarter alone, with major contributions from executives at Ripple, Gemini, and Kraken. As the 2026 race begins to take shape, Deaton is expected to continue leveraging his national profile and support among crypto advocates to challenge the Democratic establishment.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-12 03:25:11

Traders remained cautious, with sentiment subdued across digital assets. Open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures dropped sharply from $94b to $68b, while funding rates stayed flat and Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw only $1m in net inflows. Bitcoin traded below its 200-day moving average of $110,000, facing resistance near that level and support around $103,000. If selling pressure intensifies, analysts see the next support range between $86,000 and $82,000. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $103,305, down 3.5% Ether : $3,438, down 5.2% XRP : $2.40, down 5.6% Total crypto market cap: $3.56 trillion, down 3.5% Traders Eye Washington Vote As Shutdown Nears End And Data Remains Sparse Since early October, the Bitcoin market has lost about $340b in capitalization, lagging gold and tech stocks despite their recent rebounds. George Mandres, senior trader at XBTO Trading, said large holders have been reducing positions, adding to weaker ETF inflows and selling from corporate treasuries. Across traditional markets, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan index inched up 0.1% in early trade, as members of the US House of Representatives prepared to vote on a bill restoring federal funding. The measure, already approved by the Senate, could end a shutdown that began on Oct. 1 and is now the longest in US history. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2% overnight to a record close, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. The S&P 500 futures were steady in early Asia. Traders focused on limited data available during the shutdown, including an ADP report showing private employers shed an average of 11,250 jobs a week in the four weeks ending Oct. 25. The US Senate has passed the amended appropriations bill seeking to reopen the government's longest shutdown. The bill awaits House approval. #USShutdown #SenateBill #CryptoReacts https://t.co/CIV1Eocx18 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 11, 2025 Soft Labor Data Strengthens Bets On Fed Rate Cut In December Meeting The muted labor reading pushed investors to raise bets on monetary easing. Futures markets now price a 68% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Dec. 10 meeting, up from 62% a day earlier, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. The US dollar index slipped 0.2% to 99.45, its weakest level this month, reflecting softer sentiment on the greenback as traders position for potential easing. Gold extended gains after surging nearly 3% overnight to trade comfortably above $4,100 in Asian hours, supported by lower yields and renewed risk appetite in equities. Analysts See Weak Conviction In Crypto Until ETF Inflows Pick Up In contrast, Bitcoin failed to capitalize on the broader move into risk assets. The largest cryptocurrency traded near $105,000, struggling to reclaim key technical levels. Analysts say market conviction will remain weak until on-chain accumulation or ETF inflows signal a stronger shift in demand. President Donald Trump warned late Tuesday that a court ruling against his use of emergency powers for tariffs could threaten both economic stability and national security. His comments added another layer of uncertainty to markets already adjusting to the shutdown’s prolonged effects. With Washington nearing a resolution, traders expect volatility to ease across risk assets. However, crypto markets may take longer to recover, with investors still cautious after weeks of heavy selling and liquidity drain.

Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal, often called the Fed whisperer, reveals a deepening rift within the central bank over a potential December rate cut. This internal conflict highlights the high stakes for traders and investors alike, as the outcome could trigger significant market movements. Understanding this debate is crucial for anyone involved in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. What is driving the Fed’s December rate cut debate? The Federal Reserve is split between hawks and doves on the possibility of a December rate cut. Hawks typically resist lowering rates due to inflation fears, while doves push for cuts to support economic growth. Timiraos points to slowing inflation and the economic impact of tariffs as key reasons some officials advocate for a cut. Moreover, concerns over job losses and reduced consumer demand are fueling the disagreement. This division has grown more intense because the U.S. government shutdown delayed vital economic data, leaving policymakers with incomplete information. How does the Fed rift affect market expectations? Despite the internal strife, financial markets are still pricing in a December rate cut. This expectation stems from recent economic indicators and global uncertainties. For instance, if the Fed proceeds, it could lower borrowing costs and boost riskier investments like stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, if they hold off, market volatility might increase. Key factors influencing this include: Inflation trends showing a gradual slowdown Employment data hinting at potential weaknesses Global trade tensions affecting economic forecasts Therefore, monitoring Fed communications is essential for anticipating shifts. What challenges does the Fed face in deciding on a December rate cut? The Fed’s decision is complicated by conflicting economic signals. On one hand, lower inflation supports a cut; on the other, strong job numbers might argue against it. The government shutdown exacerbated this by blocking access to critical reports like GDP growth and consumer spending. Timiraos emphasizes that this data gap makes it harder for officials to reach a consensus. Consequently, the uncertainty could lead to abrupt policy changes, impacting everything from mortgage rates to crypto prices. Why should investors care about the December rate cut? Investors need to watch the Fed’s moves because interest rate changes influence asset values. A December rate cut could make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment in markets like cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, no cut might strengthen the dollar, pressuring risk assets. Actionable insights include: Diversify portfolios to hedge against Fed-induced volatility Stay updated on Fed announcements through reliable sources Analyze how past rate decisions affected market trends By doing so, you can better navigate potential ups and downs. In summary, the Fed’s internal debate over a December rate cut underscores the delicate balance between stimulating the economy and controlling inflation. Timiraos’ reporting sheds light on how this rift could shape financial landscapes, urging investors to stay informed and adaptable. As the decision date approaches, keeping a close eye on Fed developments will be key to making smart investment choices. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Fed rate cut? A Fed rate cut reduces the interest rate at which banks borrow money, aiming to stimulate economic activity by making credit cheaper. Why are hawks and doves divided over the December rate cut? Hawks worry about inflation rising if rates are cut too soon, while doves believe a cut is needed to support growth amid economic slowdowns. How does a rate cut affect cryptocurrencies? Rate cuts often lower yields on traditional investments, making riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. What role did the government shutdown play in this debate? The shutdown delayed the release of key economic data, leaving Fed officials with less information to base their December rate cut decision on. Can the market accurately predict Fed rate decisions? Markets use tools like futures contracts to estimate rate changes, but surprises can occur if Fed internal disagreements lead to unexpected outcomes. What should I do if the Fed doesn’t cut rates in December? Prepare for potential market volatility by reviewing your investment strategy and considering assets that perform well in higher-rate environments.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2763 Market Cap $448.38M Trading Volume $9.29M Circulating Supply 1.62B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2891 24-hour Low $0.2743 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.67% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3043 14-Day RSI 48.67 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.3762 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is consolidating around $0.277, showing signs of short-term stabilization. A break above $0.281–$0.285 could signal renewed bullish continuation toward $0.295. Support near $0.267 remains crucial to maintain the current recovery structure. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On Flow’s 1-day chart for November 12, the coin’s price action shows mild stabilization around $0.277 after a retracement from $0.30. The Bollinger Bands indicate moderate volatility, with price currently hovering near the midline at $0.267, suggesting an equilibrium phase after last week’s surge. The MACD remains in the green zone but shows narrowing histogram bars, hinting that bullish momentum is weakening slightly yet not entirely lost. The RSI, currently at 49.77, is neutral, implying indecision but potential for upward momentum if buying volume improves. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView FLOW’s key support lies around $0.267, aligning with the lower Bollinger Band, while resistance sits near $0.297. If buyers sustain strength above $0.280, FLOW could retest $0.297–$0.300, but a breakdown below $0.267 could invite a drop toward $0.236. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart displays a mild rebound attempt after a two-bar red sequence, with price reclaiming $0.277. The Alligator indicator shows compression, with the jaw (blue line) and teeth (red line) nearing crossover, a signal that a short-term trend shift might form if the candle closes above $0.281. FLOW’s RSI reads 57.92, leaning slightly bullish but not yet overheated, and the PVT remains steady, supporting moderate accumulation. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Immediate resistance stands at $0.280–$0.281, where the short-term moving averages converge. A breakout above this region could drive a move toward $0.287–$0.290, while a rejection could drag the price back toward the $0.272 support level.

FLOW is in a cautious accumulation phase, hovering near equilibrium levels. A push above $0.281 may restore bullish momentum toward $0.30, while holding above $0.267 will be key to sustaining optimism. Short-term traders can anticipate a gradual rebound if volume aligns with momentum indicators over the next 24 to 48 hours. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow FLOW’s TVL breaks new high, up 217% year-to-date. The future of finance won’t be built overnight, but it’s taking shape. Over $120M in value is now secured across the Flow ecosystem, as builders and communities work together to make open, reliable finance part of everyday life. This is growth built on trust. https://t.co/qo4GYS5vb5 — Flow.com (@flow_blockchain) November 11, 2025 Flow coin price prediction November 2025 Per expert opinion, the Flow predictions for November 2025 suggest a minimum price of $0.240, an average price of $0.310, and a maximum price of $0.450.

Did you know that US spot ETH ETFs just witnessed a staggering $107.4 million net outflow in a single day? November 11 marked a significant shift in investor sentiment toward Ethereum exchange-traded funds, raising important questions about market dynamics and future trends. This substantial movement follows a period of relative stability, making the sudden withdrawal particularly noteworthy for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. What Caused the ETH ETFs Massive Outflow? The November 11 outflow represents one of the largest single-day movements for ETH ETFs in recent months. According to data from TraderT, the outflow wasn’t isolated to just one fund but affected multiple major players in the Ethereum investment space. This coordinated movement suggests broader market forces at play rather than isolated investor decisions. Several factors could be driving this trend. Market volatility, regulatory concerns, or profit-taking strategies might be influencing investor behavior. However, the scale of the outflow indicates a more significant shift in how institutional and retail investors are approaching Ethereum investments through traditional financial instruments like ETFs. Breaking Down the ETH ETFs Withdrawal Numbers Let’s examine the specific breakdown of the $107.39 million outflow: Grayscale Mini ETH led the exodus with $75.75 million in withdrawals BlackRock’s ETHA followed with $19.99 million exiting the fund No spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows for the day The total outflow amounted to 157.8 billion won in local currency terms This pattern reveals that even established players like Grayscale and BlackRock aren’t immune to market pressures. The absence of any positive inflows across all ETH ETFs underscores the breadth of this trend. Why Should Investors Care About ETH ETFs Performance? Understanding ETH ETFs flows provides crucial insights into institutional sentiment toward Ethereum. These investment vehicles serve as barometers for how traditional finance views cryptocurrency assets. When major ETH ETFs experience significant outflows, it often signals changing risk appetites or market expectations. Moreover, tracking these movements helps investors make informed decisions about their own Ethereum exposure. The performance of ETH ETFs can influence broader market sentiment and potentially affect Ethereum’s price action in secondary markets. What Does This Mean for Future ETH ETFs Adoption? While single-day outflows don’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend, they do highlight the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investments. The ETH ETFs market remains relatively young compared to traditional financial products, meaning such volatility isn’t entirely unexpected. However, sustained outflows could signal deeper issues with Ethereum’s investment appeal or broader crypto market concerns. Investors should monitor whether this becomes a pattern or remains an isolated incident when evaluating their ETH ETFs strategies. Key Takeaways from the ETH ETFs Outflow Analysis The November 11 movement teaches us several important lessons about ETH ETFs and cryptocurrency investing: Even established ETH ETFs can experience significant volatility Institutional interest in Ethereum remains fluid and responsive to market conditions Tracking ETF flows provides valuable market intelligence Diversification remains crucial in crypto investing This event serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments, including ETH ETFs, carry inherent risks and require careful monitoring. Frequently Asked Questions What are ETH ETFs? ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Why did ETH ETFs experience outflows on November 11? The outflows likely resulted from combined factors including market volatility, profit-taking, and changing investor sentiment toward cryptocurrency assets. Should I be worried about investing in ETH ETFs? Single-day outflows don’t necessarily indicate long-term trends. However, investors should always conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance when investing in cryptocurrency products. Which ETH ETFs were most affected? Grayscale Mini ETH saw the largest outflow at $75.75 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA with $19.99 million in withdrawals. Can ETH ETFs outflows affect Ethereum’s price? While there’s some correlation, ETH ETFs represent just one aspect of Ethereum’s market ecosystem. Many other factors influence ETH’s price movement. How often should I monitor ETH ETFs performance? Regular monitoring is wise, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term movements. Focus on long-term trends and fundamental analysis.

This staggering movement highlights the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin while raising questions about Ethereum’s immediate appeal to major investors. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Massive Institutional Capital? The recent $524 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs represents one of the largest single-day movements since their approval. BlackRock emerged as the clear leader in this surge, demonstrating the company’s powerful influence in the cryptocurrency space. Meanwhile, the contrasting outflows from Ethereum ETFs paint a fascinating picture of current institutional preferences. What’s Driving the Bitcoin ETF Momentum? Several factors contribute to the overwhelming success of Bitcoin ETFs in attracting institutional capital: Growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a digital gold alternative BlackRock’s established reputation and client network Regulatory clarity compared to other cryptocurrency products Strong historical performance and brand recognition How Did Ethereum ETFs Perform During This Period? While Bitcoin ETFs celebrated massive inflows, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net outflow of $107.39 million on November 11th. This followed a day of negligible fund movements, indicating a significant shift in investor sentiment. Grayscale Mini ETH led the outflows with $75.75 million withdrawn, while BlackRock’s ETHA saw $19.99 million exit the fund. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The contrasting performance between Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs suggests several important market trends. Institutional investors appear to be consolidating their positions in Bitcoin as the established leader in the cryptocurrency space. This doesn’t necessarily reflect negatively on Ethereum’s long-term potential but indicates current risk preferences and market positioning. Key Takeaways from the Latest ETF Movements The massive inflow into Bitcoin ETFs demonstrates several crucial market developments: Institutional confidence remains strong in Bitcoin despite market volatility BlackRock continues to dominate the cryptocurrency ETF space Investor preferences are clearly favoring Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies The ETF approval continues to drive significant capital into the crypto space What’s Next for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? Looking forward, the performance of Bitcoin ETFs will likely continue to influence broader market sentiment. The substantial inflows suggest that institutional investors see long-term value in Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. However, the Ethereum ETF outflows might represent temporary profit-taking rather than a fundamental shift in sentiment toward the second-largest cryptocurrency. The dramatic $524 million inflow into Bitcoin ETFs led by BlackRock marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency institutional adoption. While Ethereum ETFs experienced outflows during the same period, this contrast highlights the maturing nature of the digital asset market where investors are making more nuanced decisions based on risk, return expectations, and market positioning. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the massive inflow into Bitcoin ETFs? The $524 million inflow was driven by growing institutional confidence, BlackRock’s strong market presence, and increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Why did Ethereum ETFs experience outflows? Ethereum ETFs saw $107.39 million in outflows likely due to profit-taking, temporary market sentiment shifts, and investors reallocating to Bitcoin-focused products. Is BlackRock the dominant player in Bitcoin ETFs? Yes, BlackRock has emerged as a leading force in the Bitcoin ETF space, consistently attracting significant capital and demonstrating strong investor confidence. Should investors be concerned about Ethereum ETF outflows? Not necessarily. The outflows appear to be short-term movements rather than indicating fundamental problems with Ethereum’s long-term prospects. How do these ETF movements affect cryptocurrency prices? Significant ETF inflows typically support positive price momentum, while outflows can create temporary pressure, though many other factors also influence cryptocurrency prices. Are Bitcoin ETFs a safe investment compared to direct cryptocurrency ownership? Bitcoin ETFs offer regulated exposure to Bitcoin price movements without the technical complexities of direct ownership, making them attractive to traditional investors.

While recognizing the potential for payment system innovation, financial experts emphasize the urgent need for careful implementation to avoid devastating financial risks. Why Are Economists Concerned About Won Stablecoin Implementation? A recent survey by the Korean Economic Association reveals deep divisions among financial experts. The data shows that 37.1% of respondents believe financial innovation and improved efficiency represent the strongest arguments for introducing a won stablecoin. However, nearly 30% remain skeptical about the actual need for such a digital asset. The debate centers on balancing innovation with security. Proponents argue that a properly regulated won stablecoin could revolutionize South Korea’s payment infrastructure. Meanwhile, cautious economists highlight the potential for catastrophic coin runs and sophisticated money laundering schemes that could undermine financial stability. Who Should Issue South Korea’s Digital Currency? The question of issuance authority sparks intense discussion among financial professionals. Current survey results indicate that 58.1% of economists support a hybrid approach where both banks and qualified non-bank financial institutions could issue the won stablecoin. This majority believes carefully vetted non-banking entities could drive healthy competition and innovation. However, a significant 35.5% minority argues that banks alone should control won stablecoin issuance. They maintain that traditional financial institutions possess the necessary regulatory experience and risk management frameworks to ensure stability. This division reflects broader concerns about maintaining financial security while embracing digital currency advancement. What Risks Could Derail Won Stablecoin Success? Economists identify several critical challenges that require immediate attention: Coin run vulnerability: The potential for mass redemption during market stress Money laundering pathways: Enhanced risks with cross-border digital transactions Regulatory gaps: Current frameworks may not address unique stablecoin risks Consumer protection: Ensuring user funds remain secure and accessible These concerns underscore why economists advocate for gradual implementation. They recommend starting with limited pilot programs and robust stress testing before full-scale won stablecoin deployment. This measured approach allows regulators to identify and address potential weaknesses in controlled environments. How Could Won Stablecoin Transform South Korea’s Economy? Despite the cautionary stance, economists recognize substantial benefits from proper won stablecoin implementation. The digital currency could significantly reduce transaction costs and settlement times while increasing financial inclusion. Small businesses and individual consumers might access more efficient payment systems previously available only to large corporations. International trade could experience notable improvements through faster cross-border settlements. The won stablecoin might position South Korea as a leader in digital finance within Asian markets. However, economists stress that these advantages only materialize with comprehensive risk management and regulatory oversight. What’s Next for South Korea’s Digital Currency Journey? The path forward requires careful coordination between economists, regulators, and financial institutions. Most experts agree that developing clear regulatory frameworks represents the immediate priority. These frameworks must address specific won stablecoin characteristics while maintaining alignment with existing financial regulations. Continuous monitoring and adaptive regulation will prove essential as the digital currency ecosystem evolves. Economists recommend establishing independent oversight bodies with specialized expertise in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. This balanced approach could help South Korea harness won stablecoin benefits while minimizing associated risks. Frequently Asked Questions What is a won stablecoin? A won stablecoin is a digital currency pegged to the value of South Korea’s national currency, designed to maintain stable value while enabling faster digital transactions. Why are economists concerned about won stablecoin legalization? Economists worry about potential coin runs, money laundering risks, and regulatory gaps that could threaten financial stability if not properly addressed before implementation. Who supports won stablecoin issuance in South Korea? According to surveys, 37.1% of economists see value in financial innovation, while 58.1% believe both banks and qualified non-bank institutions should be allowed to issue the digital currency. What benefits could a won stablecoin provide? Potential benefits include reduced transaction costs, faster settlements, improved financial inclusion, and enhanced efficiency in payment systems for businesses and consumers. When might South Korea implement a won stablecoin? No specific timeline exists, but economists recommend gradual implementation starting with pilot programs and thorough testing before full deployment. How would a won stablecoin affect ordinary consumers? Consumers could experience faster, cheaper digital payments and potentially greater access to financial services, though proper consumer protection measures must be established first.

After bouncing from this zone, the altcoin surged above $2.00, retesting this level as support over the weekend. As a result, SUI’s price started the new week reaching a one-week high of $2.20 on Monday, before retracing alongside most of the market on Tuesday morning. Amid its recovery, analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator flashed a buy signal for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that the bottom could be in and a rally to higher levels is next. The analyst later confirmed the buy signal, adding that “sustained buying pressure here could push it to $3 or even $4.” Adding to the potential momentum, the Sui Network announced a partnership between the exchange Crypto.com and the Sui Foundation, the organization behind the adoption and advancement of the ecosystem. According to the announcement, the exchange has launched regulated custody and liquidity support for SUI, giving institutions’ clients “a secure, compliant way to store, manage, and access deep liquidity for SUI.” Downtrend Breakout Eyes 50% Rally Offering a broader outlook, market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency continues to trade within its big higher timeframe (HT) area, currently retesting a make-or-break zone. Notably, SUI has been hovering between the $2.00-$4.00 levels for most of the cycle, with the range’s lower boundary serving as a major support zone since late 2024. Now, the price “is holding initially on this higher low,” but must show short-term strength to break out from this area. Per the post, the altcoin has also broken out of its one-month diagonal resistance, which could send the price back to pre-November pullback levels. Currently, SUI’s price is retesting the downtrend line as support, which could turn the correction into a deviation and propel a move back above $2.30. “That’d be a solid sign of strength for me that this might be due for a larger reversal,” the trader added. Similarly, analyst Crypto Kaleo highlighted the recent performance, affirming that “when SUI breaks out of a major downtrend, it rips.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Derivatives Market Is Taking Off Again, But What Does This Mean For Price? As he pointed out, the cryptocurrency broke out of similar downtrends during the May and July rallies, soaring more than 50% within a week. Therefore, if the altcoin holds the current levels, its price could jump to the $3.00 barrier in the short term. Nonetheless, he warned that the two previous breakouts also saw some volatility after the initial move, suggesting another retest of the downtrend line could happen before the next leg up. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $2.07, a 3.8% decline in the daily timeframe.

This guide presents our picks for the six best options as of November 2025 that offer instant withdrawals and no KYC requirements for players who value speed, privacy, and control over their funds. Why Players Choose No-KYC Crypto Casinos Instant Withdrawals and Anonymity Traditional casinos typically require full KYC (Know Your Customer) verification before allowing deposits or cash-out, which can result in delays or a breach of privacy. No KYC crypto casinos remove this barrier entirely. Players can access their winnings quickly and easily, without requiring extensive personal documentation or verification checks. Your gambling remains private, and no extensive documentation is required upfront. Beyond privacy, crypto casino transactions are blockchain-based, adding an extra level of anonymity that traditional casinos cannot match. All you have to do is just register with your email address or crypto wallet, start gambling, and withdraw your winnings within minutes – that’s what players want. Faster Access to Funds (No Verification Delay) Protracted verification processes can often become a frustrating bottleneck – typical of traditional casinos. Imagine having to wait 1-3 days to get a manual document review that might come back inconclusive, or even an additional 3-7 business days for banks to process your payments. No KYC crypto casinos avoid or minimize this process, ensuring that players gain faster access to their funds. A handful of platforms offer “instant or within-minute” payouts once withdrawals are confirmed onchain. F ast access to your funds allows you to move liquidity between platforms and take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. Multi-Coin Support and On-Chain Transparency With crypto casinos, players are not stuck with fiat, as the platforms typically support a variety of cryptocurrencies for deposits and withdrawals. Users can gamble using any cryptocurrency they prefer, including Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, USDT, DOGE, LTC, and more. Since these transactions occur on the blockchain, players enjoy transparency, flexibility, and faster settlements compared to fiat-based casinos. Why Regulation Still Matters While no-KYC crypto casinos offer streamlined access, it does not mean they can skimp on important regulatory and operational standards. Legitimate operators hold licenses from recognised jurisdictions, such as Curaçao, Costa Rica, and Anjouan, which permit flexible KYC requirements. The varying levels of oversight enforced by these jurisdictions ensure that crypto casino operators implement fair play protocols, industry-standard deposit limits, secure wallet infrastructure, player protection, fraud prevention, and responsible gaming frameworks. No-KYC doesn’t mean “no regulation.” Key Criteria for Our Rankings Withdrawal Speed Crypto casinos out there often claim to provide fast withdrawal speeds. In creating this list, we chose platforms offering quick payouts and fast settlement options. KYC Policy We selected casinos that offer optional KYC or tiered verification. This means you either play without completing a know-your-customer (KYC) verification upfront or, under specific circumstances such as high withdrawal volumes above permitted thresholds, a verification is triggered. Supported Coins For casino players, flexibility in funding and withdrawal options is key. So, we chose platforms supporting major cryptos (BTC, ETH), altcoins (SOL, DOGE, XRP), and stablecoins (USDT, USDC). Provably Fair Games and Reputable Licensing Every crypto casino highlighted in this piece is licensed, offers responsible gaming tools and utilizes a provably fair gaming system, ensuring that gambling is transparent, verifiable, and free from manipulation. Bonus Terms & Wagering Requirements The welcome bonus amounts and structure, wagering requirements, and withdrawal restrictions on bonuses were also considered while creating this list. Player Experience and Support Quality While technical features, flexibility, and fast payouts matter, user experience and the quality of customer support are equally important. In curating this list, we considered customer support quality and availability, community reputation, and player reviews. Top 6 Crypto Casinos With Instant Withdrawals (November 2025) 1.

Register Without KYC (Email or Wallet Login) For email-based registration, visit the no-KYC casino of your choice, sign up or register with your email address, create a password, verify your email (if obligatory), and you’re ready to play. If you prefer the crypto wallet login method, then visit the casino, confirm the compatible wallets (Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Ledger), and select “Connect Wallet.” Next, sign the verification message to prove wallet ownership, and just like that, you’re ready to start playing. The entire process for an email or wallet login takes about a minute. No ID verification, no document uploads, and no approval delays. 2. Deposit in Your Preferred Coin To load money into your account, navigate to the “Cashier” or “Deposit” section, choose your preferred coin, and copy the designated wallet address or scan the QR code provided. Send your crypto from an exchange or self-custody wallet, wait for network confirmation, and the deposit process is completed. *Take note of deposit limits, if any. Also, note the network (BEP-20, ERC-20, TRC-20) before sending any coin to avoid loss of funds. 3. Play Provably Fair or Live Games Choose games with provably fair mechanics or live dealer tables as offered by the platform. By design, provably fair systems allow all players to independently verify that operators have not manipulated outcomes. 4. Withdraw Directly to Your Wallet — Check Minimums and Network Fees Bagged some more coins from winnings, or you just want to take your initial deposit out? Follow these steps: Navigate to the “Cashier” or “Withdraw” section. Select the coin you want to withdraw/receive. Choose the right network. Paste your personal wallet address (double-check to avoid loss of funds). Enter the amount you want to withdraw. Review and confirm. Your withdrawal should arrive in minutes. *Take note of minimum withdrawal limits, KYC-trigger limits, and blockchain network fees. Safety Tips for No-KYC Casino Users Verify Smart Contract Addresses or Domains Phishing scams are common in crypto gambling. Scammers create nearly identical fake sites, collect deposits, and then disappear. Hence, you must always double-check smart contract addresses and access casinos through bookmarked domain links or by manually typing the URL into your browser. Use Self-Custody Wallets For your own safety and security, do not store significant funds in the wallet of crypto casinos or exchanges. Some exchanges flag gambling-related transactions, which might result in withdrawal delays. Instead, use self-custody wallets like Trust Wallet, MetaMask, XDEFI, or hard wallets like Trezor and Ledger to hold large amounts. Using a self-custody wallet means you control your private keys. If the casino experiences issues or shuts down, funds in your personal wallet remain safe. *Keep only active playing money in the casino’s wallet and withdraw your winnings to your personal wallet from time to time. Don’t Reuse Exchange Deposit Addresses If by any chance you’re using a crypto exchange wallet, avoid reusing deposit addresses when withdrawing from a crypto casino. Exchanges often change deposit addresses, and sending funds to an old address may result in a loss. Some casinos employ a closed-loop withdrawal policy, which requires withdrawals to be made back to the exact address used for the original deposit. To avoid losses, you must check and copy the most recent exchange address each time, or use a self-custody wallet instead. Set Withdrawal Alerts and Use 2FA To ensure an extra layer of security, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your crypto casino account if available. Turn on 2FA requirement for logins and withdrawals, and enable email alerts for deposits and withdrawals. Always Gamble Responsibly While the casinos in this guide offer safe gambling tools such as deposit limits, loss limits, session timers, and self-exclusion, responsible gambling is ultimately the responsibility of players. Therefore, you must: Set strict deposit limits before you start playing. Never gamble with money you can’t afford to lose. Take regular breaks. Walk away when you hit your loss limit. Use casino-provided tools. Recognize when there is a gambling addiction. The Future of No-KYC Crypto Casinos Growing Adoption of Lightning Network and Solana Payments The Lightning Network is transforming online casinos by enabling near-instant, low-fee BTC transactions. Forward-thinking platforms like BetPanda, Stake.com , Cloudbet, BC.Game, and Betplay.io are already implementing this technology for super-fast Bitcoin payouts. The Solana network is also growing as an on-chain payment method for casinos, offering high throughput, extremely low fees, and transaction finality of about 12 seconds (with upcoming upgrades promising sub-second speeds). The increased adoption of these payment network options is expected in the future, providing players with more choices in balancing cost, speed, and privacy. AI-Powered Risk Monitoring Without KYC According to a report by the International Association of Gaming Regulators ( IAGR ), AI-powered risk monitoring systems can analyze a person’s historical data and behavioral patterns. For example, the AI systems can monitor increasing deposit frequency, escalating betting amounts, or prolonged gambling sessions without breaks. Instead of requiring documents and ID checks, AI systems can prompt interventions, such as automated alerts for cooldown breaks, bet limits, or temporary restrictions to high-stakes games, while still preserving player anonymity. If an account triggers multiple red flags, the casino can then request additional verification. Regulation Trends — Will “Proof of Funds” Replace Traditional KYC? Traditional KYC requires submitting documents containing personal information, which defeats the “anonymity” a casino might claim to offer. For instance, a middle-ground solution, such as “Proof-of-Funds,” is implemented. In that case, players will demonstrate the legitimacy of their gambling funds through on-chain analysis, which reveals transaction history and patterns without disclosing personal identity information. This is a largely theoretical concept, but it could be a solution that protects the privacy of players and ensures regulatory compliance remains uncompromised. Evolution of Non-Custodial Gaming Platforms As blockchain scalability continues to improve gradually and gas fees decrease, it’s possible to see fully non-custodial casino models become increasingly viable alternatives to traditional models. With non-custodial gaming platforms, players are completely in charge of their cryptocurrencies, not the casino, enabling more trustless gaming experiences. Since funds are not held in-house, bets are processed directly from the players’ wallets using smart contracts. However, some risks to consider include smart contract risk, blockchain network dependencies, and regulatory complexities. Currently, the majority of the platforms operate as hybrid models that combine custodial features with blockchain verification, though fully decentralized options continue to improve. Disclaimer Online gambling inherently carries its own risks and may be subject to regulatory restrictions depending on the jurisdiction. You must be aware that crypto casinos claiming to offer “no KYC” may trigger verification under certain circumstances such as suspicious activity, and large winnings. Always take time out to read and understand the terms and conditions of any crypto casino before using the platform. Gamble responsibly, use a self-custody crypto wallet, and only play with money you can afford to lose. The information provided in this piece is for educational purposes only.

According to cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport, Bitcoin has officially entered a Bitcoin short-term downtrend that demands investor attention. This development comes despite overall market growth, creating a puzzling scenario for crypto enthusiasts. What Signals This Bitcoin Short-Term Downtrend? Matrixport’s latest analysis reveals concerning market dynamics. While the total crypto market capitalization grew impressively from $2.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion over the past year, daily trading volume tells a different story. The volume has plummeted by nearly half from $352 billion to $178 billion. This significant contraction in trading activity suggests: Reduced investor participation Decreased market liquidity Growing caution among traders Why Should Investors Care About This Downtrend? The current Bitcoin short-term downtrend isn’t just about price movements. It reflects deeper market sentiment shifts that could impact your portfolio. Matrixport emphasizes that on-chain indicators consistently point toward Bitcoin’s downward phase. These technical signals include: Weakening network activity Reduced transaction volumes Changing holder behavior patterns How Can You Navigate This Bitcoin Short-Term Downtrend? Matrixport advises maintaining a conservative investment outlook during this Bitcoin short-term downtrend . However, strategic opportunities often emerge during market corrections. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into positions Setting clear stop-loss levels Diversifying across asset classes Monitoring key support levels closely What Does History Tell Us About Bitcoin Cycles? Previous Bitcoin short-term downtrend phases have typically been followed by recovery periods. The cryptocurrency market operates in cycles, and understanding these patterns can help investors make informed decisions. Historical data shows that disciplined investors who maintain perspective during downturns often benefit during subsequent rallies. Key Takeaways From Matrixport’s Analysis The current Bitcoin short-term downtrend presents both challenges and opportunities. While reduced trading volume indicates caution, it doesn’t necessarily signal the end of Bitcoin’s long-term growth story. Smart investors use these periods to reassess strategies and position themselves for future market movements. Frequently Asked Questions How long might this Bitcoin short-term downtrend last? Matrixport doesn’t specify an exact duration, but short-term trends typically last several weeks to a few months based on historical patterns. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this downtrend? This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Matrixport recommends a conservative approach but doesn’t advise panic selling. What indicators confirm the Bitcoin short-term downtrend? On-chain metrics, reduced trading volume, and technical analysis patterns all support Matrixport’s assessment. Could this turn into a long-term bear market? While possible, current data suggests this is a short-term correction rather than a fundamental shift in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. How does trading volume affect Bitcoin prices? Lower trading volume often indicates reduced market participation, which can increase price volatility and amplify downward movements. What other cryptocurrencies are affected by Bitcoin’s trend? Most major cryptocurrencies tend to correlate with Bitcoin’s price movements, though some may show independent strength or weakness. Found this analysis helpful?

This strategic decision marks a pivotal moment for the project’s commitment to institutional-grade security standards. Why is the Plasma XPL custody transfer important? The Plasma XPL custody transfer represents a crucial step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. By moving token custody to Anchorage Digital, the project gains access to federally regulated banking infrastructure. This transition provides multiple benefits for token holders and the broader ecosystem. Here are the key advantages of this Plasma XPL custody arrangement: Enhanced security protocols through banking-grade protection Regulatory compliance with U.S. financial standards Institutional confidence for larger investors Reduced counterparty risk for all token holders What does Anchorage Digital bring to Plasma XPL? Anchorage Digital stands as one of the few crypto-native companies holding a federal bank charter. This unique position allows them to provide banking services specifically designed for digital assets. The Plasma XPL custody transfer leverages this specialized expertise to create a more robust security framework. The timing of this Plasma XPL custody change comes during increased regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency projects. By proactively choosing a regulated custodian, Plasma demonstrates its commitment to compliance and user protection. This strategic move may set a precedent for other stablecoin projects considering similar transitions. How will this affect Plasma XPL token holders? For current Plasma XPL holders, the custody transfer should be seamless. The project has indicated the transition will occur within 48 hours, minimizing disruption to users. However, the long-term implications are substantial for everyone involved with the Plasma XPL ecosystem. Consider these practical impacts of the custody transfer: Increased asset protection against potential security breaches Improved liquidity options through institutional participation Enhanced regulatory clarity for U.S.-based users Stronger project credibility in the competitive stablecoin market What challenges might this Plasma XPL custody change face? While the benefits are clear, any major infrastructure change carries potential challenges. The Plasma XPL custody transfer must ensure smooth technical integration between existing systems and Anchorage’s platform. Additionally, the project must maintain transparency throughout the transition process to maintain community trust.

The insights come from Bitget’s #AskSatoshiWithGetAgent campaign , which invited users to “speak” to Satoshi through GetAgent, Bitget’s AI-powered crypto assistant, in celebration of the Bitcoin Whitepaper’s seventeenth anniversary. Over a two-week period, more than 10,000 participants across 90 countries submitted more than 30,000 questions through GetAgent, Bitget’s AI-powered crypto assistant, offering a rare view into how today’s crypto community interprets Bitcoin’s origin story in an era shaped by artificial intelligence. The report shows that curiosity around Bitcoin’s purpose remains just as strong as interest in its price. Nearly 40% of all questions centered on whether Bitcoin has stayed true to its original ideals, with users exploring themes of decentralization, trust, and the evolution of digital money. Submissions spanned more than ten languages while vibrant participation emerged from Southeast Asia, South Asia and European markets. A standout 75% of English-language questions came from non-English-speaking countries, highlighting how AI tools like GetAgent are lowering language barriers and helping make crypto learning more accessible across state lines. AI adoption and trading behavior also showed clear parallels. 90% of core GetAgent users executed trades within the past 30 days, with 75% active in the last week. Peak trading occurred between 10 PM and midnight, and GetAgent usage followed the same pattern, suggesting that traders are increasingly turning to AI for real-time support during active market sessions. Daytime usage leaned toward education, research, and strategy planning, emphasizing GetAgent’s dual role as both an execution partner and a learning tool. Differences between VIP and regular users were also evident. VIP users interacted with GetAgent more directly, often through K-line charts, and typed more customized queries focused on hedging, market cycles, and macro shifts. Regular users preferred suggested prompts, using the assistant to deepen understanding. Together, these behaviors show how GetAgent mirrors user maturity, trading confidence, and market exposure. The Ask Satoshi experience captured the philosophical side of the crypto world. The most common questions asked whether Bitcoin still reflects Satoshi’s intent, whether Satoshi would embrace AI and why the creator chose to disappear. Regional variations added nuance with certain speakers focusing on decentralization, with other speakers exploring identity and legacy or security risks. “The report confirms the global crypto audience is maturing from speculators to stewards, asking profound questions about purpose, not just price,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. “Seeing users speak to ‘Satoshi’ through AI showed how global this conversation has become. It’s a reminder that crypto is for the masses and people are trying to understand its fundamentals differently.” The report reflects a global crypto community that is becoming more knowledgeable, more diverse, and more influenced by AI. As crypto and AI continue to intersect, Bitget’s Universal Exchange model aims to support this next phase, one where traders engage not only with markets, but with the ideas and innovations shaping them. Co-authored with Bitget’s GetAgent, the report draws on the AI assistant’s analytical depth to reveal the patterns, questions, and cultural nuances that define today’s crypto landscape. It demonstrates how GetAgent is evolving from a trading tool into an intelligent collaborator, capable of interpreting global sentiment and illuminating how people around the world think about the future of finance.

At the same time, well known XRP advocate and attorney John Deaton announced his 2026 Senate bid to challenge Democrat Ed Markey in Massachusetts. Deaton is known for defending XRP holders in Ripple’s SEC case, and his pro-crypto stance could make him a big voice in the upcoming race. First XRP ETF Nears US Launch The long-awaited arrival of a US-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) directly holding XRP may finally become a reality. Crypto investment firm Canary Capital filed the final paperwork needed to launch its spot XRP ETF, which suggests that trading could begin as soon as Thursday. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , Canary submitted a Form 8A with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday evening, which is a required step before any security can be offered on an exchange. Balchunas believes that the timing of the filing mirrors the process seen with Hedera (HBAR) ETFs, which went live the day after their 8A forms were lodged. While he warned that the launch is not yet guaranteed, he said that “all boxes are being checked” and advised investors to “stay tuned” for an announcement. Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett also added that Canary’s filing represents the final step before the ETF becomes effective at 5:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, pending Nasdaq certification of the listing. If approved, the first spot XRP ETF would be cleared for trading at Thursday’s market open, which will be a major milestone for the asset and its growing investor base. Unlike previous XRP-related investment products, Canary’s ETF was filed under the Securities Act of 1933, allowing it to hold XRP directly rather than investing in offshore entities that own the token. The launch comes amid renewed optimism across the XRP community, particularly as the recent US government shutdown nears resolution, clearing a backlog of pending ETF applications. Several other firms — including 21Shares, ProShares, Bitwise, Volatility Shares, REX-Osprey, CoinShares, Amplify, and Franklin Templeton — also have spot XRP ETFs listed with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which certainly suggests that a very competitive market could soon form. Investor anticipation already fueled a rally in XRP’s price , which jumped roughly 7% over the past week to reach $2.40. If Canary’s fund goes live as expected, it will be a historic moment for XRP that could potentially cement the token’s place alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in the expanding lineup of US-listed spot crypto ETFs. XRP’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) John Deaton Launches 2026 Senate Bid In other Ripple-related news, well known lawyer and advocate for XRP holders John Deaton is making another bid for a seat in the US Senate. After losing to Senator Elizabeth Warren in the 2024 election, Deaton announced on Monday that he will once again run as a Republican—this time challenging Democratic Senator Ed Markey in Massachusetts’s 2026 race. At an event in Worcester, Massachusetts, Deaton even declared, “I’m winning this time.” Deaton rose to prominence in the crypto community for his defense of XRP holders during Ripple Labs’ high-profile legal battle with the SEC. His outspoken support for digital assets and criticism of regulatory overreach earned him a lot of backing from crypto enthusiasts nationwide. Although his 2026 campaign announcement did not explicitly center on cryptocurrency policy, Deaton’s record suggests that he will remain a pro-crypto voice in the race. In his previous campaign, he received over $360,000 in contributions from executives at major crypto firms like Ripple, Gemini, and Kraken. The 2026 Senate race is already shaping up to be quite competitive. Alongside Markey, who will turn 80 next year, Democratic Representative Seth Moulton also entered the race. Markey has been a vocal critic of the crypto industry, and opposed the GENIUS stablecoin bill. He is also known for condemning the environmental impact of crypto mining. Meanwhile, pro-crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto already expressed enthusiasm about Deaton’s return to the campaign trail, with community director Mason Lynaugh saying that Deaton “will have his own voters he’s going to cultivate that are very excited to see someone like him saying these types of things publicly.” While Massachusetts is a challenging battleground for Republicans, Deaton’s mix of populist energy and crypto advocacy could make him a standout contender in the race.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-12 05:00:00

The buy came over a short window and lifted the firm’s holdings to roughly 7,525 BTC, a move that drew attention across the crypto market. Strive’s Big Bitcoin Purchase The purchases happened between October 28 and November 9, 2025. The average price paid for those coins was reported at about $103,315 each. Based on reports , Strive used a fresh funding method tied to a preferred-stock offering to bankroll the acquisition. Market watchers noticed the company’s total stash rose into the 7k-Bitcoin range after this round of buying. A Comparison With Peers Those holdings put Strive ahead of some rival managers in raw Bitcoin terms. Some outlets compared the haul to the reserves held by large institutional players, noting that Strive’s total climbed to near 7,525 BTC. That gap is not fixed. Bitcoin holdings are public only when managers disclose them, and prices keep moving. Still, the size of this purchase was large enough to be reported widely. BREAKING: Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, has acquired 1,567 BTC (≈ $162 M) between Oct 28 – Nov 9. The STRIVE Total Holding now stands at 7,525 $BTC (≈ $784.5 M), A clear signal that institutional conviction in Bitcoin is accelerating. pic.twitter.com/IOf2CuaFUt — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) November 11, 2025 How The Buy Was Funded Reports have disclosed that Strive tapped a preferred-stock vehicle called SATA to gather money for the purchases. The structure was described as a way to raise capital and direct proceeds into Bitcoin purchases. The preferred shares were offered to investors who wanted exposure to the strategy, and then funds were used to acquire the coins over several trading days. This financing route was highlighted in several writeups as central to how the firm completed a multi-million dollar buy without a single public market order. Market Reaction And Implications The market reaction was measured. Some analysts pointed out that a $162 million buy is sizable but still small relative to total Bitcoin market depth. Others noted it signals growing comfort among certain fund managers in putting corporate balance sheet money into Bitcoin. Price moves were mixed during the purchase window, which meant the average cost came in above and below intraday swings. A few commentary pieces also flagged that public filings and precise timing matter when trying to pin down the full picture. Next Steps For Strive As of November 11, 2025, Strive’s public statements on this specific purchase were limited in the sources reviewed. Based on reports, the firm’s strategy appears to include using equity instruments to fund further buys if investor demand continues. Industry observers said they will watch regulatory filings and later disclosures for a clearer record of timing, price, and any ongoing plans. Presidential Ambition Vivek Ramaswamy , an American biotech entrepreneur, gained national attention during his run for the Republican nomination in the 2024 US presidential race. He suspended his campaign on January 15, 2024 after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses.

According to the filing, Canary submitted a Form 8-A to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2025, a move that registers the fund’s shares under the Exchange Act and begins a regulatory clock that can lead to a listing if no objections are raised.

Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Nasdaq Listing Moves Into Final Steps Based on reports, the shares are expected to trade under the ticker XRPC once Nasdaq completes its listing approval and the regulatory waiting period runs its course. The S-1 prospectus filed earlier says the trust’s shares are expected to be listed for trading subject to notice of issuance on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Market players say a key legal mechanism is now in motion. Canary removed a delaying amendment from its S-1, which triggers a 20-day countdown to automatic effectiveness unless the SEC acts. That change has led some issuers to target a November 13 listing date, though final sign-off by Nasdaq and any SEC comments could shift that plan. CEO Steven McClurg at Canary Capital on XRPETF.. #XRP pic.twitter.com/2UnDKdvc4R — RIZ.. 🇺🇸 🇵🇷 (@RizXRP) November 10, 2025 Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said the XRP ETF could potentially double the gains Solana saw in its first week. He pointed to strong interest in XRP, reflected in its market capitalization and trading activity. Fund Details And Fees Reports have disclosed some of the fund’s basic terms. The Canary product lists a management fee of 0.50% and names custodians that are already familiar in crypto ETF work, including Gemini Trust Company and BitGo Trust Company. The trust also names US Bank as the cash custodian and US Bancorp Fund Services in an administrative role, according to market write-ups. The background numbers help frame the potential scale. According to earlier SEC filings, as of October 8, 2025, the aggregate market value of XRP was about $173 billion, which placed XRP among the top five digital assets by market cap at that date. That size is one reason multiple issuers have pushed to bring XRP into ETF wrappers. At the time of writing, XRP’s market cap stood at a little over $146 billion.

Beaton noted that these accounts are “FDIC insured” up to $2.5 million by distributing deposits across multiple banks. She said this rate surpasses what most U.S. banks currently offer, while funds remain instantly available for trading or withdrawals. Uphold’s new yield, borrowing, and cashback features deepen XRP’s real-world utility. By integrating XRP into payments, credit, and savings, the platform evolves from the exchange that “ never delisted XRP ” into a full XRP-centered financial system.

DOGE is now consolidating and might find bids near 0.1680. DOGE price started a fresh downside correction below $0.180. The price is trading below the $0.1780 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.1750 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1680. Dogecoin Price Starts Another Pullback Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1650, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.1750 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.1800. A high was formed at $0.1859 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1568 swing low to the $0.1859 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.1750 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1780 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1760 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.180 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1850 level. A close above the $0.1850 resistance might send the price toward $0.1920. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.20. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2120. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.180 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1715 level. The next major support is near the $0.170 level. The main support sits at $0.1680 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1568 swing low to the $0.1859 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.1680 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1565 level or even $0.1520 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

According to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, the peak of the last BTC cycle was recorded on November 10, 2021. This significant milestone in Bitcoin’s history offers valuable insights for investors and traders analyzing current market trends. What Does This Bitcoin Cycle High Mean for Investors? The four-year anniversary of Bitcoin’s cycle high marks a crucial point in cryptocurrency market analysis. Historical patterns show that understanding previous cycle highs helps predict future price movements. This particular Bitcoin cycle high reached unprecedented levels that many analysts use as reference points for current market evaluations. Market cycles typically follow predictable patterns, and the Bitcoin cycle high from 2021 serves as an important benchmark. However, each cycle brings unique factors that influence price action. The current market environment differs significantly from conditions in 2021, which means investors should consider multiple variables when making decisions. How Do Bitcoin Cycles Typically Unfold? Bitcoin market cycles generally follow these phases: Accumulation phase – Smart money enters positions Uptrend phase – Prices climb toward cycle highs Distribution phase – Selling pressure increases Downtrend phase – Prices correct from cycle highs The previous Bitcoin cycle high represented the peak of a massive bull run. Understanding these patterns helps investors recognize where we might be in the current cycle. The four-year timeframe aligns with Bitcoin’s halving events, creating natural rhythm in market movements. What Can We Learn From Past Bitcoin Cycle Highs? Analyzing previous Bitcoin cycle highs provides several key insights. First, each cycle high tends to be significantly higher than the last. Second, the time between cycle highs has shown interesting patterns that technical analysts closely monitor. The current distance from the last Bitcoin cycle high suggests we might be approaching another significant market phase. Julio Moreno’s observation about the Bitcoin cycle high anniversary comes at a time when market participants are watching for signs of the next major move. The four-year mark often coincides with important technical and fundamental developments in the cryptocurrency space. How Should Traders Approach Current Market Conditions? Given the anniversary of the previous Bitcoin cycle high, traders should consider several factors. Market sentiment, institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions all play crucial roles. The Bitcoin cycle high from 2021 serves as both a psychological and technical level that influences trading decisions. Successful cryptocurrency investing requires understanding these historical patterns while remaining adaptable to new market dynamics. The Bitcoin cycle high milestone reminds us that markets move in cycles, and patience often rewards disciplined investors. What’s Next After This Bitcoin Cycle High Anniversary? As we reflect on the four years since the last Bitcoin cycle high, several questions emerge. Will the next cycle high surpass previous records? How will evolving market structures impact future price discovery? The answers depend on multiple factors, including adoption rates, technological developments, and global economic conditions. The Bitcoin cycle high anniversary provides an excellent opportunity for investors to review their strategies and prepare for potential market movements. Historical data combined with current analysis creates a powerful framework for making informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a Bitcoin cycle high? A Bitcoin cycle high refers to the peak price point reached during a specific market cycle, typically measured from one major low to the next major high in Bitcoin’s price history. How long do Bitcoin cycles typically last? Bitcoin cycles have historically lasted approximately four years, often aligning with the Bitcoin halving events that occur every 210,000 blocks. Why is the November 2021 Bitcoin cycle high significant? The November 2021 Bitcoin cycle high marked the peak of a massive bull run and serves as an important technical and psychological level for market analysis. Can past cycle highs predict future price movements? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, analyzing previous cycle highs helps identify patterns and potential support/resistance levels. How does the four-year cycle relate to Bitcoin halving? The four-year cycle often correlates with Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce mining rewards and historically precede significant price increases. What factors could influence the next Bitcoin cycle high?

Having failed to produce a significant recovery since last month's sharp decline, Bitcoin is struggling to ride the wave of risk appetite. The price briefly rose above $107,000 on the last trading day, but quickly fell below $105,000. The damage from last month's crash, which wiped out billions of dollars in market value, is believed to have not yet been fully repaired. Large investors taking profits at year-highs and forced liquidations in early October have intensified selling pressure again. This chart highlights the fragility of investor sentiment. Market momentum has yet to recover. Bitcoin futures open interest remains around $68 billion, well below last month's peak of $94 billion. Funding rates are also frozen in neutral territory. While equity and credit markets have strengthened on hopes for a US government reopening, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have not shown the same vigor. The technical outlook isn't strong either, according to analysts. Bitcoin is trading below its 200-day moving average (around $110,000), which analysts consider the threshold for a sustainable uptrend. This suggests significant hurdles remain to any upward price movement. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Decides to List a Surprise Altcoin Despite continuing the year with positive returns, Bitcoin is underperforming compared to both gold and tech stocks. This leaves BTC vulnerable if momentum-driven funds reverse direction. While expectations of a US government reopening have lifted risk assets somewhat, the crypto market remains generally cautious. Senior strategist George Mandres describes the current situation as a “dead cat bounce”: The market is exhibiting a temporary recovery after a sharp decline. On the stock front, there are expectations that the government reopening will further stimulate risk appetite. However, on the cryptocurrency front, the sentiment is different. There's a widespread belief that former Bitcoin holders are selling in large quantities. This, coupled with premium pressure from companies that have added digital assets to their balance sheets and limited new capital inflows in the ETF space, is cooling risk appetite. On the downside, $103,000 is being monitored as a critical structural level. Below this band, a bearish scenario extending to $86,000 is anticipated. Deeper support lies at $82,000, which also coincides with the 100-week moving average. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What’s the Latest on Bitcoin?

He previously failed to unseat industry critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The attorney known for filing amicus briefs supporting crypto firms in legal battles against the US SEC, declared his intention to run for the 2026 US Senate at a recent event in Worcester, Massachusetts. “It’s time for leaders who know how to fight and deliver results. I’m running for the United States Senate to do just that,” Deaton posted on X, seeking contributions from the crypto industry . I’m John Deaton. I grew up with nothing, served in the Marines, and built a life and business here in Massachusetts through hard work.

It’s time for leaders who know how to fight and… pic.twitter.com/KQ4gKtvoSZ — John Deaton (@DeatonforSenate) November 11, 2025 This time, he will face off against Democrat Sen. Ed Markey, who introduced legislation in 2023 to crack down on crypto energy consumption. John Deaton Had Well-Financed Campaigns – What About This Time? The Crypto Twitter linchpin received national attention last year, running as a pro-crypto candidate against Warren. He ran a well-financed campaign till the end, but ultimately lost to Warren by nearly 20 points. For instance, crypto-backed political action committee (PAC) invested $850,000 to bolster Deaton’s Massachusetts Senate primary in 2024. Besides, Gemini’s Winklevoss Twins donated Deaton $500,000 each in Bitcoin to “unseat” Elizabeth Warren and “put an end to” her war on crypto. They called Deaton “pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business candidate.” While many crypto industry players oppose Markey due to his strong stance against the asset class, as well as voting against the GENUIS stablecoin bill , the aggressive pro-crypto Trump administration has calmed the industry this year. As a result, crypto is playing less of a visible role this time. Deaton’s recent campaign page does not mention pro-crypto policies if elected. The website is open to donations in several cryptos, including Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , XRP and memecoins like BONK and Dogecoin . Massachusetts Struggles to Become Bitcoin-Friendly The Bay State’s Bitcoin reserve bill encountered an early setback last month after state lawmakers remained silent, offering no responses on the proposal. The bill, titled An Act Relative to a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, was introduced by Republican State Senator Peter Durant . Per Bitcoin Reserve Monitor , the tepid response has added Massachusetts to the growing list of delays.

CEO Mitchell Demeter stated that the company will focus on steady growth, token burns, and fair rewards for developers, rather than pursuing quick market gains. Demeter posted an article on X that accurately highlights this plan, stating that Sonic Labs will connect real network use, its token value, and developer rewards through updates to its system and business model. Sonic Labs wants to build real value on its network CEO Mitchell Demeter said Sonic already has a fast and reliable token system, and the company wants everyone to benefit from it. Instead of chasing short-term market reactions, the plan will make sure every transaction, project, and partnership rewards builders and users in the long run. The company will eliminate 90% of all transaction fees and allocate the remaining 10% to validators, making the remaining tokens rarer and more valuable over time. The more people build, use, and support the network, the more rewards they receive, creating a loop where participation generates value that grows with the network. Demeter also explained that tokenholders and other participants will be able to vote on decisions about rewards, token burns , and other important rules. The system will be fair and transparent, ensuring that people who use and support the network have a say in its growth. Sonic Labs will also ensure fair reward distribution to validators and control token provisioning, allowing the network to be sustained for a longer period. The company will also introduce selected Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and launch its own Sonic Improvement Proposals (SIPs) to enhance the network’s utility for real-world projects and users. Developers will receive a system that rewards them for building and connecting new applications to other networks. Sonic wants more to come on board to increase the level of activity, creating more rewards and value for everyone involved. The rewards system boosts Sonic’s expansion, education, and engagement by institutions Sonic Labs plans to open an office in New York City, positioning it as the headquarters for its operations and partnerships. The company aims to showcase its true value to banks and investors, and the new office will enable it to expand in areas such as marketing, communications, and sales, thereby educating the broader public. Sonic’s media and learning platform, GMSonic, began as a podcast, but the company has since expanded it into a comprehensive platform that shares educational content with its community members. The firm aims to educate new developers on how to utilize Sonic, recognize builders for their contributions, and inform community members about all the activities within the ecosystem. Sonic will also continue hosting its Sonic Global Summit and participating in other major conferences to educate people and encourage them to join its ecosystem, allowing them to benefit as well. The company aims to establish a network that fosters learning and collaboration between builders and users. In return, the platform will become stronger in the long term, and everyone will benefit from their participation. CEO Mitchell Demeter stated that the company has a healthy treasury, a substantial pool of liquidity, and the necessary resources to expand its team and plans. He called the approach “speed with purpose,” and said the goal of the company is to build a system where everyone has a reason to participate, help the network grow, and benefit from its success.

Thiel made these remarks after acknowledging that the Bitcoin mining industry is experiencing hardship due to stiff competition, increasing energy demand, and declining profits. During an interview, the CEO referred to Bitcoin mining as a zero-sum game. Thiel explained that it gets tougher for everyone else when more individuals join in. This is because profit declines, and one’s minimum cost is the funds spent on energy, he added. MARA CEO raises concerns about the situation surrounding the Bitcoin mining industry Thiel noticed that several mining firms are shifting their focus to related areas such as artificial intelligence or developing high-performance computing (HPC) systems. According to his findings , others struggled because they cannot keep up with the pace of those operating their own hardware at minimal cost, such as leading manufacturers and companies like Tether. “You have hardware suppliers running their own mining businesses since customers are not buying as much equipment,” Thiel stated. Based on his argument, the global hashrate continues to surge, affecting everyone else’s profits, causing them to shrink. Following the intense nature of this situation, the MARA CEO cautioned that things could worsen for miners after the next Bitcoin halving in 2028. At this time, the block reward for miners will reduce to approximately 1.5 BTC per block. Therefore, if transaction charges do not increase or if Bitcoin’s price does not escalate significantly, Thiel warned that mining could be profitless for many. To further explain his argument, he claimed that Bitcoin was designed with the idea that transaction charges would ultimately replace subsidies. However, Thiel mentioned that this idea has not yet materialized, leading him to conclude that if Bitcoin does not increase by 50% or more each year, it will become challenging after 2028 and considerably tougher in 2032. In the meantime, analysts discovered some temporary increases in the industry. Still, sources declare that, although there have been some temporary increases, transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are generally low. According to these sources, the latest hikes in charges, such as those from inscriptions and Ordinals, have not lasted long enough to replace block subsidies. Thiel believes the mining industry market will eventually balance itself Thiel mentioned that miners should pay close attention to new developments, such as banks purchasing block space in advance to ensure priority in transactions. According to the CEO, this move is a game-changer in the industry, but nothing is solid yet. In such a scenario, smaller miners are extremely stressed. Large entities adapt to the situation by controlling their energy sources and investing in private AI infrastructure, while smaller companies may be forced to close down. To address this issue, Thiel stated that they plan to maintain their production costs in the lowest 25%. With this percentage in place, the MARA CEO asserted that in a tough mining market, 75% of their competitors will have to close before they do. Looking forward, Thiel believed that the market would eventually balance itself as miners attain their profit limits. However, he noted that this limit is rising swiftly. “By 2028, you’ll either need to generate power yourself, be owned by a power generator, or team up with one,” the CEO said. “The time for being a miner connected directly to the grid is running out.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-12 05:34:58

RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones cautioned that if tensions rise, early indicators of financial fragmentation, such as changes in central bank reserve holdings, could reveal weaknesses. RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones spoke on Wednesday at the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia conference in Broadbeach, Queensland. In his speech, Jones pointed to “emerging evidence” of disparities in central banks’ reserve management practices, specifically a rise in gold holdings among a select group of nations. RBA warns of market overconfidence risks Brad Jones claimed that there was growing evidence that central banks’ reserve asset holdings were becoming fragmented. He stated that a group of nations essentially accounts for all the rise in gold holdings by central banks. Jones added that it is obvious that some of this is due to the possibility of asset confiscation sanctions. Jones also mentioned issues with fragmentation in financial safety nets and international payments. He emphasized that fragmentation issues are currently “more a fear than a lived reality.” According to Jones, risk premiums across asset classes have dropped to “concerning lows.” He claimed that the drop indicates that markets are having difficulty pricing in binary or geopolitical risk. “It’s not so much that we think that the levels of risk premiums are completely unsustainable, we’re just surprised that there’s not a bit more reflected in those levels of spreads given what we observe, which is quite a confronting set of potential risks.” -Brad Jones, RBA Assistant Governor. Jones claimed that many central banks are perplexed as to why market pricing appears to be so elevated. Jones’s comments show the growing government concern that, amid escalating geopolitical tensions and global economic realignments, financial markets have become unduly complacent. The RBA is raising awareness of market behavior and the possibility of shocks that challenge policy intervention assumptions as central banks adapt to a more fragmented environment. RBA signals inflation risks and rate outlook Last month, Michele Bullock, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, warned that a sharp decline in global optimism could lead to financial instability and prompt further interest rate reductions. Speaking on October 27 at the annual Australian Business Economists event in Sydney, she claimed that despite geopolitical and economic threats, investors appeared unduly comfortable. Ms. Bullock informed the Sydney group that her international counterparts were “flummoxed” by how “sanguine” or hopeful the financial markets had become. She questioned if the financial markets may go negative, “Could it all end up very badly?” According to Bullock, the low risk premiums are the reason for the low credit spreads. She stated that although the unemployment rate in Australia increased to 4.5% in September, the job market was still “tight.” Additionally, she confirmed that if the markets undergo a major directional shift, the RBA would need to focus on financial stability issues. In response to a reporter’s question about whether the RBA would lower interest rates amid an “AI bubble,” Bullock stated that the board does not consider asset prices when making monetary policy decisions. However, she stated that the RBA would consider lowering interest rates if the financial markets did decline sharply and it harmed the economy, without mentioning the potential for an AI bubble to collapse. On Monday, RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said in a speech that there is growing discussion about whether the current cash rate of 3.6% is restrictive enough to control inflation. The topic is crucial for the policy outlook. According to Hauser, there was little room to increase without driving up inflation, as demand was “slightly” over potential when GDP growth picked up last year, marking the tightest recovery since the early 1980s. Hauser claimed that the belief that inflation would continue to decline in the economy is largely based on the current assessment that monetary policy is rather restrictive. The central bank now projects inflation will remain above the 2-3% target zone until mid-2026, based on the expectation of one more rate drop next year. According to the RBA, the third-quarter inflation statistics came in surprisingly high, leading the bank to forecast it will settle at 2.6%, slightly above the 2.5% midpoint Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

While the analyst said there was a small possibility of a recovery in the short term, he argued that the overall trend was still clearly downward. Il Capo stated that some support levels are working in lower timeframes, saying, “We may see a slight short-term rebound, but the overall outlook is bearish. Many are saying this is the start of the altcoin season. In my opinion, this is just a 'dead cat bounce' and a few exit pumps.” Related News: When Will Altcoins Finally Start Booming?

Il Capo, who called the sharp decline that occurred on October 10th the “pre-black swan period,” stated that if a larger decline were to occur, he would aggressively turn to the bull market: “There will come a time to be bullish. Probably after a bigger capitulation than on October 10th. Then I'll be one of the most optimistic. But now is not that time.” Market data also supports the analyst's cautious stance. Bitcoin is trading at $103,300, down 2.44% in the last 24 hours.

Financial Services Commission Chairman Lee Eog-weon recently announced plans to fast-track the second phase of the country’s crypto legislation, specifically targeting stablecoin regulation. This move comes as global attention focuses on the potential risks and benefits of these digital assets. Why Does Stablecoin Oversight Matter Now? During a November press conference in Seoul, Chairman Lee highlighted the dual nature of stablecoins. He acknowledged their innovative functions for payments and remittances while emphasizing the urgent need for stablecoin oversight to prevent capital flight and protect monetary stability. The commission recognizes that without proper regulation, these digital assets could threaten the entire financial ecosystem. Three Key Principles for Won-Backed Stablecoins The FSC has outlined three fundamental principles that will guide the new stablecoin oversight framework: International Standards Alignment – Ensuring Korean regulations match global best practices Innovation with Safety – Promoting technological advancement while establishing financial market protections Integrated Safeguards – Creating systems that combine finance, industry, and technology What Challenges Does Stablecoin Oversight Face? Implementing effective stablecoin oversight presents several challenges. Regulators must balance innovation with consumer protection while maintaining Korea’s competitive edge in the digital economy. Moreover, the rapid evolution of stablecoin technology requires flexible regulatory approaches that can adapt to new developments. The FSC’s accelerated timeline demonstrates their commitment to addressing these challenges promptly. How Will Stablecoin Oversight Impact Users? For cryptocurrency users in South Korea, enhanced stablecoin oversight means greater security and stability. The regulations will likely include: Clear reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers Regular auditing and transparency measures Consumer protection mechanisms Interoperability standards with traditional finance This comprehensive approach to stablecoin oversight aims to build trust while fostering innovation in the digital asset space. The Global Context of Stablecoin Regulation South Korea’s move toward stricter stablecoin oversight aligns with international trends. Major economies worldwide are developing similar frameworks to address the growing importance of stablecoins in global finance. By accelerating their regulatory process, Korea positions itself as a leader in responsible digital asset management while ensuring its financial system remains secure and competitive. Conclusion: A Balanced Approach to Digital Finance South Korea’s accelerated timeline for crypto legislation phase two represents a significant step toward comprehensive stablecoin oversight. The FSC’s three-pronged approach demonstrates a thoughtful balance between innovation and protection. As the global financial landscape evolves, this proactive stance on stablecoin oversight will likely influence how other nations approach digital asset regulation, potentially setting new international standards for the cryptocurrency industry. Frequently Asked Questions What is the timeline for Korea’s new stablecoin regulations? The Financial Services Commission plans to accelerate the drafting process this month, with implementation expected to follow after parliamentary review and public consultation periods. How will stablecoin oversight affect existing cryptocurrency exchanges? Exchanges will need to comply with new reporting requirements and ensure listed stablecoins meet the regulatory standards, potentially leading to more rigorous listing procedures. Will these regulations apply to foreign stablecoins? Yes, the stablecoin oversight framework will likely cover all stablecoins available to Korean users, regardless of their country of origin, to ensure comprehensive market protection. What protections will consumers gain from stablecoin oversight? Consumers can expect greater transparency about reserve backing, improved redemption mechanisms, and enhanced legal protections against potential stablecoin failures. How does this align with other countries’ stablecoin regulations? Korea’s approach mirrors global trends while addressing specific national concerns, particularly regarding won-backed stablecoins and capital flight prevention. Can developers still innovate under the new stablecoin oversight? Absolutely. The framework aims to promote responsible innovation while establishing necessary safeguards, encouraging development within defined regulatory parameters.

China Alleges State-Level Operation The incident in question revolves around the theft of 127,272 BTC from the LuBian Bitcoin mining pool in December 2020, constituting one of the most substantial crypto heists in history. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point The Chinese National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center suggests that this large-scale hack was likely a planned “state-level hacker operation” orchestrated by the US. The agency points to the discreet and delayed movement of the stolen Bitcoin as indicative of governmental involvement rather than typical criminal behavior. The report further links the Bitcoin from LuBian, a former Bitcoin mining firm, to tokens seized by the US government, which authorities claim are linked to Chen Zhi, the chairman of the Cambodian conglomerate Prince Group. Chen Zhi had been accused by the US of participating in a wire-fraud conspiracy and running a money-laundering scheme in October. Notably, details on when and how the Bitcoin was confiscated by the US remain undisclosed. The narrative put forth in the report suggests that the US government might have employed hacking tactics as early as 2020 to appropriate the 127,000 Bitcoin associated with Chen Zhi, characterizing the operation as an example of a “black eats black” maneuver orchestrated by a state-level hacking entity. Bitcoin Forfeiture Fallout Federal prosecutors involved in the Chen case have refrained from disclosing the methods used to gain control of the Bitcoin, following the Department of Justice’s civil forfeiture complaint seizing the 127,271 BTC, which stands as the most substantial forfeiture action undertaken by the US government. Recent statements from the Chinese government have highlighted a growing trend of accusing the American government of engaging in hacking activities.

Just last month, China alleged that it possessed undeniable evidence of a US cyber attack on the National Time Service Center. In response to the allegations, a lawyer representing Chen Zhi has filed a request for additional time in a US court to allow for tracing of the stolen BTC from LuBian. The attorney, Matthew L. Schwartz has criticized the government’s claims against Chen as being “seriously misguided.” Schwartz, who serves as counsel to Mr. Chen and the Prince Group, stated that they are collaborating with cryptocurrency experts to trace the Bitcoin seized over a year ago and stolen back in 2020. T At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $102,550, recording losses of 3% in the 24-hour time frame.

54297529,625898,1762927248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54297529.jpeg,Inside The US Senate’s Crypto Market Structure Draft Bill: A Victory For The Industry?,https://bitcoinist.com/the-us-senates-crypto-market-structure-draft-bill/,"The US Senate Agriculture Committee has released the highly anticipated draft of the Market Structure Bill, a move many are praising as a significant milestone for the crypto industry in the United States. With promises of clearer regulatory frameworks just around the corner, this development is expected to enhance the operating environment for various cryptocurrencies. Historic Draft Bill Promises Clarity For Crypto The draft , unveiled by Agriculture Chair John Boozman and Senator Cory Booker, includes provisions that aim to overhaul regulations pertaining to digital asset commodities. However, the text features numerous sections marked with brackets, indicating ongoing negotiations among lawmakers regarding key definitions and other critical issues that remain unresolved. One of the most notable aspects of the draft is the formal definition of digital commodities, which positions the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulatory authority for their trading. This shift may resolve jurisdictional conflicts between the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to experts at The Bull Theory, this clarity will finally extend to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), potentially easing the regulatory burdens faced by these digital assets. The draft also introduces protections for blockchain developers and infrastructure providers, ensuring they are not classified as money transmitters or brokers. This aspect of the bill allows developers to innovate freely, enabling them to operate nodes or deploy smart contracts without the fear of legal repercussions. In an effort to boost market transparency and advocate for retail investors, the bill proposes the establishment of a new Digital Commodity Retail Office within the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This office is designed to oversee fair markets and protect investors, moving the crypto industry closer to being recognized as a legitimate financial sector. Furthermore, the legislation emphasizes global alignment by mandating cooperation with foreign regulators, setting the stage for internationally consistent digital asset standards. This alignment is something that institutional investors have eagerly anticipated, as it would enhance the clarity surrounding spot markets , exchanges, and derivatives once the CFTC assumes its role as crypto’s primary regulator. Bipartisan Negotiations Underway The potential passage of this bill could serve as a significant green light for institutional capital, particularly for altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have remained on the sidelines amid the government shutdown. The Bull Theory experts assert that the crypto sector has never been closer to achieving full regulatory clarity in the United States. Separately, Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the other half of the bill concerning securities regulations, have already introduced a partisan discussion draft earlier this year. They are currently engaged in negotiations with Democrats to reach a bipartisan agreement , with hopes of moving forward with a markup later this year.

Data shared by crypto enthusiast Cryptobilbuwoo0 shows a steady decline in the number of XRP tokens held across the top accounts. The chart outlines how wallet balances have evolved, providing a clear picture of changing ownership patterns in the network. According to the data, only 724 accounts, representing the top 0.01% of all XRP wallets, each hold 4,656,990 XRP or more. Expanding the range, 7,242 wallets in the top 0.1% maintain balances above 323,157 XRP, while the top 1%, consisting of 72,421 wallets, hold at least 49,998 XRP each. For the top 10% , balances fall to about 2,322 XRP. Cryptobilbuwoo0 summarized the development in a brief post, writing, “People’s XRP holdings are getting less and less. They want you out of this game. HODL.” The statement reflects growing sentiment among XRP holders that supply concentration and reduced token availability may signal an attempt to price out retail investors . #XRP Rich List.

While some small and mid-tier holders appear to be reducing their positions, larger accounts are maintaining significant quantities. Whales are showing confidence in XRP , and the data from the rich list suggests that XRP supply is becoming more consolidated among large, long-term participants who are holding through market fluctuations. Such redistribution may be a potential foundation for stronger price movements. When the circulating supply held by speculative traders decreases, it can create conditions for tighter market liquidity. In turn, this tends to amplify the price impact of future demand growth. A steady contraction in available supply also implies that the selling pressure in the market may be easing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positive Indicators for Market Strength The contraction of balances among mid-range accounts could indicate that XRP is transitioning into a more mature phase of holder composition. Investors with larger stakes may be demonstrating greater conviction in the asset’s long-term potential . If this consolidation trend continues, XRP’s market dynamics could strengthen. A smaller active circulating supply means price reactions to new capital inflows would likely become sharper. As liquidity narrows, buyers entering the market face fewer sellers willing to offload tokens, which can accelerate upward movements once momentum returns.

This latest transaction brings the mysterious investor’s total holdings to an incredible 386,000 Ethereum, valued at approximately $1.33 billion. The strategic accumulation by this Ethereum whale signals strong confidence in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. What Does This Ethereum Whale Know That We Don’t? The recent activity from this Ethereum whale represents one of the most significant accumulation patterns we’ve seen in months. According to Onchain-lense data, the investor purchased and withdrew 30,500 ETH from Binance in this single transaction. This follows another substantial purchase of ETH worth $98.59 million made earlier the same day. The consistent buying pattern suggests this Ethereum whale has a clear strategic vision for their investment portfolio. This isn’t the first major move from this particular Ethereum whale. Previously, the same entity withdrew 60,000 ETH from Binance and deposited the funds into Aave. The repeated large-scale withdrawals from centralized exchanges indicate this Ethereum whale prefers self-custody and decentralized finance protocols over exchange-held assets. Why Are Whale Movements So Important for Ethereum? Understanding whale behavior provides crucial insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. When a major Ethereum whale accumulates this significantly, it often indicates: Long-term confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals Reduced selling pressure as coins move to cold storage Potential price support from large holders Institutional-level interest in the asset The actions of this Ethereum whale matter because large holders can significantly influence market dynamics. Their accumulation patterns often precede major price movements, making them important indicators for both retail and institutional investors. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The substantial withdrawal by this Ethereum whale reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges. When coins move from exchanges to private wallets, they’re less likely to be sold quickly. This creates a more stable foundation for price appreciation. Moreover, the Ethereum whale’s continued accumulation suggests they anticipate positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. Market analysts are closely watching these movements because large-scale accumulation by an Ethereum whale often signals institutional-level confidence. The timing is particularly interesting given recent market conditions and upcoming Ethereum network upgrades. The Ethereum whale’s actions could be positioning for anticipated positive momentum. What Can Retail Investors Learn From This Ethereum Whale? While most investors don’t have the capital of this Ethereum whale, there are valuable lessons in their strategy: Consistent accumulation during various market conditions Preference for self-custody over exchange storage Strategic use of DeFi protocols like Aave Long-term perspective rather than short-term trading The Ethereum whale’s approach demonstrates the importance of having a clear investment thesis and sticking to it through market fluctuations. Their pattern of steady accumulation, regardless of short-term price movements, shows conviction in their investment strategy. The Bottom Line: Why This Ethereum Whale Matters This massive accumulation by an Ethereum whale represents more than just another large transaction. It signals deep confidence in Ethereum’s future at a time when the crypto market faces various challenges. The consistent pattern of withdrawals from exchanges to private wallets suggests this investor is building a long-term position rather than engaging in short-term speculation. As we watch this Ethereum whale continue to build their position, the broader market gains valuable insights into institutional-level thinking about cryptocurrency investments. Their actions provide a real-time case study in strategic cryptocurrency accumulation and portfolio management. Frequently Asked Questions What is a cryptocurrency whale? A cryptocurrency whale is an individual or entity that holds large amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions can significantly impact market prices due to the size of their holdings. Why do whales move funds from exchanges? Whales often move funds from exchanges to private wallets for security reasons, to reduce counterparty risk, or because they plan to hold long-term rather than trade frequently. How can I track whale movements? You can track whale movements using blockchain explorers and specialized analytics platforms that monitor large transactions and wallet activities across major cryptocurrencies. Do whale movements always predict price changes? While whale movements can indicate sentiment, they don’t always predict immediate price changes. Market conditions, news events, and broader economic factors also play significant roles. What does this mean for small Ethereum investors? Large accumulations by whales can indicate confidence in the asset’s future, but small investors should always conduct their own research and invest according to their risk tolerance. How significant is 386,000 ETH in the broader market? 386,000 ETH represents a substantial portion of circulating supply and demonstrates significant market influence, though Ethereum’s large market cap means no single whale controls the market.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-xrp-bear-market-signal-heres-what-is-coming/,"XRP has slipped below the Gaussian channel once again, reviving comparisons to previous market cycles that preceded major price moves. In a recent video , Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst on X, noted that a similar pattern marked the start of bear markets in both 2018, 2022, and 2024. “This is not bullish,” he said, recalling how previous breaks below the channel historically confirmed downward trends. During the 2018 breakdown, XRP fell by 74.55%. In 2022, it declined by 61.27%, while the 2024 instance resulted in a 16.66% drop before its price quickly rebounded. Each of these declines followed an initial move below the Gaussian channel , which traders often use to identify market momentum and trend reversals. #XRP Bear Market Signal pic.twitter.com/v9lIyXi0sw — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 10, 2025 Where is XRP Going Next? At the time of his analysis, XRP traded at $2.28. If the same historical percentages were to repeat, XRP could drop to around $0.58 in a 74.55% decline, $0.88 in a 61.27% fall, or $1.9 in a milder 16.66% pullback. Such projections place the asset in a potential range that aligns with previous corrective phases. However, XRP’s recovery in 2024 showed that temporary dips below the Gaussian channel do not necessarily mean prolonged weakness. Potential for a Sharp Recovery Following its 16.66% decline in 2024, XRP rebounded dramatically, soaring more than 500% to reach $3.39 by January 2025. That rally defied broader market expectations at the time and highlighted XRP’s capacity for rapid price recoveries once bearish sentiment fades. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Applying a similar percentage increase to XRP’s current level suggests that, if history were to repeat, a 500% surge from $2.28 would project a potential move toward approximately $13.68. While such gains remain speculative, the comparison highlights how XRP has historically transitioned from deep corrections to strong upward trends within relatively short timeframes. Market Outlook Steph Is Crypto’s assessment emphasizes the importance of watching XRP’s short-term structure rather than assuming a fixed outcome. Whether XRP follows the 2018 and 2022 patterns or mirrors the 2024 recovery will depend largely on external market factors. While XRP remains technically sensitive, it is currently showing bullish signals after a notable rally over the past 24 hours . If the digital asset can maintain this positive momentum, its ability to recover swiftly could redefine how traders interpret such technical patterns.

He added, “Because of the speed at which they have to do the transaction, it’s worse for consumers. Disclosures are important . . . but if there are 14 steps, it’s worse.” According to FT, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi criticized the UK’s strict crypto regulations for hindering capital flows and hurting user experience.

Sethi also said Kraken won’t offer… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 12, 2025 FCA Rules Aim To Protect Investors With Risk Warnings And Appropriateness Checks The Financial Conduct Authority brought in financial promotion rules in late 2023. Firms must post clear risk warnings, ban incentives to invest, build positive frictions, and run appropriateness checks to assess whether customers understand crypto risks. Companies marketing to UK users must comply. Sethi said the added hurdles deter some customers from investing at all, which could mean missing potential gains. He argued that excessive friction slows transactions and undermines user experience. According to the FCA, its rules help people understand both benefits and risks. Regulators Tighten Grip As FCA Sues HTX Over Crypto Promotion Breaches Executives have long said Britain’s stance is too cautious. Calls to loosen rules have grown this year, as the US under President Donald Trump has become more welcoming to digital assets. Enforcement has also stepped up. The FCA sued HTX last month for failing to comply with promotion rules. The exchange is linked to Justin Sun, who has invested millions of dollars in Trump’s digital asset ventures. Kraken, founded in 2011, ranks among the 15 largest exchanges by trading volume. Sethi, who co-leads Kraken with David Ripley and chairs Tribe Capital, said tighter UK protections leave British users unable to access about three quarters of the products available to US customers, including higher-yield offerings and some decentralised finance lending. The San Francisco exchange is preparing for a public listing as early as 2026. Bloomberg reported that Kraken is working with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to lead the offering. Expansion remains a focus. In March, Kraken said it would acquire derivatives platform NinjaTrader in a $1.5b deal, a move that would deepen its presence in futures and options while it navigates diverging regulatory paths in the UK and the US.

The token represents dollar deposits at the bank, allowing users to send and receive money via Coinbase’s Base public blockchain. Naveen Mallela, global co-head of JPMorgan blockchain division Kinexys, told Bloomberg on Wednesday that the rollout will enable payments to process in seconds and 24/7, bypassing traditional banking delays. JPMorgan is planning to expand the service to other blockchains, Mallela added. The move signals JPMorgan’s push to embrace digital assets into core institutional banking services. JPMorgan Gives clients’ clients access to JPM Coin The rollout comes after successful pilot tests with major firms, including Mastercard, Coinbase, and B2C2. Coinbase is reportedly set to accept JPM Coin as collateral for transactions and liquidity operations. According to Mallela, the bank is considering making the token accessible to clients of its clients at a later stage. It will also expand to other currency denominations, pending approval from regulators. Mallela described deposit tokens as “yield-bearing,” differing from stablecoins. They are digital claims on funds already sitting in client bank accounts, designed to facilitate easy blockchain transactions. “We think that stablecoins get a lot of buzz, but for institutional clients, deposit-based products offer a compelling alternative,” Mallela said. In June, JPMorgan launched the first banking token, “JPMD”, on the Coinbase Base network, following a trademark application for “JPMD.” JPMD is fully backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars and will initially be available to institutional clients only, the banking giant said at the time .

Bank of Korea, for instance, announced central bank deposit tokens with public blockchain networks in May, describing it as a “type of stablecoin.” The move was intended to drive away the influx of global stablecoins.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization trades around $3,450, maintaining a position that analysts consider crucial for the continuation of its bullish structure. XRP’s price action over the past 24 Hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The asset has experienced notable price swings in recent weeks. A mid-November decline pushed ETH toward the $3,400 mark before stabilizing. Current trading shows the cryptocurrency hovering near $3,564, with modest daily losses as market participants monitor critical support and resistance zones. Critical Support Zone Determines Next Move The $3,000 level has emerged as the most significant support area for Ethereum's current market structure. Technical analysts consistently highlight this price point as the foundation for any potential upward movement. A sustained hold above this threshold could enable ETH to target the $4,300 region in the coming weeks. Recent price action suggests a range-bound consolidation rather than a bearish breakdown. The cryptocurrency has been trading between $3,348 and $3,700, with multiple tests of these boundaries. Market observers describe the current pullback as healthy within the context of the broader uptrend that began when Ethereum bounced from $2,800 earlier in 2025. The $3,700 zone presents immediate resistance. This level, which previously provided reliable support, has now become a barrier. Ethereum's Bitfinex chart shows at least three bounces from this horizontal band since late October. A decisive break above this level, accompanied by strong volume, could signal renewed bullish momentum. Institutional Players Increase Holdings On-chain data reveals significant accumulation by large wallet holders despite recent price weakness. One verified whale purchased 75,418 ETH worth approximately $269 million through Binance in just 12 hours. This acquisition increased the wallet's total holdings to roughly 266,901 ETH, valued at $949 million. The accumulation trend extends beyond isolated transactions. Throughout November, whale addresses acquired over $1.37 billion worth of ETH even as prices declined approximately 12%. This pattern typically signals that sophisticated investors view current price levels as attractive entry points. Market analysts note that such behavior often establishes soft price floors. While not guaranteeing immediate upward movement, substantial whale accumulation suggests that well-capitalized participants do not consider current valuations excessive. Short-term technical analysis identifies a support band between $3,520 and $3,348. Traders have also noted concentrated long liquidation leverage stacked between $3,507 and $3,460. A decline into this zone could trigger sharp price movements as leveraged positions get liquidated. Immediate resistance levels sit at $3,631, $3,665, and $3,707. Breaking through these barriers would improve the probability of a sustained rebound, particularly if Bitcoin maintains upward momentum simultaneously. Bitcoin's price action continues to significantly influence Ethereum's directional moves. Elliott Wave analysis from market technicians suggests Ethereum may be completing a corrective wave pattern. This structure could set the stage for renewed bullish momentum once the correction finishes.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-12 07:08:05

The company began issuing the JPYC yen-pegged stablecoin on October 27, and aims to influence the central bank’s control over monetary policy. JPYC has disclosed that it has issued nearly 143 million yen worth of JPYC stablecoin tokens to date. It also noted that the number of account holders reached 4,707 as of November 12. The company has stated that it intends to issue 10 trillion yen (~$66.32 billion) worth of JPYC over three years. However, it acknowledges that its JPYC project is still a drop in the ocean of a 290-billion-dollar stablecoin market. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer is committed to establishing the yen’s presence in a market where U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoins make up nearly 99% of the global supply, according to JPYC’s CEO Noritaka Okabe. Okabe says Japan must ensure yen presence in global stablecoin market The JPYC executive said in an interview with Reuters that various assets are now being traded on blockchains in real-time globally. However, he noted that the U.S. dollar disproportionately dominates the stablecoin market. Okabe emphasized that this U.S. dollar dominance disadvantages Japanese firms that need to pay extra transaction and hedging costs. Meanwhile, the JPYC boss thinks Japan must ensure the yen has a presence in the global stablecoin market. JPYC stated that its stablecoin project is fully convertible to the yen and backed by domestic savings, as well as Japanese government bonds (JPGBs). The company has unveiled plans to invest up to 80% of its proceeds in JGBs and 20% in bank savings. “With the BOJ tapering bond buying, stablecoin issuers could emerge as the biggest holders of JGBs in the next few years.” – Noritaka Okabe , CEO of JPYC Okabe also pointed out that, given the rapid growth of stablecoins, issuers could help Japan fill a gap left behind by the diminishing presence of the Bank of Japan (BOJ). He added that the increasing presence of yen stablecoin issuers could influence the BOJ’s monetary policy. Okabe noted that the volume of JGBs bought by such issuers is swayed by the balance of demand and supply for stablecoins. BOJ still holds 50% of the JGB market The BOJ reportedly still holds 50% of the 1,055-trillion-yen JGB market. However, it has slowed bond purchases, which it began last year as part of its efforts to phase out a massive decade-long stimulus. Meanwhile, Okabe believes that while authorities could try to control the duration of bonds stablecoin issuers buy, it would be difficult for them to control the volume they hold. He mentioned that the control of bond durations by authorities will occur worldwide, and Japan is no exception. The JPYC CEO also disclosed his company’s plan to buy mostly short-term securities. However, he said government officials and lawmakers were approaching him about whether JPYC could buy more longer-term JGBs. Okabe believes this is a possibility and said it is something his company can look into in the future. Noritaka Okabe disclosed that Japan’s three largest banks are planning to experiment with jointly issuing stablecoins. He noted that U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoins have surged with strong backing from President Donald Trump, urging Japan to follow suit. However, policymakers warn that stablecoins could facilitate the movement of funds outside regulated banking systems. Okabe says this will undermine the role of commercial banks in global payment flows. Meanwhile, JPYC’s partnerships and megabank initiatives are expected to accelerate the adoption of yen-backed stablecoin, creating a flywheel of use cases and liquidity. Japan’s FSA has also created a sandbox for innovation, reducing compliance risks for early adopters.

This massive institutional investment represents one of the largest single staking operations in recent memory, highlighting the growing confidence major players have in blockchain technology and decentralized finance. What Does Paradigm Stakes HYPE Mean for the Market? When Paradigm stakes HYPE tokens worth $581 million, it sends a powerful signal to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This move demonstrates strong institutional belief in the HYPE ecosystem’s long-term potential. According to on-chain analyst MLM, the investment firm allocated 14.7 million HYPE tokens across strategic positions within the network. The staking operation reveals careful planning and strategic positioning. Of the total staked amount, Paradigm transferred 3.02 million HYPE (valued at $120 million) directly to HyperEVM. This substantial allocation suggests the firm sees particular promise in HyperEVM’s capabilities and future development roadmap. How Is Paradigm Managing This Massive Stake? Paradigm’s approach to managing their HYPE stake shows sophisticated risk management and infrastructure planning. The majority of the staked volume has been delegated to the Anchorage node operated by staking infrastructure provider Figment. This decision indicates: Professional node operator selection for maximum security Infrastructure diversification to mitigate risks Focus on reliable staking returns through established providers Currently, Paradigm maintains 1.41 million HYPE ($55.9 million) in their direct custody wallet. This reserve provides flexibility for future strategic moves while ensuring immediate liquidity if needed. Why Should Investors Care About This Move? The decision by Paradigm to stake HYPE at this scale carries significant implications for both retail and institutional investors. When a firm of Paradigm’s caliber makes such a substantial commitment, it often precedes broader market recognition and adoption. This massive stake could potentially: Increase network security through enhanced staking participation Drive positive price momentum for HYPE tokens Attract additional institutional interest in the ecosystem Validate the underlying technology and project roadmap Moreover, the timing and scale of Paradigm’s HYPE stake suggests careful market analysis and conviction in the project’s fundamentals. Such moves typically undergo extensive due diligence before execution. What Challenges Come With Large-Scale Staking? While Paradigm’s decision to stake HYPE represents a vote of confidence, large-scale staking operations face several challenges. The firm must navigate liquidity constraints, market volatility, and technical risks associated with maintaining such a substantial position. However, their strategic allocation across different components of the HYPE ecosystem shows thoughtful risk management. The delegation to Figment’s Anchorage node specifically addresses technical execution risks, while the HyperEVM allocation positions Paradigm to benefit from that platform’s growth. This balanced approach demonstrates why institutional players can move markets when they stake significant amounts. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption Paradigm’s decision to stake $581 million in HYPE marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency’s maturation. This move not only validates the HYPE ecosystem but also signals growing institutional comfort with blockchain technology. As more traditional investment firms follow Paradigm’s lead, we can expect increased market stability and mainstream adoption. The careful distribution between HyperEVM, Figment’s infrastructure, and direct wallet holdings shows sophisticated portfolio management that retail investors can learn from. This strategic staking operation sets a new benchmark for institutional participation in decentralized networks. Frequently Asked Questions What is staking in cryptocurrency? Staking involves locking cryptocurrency tokens to support network operations and earn rewards, similar to earning interest in traditional finance. Why did Paradigm choose to stake HYPE? Paradigm likely sees long-term potential in the HYPE ecosystem and aims to earn staking rewards while supporting network security. How does staking affect HYPE token price? Large-scale staking reduces circulating supply, which can create upward price pressure while demonstrating institutional confidence. What risks come with staking? Staking carries risks including market volatility, technical failures, and liquidity constraints during lock-up periods. Can retail investors stake HYPE similarly? Yes, though at smaller scales, retail investors can participate in HYPE staking through various platforms and delegation services. How does Figment’s role impact the staking process? Figment provides professional staking infrastructure, ensuring reliable node operation and maximizing rewards for delegators like Paradigm.

This test payment, made through the cross-border mBridge platform, confirms the UAE’s technical integration and signals readiness for wider government and private sector adoption of CBDCs. The development is the first public update since the Central Bank’s March announcement that the Digital Dirham would begin rolling out in late 2025. Maktoum Bin Mohammed @MaktoumMohammed · Follow Today, Ministry of Finance & Dubai Finance marked a pivotal milestone in the history of government financial transformation in the UAE, as we executed the first government transaction using the Digital Dirham issued by the Central Bank of the UAE, representing the future of the 7:48 PM · Nov 11, 2025 213 Reply Copy link Read 47 replies First digital dirham payment completed in two minutes The payment was executed by the UAE Ministry of Finance and Dubai Finance as part of the CBDC’s ongoing pilot programme. The transaction took less than two minutes to complete. According to Dubai Finance , the objective was to verify “operational readiness” and ensure smooth system integration between government entities and the Central Bank. mBridge, the government payments platform used in this test, is designed for secure and efficient cross-border CBDC settlements. The pilot confirmed its capability to facilitate real-time transactions between federal and local bodies. The UAE government called the test “a step towards broader adoption” of its digital currency infrastructure. Launch strategy limits initial CBDC use to payments The Central Bank of the UAE clarified in a July policy paper that the digital currency will initially be restricted to payments. This controlled scope aims to minimise risks associated with more complex financial products like interest-bearing accounts or savings mechanisms. The phased launch is intended to allow gradual integration across sectors and monitor technical and regulatory impact before expanding functionality. The paper described the initiative as an effort to “future-proof” the country’s monetary system and ensure it remains responsive to a fast-changing digital economy. UAE joins global movement with cautious progression Globally, several governments are pursuing CBDCs, but very few have reached full implementation. As of now, only Nigeria, the Bahamas, and Jamaica have live, operational CBDC tokens, according to the Atlantic Council’s tracker. Around 49 other nations, including the UAE, remain in the pilot phase. Recent international developments mirror the UAE’s move. The European Central Bank has advanced to the next stage of its digital euro project, while Kyrgyzstan has announced plans to issue a national CBDC of its own. These actions show growing momentum towards state-backed digital currencies, despite ongoing concerns around privacy, surveillance, and centralised financial control. Privacy concerns and financial sector disruption remain key issues CBDCs continue to draw mixed responses from stakeholders. Advocates highlight their potential to improve transaction speed, enhance transparency, and increase financial inclusion. However, critics argue that direct interaction between individuals and central banks could threaten commercial banking institutions and reduce financial privacy. The UAE’s decision to restrict its initial CBDC use to basic payments appears designed to sidestep some of these concerns. By excluding interest-earning features and savings products from the launch phase, the government aims to test the technology without destabilising existing financial systems. As the country prepares for a broader rollout by Q4 2025, more phases of testing are expected. This first transaction demonstrates both progress and caution, positioning the UAE as a measured but ambitious player in the evolving CBDC space.

Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, called it “the most consequential roadmap for how an institution is going to integrate digital assets into their business.” Cody said it’s a complete compliance manual for firms trying to understand what regulations they need to follow to legally operate in crypto. The bill, as reported earlier by Cryptopolitan, also builds a structure for how financial institutions can safely engage with crypto, setting the stage for formal oversight instead of the usual regulatory tug-of-war. Bitcoin and Ether declared digital commodities in new crypto bill The Senate’s crypto bill classifies Bitcoin and Ether as “digital commodities,” giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) full authority to regulate them, a direct jab at former SEC chairman Gary Gensler position while he was in office. That designation is actually a really big deal for banks and funds that want to move crypto holdings into long-term strategies. By making this distinction, the Senate Agriculture Committee effectively splits the market into two worlds; regulated and unregulated. Tokens under regulation are expected to attract heavy institutional capital, more liquidity, and larger derivative markets. Unregulated tokens, on the other hand, will likely face pressure as investors flock to assets with clearer protections. The bill also forces crypto companies to separate their exchange, brokerage, custody, and trading operations, breaking apart the all-in-one model that’s been the norm in crypto for over a decade now. The draft also allows the CFTC to work jointly with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue new rules for crypto oversight. Cody said, “There’s a lot more power or authority delegated to the CFTC to have jurisdiction over this industry.” This marks a reversal of roles since the SEC had taken the lead for years, edging the CFTC out of the spotlight. Another section authorizes the CFTC to charge fees from registered crypto entities (such as exchanges, brokers, and dealers) to fund its supervision, registration, and public education duties. It’s a self-funding mechanism that reduces reliance on Congress for oversight money. The draft also introduces listing standards, requiring that crypto exchanges only allow trading of tokens that are “not readily susceptible to manipulation.” The goal is to protect investors from scams and rug pulls that continue to plague parts of the market. The Senate Agriculture Committee has clarified that the bill is still a discussion draft, not a final version. Lawmakers plan to gather public and industry feedback in the coming weeks, but Cody admitted it’s “almost impossible to get [a final version] done by the end of the year.” Key sections, such as anti-money-laundering and decentralized finance (DeFi) rules, are still open for revision. Keith Grossman, president of MoonPay, said the bipartisan nature of the bill shows that “crypto is a bipartisan issue.” Keith stressed the need for lawmakers to clearly differentiate between centralized and decentralized systems. This draft will eventually merge with the Senate Banking Committee’s version of the market structure proposal to create a single comprehensive crypto framework. Craig Salm, Chief Legal Officer at Grayscale, said regulators like the SEC, IRS, and Treasury Department have already made progress by offering new guidance on staking in crypto exchange-traded products. Craig added that “thoughtful legislation will be critical to solidifying the foundation of the crypto industry in the U. S. and unlocking even greater value for investors and consumers.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|BTC|CFTC|ETH|IRS|SEC|Treasury Department|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-12 07:19:55

In this article, we’ll examine the HR innovations already launched at Alfa Bank and explain in simple terms how each affects an employee’s experience at the company. Total Employee Experience: HR Tech Platform for Candidates, Employees, Managers, and the Business Alfa People assists employees with everyday tasks and all corporate activities. It’s a product with both web and mobile versions, as technologically advanced as the bank’s mobile app for customers. Employee convenience is first priority. Alfa Bank doesn’t just create a high-quality product — Alfa People allows users to seamlessly switch between multiple roles throughout their entire career. First, candidates experience digital hiring with zero office visits through the life time in the company. This initial touchpoint with the HR product shapes their impression. After joining the team, employees gain full access to Alfa People services. When they become managers, they can access management tools without switching windows, all within the same familiar interface. If a new business need arises, the team can adapt the business process to fit the unified HR Tech platform, and a new service appears in Alfa People. To ensure the product meets employee needs, the bank collects Voice of Employee ratings after each service interaction. AI-Powered Culture At Alfa Bank, any employee can gain fundamental skills for working with artificial intelligence. For example, you can take a course at Alfa Academy or join a working group focused on AI implementation within your team. If desired, you can build an entire career development path around this trending technology right at the bank: find like-minded colleagues and work together to introduce real innovations into a top-tier product. Tech Services and AI Applications for Every Employee In 2025, Alfa Bank launched the Alfa AI service based on the Alfa Gen platform. It brings seven leading neural networks into a familiar, user-friendly interface —right inside Alfa People. Any employee can start a chat with a neural network in just a few clicks to solve work-related problems or tackle any task. Alfa AI offers both internal and external AI models. Internal models operate within the bank’s secure environment and can safely process sensitive data without leaving the bank’s infrastructure. External models connect for tasks that don’t involve confidential information, leveraging the capabilities of leading AI platforms. This approach strikes a balance between security and AI efficiency. Built-in applications help newcomers with repetitive processes: drafting emails, analyzing files, creating images and etc. Employees can also write custom prompts for their specific needs, quickly create AI applications without coding skills, and share them with colleagues. All of this comes with no restrictions: no need to set up or renew subscriptions, learn new applications, or pay for tokens. Alfa AI is available to all employees from day one, with no requests or approvals required. AI for Efficient Recruitment One of Alfa Bank’s goals is to hire the best talent on the market. It’s especially challenging to quickly fill mass vacancies, such as contact-center or product delivery specialists. AI helps here too. Machine learning models rely on the profiles of successful Alfa Bank employees and identify suitable candidates from fields not typically associated with banking. The referral program is enhanced by an AI agent that scans uploaded CVs and suggests relevant Alfa Bank vacancies based on the candidate’s skills and experience. This way, employees can instantly find relevant openings for their contacts across all company departments. Working with ELTV: How to Increase Team Performance With AI, Alfa Bank takes an individual approach to each person. ML models analyze data and determine each employee’s peak effectiveness period. Work with ELTV begins with the recruitment ML model — it determines how well a candidate matches the profile of an effective employee and what potential they bring to the company. One ML model suggests optimal vacation dates to maintain productivity. Employees take leave at the right time, meet KPIs more efficiently, and avoid burnout. The bank improves its metrics and retains its team. Other models generate recommendations for managers, advising which processes need more attention. These recommendations help increase efficiency and retain staff. Alfa Bank’s win in the Best Use of AI in HR category recognizes its contribution to HR Tech. The company creates next-generation products where AI and tech services work for candidates, employees, managers, and the business. This is an AI-powered approach at every stage of the employee journey — from recruitment and development to boosting team efficiency and increasing ELTV. A strong team, efficient hiring, and tech-driven HR have become a real competitive advantage for the business.

This strategic move opens up new trading opportunities for investors seeking higher leverage and expanded market access. What Are PLANCK Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? PLANCK perpetual futures represent a significant milestone in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have expiration dates, perpetual futures continue indefinitely, making them ideal for long-term trading strategies. The introduction of PLANCK perpetual futures on Binance demonstrates the platform’s commitment to expanding its derivatives offerings. The timing couldn’t be better for traders looking to diversify their portfolios. With the PLANCK/USDT pair going live at 12:30 p.m. UTC on the 13th, investors have a unique opportunity to capitalize on this new market.

This high leverage ratio allows traders to: Amplify potential returns with smaller capital investments Execute sophisticated trading strategies previously limited by capital constraints Hedge existing positions more effectively across different market conditions Access greater market exposure without committing large amounts of capital However, remember that higher leverage also means increased risk.

What Trading Advantages Do PLANCK Perpetual Futures Offer? Trading PLANCK perpetual futures on Binance brings several distinct advantages to market participants. The platform’s robust infrastructure ensures reliable order execution and minimal slippage, even during volatile market conditions.

Market volatility can lead to rapid price movements that may trigger liquidation events if proper risk management isn’t in place. Successful traders typically use stop-loss orders and position sizing strategies to manage their exposure. Moreover, the perpetual nature of these contracts means funding rates become an important consideration. These periodic payments between long and short positions help keep the contract price aligned with the underlying asset’s spot price. Understanding how funding rates work is crucial for long-term PLANCK perpetual futures positions. How Can You Maximize Your PLANCK Perpetual Futures Experience?

The initiative is part of the standard clearing and settlement preparation process and doesn’t imply that the ETF has received regulatory approval. The listing only confirms that the fund is poised for trading after receiving regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although no official launch date has been announced, the listing aligns with broader efforts by asset managers to introduce blockchain-linked investment products with institutional backing. Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF awaits SEC approval The approval of the ETF could introduce major institutional access to the Chainlink network. The emergence of CLNK also boosts the liquidity and market demand for the LINK token. At the time of publication, the world’s 12th-largest digital asset, LINK, is trading at $15.45, down nearly 5% in the past 24 hours. The digital asset has also declined by approximately 19.2% over the past 30 days. LINK’s trading volume also surged post-announcement, suggesting that there’s growing participation from retail and institutional traders. In its S-1 filing with the SEC, Bitwise revealed that Coinbase Custody Trust Company will serve as custodian for its Chainlink fund. The ETF will also support in-kind creation and redemption, allowing investors to buy shares with LINK and receive the token when they sell their shares. Bitwise has also recently applied to list exchange-traded funds tracking Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Aptos, separately. At the time of publication, Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF holds more than 40,730 worth about $2.3 billion, while its Ethereum ETF holds more than 113,605 ETH worth more than $385 million. Other Chainlink ETFs are in the pipeline, showing the industry’s interest in such products as they await approval and launch. There has been an accelerating trend of institutional investment directed towards Chainlink, with Grayscale also submitting a proposal for a spot Chainlink ETF. The fund would be listed on the NYSE Arca under the ticker GLNK if approved. Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF listing follows the launch of its Solana Staking ETF in late October. LSEG data revealed that the fund already attracted more than $420 million in its first week. JPMorgan also predicted that such altcoin ETFs could attract $14 billion in their first six months, with nearly half of that amount potentially flowing into SOL funds. Bitwise’s chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, acknowledged that the firm likes being first, but also follows the rules. DTCC lists five XRP ETFS Bitwise and other investment firms, including Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and CoinShares, have also recently filed to launch ETFs tied to Ripple’s XRP. On Tuesday, the DTCC listed the five XRP funds on its website, classifying them as active and in the pre-launch stage. The listing doesn’t imply that the funds will be approved by the SEC, but it represents a crucial step that usually precedes the official launch. The inclusion of those funds on the DTCC list caused a strong market reaction in XRP. On-chain data showed that the digital asset surged nearly 12% in a matter of hours after the announcement. At the time of publication, XRP is trading at $2.40, down about 3.33% in the last 24 hours. XRP has also dropped by more than 5.7% in the last 30 days. Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg Intelligence argued that most funds that reach the DTCC listing stage eventually launch, especially if the regulatory environment is favorable. Balchunas’ remarks come as the SEC has relaxed certain procedures in recent weeks for reviewing ETFs amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The change allows issuers to submit coordinated amendments to their S-1 filings. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, believes that the debut of the crypto fund could happen in a matter of days once the current government shutdown ends.

It is a historic move in regulation that marks the beginning of a bright future in terms of meme coins attaining mainstream financial acceptance. Technical indicators point to growing momentum as both MACD indicates the occurrence of bullish crossover and RSI has increased to 64, which means that the buying pressure is increasing. But at the point of $0.20, DOGE has massive resistance with 11.12 billion tokens already gathered in the past, and this becomes a very critical point that the token cannot be further advanced. With investors considering what crypto to purchase today in light of these trends, numerous investors are comparing the forward-moving momentum of ETF-driven Dogecoin to those with more fundamentally sound DeFi initiatives with greater utility and growth processes. Dogecoin’s ETF-Driven Rally The prospective launch of the first Dogecoin ETF ever will bring a new belief to a new direction of this meme coin in the market. The most recent automatic time out with the SEC by Bitwise was initiated by an amendment to its S-1 filing submitted two weeks ago and established a deadline of November 12 which would result in the approval of the default had no objections come forward. This regulatory achievement together with the interference of Coinbase Custody as the specified custodian concerning the holdings of DOGE offers institutional reliability that has lacked on the meme coin markets until now. Though such tendencies produce good short-term conditions, the very concept of the Dogecoin value in the long-term is overly relying on the enthusiasm of speculation instead of basing it on its practical use, which is why the chosen strategy makes strategic investors consider alternative choices over the selection of the sort of crypto to purchase to enjoy continuous portfolio growth without necessarily following the immediate hype cycles. Mutuum Finance Presale Demand Where Dogecoin is profiting out of speculation by ETFs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has maintained incredible organic growth by its soaring presale. The project has already raised more than $18,600,000 and has already attracted 17,900 holders and this displays high confidence in the market with regard to the practical value proposition of the project. In Phase 6 of its presale and tokens priced at only $0.035, this is one of the best deals that an investor may look at in terms of securing the best crypto to invest in the current market cycle. Having now 90% of this phase already committed, the remaining tokens are being purchased by investors at a rapid pace. The next phase will introduce a 20% price increment to $0.040, and the present moment will be the last chance to occupy the positions at this stage before the project starts operating at the price of $0.06 that will yield 400% income to the Phase 6 participants. Basic Strength Over and above Speculative Resources Mutuum Finance defines its competitive edge by a complex twin-market loan scheme complying with authentic DeFi requirements outside of the issue of speculative trading. The innovative structure of the platform consists of capital efficient Peer-to-Contract pools and pliable Peer-to-Peer lending markets to provide full body yield prospects on both benchmark and specific digital assets. The creation of the protocol is right on time, and its V1 protocol implementation is scheduled to take place on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. In addition to its technical resources, Mutuum Finance allows more interest by a transparent 24-hour leaderboard which rewards the best contributor each day with a $500 MUTM prize. To investors considering investing in crypto both to obtain short-term rewards and in the long run, Mutuum Finance offers a great point as the highest valuable cryptocurrency to invest in at this stage of the market. As the next big crypto opportunity, Mutuum Finance is fundamentally a good opportunity with many catalysts in its future, and is becoming the most preferred crypto to buy to get short-term gains as well as long-term exposure to DeFi. Last Chance at the existing Price Phase 6 tokens offer a time-limited chance to position in Mutuum Finance at the present price of $0.035. Investors monitoring the volatility of Dogecoin under the ETFs have limited time to invest in the project with better fundamental forces and more straightforward ways to appreciate. As the next phase involves a substantial price rise, providing immediate involvement is the most profitable entry point compared to other investors as Mutuum Finance enters its next tier of growth, cementing itself as the preferred option of the investor looking to know what crypto to buy today and achieve the best risk-adjusted returns.

Bitcoin Dominance Breaks Below 50 EMA Since 2023, the Bitcoin dominance has remained firmly above the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), showing immense strength around this level. Even through market crashes, the digital asset has maintained its dominance, and with each passing year, the trendline has continued to rise. As long as the Bitcoin dominance stayed above the 50 EMA, it showed it would continue to dominate, but this is changing now.

According to the post by Unichartz, it shows that the Bitcoin dominance has now crashed below the 50-Day EMA for the first time in almost one year. This comes as the dominance lost its footing above 60% and has failed to reclaim its position above it. Naturally, there has been an attempt to reclaim the 50-Day EMA once again. However, this attempt failed after the brief surge above 63% in early October was thwarted by the market-wide crash on October 10. Since then, the dominance has remained below the 50 EMA and has now spent a full consecutive month below this critical level. What This Means For The Crypto Market Historically, the altcoin season has only begun when the Bitcoin dominance has seen a decline. This trend has held strong through the years, and even through the current cycle, has prevented the rise of another altcoin season.

It shows that the dominance will fall below 40% if it fails to reclaim the 50 EMA soon. Such a crash would give room for altcoins to actually run as the focus moves away from Bitcoin. With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at a low 31 at the time of this writing, it shows that a crash in the Bitcoin dominance is sorely needed for altcoins to rise again. However, the analyst explains that if the dominance does reclaim the 50 EMA, then Bitcoin’s lead may be extended for longer before attention rotates back to altcoin.

According to Accel’s latest 2025 Globalscape report, these regions have attracted 66% as much private funding as their American counterparts this year, signaling a dramatic transformation in the global AI landscape that could reshape how artificial intelligence integrates into everyday business applications. Why is the AI Application Layer Becoming Europe’s Strength? The AI application layer represents where artificial intelligence meets real-world business needs, and Europe is emerging as a formidable competitor. Philippe Botteri, partner at global VC firm Accel, reveals that Europe has evolved from being one-tenth the size of the U.S. market a decade ago to now capturing two-thirds of American private funding levels. This remarkable growth stems from what Botteri describes as an ecosystem of founders and investors who have mastered building exceptional software companies over the past ten years. How European AI Startups Are Achieving Unprecedented Growth European AI startups are demonstrating growth patterns that defy historical norms. A new generation of AI-native applications is reaching $100 million in annual recurring revenue within years rather than decades. Botteri emphasizes that these companies are growing faster than anything seen before while maintaining incredible efficiency levels. The revenue per employee metric for these AI application layer companies represents the highest ever recorded for software businesses, a trend occurring on both sides of the Atlantic. Venture Capital Funding Patterns in the AI Space The distribution of venture capital funding reveals strategic shifts in investor confidence. While European foundation model companies like Mistral AI face challenges in competing with American giants, the AI application layer presents abundant opportunities. Jonathan Userovici, Paris-based general partner at Headline, observes that across every vertical—from legal and healthcare to manufacturing and marketing—European founders combine world-class technical talent with deep market expertise. This combination has proven particularly attractive to venture capital investors seeking defensible business models. The Rise of AI-Native Applications Across Industries AI-native applications are transforming traditional business processes with unprecedented speed. Companies like Lovable and Synthesia have emerged as category leaders, demonstrating how specialized AI solutions can dominate specific market segments. These AI application layer companies benefit from what Lotan Levkowitz, managing partner at Grove Ventures, identifies as proprietary data and data flywheels—assets that create sustainable competitive advantages beyond mere technological innovation. Cloud Software Companies Adapting to the AI Revolution Traditional cloud software companies aren’t disappearing; they’re evolving. Accel’s Public Cloud Index shows 25% year-over-year growth as established players integrate agentic capabilities into their products. Some private companies, like Accel portfolio company Doctolib, are adopting AI so rapidly that they’re becoming effectively AI-native. This adaptation demonstrates how the AI application layer is expanding beyond pure startups to include transformed incumbents. FAQs: Understanding the AI Application Layer Competition Which European AI startups are leading the application layer? Companies like Lovable and Synthesia have emerged as category leaders in their respective domains. What is Accel’s role in AI investing? Accel is a global venture capital firm that publishes annual reports on AI and cloud market trends, providing valuable insights into investment patterns. How does Mistral AI fit into the European AI landscape? Mistral AI represents Europe’s ambition in foundation models, though the application layer shows stronger current growth potential according to Accel’s analysis. What perspective does Headline bring to European AI? Headline , through partners like Jonathan Userovici, emphasizes the combination of technical talent and market expertise in European AI startups. How is Grove Ventures approaching AI investments? Grove Ventures , led by Lotan Levkowitz, focuses on companies with proprietary data advantages in the AI application layer. The global race for AI supremacy is far from decided, but the battlefield is shifting. While American companies dominate foundation model development, Europe and Israel are carving out significant territory in the AI application layer where specialized solutions meet specific market needs. This diversification strengthens the global AI ecosystem, creating more robust and varied opportunities for innovation, investment, and technological advancement that will benefit businesses and consumers worldwide.

Key Takeaways: Bitwise’s spot Chainlink ETF has appeared on the DTCC registry under ticker CLNK, signaling it may be nearing launch. The ETF aims to track Chainlink (LINK), with Bitwise awaiting SEC approval and completion of its Form 8-A filing. The listing comes amid a broader wave of delayed crypto ETFs. The ETF, listed under the ticker CLNK , was added on Tuesday to the DTCC’s “active” and “pre-launch” categories. While the move doesn’t guarantee approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it has historically indicated that a product is close to being cleared for trading. DTCC: Wall Street’s Backbone for Clearing and Settlement The DTCC serves as one of Wall Street’s core post-trade infrastructure platforms, handling the clearing, settlement, and recording of financial transactions to ensure efficient and secure processing for assets, including stocks and ETFs. Bitwise, one of the largest crypto asset managers in the US, has yet to file its Form 8-A, a key requirement before an ETF can officially list on an exchange. The firm initially filed its Form S-1 in August, outlining its plan for an ETF designed to track Chainlink (LINK), the native token powering Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network, which delivers real-world data to smart contracts on-chain. Grayscale is also pursuing a spot Chainlink ETF, though analysts say it could face tougher scrutiny as it aims to incorporate staking, an area still viewed cautiously by US regulators. The listing comes amid a broader wave of spot crypto ETF applications, many of which have been delayed due to the ongoing US government shutdown, now in its 42nd day. LATEST: Bitwise Chainlink ETF advances with DTCC listing approval. $LINK pic.twitter.com/AW4u9flSrf — Nathan Jeffay (@NathanOnCrypto) November 11, 2025 The SEC has been operating at reduced capacity during the shutdown, though lawmakers are expected to approve a funding deal to restore full operations soon. Industry watchers believe a resolution could accelerate ETF approvals, particularly under the SEC’s new generic listing standards introduced in mid-September. These rules allow certain crypto investment products to be approved without requiring case-by-case reviews, potentially streamlining future listings for altcoin-focused ETFs such as Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Hedera (HBAR). If cleared, Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF would become one of the first US spot ETFs offering exposure to a decentralized oracle network, marking another step in the growing institutionalization of altcoin investments. Crypto Funds See Outflows Amid Renewed Market Volatility As reported, institutional outflows from crypto investment products accelerated last week , reaching $1.17 billion, the second consecutive week of heavy withdrawals amid renewed market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Data shows trading volumes in ETPs remained high at $43 billion, but optimism from midweek progress on resolving the U.S. government shutdown quickly faded, sparking further redemptions by Friday. The US market drove most of the outflows, totaling $1.22 billion, while Germany and Switzerland saw modest inflows of $41.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively. Bitcoin funds led the losses with $932 million in outflows, followed by Ethereum at $438 million, though short Bitcoin ETPs logged $11.8 million in inflows, their strongest week since May 2025. Despite the bearish trend, select altcoins showed resilience. Solana led with $118 million in inflows, bringing its nine-week total to $2.1 billion.

The government wants to plug holes in its rules that stop money from leaving the country without permission. Six tax offices in big cities like Beijing and Shenzhen put out nearly identical statements on Tuesday. They said they had “reminded and coached” some people to report their foreign earnings and pay any back taxes. Officials used computer data analysis to track these individuals down. The government isn’t letting up on hunting taxes linked to trading done outside the country and stopping people from dodging money transfer restrictions. This push comes as officials look for new ways to bring in cash and shrink a massive budget shortfall. Money from selling land has dried up, and Beijing has tightened how much local governments can borrow. The authorities called out some specific cases. Someone named Fu in Xiamen city in the southeast had to pay almost 7 million yuan, which equals $983,500, in back taxes plus penalties. Another person with the last name Li in Sichuan province paid nearly 6.7 million yuan. This isn’t new. Government records show local authorities ran a similar push in late March as per Bloomberg. Global data sharing enables enforcement The tax push follows rules put in place in 2018 called the Common Reporting Standard. This worldwide system shares financial information to catch people dodging taxes. Chinese laws have always said citizens must pay taxes on all their income from anywhere in the world, including profits from investments. But this rule was barely enforced until last year. Through the Common Reporting Standard, China has been swapping account information automatically with almost 150 countries and territories. This exchange covers accounts owned by people who owe taxes in each member country. It’s been happening for several years now. Record capital flight to Hong Kong Money leaving China hit a record in July. Mainland investors bought Hong Kong assets hard after the government relaxed some market rules. Banks in China sent a net $58.3 billion overseas last month for their customers who wanted to invest in securities, according to numbers by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange released in August. That’s the biggest monthly outflow since the government started keeping these records in 2010. As Chinese companies put more money overseas , authorities face growing pressure to fill revenue gaps while stopping capital flight that could shake up the financial system.

The platform will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for these assets to support an upcoming network hard fork. This proactive measure ensures the safety of user funds during this significant blockchain upgrade. What Does the Upbit Hard Fork Mean for Users? The suspension begins at 11:00 a.m. UTC on the 19th and affects both HIVE and HBD tokens. During this period, users cannot deposit or withdraw these assets from their Upbit accounts. However, trading activities for these tokens will continue as normal on the exchange’s internal order books. This temporary suspension is a standard security practice that exchanges implement during network upgrades. The Upbit hard fork preparation demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to protecting user assets and ensuring a smooth transition to the updated blockchain network. Why Are Exchanges Like Upbit Suspending Services During Hard Forks? Hard forks represent major changes to a blockchain’s protocol. When networks undergo these upgrades, exchanges must take precautions to prevent potential issues such as: Transaction conflicts during the transition period Potential chain splits that could affect fund security Network instability that might lead to lost transactions Compatibility issues between old and new network versions The Upbit hard fork suspension follows industry best practices for handling significant network changes. By temporarily pausing deposits and withdrawals, the exchange minimizes risks and ensures all user funds remain secure throughout the upgrade process. What Should HIVE and HBD Holders Do During This Period? If you hold HIVE or HBD on Upbit, here are the key points to remember: Deposits and withdrawals will be unavailable starting at the specified time Trading between cryptocurrency pairs remains active on the platform No action is required from users holding these assets on Upbit Funds are completely safe during the suspension period The exchange will monitor the network upgrade closely and resume services once the hard fork completes successfully and network stability confirms. Users should watch for official announcements from Upbit regarding the exact resumption timing. How Long Will the Upbit Hard Fork Suspension Last? While Upbit hasn’t specified an exact end time for the suspension, similar network upgrades typically take several hours to complete. The exchange will restore deposit and withdrawal services once they confirm the new network version operates stably and securely. This temporary inconvenience ultimately benefits the entire Hive ecosystem. The network upgrade likely introduces improvements that enhance functionality, security, or performance. The Upbit hard fork handling demonstrates the exchange’s responsible approach to managing user assets during critical network events. Conclusion: Navigating Blockchain Upgrades Safely The temporary suspension of HIVE and HBD services on Upbit represents a necessary precaution during an important network evolution. While briefly inconvenient for users, these measures ensure fund security and smooth network transition. The exchange’s transparent communication about the Upbit hard fork procedures helps users understand and prepare for the temporary service interruption. Frequently Asked Questions What is a hard fork? A hard fork is a permanent divergence in a blockchain network that creates two separate versions. It requires all network participants to upgrade to the new protocol version. Can I still trade HIVE and HBD on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, trading between cryptocurrency pairs will continue normally. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. Are my funds safe during the hard fork? Absolutely. The suspension is a security measure to protect user funds during the network transition. Your assets remain secure in Upbit’s custody. When will services resume? Upbit will restore services once the hard fork completes and network stability confirms. Monitor official announcements for specific timing. Do I need to move my funds before the suspension? No action is required. The suspension affects deposits and withdrawals, but existing balances remain unaffected and secure. Will this affect HIVE and HBD prices? While temporary service suspensions can create short-term market reactions, network upgrades typically aim to improve the blockchain’s long-term value and functionality. Found this update helpful?

Arthur Hayes: ZEC Holders Should Withdraw Their Assets from Exchanges Hayes stated on social media that users holding Zcash (ZEC) assets on centralized exchanges (CEX) should withdraw these assets to their own wallets as soon as possible for the security and privacy of their funds. Hayes also emphasized the importance of users enabling ZEC's “shield” feature. This feature obscures transactions, protecting the identities of both senders and recipients, thus reinforcing Zcash's core purpose of a privacy-focused financial transaction model. According to experts, holding assets on centralized exchanges can pose additional risks to users due to reasons such as cyberattacks, regulatory risks or exchange bankruptcy. Hayes' warning comes at a time of increasing regulatory pressure, particularly in the crypto market, and intensified regulatory scrutiny of privacy-focused projects. Arthur Hayes is known in the crypto community for his pronouncements advocating for decentralization and user control. His latest call is seen as a step toward emphasizing the need for privacy-focused assets like Zcash to be protected in accordance with his philosophy. *This is not investment advice.

As highlighted by analyst X Finance Bull, the transfer unfolds amid growing excitement over potential XRP Spot ETFs, government market reopenings, and the global shift toward ISO 20022 standards, a convergence poised to redefine institutional finance and cross-border payments. While whale transfers are routine in crypto, the sheer scale and timing of this $56M XRP exodus have reignited market intrigue. X Finance Bull suggests it may signal the quiet entry of major institutions, or even government entities, positioning for large-scale XRP integration. Therefore, this move mirrors a growing trend of silent accumulation among deep-pocketed investors, reinforcing XRP’s rising influence in the global digital payments ecosystem. Notably, blockchain data reveals the $56M XRP transfer went to a new, non-exchange wallet, indicating a cold storage move typical of long-term holding. This mirrors prior institutional accumulation patterns, where strategic players quietly amass positions ahead of major market catalysts. On the other hand, ISO 20022, the global standard for secure and efficient financial messaging, is set to drive the next wave of cross-border settlement. XRP, fully ISO 20022-compatible, is uniquely positioned as a bridge asset for institutions and central banks pursuing seamless digital interoperability. Rising speculation over XRP Spot ETFs is also fueling market optimism. Following Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals, investors see XRP’s institutional debut as inevitable, potentially unlocking massive liquidity and making early accumulation strategically advantageous. Adding to the intrigue, global financial institutions are reportedly ramping up blockchain integrations and liquidity testing ahead of 2026, a key milestone for ISO 20022’s full implementation. XRP’s consistent inclusion in institutional pilots and partnerships reinforces its utility as more than just a speculative asset; it’s becoming a cornerstone of digital finance infrastructure. If the $56 million transfer indeed represents early accumulation by a major institution or government body, it would mark one of the strongest signals yet of growing confidence in XRP’s long-term role in global settlements. Conclusion The $56M XRP transfer from Bitget signals growing institutional interest, hinting at strategic accumulation ahead of key market catalysts. Positioned amid Spot ETF anticipation, government financial reopenings, and ISO 20022 adoption, XRP is emerging as a vital bridge for global payments and institutional finance, making it a cryptocurrency investors cannot ignore.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-12 07:52:02

(JPM) has officially begun rolling out a new deposit-token product, branded as JPM Coin (or JPMD), aimed at its institutional clientele. These tokens operate on the Base blockchain, which is linked to Coinbase, and represent dollar deposits at JPMorgan. The bank has tested JPM Coin on leading firms and plans to add other currencies once regulators approve. Unlike many so‑called stablecoins, JPM Coin is structured as a “deposit token”, meaning it is a digital claim on actual bank deposits at JPMorgan rather than a separately issued asset backed by reserves JPMorgan speeds up transactions using JPM Coin Normal bank payments only work during business hours and can take one or more days to go through, but users can now transact with JPM Coin at any time of the day within seconds. Before allowing more people to use JPM Coin, the bank tested it with major companies, including Mastercard , Coinbase, and B2C2, to assess how well the token performs in real-world business operations. JPMorgan also used the trial to identify and fix any bugs and plan how to use the token with other payment networks. The banking institution aims for JPM Coin to reach a broader range of businesses over time. JPMorgan will also create other versions of the coin in different currencies, such as the Euro, which will be called JPME. This way, companies around the world will be able to send and receive money in seconds, while still adhering to the rules set by banks and regulators. JPMorgan also runs Kinexys Digital Payments, and JPM Coin is a part of it. The network already processes over $3 billion every day and accommodates transactions in dollars, euros, and pounds. JPMorgan is a great example of how banks can utilize new technology to facilitate faster payments and provide companies with more options for transactions without incurring high fees. Deposit tokens create new opportunities for banks and clients Deposit tokens are safe and reliable for businesses because they represent existing deposits in banks, and each token is backed by real money held in a corresponding account. Companies don’t have to worry about the token losing value, so they can safely use it for large transactions, international payments, or fast settlements between businesses. Deposit tokens also earn interest for the companies that hold them. Unlike stablecoins, which are usually linked to cash but don’t pay any interest, holders of deposit tokens earn small returns. They can still use them for payments, transfers, or other financial operations. For example, Coinbase will accept JPM Coin as collateral on the platform, so businesses use it for trading and lending. Other banks, such as Bank of New York Mellon and HSBC , are also offering deposit tokens to provide businesses with a reliable and quicker way to move money while still complying with the rules. Furthermore, governments and regulators are working on clearer rules for digital money, making now the ideal time for institutions to launch their deposit tokens. Laws like the Genius Act in the United States make these digital tokens safe, legal, and transparent enough for businesses to use in their financial operations. Deposit tokens have the potential to become a standard tool that banks and other institutions use to combine digital assets with the safety of traditional financial services. The tokens are available 24/7, have lower transaction fees, and can earn interest on funds that companies hold digitally. JPMorgan appears to be committed to expanding its presence in the digital asset market through the use of the JPM Coin. The bank will be able to reach more clients, increase the coin’s adoption rates among institutions, and serve as a strong example of how blockchain can work seamlessly with traditional finance to produce better financial tools for everyone.

In this regard, insights by OpenAI’s ChatGPT point to the possibility of the asset plunging to that level in the coming months. ChatGPT noted that Bitcoin’s momentum is fading after failing to hold above $110,000, with the RSI cooling to neutral and the price hovering just above its 200-day moving average ( MA ) near $87,000, a sign the trend is losing steam. On the macro side, the AI highlighted the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on rate cuts and tightening liquidity as potential drags on risk assets, while rising exchange inflows suggest growing sell pressure from investors. According to ChatGPT, a drop to $50,000 would likely stem from a combination of tightening liquidity, ETF outflows, institutional profit-taking, and a break below key supports at $87,000 and $80,0000 a setup that could trigger panic selling similar to 2018 and 2022. If these risks align, the AI model sees the April–August 2026 window as the most probable time for such a crash, consistent with Bitcoin’s historical pattern of peaking 12–18 months after a halving. From a projected top near $130,000 to $150,000, a typical 60% to 70% correction would bring prices near $50,000. However, ChatGPT cautioned that if macro conditions remain stable, Bitcoin could instead see a milder pullback to the $70,000 and $80,000 range before resuming its next uptrend. Bitcoin’s technical outlook At the same time, the possibility of Bitcoin crashing to $50,000 is also supported by technical indicators. In this context, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez suggested in an X post on November 11 that Bitcoin’s next major market bottom could occur in roughly 328 days, placing the timeline around October 2026. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to his outlook, Bitcoin appears to be following a cyclical pattern similar to previous market cycles, where peaks are followed by prolonged drawdowns lasting over a year before recovery begins. The projected bottom range of $38,000 to $50,000 aligns with historical retracement levels seen after previous bull runs. The analysis implies that Bitcoin may continue to face gradual downside pressure as the current cycle matures, potentially marking the end of its post-halving rally phase. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $103,411, having dropped about 1.4% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, BTC has gained 1.3%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin’s price now sits below both the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $112,216 and the 200-day SMA at $105,751, confirming a bearish short- to medium-term trend. The 50-day SMA acting as overhead resistance reinforces downward pressure, while the minor cushion above the 200-day SMA keeps the long-term uptrend technically alive but fragile. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 47.76 (neutral) shows no momentum extremes, neither oversold enough for a strong bounce nor overbought to justify further selling.

Consequently, we asked ChatGPT and Perplexity whether this will turn out to be as bullish as many expected, or if it will turn out to be a classic ‘sell-the-news’ event. What Comes First? Since November started, XRP’s price has experienced quite the volatile rollercoaster. It plunged below $2.10 during the November 5 crash, and spiked to almost $2.60 just a few days later. It has since lost some traction and now struggles to remain above $2.40. What’s particularly interesting is that the rally from $2.10 to $2.60 occurred despite Ripple whales selling en masse. However, Perplexity outlined that if this trend continues, the pressure on XRP’s price is likely to intensify. “Recent on-chain analysis shows significant whale selling and large amounts of XRP being moved to exchanges over the past weeks, indicating a distribution phase. Such selling pressure from smart money often leads to subdued or even pullback price action in the short term as whales capitalize on retail optimism.” The AI solution added that the current $2.40 level appears as the calm before the storm, as it reflects the tension between the buildup for an ETF catalyst and active selling. It outlined historical performances by ETH and BTC after their ETF launches. It warned that XRP could experience a similar “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news” behavior, where the price rallies leading up to the event only to undergo a moderate pullback immediately after, as traders take profits. ChatGPT’s output was similar. It believes the most likely short-term scenario for XRP’s price would be an immediate spike to around $3.00 after launch , followed by a sharp rejection and pullback to somewhere between $2.00 and $2.20. But What About the Long-Run? Although both AI solutions predicted short-term pain for XRP, they believe the existence of spot Ripple ETFs is fundamentally bullish for the asset’s long-term performance. “The longer-term outlook remains bullish due to the expected institutional inflows and improved market confidence from a regulated XRP investment vehicle. This suggests that after any typical sell-the-news dip, the price could stabilize and resume upward momentum over the subsequent weeks to months,” said Perplexity. ChatGPT was a bit more precise in its predictions, stating that the underlying asset’s price can establish a solid base at around $2.40 for the next few weeks after the dust of the launch settles. Moreover, it could go beyond $3.20 but only under the right circumstances. It explained that the “real trend” will be felt after 1-3 months have passed, and the direction will be determined by the actual ETF flows: “ Sustained inflows → gradual recovery and new highs. Weak inflows → range or prolonged correction.” The post Tomorrow’s XRP ETF Debut: Immediate Rally or Rug? 2 AIs Issue Big Price Warnings appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) ETF|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-12 07:56:11

The goal is to let customers of the two banks send and receive deposit tokens around the clock, and to make those tokens usable on both permissioned ledgers and public blockchains like Base. The effort aims to make tokens issued by one bank redeemable through the other bank’s service. JPMorgan-DBS Team-Up: Interbank Token Flow Becomes A Practical Test According to an announcement, the project will link DBS Token Services with Kinexys Digital Payments so institutional clients can transfer tokenized deposits and settle in real time. For example, a JPMorgan institutional client might pay a DBS client using JPMorgan Deposit Tokens (JPMD) on the Base public blockchain , and the recipient could then redeem or exchange that token through DBS. Both banks already offer 24/7 liquidity and instant settlement inside their own networks. This work is meant to let those benefits cross bank boundaries. What The Banks Say About Risks And Reach Rachel Chew, Group Chief Operating Officer and Head of Digital Currencies at DBS Bank, said the move is meant to reduce fragmentation and expand the usefulness of tokenised money for businesses. Naveen Mallela, Global Co-Head of Kinexys, said the banks are building infrastructure so institutional clients can use tokenised deposits while keeping legal and safety checks in place. Based on reports , the banks plan to combine technical and legal steps to make transfers dependable. Technical Hurdles And Legal Questions Moving money between different blockchains needs to be done carefully, analysts said. The transfer has to be final, and ownership has to be clear. Identity checks and rules also have to be followed when using public networks. DBS and Kinexys are building the system so that sending tokens between banks is safe, simple, and follows the rules. Pilot First, Broad Rollout Later Work like this usually begins with pilots on a small set of networks and narrow use cases, then scales if the tests go well. Reports note that this kind of cross-issuer approach by JPMorgan and DBS could cut the need for private stablecoins in some institutional flows. But banks will likely use controlled gateways and clear legal agreements rather than fully trustless bridges, since they must protect depositors and follow rules. They’re Paying Attention A 2024 survey by the Bank for International Settlements found that banks in almost one third of the countries surveyed have started, tested, or studied tokenized deposits. This shows that both regulators and banks are already paying attention. Once DBS and Kinexys get their system running, other banks might follow with similar projects, which could change how and where companies move money across borders.

Canary Capital, a digital asset management firm, is on the verge of launching its long-awaited product, which analysts believe could begin trading as early as Thursday . Regulatory Progress Points to Imminent Launch The prospect of a near-term launch gained credibility after Canary Capital filed its Form 8-A with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing allows the fund’s shares to be listed and traded on a registered securities exchange. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas indicated that, based on the sequence of recent filings, the fund could go live this week, possibly even ahead of Thursday if final approvals are completed. Adding to the momentum, Canary Capital recently withdrew a “delaying amendment” from its S-1 registration statement, effectively allowing the filing to take effect automatically without further administrative delay. This procedural step is a strong signal that the company is finalizing preparations to bring the product to market. Canary filed 8A for XRP ETF last night, which points to launch tomorrow or Thursday (today is holiday). Thursday was the day we thought they'd be on track for but when they did the 8A for HBAR they launched the next day. Not done deal but all boxes being checked. Stay tuned.. pic.twitter.com/gVt9c3psmu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 11, 2025 Background on the Filing Process Canary first submitted its application for a spot XRP ETF in October 2024, placing it among the earliest issuers seeking to create a regulated investment vehicle backed by XRP. The filing was made through the Cboe BZX Exchange, which has since received formal acknowledgment from the SEC. The process, however, has been marked by several delays from the commission. These developments come at a time when the digital asset industry is witnessing renewed optimism around exchange-traded funds linked to cryptocurrencies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While Bitcoin and Ethereum have already paved the way for other spot ETF products, the arrival of an XRP-focused equivalent would represent another milestone for the sector. Expanding ETF Competition Canary Capital is not alone in pursuing an XRP ETF. Major traditional finance players have shown increasing interest in similar offerings. Franklin Templeton, a global investment firm managing over $1.5 trillion in assets, is reportedly preparing its own product. The DTCC recently listed Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF , and the interest from these major institutions shows a broader institutional recognition of XRP’s role within digital finance. While XRP currently trades around $2.40 with no definite sign of an upcoming rally, the launch of spot XRP ETFs could trigger a new wave of investment, sending the digital asset to new heights.

The partnership gives Google a stronger base in one of the world’s fastest-growing tech markets and helps Turkey push its ambition to become a digital power in the region. The announcement came after Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS filed details of the agreement, confirming that both companies will work together to create a Google Cloud region made up of three large network clusters. Each cluster will hold thousands of servers that will support cloud, storage, streaming, and AI services across Turkey and neighboring countries. Everything to know about Turkcell’s billion-dollar cloud plan Ali Taha Koc, the Chief Executive of Turkcell, said the partnership will “make Turkcell a cloud center globally,” as the new hyperscale facility will transform how data is processed and stored inside the country. The company expects to spend $1 billion through 2032 to support the project, with its data center capacity set to more than double over that time. Turkcell also forecasts a sixfold increase in its cloud and data center revenue in U.S. dollar terms by the end of 2032, saying that it plans to act as both the infrastructure provider and reseller of Google Cloud services. The Google-Turkcell deal is part of Turkey’s wider goal to become a regional hub for digital services and artificial intelligence, as cloud demand grows around 20% every year, with the total market value is expected to reach $4.2 billion by 2029, thanks the rise of AI models , automation, and even crypto-linked cloud activity. While Google deepens its ties in Turkey, the company faces legal heat at home. A lawsuit filed in San Jose, California, accuses the tech company of using its Gemini AI assistant to secretly track private communications from users of Gmail, Chat, and Meet. The complaint claims that Google turned on Gemini across these apps in October without permission, allowing it to “access and exploit” every message and attachment sent or received. The case, which invokes the California Invasion of Privacy Act of 1967, argues that the company’s AI feature violates privacy laws by collecting data without consent. Although users can disable Gemini , they must dig deep into privacy settings to do so, raising concerns over user transparency. Even with the lawsuit ongoing, Google is expanding its physical presence across Europe, having recently announced a €5.5 billion ($6.4 billion) investment in Germany to strengthen its computing and data operations over the next four years. The plan includes two data centers in the Frankfurt region, though the company didn’t reveal the size of the facilities. The European Commission has encouraged companies to build “gigafactories” (massive data hubs capable of training complex AI models) to ensure Europe isn’t left behind in the global AI race. Other major tech players are following the same path. Nvidia and Deutsche Telekom are developing a €1 billion data center in Munich set to open in 2026, while Microsoft pledged $10 billion for a new data center hub in Portugal.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase launched its first international platform, Coinbase Business, in Singapore. The platform offers startups and SMBs instant USDC payments, global transfers, and integrated crypto management tools. The rollout builds on Coinbase’s collaboration with Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) under the BLOOM Initiative. The move allows Singaporean startups and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) to access instant USDC payments, global payouts, integrated trading tools, and automated accounting. Coinbase Expands Overseas with Singapore Launch Singapore, a key fintech hub and one of Asia’s most crypto-forward economies, is the first country to host the platform’s international debut. Coinbase said the launch builds on its recent collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) under the BLOOM Initiative, which aims to promote borderless and compliant digital payments. The new business suite offers a full financial operating stack for companies integrating crypto into daily operations. Core features include USDC-based global payments, an API for automated payroll and vendor management, and a 1% transaction fee for cross-border payments, a fraction of traditional credit card processing costs. Businesses can also earn yield on USDC balances and reconcile their books through QuickBooks and Xero integration. Coinbase Business allows firms to securely buy, sell, and manage digital assets directly from their operating account. Coinbase Business has officially landed in Singapore! We're thrilled to launch the first international expansion of our all-in-one financial platform right here in Asia’s digital hub. More details ↓ pic.twitter.com/reIvCMRmOM — Coinbase Singapore (@CoinbaseSG) November 12, 2025 The company says this provides Singapore’s rapidly growing startup scene with “a command center where money moves as fast as ambition.” The launch is backed by a partnership with Standard Chartered Bank, enabling seamless real-time SGD transfers for both retail and business users. Coinbase said this banking link ensures fiat-crypto integration under Singapore’s strict regulatory standards. “This expansion underscores our commitment to supporting the region’s innovation economy,” Coinbase said in its announcement. “We’re empowering Singaporean businesses with faster, cheaper, and programmable financial tools for the next era of global trade.” Coinbase’s Singapore launch comes amid rising institutional adoption of stablecoins like USDC and growing regulatory clarity across Asia. The company’s participation in MAS’s Agentic Payments workstream signals deeper involvement in shaping compliant digital asset infrastructure across the region. Early access for Singaporean firms is now open. Coinbase Says Stablecoins Strengthen US Banking System Last month, Coinbase rejected claims that the growth of stablecoins could drain deposits from US banks, arguing instead that they reinforce the dollar’s global dominance. Shirzad said most stablecoin demand comes from international users seeking dollar exposure, not from U.S. savers. The firm added that about two-thirds of stablecoin activity occurs on DeFi platforms, separate from traditional banking, and compared the current fears to those raised during past financial innovations like money market funds. Meanwhile, the Bank of England (BOE) is also preparing to release its long-awaited regulatory framework for stablecoins, aiming to match the pace of US developments in digital asset oversight. Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden dismissed suggestions that the UK is trailing behind the US, telling Bloomberg that the new regime would become operational “just as quickly as the US.” The BOE will publish its formal consultation on stablecoin regulation on November 10.

54303211,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=858605,1762939311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54303211.jpeg,"MUFG, OpenAI to launch AI-powered digital bank in Japan next year",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mufg-openai-to-launch-ai-digital-bank-japan/,"MUFG, Japan’s biggest banking group, said on Thursday it is teaming up with OpenAI to launch an AI‑powered digital bank next fiscal year, according to information shared by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. in Tokyo. The partnership will use AI to automate account openings, customer chats, and everyday money management through smartphone apps connected to ChatGPT. The plan is to make banking more direct, cutting out manual processes that slow things down for users in Japan’s still heavily paper‑based financial markets. The new digital bank will allow people to consult with ChatGPT about savings, asset management, and household spending instead of calling a branch or waiting in long lines, MUFG said this collaboration is part of its wider strategy to embed AI into everything from customer service to internal workflows. MUFG expands AI hiring as Japan’s banks face tech overhaul Tadashi Yamamoto, who leads the retail and digital business group at MUFG, said the company plans to grow its team of AI specialists to more than 350 employees by the end of March 2027. To reach that goal, the bank will recruit mid‑career professionals with technical backgrounds. The company said this hiring push is a long‑term investment in building systems that can keep up with the speed of innovation in AI. Banks across the world are facing the same challenge; how to use AI without losing the human touch or triggering mass layoffs. In Japan , where the financial industry employs hundreds of thousands of people, the debate over automation has become especially heated. Executives from the country’s top banks are trying to reassure workers that AI won’t erase their jobs overnight. At a Nikkei‑hosted event in Tokyo, Masahiro Kihara, CEO of Mizuho Financial Group, said people shouldn’t assume AI will replace them. “Humans have ability for dialogue, empathy, creativity and ethics,” Masahiro said, adding that workers can focus on “more value‑added work” as machines take on repetitive tasks. Akihiko Ogino, CEO of Daiwa Securities Group, told the same audience that his managers have been instructed to use AI “as much as possible.” Akihiko said collaboration between humans and machines is the fastest way to improve decision‑making and productivity. Kentaro Okuda, CEO of Nomura Holdings, said, “Let AI do what AI can do and humans do value‑added work,” arguing that Japan’s aging population makes that balance essential. Kamezawa says AI will redefine MUFG’s identity Hironori Kamezawa, CEO of MUFG, said AI is no longer just a tool, it is becoming a business partner. “We need to change ourselves to an AI native company,” Hironori said, describing how the bank is re‑wiring its systems around machine learning. In the firm’s latest annual report, he wrote that the age of AI demands humans who can think deeply and act with intention. Earlier this year, MUFG Bank , the main unit of the group, hired Tokyo‑based startup Sakana AI to boost the bank’s use of artificial intelligence.

South Korea’s leading exchange Bithumb has announced a temporary Bithumb HIVE suspension that affects all deposit and withdrawal operations. This crucial maintenance window begins at 9:00 a.m. UTC on November 19th, directly supporting the Hive network’s significant upgrade. Why is Bithumb Implementing This HIVE Suspension? The Bithumb HIVE suspension represents a proactive measure to ensure seamless integration with the Hive network’s latest improvements. Network upgrades typically introduce enhanced features, improved security protocols, or optimized transaction processes. Therefore, exchanges must temporarily pause services to implement these changes safely. This temporary Bithumb HIVE suspension follows industry best practices for handling blockchain upgrades. Major exchanges routinely implement such measures to protect user assets during technical transitions. The scheduled timing allows for thorough testing and verification before reactivating services. What Should HIVE Traders Do During This Period? While the Bithumb HIVE suspension affects deposit and withdrawal functionality, trading of HIVE tokens typically continues uninterrupted on the exchange’s internal order books. However, traders should confirm this with Bithumb’s official announcements. Complete pending transactions before the November 19th deadline Monitor official channels for service restoration updates Plan trading activities around the maintenance window Verify wallet compatibility with the upgraded network How Long Will This Bithumb HIVE Suspension Last? Exchange maintenance periods vary depending on the complexity of network upgrades. While Bithumb hasn’t specified an exact completion time, similar upgrades typically require several hours to a full day. The exchange will likely provide updates through their official communication channels once services resume. Historically, Bithumb has demonstrated reliability in managing such technical transitions. Their systematic approach to the Bithumb HIVE suspension minimizes potential disruptions while prioritizing asset security throughout the process. What Benefits Does This Network Upgrade Bring? The Hive network upgrade driving this Bithumb HIVE suspension potentially introduces valuable improvements. Network enhancements often include: Faster transaction processing times Reduced network congestion Enhanced security features New functionality for developers Improved scalability for future growth These upgrades ultimately benefit the entire Hive ecosystem, making the temporary Bithumb HIVE suspension a worthwhile investment in network infrastructure. Essential Takeaways from the Bithumb HIVE Suspension The scheduled Bithumb HIVE suspension demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to operational excellence and user protection. While temporary service interruptions can cause minor inconvenience, they represent necessary steps toward improved network performance and security. Traders should view this Bithumb HIVE suspension as routine maintenance rather than cause for concern. The proactive communication and scheduled timing allow adequate preparation, minimizing potential trading disruptions during the upgrade process. Frequently Asked Questions Will I lose my HIVE tokens during the suspension? No, your HIVE tokens remain secure in your Bithumb account throughout the suspension period. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily disabled. Can I still trade HIVE on Bithumb during this time? Typically yes, trading between HIVE and other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb’s internal order books continues normally during such maintenance periods. How will I know when services resume? Bithumb will announce service restoration through their official website, mobile app notifications, and social media channels. Should I move my HIVE to another exchange before the suspension? This depends on your trading needs. If you require HIVE transfers during the maintenance window, consider moving tokens beforehand. Otherwise, leaving them on Bithumb is perfectly safe. What happens if I send HIVE to Bithumb during the suspension? Transactions sent during the suspension period may be delayed or returned. Always verify deposit status before sending assets during maintenance windows. Will this affect HIVE’s price? Temporary exchange suspensions rarely cause significant price movements unless combined with other market factors. The upgrade could positively impact long-term value. Found this information crucial?

QCDT is a regulated, yield-bearing token co-launched by Qatar National Bank, DMZ Finance, and Standard Chartered, offering institutional-grade exposure to on-chain finance. Positioned alongside leading global tokenized money market funds such as BUIDL and BENJI — collectively referred to as the “BBQ”. QCDT bridges traditional finance and decentralized markets. By combining DMZ Finance’s tokenization expertise, Bybit’s global exchange infrastructure, and Mantle’s scalable blockchain architecture, QCDT brings real-world yield on-chain in a compliant and capital-efficient manner. Unlocking Institutional-Grade Yield and Mirror Collateral Onchain At launch, Bybit has become the first global exchange to accept QCDT as collateral, enabling qualified institutions to deploy tokenized MMF units as margin collateral backed by U.S. Treasuries. The integration provides up to USD 1 billion in borrowing capacity, unlocking new opportunities for both traditional financial institutions and established trading firms to participate in onchain yield strategies within a regulated framework. “Tokenized money market funds like QCDT represent a foundational bridge between traditional finance and DeFi,” said by Belle, Head of BD at Mantle. “By leveraging Mantle’s modular infrastructure, we are enabling compliant, high-value assets to move onchain, setting the stage for scalable institutional adoption.” Building the Bridge Between TradFi and DeFi Powered by DMZ Finance, QCDT combines the security of regulated financial products with the efficiency of blockchain settlement. The collaboration with Bybit unlocks seamless integration between traditional capital and onchain liquidity — a major milestone in advancing tokenized finance. “At DMZ Finance, our mission is to make real-world assets accessible in digital form,” said [Nathan Ma, Co-founder and Chairman of DMZ Finance]. “Working with Mantle and Bybit demonstrates how tokenization can bring innovation to institutional markets while bridging liquidity and access for more TradF and Web3 investors.” Advancing Mantle’s Vision for Institutional RWAs For Mantle, the deployment of QCDT marks another milestone in its Real-World Asset (RWA) strategy — positioning the network as the institution-ready Layer-2 for compliant, high-value financial instruments. By bringing regulated yield-bearing assets onchain, Mantle strengthens its role as the liquidity and distribution layer for tokenized assets — paving the way for principal-protected yield instruments, compliant liquidity rails, and institutional-grade capital markets built on blockchain. About Mantle Mantle positions itself as the premier distribution layer and gateway for institutions and TradFi to connect with onchain liquidity and access real-world assets, powering how real-world finance flows. With over $4B+ in community-owned assets, Mantle combines credibility, liquidity and scalability with institutional-grade infrastructure to support large-scale adoption. The ecosystem is anchored by $MNT within Bybit, and built out through core ecosystem projects like mETH, fBTC, MI4 and more.

While speaking at the Singapore FinTech Festival, the Fed governor highlighted that the adoption of AI algorithms could augment existing roles and tasks, while also causing radical changes in leisure and work to boost efficiency. He also highlighted that it is still early to predict the outcomes of AI infiltration in economies, noting that two scenarios could play out randomly, with the possibility of more intermediate scenarios emerging. Barr cited a New York Fed survey that showed AI technology caused employers to scale down their hiring plans. The governor suggested that a connection may exist between the employment scale-down and the existing slow job creation. Barr says AI reforms could change monetary policies Fed officials have consecutively cut their benchmark interest rates in the last two policy meetings after a sharp decline in hiring over the summer. Although the governor did not hint at near-term changes in monetary policy, recent public comments reveal that policymakers are divided over a third possible reduction in December. The governor also highlighted that planned capital investments worth trillions of dollars channelled into data centers could bring significant changes to economies, including productivity gains. He explained that a massive wave of data center investment has begun and could result in the sector drawing $3 trillion for data center infrastructure development. Large companies and major corporations have begun investing in data centers. Cryptopolitan previously reported that Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google recently invested $6.4 billion into Germany’s cloud infrastructure for data center expansions. The tech company did not give the details of the investment despite the magnitude of the project. Barr stated that the influx of capital into data centers will impact the economy by raising labor productivity and offering higher output growth without putting excessive pressure on inflation in the long run. The official explained that on a sufficiently large scale, these changes could have a significant impact on monetary policies. He cautioned that a risk of losses and adjustments in the AI sector exists if the investment exceeds short-term demand. Cryptopolitan recently reported that investors on Wall Street are sounding alarms over Silicon Valley’s aggressive spending and investments in artificial intelligence. Barr also pointed out that AI is quickly infiltrating the financial sector and that the outcome is more beneficial if risks are mitigated carefully. According to the Fed governor, adoption of AI algorithms in the financial sector seems to be “most concentrated in areas that can enhance operational efficiency, including applications that involve text analysis, classification, and information search inside the firm, as well as customer-facing functions.” Governor Barr believes central banks should leverage AI technology He noted that AI’s constant advancements and improvements to help common businesses function are essential aspects that drive hope about the technology raising labor productivity. Barr advised that central banks worldwide need to keep up with AI by increasing their speed of adoption for the institutions’ operations. Barr noted that the Federal Reserve has been making strides to capitalize on AI algorithms. He emphasized that the Fed aims to leverage the right AI tools by establishing an AI program and governance framework for the use of AI technologies. He noted that he was excited about the modernization of technology as an internal application of Generative AI tools. He said the Fed is already applying GenAI tools to generate unit tests, translate legacy code, and accelerate cloud migration. Barr said that the progress has enabled Fed workers to achieve various related objectives at a faster rate with improved quality and enhanced developer experience. He projected that AI will play a pivotal role in the American economy in the future; therefore, the central bank is devoting necessary resources to understanding the technology.

This institutional backing has enabled SOL to stabilize at a range of $150 to $160, which is a key support level that is being aggressively held by bulls. According to the analysts, when Solana price stays above $150, there is a possibility of a short-term rebound of Solana to the $175-185 level as it has been determined that its price can hit $200 as a more realistic long-term price mark. Amid these encouraging signs, more questions are emerging among the investors, whether the currently existing networks that are layer-1, such as Solana, are capable of competing with the growth potential of emerging DeFi crypto currently in presale, especially when looking to purchase the best crypto to maximize returns. The Institutional Support of Solana Its recent institutional adoption of Solana through ETF products underscores the increasing legitimacy of this new development in the rest of the traditional finance industry. This huge pool of capital has provided a solid foundation at the present level of prices of SOL, which may have acted as a cushion against a further decline in the market. Technical indicators indicate that the MACD line is in the offing of a possible bullish crossover, and that the RSI has been fluttering around the 37 mark indicating that the asset could be in the waters of being oversold, which could be the prelude to a rebound. Nonetheless, under these positive circumstances, the road path of Solana to achieve a large percentage of gains relative to its present scale has high challenges in contrast to the projects in their earlier stages and this is why most people are questioning what crypto should be their purchase that presents a combination of innovation and larger upside with a reduced entry point. Mutuum Finance Presale Beating Rival Established Names As Solana consolidates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still enjoying nearly unparalleled momentum in presales to the point of competing with established cryptocurrencies. The project has already raised more than $18,600,000 and attracted up to 17,900 holders indicating high confidence in the market of the value proposition beneath the project. This presale is currently in Phase 6 and tokens cost only $0.035, so this is one of the strongest presales that an investor can ever have when looking to invest in the current market cycle. Having so far filled 90% of this phase, the last deposits of the tokens are being bought by investors who are aware of the time constraint of getting the tokens by the maximum time possible before the price grows. Phase 7 will take place causing the price to be moved to $0.040, and this is the last opportunity to be able to purchase positions at the current price. Dual-Market Innovation and Dynamic Rewards Mutuum Finance is unique in that it provides a dual-market lending structure that integrates the efficiency of Peer-to-Contract with the flexibility of the Peer-to-Peer and develops a full ecosystem of mainstream and niche digital assets. In addition to its technical strengths, Mutuum Finance creates a high-tech leaderboard that allows participants to have their work recognized by giving the highest contributor of the day a $500 in MUTM bonus. The project is also working at a faster pace with an aggressive $100,000 giveaway where ten winners will get a cash amount of $10,000. Competitive Edge vs. mature Cryptos The presale architecture of Mutuum Finance is mathematically favorable even to recover the well-established cryptocurrencies. Whereas Solana involves a lot of movement of capital to attain substantial percentage gains out of its current price, a lower entry point and a marked progression of appreciation that MUTM offers during its presale rounds forms a more lucid risk-reward curve. It is further underlining strength that may appeal to all precautionary investors with the security audit conducted on the project and the open-mindedness of the development schedule implemented throughout the project. As the prospective next investment in the crypto space, Mutuum Finance is a fundamentally attractive option with several drivers in the future, with more and more people suggesting it as the place to invest in in the next few quarters. Final Hours at Current Price The rate at which the Phase 6 tokens are being distributed shows that the period during which a buy on MUTM will occur at $0.035 will not continue for long. Investors who are monitoring the recovery effort by Solana have a short time frame within which they can invest in a project whose short-term appreciation skills are higher and whose long-term fundamentals are equally good. As the next stage starts with the introduction of the price growth of 20%, the immediate action offers the most beneficial spot before Mutuum Finance moves to the other growth level, occupied by becoming the most beneficial crypto to buy as part of a strategic portfolio addition.

Recent market signals suggest we’re heading into a period of significant Bitcoin volatility that could test even the most seasoned investors. The calm waters we’ve experienced might be giving way to turbulent seas ahead. Why is Bitcoin volatility suddenly increasing? The Volmex 30-day BTC Implied Volatility Index has broken its downward trendline, signaling a major shift in market expectations. This technical development suggests that traders are anticipating larger price swings in the coming weeks. When this key indicator changes direction, it often precedes actual market movement. Jimmy Yang from Orbit Markets explains the underlying mechanics. “Early holders, miners, and large investors had been suppressing Bitcoin volatility through consistent call option selling,” he notes. However, as spot prices declined, these positions unwound, removing a crucial stabilizing force from the market. What’s driving this Bitcoin volatility surge? Several factors are converging to create the perfect storm for increased price swings: Reduced call option selling by major players Rising demand for downside protection through put options Weakening market liquidity conditions Ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty This combination creates an environment where even small catalysts could trigger outsized moves. The removal of the volatility suppression mechanism means the market’s natural tendency for Bitcoin volatility is reasserting itself. How should traders approach this Bitcoin volatility? Increased Bitcoin volatility presents both risks and opportunities. For short-term traders, wider price swings can mean bigger profits but also larger losses. Position sizing becomes critically important during these periods. Long-term investors might see this as a potential buying opportunity if prices dip significantly. However, the heightened Bitcoin volatility requires careful risk management and potentially wider stop-losses to avoid being shaken out by normal market fluctuations. What does history tell us about Bitcoin volatility cycles? Bitcoin has experienced similar periods of suppressed volatility followed by explosive moves throughout its history. These transitions often mark significant turning points in market trends. The current setup suggests we could be approaching another such inflection point where the extended period of relative calm gives way to more dynamic price action. The key takeaway is that periods of low Bitcoin volatility rarely last forever. Markets naturally cycle between compression and expansion phases, and we appear to be transitioning into the latter. Navigating the coming Bitcoin volatility storm As we face this potential increase in Bitcoin volatility , remember that preparation is your best defense. Whether you’re a day trader or long-term holder, understanding the market dynamics at play can help you make more informed decisions. The coming weeks could test investor resolve, but they may also create exceptional opportunities for those who remain calm and strategic. Frequently Asked Questions What is the BVIV index and why does it matter? The Bitcoin Implied Volatility Index measures market expectations of future price swings. When it breaks key trendlines, it often signals coming market turbulence. How long might this increased volatility last? Volatility cycles can last from several weeks to months. The current setup suggests we could see elevated volatility through the next options expiration cycle. Should I sell my Bitcoin during high volatility? That depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Some traders thrive in volatile conditions, while long-term investors might use dips as buying opportunities. What’s the difference between implied and realized volatility? Implied volatility reflects market expectations of future price moves, while realized volatility measures actual historical price movements. Can options trading really suppress Bitcoin volatility? Yes, when large players consistently sell call options, it can create a ceiling effect that limits upward momentum and reduces overall price swings. What other indicators should I watch during volatile periods? Monitor trading volume, funding rates, open interest, and major support/resistance levels for additional context on market direction.

PepeNode Readies for Rally",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-4000-pepenode-to-rally/,"What to Know: ETH faces firm resistance at $4,000–$4,100 and could retest the $3,272 support before attempting a breakout toward $4,000. Whales started amassing $ETH in bulk, with one whale in particular reaching $1.38B in $ETH after a recent $213M purchase. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) builds a gamified mine-to-earn loop on Ethereum, aiming to turn presale interest into ongoing activity and token burns. The $PEPENODE presale is now above $2.1M, with a token price of $0.0011454, and rewards early participants with better-performing mining nodes. Ethereum is chopping just below the levels that matter. After repeated knockbacks near $3,700, liquidity still stacks between $4,000 and $4,100, while the bears keep a toehold. Analyst Ted believes that the $4.1K price point is reachable if $ETH maintains momentum above $3.7K. The right conditions seem to be there. Whales and institutions have quietly stepped in, with one whale address scooping $269,460,000-worth of $ETH , while another increased its Ethereum supply to $1.38B, following a $213M purchase . That kind of absorption often caps downside tails and sets the stage for mean-reversion rallies into stacked offers. If $ETH can reclaim $3,700 with conviction, the path toward $4,000 reopens quickly. For context, spot prices hover in the mid-$3Ks with volatility picking up. CoinMarketCap’s live board shows $ETH around the mid-$3,400s today, reminding you the market’s still rangebound and headline-sensitive. Inside that range, the bid keeps showing up at $3,400–$3,300, but $4,000 remains the battleground with thicker resting liquidity. So what do you do if the price chops for a bit longer? This is where risk rotation gets interesting. Periods of $ETH consolidation historically funnel flows toward narratives with clear catalysts. That’s why more eyes drift to early-stage plays aligned with Ethereum’s culture and rails. Enter PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a ‘mine-to-earn’ meme token building a gamified virtual mining loop on Ethereum. When majors stall but on-chain participation holds, projects that blend gameplay, staking and token burns can soak up attention (and capital) until the next $ETH leg. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Mine-to-Earn Utility on Ethereum That Rewards Activity PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) positions itself as the meme coin that actually gives you something to do while you wait for the next breakout. Its whitepaper describes a virtual server-room where you buy and slot ‘Miner Nodes’ and facility upgrades, then optimize a simulated hashrate to generate rewards. It’s all on Ethereum, with smart contracts tracking staking and game logic once TGE lands. The concept is simple: create your mining facility, put it to work, and upgrade your nodes whenever necessary. No spicy electricity bills, no massive investments in high-end mining equipment; PEPENODE takes care of that. PEPENODE’s docs outline burn mechanics tied to node purchases and upgrades, alongside staking that switches on during presale and flows into game rewards later. That’s a classic flywheel pitch: more play → more upgrades → more burns → tighter float, assuming adoption sticks. The project incentivizes early adoption, because early nodes deliver higher rewards. Get your ticket into PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) mining ecosystem today. PEPENODE, Next Crypto to Explode? The presale is over $2.1M right now with a current token price of $0.0011454, per the project’s live materials. The stage-based pricing means $PEPENODE is guaranteed to increase in value during the presale phase and, if utility checks, post-launch as well. A realistic price prediction for $PEPENODE has the token at $0.0077 by the end of 2026, although massive hype-driven adoption could push it even higher. We’re talking about a 572% ROI if you invest at today’s price. Such a performance would help PEPENODE rank among the best presales of 2025. And possibly one of the next crypto to explode . Where could this go in the broader 2025 setup? The 4-Phase roadmap details several milestones for 2026 and beyond, including launching the Virtual Mining Simulator and introducing the meme coin rewards. For traders watching risk rotations while $ETH wrestles with $3.7K and $4K, the pitch is straightforward: pick spots where the on-chain loop doesn’t grind to a halt just because $BTC and $ETH go sideways. PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) mine-to-earn model tries to do exactly that—keeping attention, activity, and token velocity humming until majors decide the next leg. Our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE gives you all the information you need to secure your tokens fast and easy. Go to the presale page and buy your $PEPENODE stack today.

According to MartyParty, an analyst, the release involved around 193,000 SOL valued at about $30 million. This marks the latest phase of a structured vesting program that has gradually released millions of tokens to the estate since early 2024. The tokens are managed under bankruptcy oversight and often end up on major exchanges to repay creditors. Ongoing Monthly Unlocks Continue The Alameda and FTX-linked wallets have followed a steady monthly pattern of SOL unlocks, with amounts increasing slightly over time. Previous releases in October and September 2025 saw similar quantities of about 192,000 SOL each. The largest event occurred in March 2025 when more than 11 million tokens were freed, equivalent to over $2 billion at that time. Those tokens were primarily sold to firms like Galaxy and Pantera through bankruptcy-managed auctions. In total, more than 8 million SOL worth over $1 billion have been released since November 2023. Analysts estimate that approximately 5 million tokens remain locked or staked, with smaller monthly unlocks expected until 2028. These tokens originated from pre-2021 investment deals, not new emissions, meaning the supply increase has long been scheduled. Market Reactions and Price Action Solana’s market reaction remained steady despite the unlock. The token traded near $157.90 at press time, marking a 3.9% daily decline and maintaining a $87.5 billion market capitalization. Over the past week, SOL posted minor gains of 0.2%, showing resilience despite supply-related concerns. Source: X CryptoPulse noted that the asset’s recent movement from $150 to $170 shows underlying resilience despite temporary market fatigue. The short-term structure still favors consolidation between $156 and $165 before the next possible move higher. Key resistance remains near $195–$200, while a breakout above $180 could reignite upward momentum.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-12 09:32:08

Announced at the Web Summit in Lisbon on Wednesday, the initiative allows US-based businesses to send stablecoin payouts from fiat-funded accounts directly to recipients’ crypto wallets. This move positions USDC at the centre of a broader effort to upgrade traditional financial infrastructure with blockchain efficiency. Stablecoin payouts now live for US businesses Visa’s new pilot enables users of its Visa Direct service to send USD Coin (USDC) directly to wallets of recipients who choose to receive funds in stablecoins. The function compresses payment timelines from multiple days to mere minutes. Visa stated that the use case targets business-to-worker transactions including salaries, freelance payments, and contractor disbursements. While the pilot is initially limited to select US-based partners, a full-scale rollout is expected in 2026. It is designed to benefit companies managing international operations or engaging workers in the gig economy. These segments frequently face frictions in the current cross-border banking model. Internal data from Visa revealed that 57% of gig workers favour digital payments due to their immediacy. This initiative responds to that trend by integrating stablecoin transfers into the workflow of existing financial systems, eliminating legacy bottlenecks. Growing momentum in stablecoin infrastructure This pilot is not Visa’s first foray into blockchain-backed settlement. In July, it extended its stablecoin capabilities to support tokens such as Global Dollar (USDG), PayPal USD (PYUSD), and Euro Coin (EURC) across Stellar and Avalanche blockchains. These integrations reflect Visa’s intent to normalise stablecoin use in conventional payment channels. By September, Visa Direct began piloting real-time treasury transfers using USDC and EURC. These tests addressed corporate demand for rapid inter-business settlements, especially for treasury management applications. The timing of Visa’s acceleration aligns with legislative clarity. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act in the United States introduced a federal framework for stablecoins. This regulatory milestone has prompted a wave of institutional engagement with digital currencies. Competition increases in corporate stablecoin innovation Other major financial players are not far behind. Citigroup is developing stablecoin-based systems for internal and external settlements. Western Union has disclosed plans to roll out a blockchain-based asset transfer mechanism on Solana. Meanwhile, JPMorgan and Bank of America are in early-stage development of their own stablecoin initiatives. The corporate push has extended to the venture capital sector. Investors are increasingly directing capital toward stablecoin infrastructure firms. Recent investment rounds have backed Telcoin, Hercle, and Arx Research, each focusing on stablecoin integration, compliance tooling, or ecosystem expansion. This wave of activity suggests stablecoins are evolving from speculative assets to functional tools for large-scale financial operations. Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond Visa’s roadmap indicates that stablecoin-based payouts are not a one-off experiment but part of a strategic reorientation. Select partners are currently piloting the programme, with broader access planned for 2026. That timeline coincides with expected improvements in blockchain scalability and regulatory harmonisation. Embedding stablecoin wallet options within mainstream payment systems could normalise digital currency usage for payrolls and operational transfers. Visa is shaping an environment in which digital wallets coexist with traditional bank accounts, not as replacements but as parallel conduits for value. With infrastructure solidifying and regulatory barriers declining, Visa’s USDC pilot represents a notable convergence of enterprise finance and decentralised technologies. It reflects an accelerating shift where stablecoins become viable instruments for real-world economic coordination.

New data reveals that Bitcoin sell pressure has significantly decreased, suggesting we might be approaching a crucial turning point. The latest metrics indicate that the intense selling momentum is finally easing, potentially setting the stage for a market recovery. What Does Decreasing Bitcoin Sell Pressure Mean for Investors? CryptoQuant’s recent analysis shows the Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit (NUP) indicator holding steady at 0.476. This crucial metric suggests that Bitcoin sell pressure has largely subsided after recent market turbulence. When NUP reaches these levels, it typically indicates that most weak hands have already sold their positions. The reduction in Bitcoin sell pressure creates several important implications: Fewer sellers in the market means less downward pressure on prices Long-term holders appear to be maintaining their positions The market may be forming a solid foundation for the next upward move How Can You Identify a Short-Term Bottom? Recognizing market bottoms requires understanding key indicators beyond just price movements. The current Bitcoin sell pressure reduction aligns with several technical and on-chain signals that professional traders monitor closely. However, remember that markets can remain volatile even during bottom formation periods. Here are the key signals suggesting we’re near a short-term bottom: Decreasing exchange inflows from long-term holders Stabilization in mining activity and hash rate Reduced leverage across derivatives markets Growing accumulation from institutional investors What Actionable Steps Should Traders Consider Now? With Bitcoin sell pressure easing, strategic investors have an opportunity to reassess their positions. The current environment suggests that panic selling has subsided, creating potential entry points for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Nevertheless, always maintain proper risk management strategies. Consider these approaches during this transitional phase: Dollar-cost averaging into positions rather than timing the exact bottom Setting clear stop-loss levels to protect against unexpected volatility Monitoring on-chain metrics for confirmation of sustained recovery Diversifying across timeframes and investment strategies Why This Market Phase Matters for Long-Term Growth Periods of reduced Bitcoin sell pressure often precede significant market movements. Historical data shows that when NUP indicators reach these levels and stabilize, they frequently mark the beginning of new accumulation phases. This current setup could represent an important inflection point for patient investors. The market’s ability to absorb remaining Bitcoin sell pressure while maintaining current levels demonstrates underlying strength. This resilience often signals that the worst of the selling may be behind us, though confirmation through sustained price action remains essential. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Bitcoin Landscape The significant easing of Bitcoin sell pressure, as indicated by the NUP metric at 0.476, suggests we’re approaching a potential short-term bottom. While markets remain dynamic and require continuous monitoring, the current data provides cautious optimism for investors. The reduction in selling pressure, combined with other positive on-chain signals, creates an environment where strategic positioning could yield favorable results. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing requires patience, research, and disciplined risk management through all market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit (NUP) indicator? The NUP indicator measures the unrealized profit or loss across all Bitcoin holdings. It helps identify whether investors are generally in profit or loss, which influences their selling behavior. How reliable is the NUP indicator for predicting bottoms? While no indicator is perfect, NUP has historically been effective at identifying extreme market conditions. However, it should be used alongside other metrics for confirmation. Does reduced sell pressure guarantee a price increase? Not necessarily. Reduced sell pressure removes downward momentum, but price increases require new buying demand to enter the market. How long do short-term bottoms typically last? Short-term bottoms can last from several days to several weeks, depending on market conditions and catalyst developments. Should I invest all my capital when sell pressure eases? Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging and maintain proper portfolio diversification. What other indicators should I watch alongside NUP? Monitor exchange reserves, miner activity, funding rates, and volume patterns for comprehensive market analysis. Found this analysis helpful?

Infineon, which ends its fiscal year in September, said it anticipates moderate revenue growth this year after a slow period weighed down by weak demand in autos. CEO Jochen Hanebeck said global investment in AI infrastructure keeps climbing, prompting a new forecast that’s 50% higher than before. He also pointed out that growth in the automotive, industrial, and consumer sectors remains subdued, with customers staying cautious and limiting orders to short-term needs. Infineon’s gross margin slipped to 38.1% from 40.9% in the second quarter, to currency fluctuations and lower margins on certain consumer power and sensor products, which were sold under tighter pricing due to underused production capacity, said the earnings report. AI growth cushions auto weakness for Infineon Infineon’s automotive division, which accounts for roughly half of total revenue, continues to face sluggish demand, as the car-chip market remains stuck in a slowdown after customers stockpiled components during the Covid-19 shortages. Infineon’s CFO Sven Schneider said during an interview with Bloomberg TV that such instability from tariffs and global politics is “the new normal,” though he expects stability to improve as new trade deals emerge. Shares of Infineon rose 0.6% to €34.09 at 9:14 a.m. in Frankfurt following the announcement. The company’s 2025 fiscal year revenue fell 2% to €14.66 billion, aligning with analyst expectations. In the fourth quarter, sales reached €3.94 billion, up 6% from the prior period, with contributions from all divisions, including automotive. For the first fiscal quarter of 2026, Infineon said it expects revenue of about €3.6 billion, below the market’s average forecast of €3.75 billion. In comparison, rivals Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics reported disappointing Q3 earnings missed, especially after the global automotive chip supply chain took most of its hit in late September thanks to the Dutch government seized Nexperia , a Chinese-owned semiconductor firm critical to carmakers. Companies including Volkswagen AG warned about the impact of a shortage, and Honda Motor Co. cut its annual profit guidance after halting production at some plants. The Dutch company’s facility in China accounted for about half of Nexperia’s pre-crisis volumes. Beijing’s retaliation (restricting exports of Nexperia’s chips) caused another supply squeeze. Cryptopolitan has reported that both sides have started to settle the dispute. Jochen said on a media call that overlap between Infineon’s product lineup and Nexperia’s affected semiconductors is limited, adding, “Here and there we were able to help out a little bit.” Now the Netherlands is prepared to suspend its powers over Nexperia if the shipment of supplies resumes and is verified.

According to the StoryTime page on Facebook, the cats were found snuggling inside a private mining facility in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Employees told reporters that the stray cats appeared near the facility during the cold season in early October, looking for shelter and heat from the running mining machines. Within weeks, the number of cats had multiplied to around 200, transforming the crypto mining centre into an unintended feline sanctuary. Every time the animals slept on top of the machines, the graphics cards’ output was strained. This lowered hash rates and required expensive hardware upgrades. “It’s cute and touching, but these ‘beds’ literally cost us millions of dollars,” one employee told StoryTime, explaining that the animals’ presence caused overheating. Mining rigs turned into a cat inn The farm’s owner, described by workers as a lifelong animal lover, decided to accommodate them. “Luckily, the man who owns these machines is a cat guy,” said one worker. “He bought over 200 heating mats, and we’ve been instructed to put them in a separate room for the cats.” The impromptu shelter was set up adjacent to the main mining hall, complete with insulated walls and bedding to keep the cats warm. “I find it so beautiful that, of all animals that could have sabotaged crypto nonsense, it had to be cats. The backbone of internet culture,” said one X user. finally, a decent use for crypto pic.twitter.com/3FMbvj1XUD — horse dentist (@equine__dentist) November 10, 2025 Per stats from Coinwarz, the Bitcoin network’s current mining difficulty clocked 155.97 trillion hashes per second (155.97 T), so miners must perform roughly 155.97 trillion hash computations on average to find a block. Mining rigs use electric power between 1.5-3.3 kilowatts each, which equates to around 54-82 °C of heat emitted, just about the amount dozens of cats need to beat the 0-16 °C Inner Mongolia cold weather. Despite the damage, workers say the cats are now well cared for and have become a permanent feature of the site. “They’re part of the family now. The mining rigs may be quieter, but at least the cats are warm,” one technician reckoned. Mining in a region where it is banned Cryptocurrency mining was officially banned in Inner Mongolia in 2021, when the region’s Development and Reform Commission declared a crackdown on crypto mining and related digital asset operations. According to Reuters, the commission said violators could face license revocations and social credit penalties if found participating or helping in mining operations. Inner Mongolia was once a global powerhouse for Bitcoin mining, accounting for nearly 8% of worldwide hash power at the time, per the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. However, Beijing’s push for carbon neutrality and financial risk control led to restrictions around Mainland China and Inner Mongolia. The Chinese government sent a stern warning to crypto-mining telecommunications and internet firms, and new digital coin projects were explicitly banned. China’s State Council, led by Vice Premier Liu He, vowed to “resolutely prevent and control financial risks” from digital currencies. Inner Mongolia, responding to the directive, pledged to “clean up” its mining sector to purify the big data industry. China and the US Bitcoin hack blame game The cat incident comes against the backdrop of tensions between China and the United States over digital assets and cybersecurity earlier this week. Beijing’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Centre accused Washington of orchestrating a massive Bitcoin theft from a Chinese-linked mining pool known as LuBian. According to Chinese officials, cited by Cryptopolitan, American state-backed hackers allegedly stole 127,272 Bitcoin, worth approximately $13 billion, from LuBian in December 2020. The agency claimed a “state-level hacker operation” came from the US government, and that US authorities later confiscated the stolen tokens in a separate money-laundering case involving Cambodian businessman Chen Zhi. The US Department of Justice evidently filed a civil forfeiture case to seize the 127,271 Bitcoin, but declined to explain how it gained control of the tokens.

Standard Chartered Has Partnered Up With DCS On Stablecoins As revealed in a press release, Standard Chartered is collaborating with DCS Card Center as the banking partner for DeCard, a credit card that enables users to make stablecoin transactions. DCS Card Center, formerly known as Diners Club Singapore, is a global payments provider situated in Singapore. It backs the DeCard credit card, described as “a next-gen card brand built for seamless stablecoin spending in the real world.” The company is now turning to Standard Chartered’s infrastructure to support DeCard’s growing userbase. Headquartered in the UK, Standard Chartered is a major global banking institution operating in 54 markets, including Singapore. The bank has been making strides in the digital asset sector recently. In July, the institution became the first of its stature to launch spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading desks for institutional investors. Last month, it also partnered up with cryptocurrency exchange OKX in the European Economic Area (EEA). The collaboration with DCS isn’t Standard Chartered’s first foray into stablecoins, either, as the bank formed a joint venture with Animoca Brands and Hong Kong Telecom back in August to apply for a stablecoin issuer license in Hong Kong. Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to a fiat currency, have increasingly been becoming popular around the world, as they offer a faster and more transparent alternative to traditional transactions. In the partnership with DCS, Standard Chartered will provide banking and financial services to DeCard across a range of domains, including fiat and stablecoin settlements. Dhiraj Bajaj, the bank’s Global Head of TB FI Sales, said: This partnership is in line with our continued efforts to offer banking solutions for innovative Fintech partners and is central to our strategy of supporting clients in navigating the evolving digital assets space. According to the press release, Standard Chartered’s API infrastructure will also allow DCS to link virtual accounts to DeCard holders, making it possible for immediate identification and transaction reconciliation across multiple channels. Currently, Standard Chartered and DCS are rolling out the collaboration only in Singapore, but expansion in other key markets is planned. It’s unknown, however, which markets exactly the service will make its way to next. While stablecoins have been gaining more adoption, growth in their market cap is starting to cool down, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . From the above chart, it’s visible that the 60-day change in the market cap of USDT, the largest of the fiat-tied cryptocurrencies, was witnessing sharp growth earlier in the year, but recently, it has shown a turnaround. “After months of growth, total stablecoin market cap is now trending downward—a potential signal of cooling liquidity,” noted Maartunn. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $104,000, down 1% over the last 24 hours.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Stablecoins|Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered Stablecoins,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-12 10:00:51

Ontology announced that the ONG Tokenomics Adjustment Proposal has been approved by the network’s node operators following a three-day on-chain vote held from October 28 to October 31, 2025. The proposal passed with 117,169,804 votes in favor and zero votes against, confirming a strong community consensus to move forward with updates that strengthen long-term sustainability, staking incentives, and ecosystem development. “This decision sets ONG on a clear, sustainable path with an 800 million cap, a permanent liquidity lock, and predictable emissions that support ONT stakers and simplify planning for developers,” said Jun Li, Founder of Ontology. “Together, these improvements are intended to drive higher on-chain usage and transactions as we complete the MainNet v3.0.0 upgrade on December 1, 2025.” What Was Approved Objectives Cap total ONG supply at 800 million. Permanently lock ONT and ONG assets equal to 100 million ONG in value to strengthen liquidity and reduce circulating supply. Rebalance incentives for ONT stakers while maintaining predictable emissions. Implementation Overview Cap total supply at 800 million ONG. Extend the release period from 18 to 19 years. Maintain a constant release rate of 1 ONG per second. Allocate 80 percent of emissions to ONT staking incentives and 20 percent, plus transaction fees, to ecological liquidity. Use ONG to acquire ONT, pair the two assets for liquidity, and burn the LP tokens to permanently remove the assets from circulation. Supply Effects 200 million ONG will be burned to establish the new cap. Assets equal to 100 million ONG will be permanently locked in liquidity pools. Why It Matters This decision marks a structural step forward for Ontology’s economic foundation. By reducing supply and locking liquidity, the network is reinforcing the value and predictability that long-term participants depend on. A capped supply establishes value discipline. A permanent lock safeguards liquidity. Predictable emissions sustain staking rewards and ecosystem stability. As Web3 shifts toward real-world identity and verifiable data, sustainable networks will define the next wave of adoption. These adjustments strengthen Ontology’s position as a reliable infrastructure for decentralized identity, privacy, and trust. A more resilient ONG foundation supports ONT ID, ONTO Wallet, and Orange Protocol, ensuring that developers, businesses, and partners can build on Ontology with confidence. It signals a network engineered for steady growth, ready to power the next phase of decentralized identity adoption. Network Upgrade Timeline v2.7.0, November 27, 2025: Consensus and gas-limit optimizations. v3.0.0, December 1, 2025: ONG tokenomics update and consensus optimization. Execution: All MainNet and dApp nodes upgrade to avoid synchronization pauses. Users and stakers: No action required. Key Questions: How long are the ONT and ONG assets equal to 100 million ONG locked: The lock is permanent. It is enforced by burning the LP tokens created from ONG–ONT liquidity provisioning. This mechanism removes the underlying assets from circulation and maintains long-term supply discipline. Will ONT staking rewards change: Emissions will decrease by about 20 percent. This may adjust nominal payouts, but the capped supply and predictable release rate create a more stable environment for sustainable staking rewards over time. Realized APY remains market-dependent. Do users or stakers need to take action: No action is required. The upgrade will be executed at the node level, and users or stakers should experience no service disruption. When do the changes take effect: The tokenomics adjustments activate with Ontology MainNet v3.0.0 on December 1, 2025, following network upgrades beginning November 27, 2025. Node and dApp operators are advised to complete upgrades accordingly to maintain synchronization. Governance and Community All nodes participated through OWallet, in accordance with Ontology’s decentralized governance framework, reflecting community involvement in the network’s operational decisions.

It provides infrastructure for verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs in real-world Web3 applications.

According to posts on X by a popular analyst known as Egrag Crypto, the coin is trading at the bottom of a descending triangle and could stage a strong rally in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Analysts Point To Historical Setups According to Egrag, two earlier runs give the pattern some weight. He compared the present chart to moves in 2017 and 2021. Back then, XRP went from $0.097 to $3.84 across a roughly three-month span around 2017–2018. In 2021, it rose from below $0.45 to above $1.90 in two monthly candles. Based on those moves, he expects a comeback within four to six weeks and projects gains of about 300% to 1,400% from today’s price. #XRP – ⚔️ Weakness?

And that’s fine , protecting profits is smart,” he added. Other market voices have echoed parts of that view, reposting Egrag’s chart and wrote that XRP is “busy testing bulls’ faith.” ETF Filing Moves Forward Meanwhile, according to filings and reporting, Canary Capital has taken a key step toward launching a spot XRP ETF in the US. The firm filed a Form 8-A, a move that, once Nasdaq signs off, would let the fund list its shares. Crypto reporter Eleanor Terrett said the filing will become effective at 5:30 p.m. ET once Nasdaq certifies it, and trading is set to start when US markets open on Thursday, November 14, 2025. That development matters because an ETF can make an asset easier for many investors to buy. It does not mean prices will automatically skyrocket. It does mean more attention, and that can change market behavior in ways that are hard to predict. 🚨NEW: @CanaryFunds has filed its Form 8-A. This is the final step before it goes effective at 5:30 PM ET Wednesday once the Nasdaq certifies the listing. When that happens, the last hurdle is cleared and the first $XRP spot ETF will be set to launch Thursday at market open. pic.twitter.com/mXvkrrXbiJ — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 11, 2025 Short-Term Data And Market Tone At press time, XRP was trading around $2.39, down about 3% over the last 24 hours. Technical traders focus on where the price sits inside the triangle pattern and watch volume for confirmation of a breakout. Related Reading: XRP ETF Canary Takes Flight: 8-A Filing Clears Path To Nasdaq Listing Some see the structure as a setup for a large move either way. Others point out that the market environment today is not the same as in 2017 or 2021, given bigger trading volumes and different regulatory factors. The ETF timing adds a new element to watch. If Nasdaq approves Canary Capital’s Form 8-A as reported, the first spot XRP shares could start trading on Thursday. Markets often react to such milestones, but how big that reaction will be is unknown.

This pivotal moment creates urgent trading opportunities that every currency investor needs to understand. The dollar’s upward trajectory signals a major shift in market sentiment that could reshape global currency dynamics for weeks to come. Why is the US dollar gaining strength? The US dollar’s recent upward movement reflects growing confidence in the American economy’s resilience. As lawmakers finalize the government reopening plan, investors are returning to dollar-denominated assets with renewed optimism. This trend demonstrates how political stability directly influences currency markets and creates predictable patterns for savvy traders. Understanding currency markets during political transitions Currency markets typically react to government shutdown resolutions with increased volatility and clear directional trends. The current situation presents three key factors driving dollar strength: Restored government services boosting economic activity Return of federal workers stimulating consumer spending Renewed international confidence in US political stability Government shutdown impact on economic recovery The end of the government shutdown removes significant uncertainty that had been weighing on economic growth. Federal agencies resuming normal operations will immediately begin processing delayed contracts, payments, and services. This sudden injection of economic activity typically creates a positive feedback loop that strengthens the domestic currency. Economic Factor Pre-Reopening Post-Reopening Government Spending Limited Accelerated Market Confidence Cautious Optimistic Currency Volatility High Stabilizing Identifying trading opportunities in currency shifts Current market conditions offer distinct trading opportunities for those who understand historical patterns. The dollar’s drift higher suggests several strategic approaches: Short-term positions capitalizing on reopening momentum Medium-term strategies based on economic normalization Hedging against potential post-rally corrections FAQs: Government Reopening and Currency Markets How long do government reopening effects typically last in currency markets? Most significant currency movements occur within the first two weeks following resolution, with effects gradually normalizing over 4-6 weeks. Which government agencies most influence dollar strength during reopenings? The Federal Reserve , Treasury Department , and Commerce Department play crucial roles in stabilizing and guiding currency markets. What historical patterns suggest about current trading opportunities? Previous government shutdown resolutions under leaders like President Biden and President Trump show consistent dollar strengthening patterns. The government reopening represents a critical inflection point for the US dollar and global currency markets. The combination of restored political stability, renewed economic activity, and returning investor confidence creates a powerful foundation for sustained dollar strength. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable insights for navigating the evolving financial landscape and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.

Holders Will Make Immense Wealth,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-will-hit-all-time-high-in-3-months-holders-will-make-immense-wealth/,"Levi Rietveld, creator of Crypto Crusaders, has become known in the XRP community for his direct and confident market insights. In a recent post , Rietveld expressed strong conviction about XRP’s near-term trajectory, stating that “If I’m right.. $XRP will hit all time highs in the next 3 months.” Rietveld believes anyone holding XRP now has a big opportunity to “make immense wealth.” His statement resonated with investors who view XRP as one of the digital assets most poised for renewed momentum . While many analysts continue to debate whether the current market cycle has fully matured, Rietveld’s outlook introduces a decisive stance. Rather than speculating on long-term uncertainty, he frames the coming months as a critical period for XRP’s potential breakout. If I'm right.. $XRP will hit all time highs in the next 3 months and everyone holding XRP has the opportunity to make immense wealth.. If I'm wrong the bull run is over, and we can buy XRP at a massive discount until the next bull run kicks off.. Win-Win — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 10, 2025 Positioning XRP for Market Strength Rietveld’s perspective aligns with increasing confidence among XRP supporters who believe the asset’s fundamentals have strengthened despite recent volatility . Ripple’s recent expansion into institutional payment solutions, the use of XRP in liquidity management, and growing interest from fintech firms have all positioned the asset as more than just a speculative token. For many investors, Rietveld’s statement reflects a belief that the market may be underestimating XRP’s potential to recover in an improving macroeconomic environment. However, Rietveld acknowledged that his prediction carries risk, writing that “If I’m wrong, the bull run is over.” Despite this, the end of the bull run can also benefit the community, as Rietveld stated, “We can buy XRP at a massive discount until the next bull run kicks off.” For supporters, it’s not simply about price movement, but timing participation in a long-term growth cycle. Rietveld sees the situation as a “Win-Win,” as investors who buy the dip will benefit from the digital asset’s massive resurgence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why His View Resonates with Investors Rietveld’s post reinforces the perception that XRP is undervalued. This creates an attractive setup for upside movement. His forecast, while bold, reflects a sentiment that XRP’s underlying value proposition continues to strengthen as adoption expands. Traders and long-term holders recognize that digital assets often move sharply once regulatory or liquidity barriers shift. With XRP now more deeply integrated into payment rails and financial infrastructure, optimism around potential price acceleration has gained credibility. His prediction places clear expectations on the months ahead while maintaining a constructive outlook even in the event of short-term setbacks.

Bitcoin’s role as collateral and benchmark asset across stablecoins and lending products is expanding its monetary premium. The SEC’s in-kind redemption approval allows ETFs to hold Bitcoin directly, thereby reducing liquidity and slowing market velocity. Upcoming spot ETF approvals in South Korea and Japan could remove hundreds of thousands of additional coins from circulation. These structural shifts support a long-term valuation framework that point to significant upside through 2030. Investment Thesis I give Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) a strong buy rating because its long-term value is being driven by three major forces: a shrinking circulating supply, its status as a benchmark reserve asset for the greater crypto economy, and its growth as a monetary premium across various institutional products. More than 73% of Bitcoin is being held long-term, and an additional 15% has been absorbed by ETFs, corporate treasuries, and governments, thereby slowing its velocity and tightening its effective float. There are two catalysts reinforcing this trend: first, there's the upcoming approval of spot ETFs in South Korea and Japan , which would bring hundreds of thousands of coins into custody, and, second, there's the SEC's recent approval of in-kind redemptions for Bitcoin that are moving it into ETF vaults as opposed to going through exchanges. Put together, all these forces are reducing Bitcoin's circulation, thereby both expanding its role as global collateral as well as increasing its intrinsic value under the quantity theory of money valuation framework I use below. Based on all these factors, I give a base-case fair value to Bitcoin of $229,000 by 2030 assuming all this institutional absorption continues with modest growth, with my bull case reaching as high as $384,000 assuming velocity falls below 4.5. The Three Drivers of Bitcoin's Value There are three major drivers, or forces, that are defining Bitcoin's value going into the future: Driver 1: Shrinking Circulating Supply First, there's Bitcoin's shrinking circulating supply. Bitcoin's circulating supply available to buy or sell has shrunk faster than at any other time in most recent years. For example, institutions absorbed eight years' worth of Bitcoin issuance in 2024 alone, with 1.33 million Bitcoin in spot Bitcoin ETFs, totaling around $140 billion in assets under management, representing 6.35% of Bitcoin's supply cap. Meanwhile corporate and government treasuries (i.e. countries, public companies, and private companies) hold approximately 1.94 million Bitcoin, representing 9.2% of Bitcoin's supply cap, and worth, at the time of this writing, approximately $203 billion. As a matter of fact, recent data shows a record 14.46 million Bitcoin held by long-term holders (in this case, defined as holders holding Bitcoin for at least 155 days) who buy during dips and sell during bull market peaks. These long-term holders constitute 73% of Bitcoin's circulating supply, which, thereby lowers the market velocity (or [V] in my valuation model below) for Bitcoin and increases its intrinsic worth (if we value Bitcoin according to the quantity theory of money as I do below). In essence, Bitcoin's value is determined by supply-side dynamics as opposed to short-term trading or even speculation as many may believe. Driver 2: Anchor for the Crypto Economy Second, Bitcoin serves as an anchor for the crypto economy, very similar to how the U.S. dollar serves as the anchor for global finance. The total transaction volume settled across stablecoins has reached an annual $27.6 trillion , while the total market cap for stablecoins has reached $300 billion for the first time. And though these stablecoins operate on other blockchains such as Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Tron ( TRX-USD ), Bitcoin serves as the benchmark reserve asset; in other words, it serves as the backbone of trust in the digital asset community, keeping stablecoin markets credible and, without it, the entire crypto market would lose both its base layer of confidence and its liquidity. From a valuation standpoint, this expands Bitcoin's transaction volume (the [T] in my valuation model below) beyond its own network, which itself had roughly $19 trillion settled in transactions in 2024 through the Bitcoin network, to include the trillions settled across stablecoins that reference Bitcoin for both pricing and collateral. Driver 3: Growth as a Monetary Premium Third, this driver is related, yet distinct, from the first two drivers, and that is that Bitcoin's next stage of monetization is being driven by its monetary premium (i.e. the extra value it gains due to its function as a monetary reserve) as opposed to speculation, where more than $750 billion to $800 billion in global products reference Bitcoin either through direct holdings (i.e. products physically holding Bitcoin that remove its coins from circulation and, thereby, lower its velocity), collateralized instruments (i.e. products that lock Bitcoin for loans, stablecoins, or other financial instruments) and derivative exposure (i.e. products that track or settle against Bitcoin's price). Beyond the already mentioned spot ETFs and treasuries, there is also the derivatives market, with open interest in Bitcoin futures across exchanges reaching as high as $66 billion in mid-2025, the Bitcoin-backed lending market, which was valued at $8.6 billion and that has estimated growth projections to around $45.6 billion by 2030, the broader crypto-collateralized lending sector, which, as of mid-2025, held around $50 to $55 billion in total value locked [TVL] across decentralized and institutional platforms, and the stablecoin ecosystem, referenced above as a $300 billion market, that relies on Bitcoin as the ultimate liquidity benchmark. What these multiple layers illustrate is Bitcoin's growth as a monetary premium, or the added value that Bitcoin acquires from serving as a three-fold financial reserve, collateral base, and pricing benchmark for the digital economy, that continues to increase as more products continue to reference Bitcoin either through direct holdings, loans, or derivatives. And my greater point with all this data is that Bitcoin is shifting from a speculative asset to monetary infrastructure. What this does for my valuation model is expand Bitcoin's transaction demand even further (the [T] in my valuation model) beyond its on-chain activity, and into the broader financial system, thereby integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance. Putting It All Together In sum, we have these three forces—a shrinking supply, expanding transaction demand, and Bitcoin's growth as a monetary premium—that together form the foundation for Bitcoin's long-term value going forward. And now that we have each driver defined and how they serve their purpose in the valuation model below, we can now quantify their impact using the following methodology: Valuation Method I'll use the same framework to value Bitcoin as I did XRP , which is found in chapter 12 of the book ""Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond"" and based on the quantity theory of money and adapted for cryptoassets, which assumes that a cryptoasset's value comes from the amount of economic activity it supports relative to how frequently the currency circulates. In this case: We divide a digital asset's transaction volume or the economic value that is settled or referenced by Bitcoin [T] by its velocity [V]—how many times each Bitcoin is used per year—to get us our market cap [MV]. Dividing the market cap [MV] by the circulating supply [B] gets us our price per Bitcoin. We apply a discount, usually around 20-30%, to adjust for risks such as regulation, adoption delays, and so on, over a time horizon. Bitcoin's Valuation Using the three drivers above, I modeled Bitcoin's value through 2030 across three scenarios in the chart below with the logic behind the numbers being the following: Historically, Bitcoin's velocity has been around 5 to 6 . However, since 73% of Bitcoin is held by long-term investors, with another 15% locked in ETFs, corporate and government treasuries, this float contraction, as I've argued above, is slowing its velocity, and I thereby use a velocity of 4.7 as my base. For the transaction element, Bitcoin currently anchors $46 trillion in annual economic activity— $19 trillion through the Bitcoin network and an annual $27.6 trillion from stablecoin settlements. While the Bitcoin network is mature and may only be expected to have modest growth, say around 1-2% per year, the expanding stablecoin layer may have growth of around 10-15% per year, and the Bitcoin-referenced financial products are expanding the fastest and, thereby, have growth of around 15-20%. When blended together, we get an estimated 4-5% annual growth per year in transaction activity. However, we must assume some slowdown in the Bitcoin network, velocity drag from more institutions holding on to Bitcoin, and some stablecoin volume that may migrate to other anchors besides Bitcoin. Therefore, I'll assume net realized growth of around 1-1.5% in my model, and I'll assume $48 trillion in transaction volume or economic value for my bull case. Bitcoin Valuation Table (Author) Bull Case Our bull case estimates 266% upside with a price target of $384,000 by 2030 assuming that Bitcoin's transaction base grows steadily toward $48 trillion with the expansion of stablecoins, lending markets, and the Bitcoin-referenced financial products. Velocity would also slow modestly, with more supply absorbed by both ETFs and institutional holders. Base Case Our base case estimates 119% upside with a price target of $229,000 by 2030 assuming moderate transaction growth to $32 trillion and a velocity of 4.7 as the Bitcoin network matures. This aligns most closely with Bitcoin's current path and is a conservative fair-value midpoint—the one which I believe is the most likely to happen. Bear Case Our bear case estimates 14% downside with a price target of $90,000 by 2030. This would assume both more limited transaction activity along with a higher velocity due to more Bitcoin turnover and a slowing down in institutional holding. Two Catalysts for Upside There are two catalysts for Bitcoin, one potential and one live, that would or do cause velocity drag, thereby increasing the asset's intrinsic value: Spot ETFs in South Korea and Japan The first catalyst is South Korea's move in approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in a plan to modernize the nation's digital capital markets. The second is a Japanese Bitcoin ETF that could debut in 2027, with the Japanese government possessing the tools to fast-track its approval. Tomoya Asakura, the President and CEO of SBI Global Asset Management, stated in a government session: The earliest we can expect approval is two years from now. But that is still too late. The US market has been moving very quickly over the past six months. In a year’s time, we can also expect to be significantly behind Hong Kong and Singapore. Approval in both nations would accelerate Bitcoin's supply absorption (my first driver above) and expand the transaction demand (my second and third drivers above). And we can't forget that South Korea is the second largest crypto market in the world in terms of fiat trading volume. With hundreds of thousands of coins being removed from circulation, and fewer coins changing hands, this would contribute to a slowdown in Bitcoin's velocity, which is the most important variable for increasing intrinsic value. 2025 Fiat Trade Volume by Currency (Kaiko Market Explorer) ETF In-Kind Redemptions The second catalyst, which is live, is the SEC's approval of in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs that allow institutions to receive Bitcoin instead of cash (as was the case with the old cash-based system) when redeeming or creating new ETF shares. In the previous cash-based model, issuers had to buy or sell Bitcoin on the open market whenever investor demand for ETFs changed; but now, authorized participants [APs], such as major banks, that have formal agreements with ETF issuers, such as Blackrock (NYSE: BLK ), can transfer Bitcoin straight into ETF vaults, the main point being that more coins are now moving through institutional accounts—from one vault to another—rather than circulating through exchanges, reducing both liquidity and selling pressure. For example, as of the time of this writing, Blackrock's IBIT (NASDAQ: IBIT ) is the dominant force among all Bitcoin ETFs, holding around 805,000 BTC worth $87 billion, holdings that have grown steadily since the SEC's approval of in-kind redemptions. With this new model, these coins now inside ETF custody, rarely move, thus slowing down Bitcoin's velocity further and tightening its effective float. Thesis Risks I believe the primary risk to my valuation is regulatory reversal back to a cash-based ETF structure or imposed custody constraints that would, in effect, force ETFs to sell Bitcoin during the redemption process, increasing both market velocity and effective float. A second risk lies in the potential for profit-taking by long-term holders, which, as mentioned above, sell during market highs. A mid-cycle bull run, let's suppose one happens in 2026, would raise Bitcoin's velocity and weaken my argument above that highlights Bitcoin's scarcity-driven premium driving up its valuation. A third risk lies in the stablecoin market; should either Tether ( USDT-USD ) or USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) have some sort of liquidity crisis or a depegging occurs, this would slow both exchange trading and crypto lending, thereby cutting the total number of transactions [T] that use Bitcoin as either a benchmark or as loan collateral. And, fourth, there is always the risk of rising interest rates or even a crunch in global credit that could pull money away from Bitcoin ETFs and into safer, yield-bearing assets that would, in effect, slow down institutional buying. Investor Takeaway Bitcoin is evolving from speculative asset into monetary infrastructure, combining long-term holder dominance, ETF absorption, and rising use as collateral across various financial products that are both decreasing its velocity and tightening its supply—two factors that raise its intrinsic value. With the U.S. having adopted an in-kind ETF model, along with major players in Asia preparing for their own spot ETF approvals, institutional accumulation and integration is now ushering Bitcoin into a new era that reinforces the currency's scarcity and relevance. Of course, there are always the regulatory, macro, and profit-taking risks, but Bitcoin's structural trends that are driving a contraction in supply seem to be durable heading into the future, with my base-case of $229,000 per Bitcoin by 2030 reflecting these trends, along with even more upward potential closer to $384,000 should institutional accumulation accelerate while Bitcoin velocity decelerates.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-12 10:12:53

Key Takeaways: Visa has launched a pilot program allowing direct USDC payouts for freelancers, creators, and gig workers, enabling near-instant global payments. The initiative targets emerging markets with limited banking access, offering faster, more stable, and transparent fund transfers. The program marks Visa’s latest push into blockchain finance, following $140 billion in crypto-related transactions since 2020. The initiative aims to make cross-border payments nearly instant while reducing dependence on traditional banking infrastructure. Announced Wednesday at the Web Summit in Lisbon , the pilot allows businesses using Visa Direct in the US to fund payouts in fiat currency, with recipients choosing to receive their earnings in USDC. Visa Targets Emerging Markets With Faster, Stablecoin-Based Payout Access Visa said this gives users faster and more stable access to funds, particularly in countries facing currency volatility or limited banking access. “Launching stablecoin payouts is about enabling truly universal access to money in minutes — not days — for anyone, anywhere in the world,” said Chris Newkirk, Visa’s President of Commercial & Money Movement Solutions. Recipients must hold a compatible stablecoin wallet and pass know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks. The pilot currently supports only USDC and involves select partners, with a broader rollout expected in the second half of 2026 as regulations evolve. The move builds on Visa’s September pilot that allowed businesses to pre-fund payouts using stablecoins. Together, the initiatives expand Visa’s reach into stablecoin-powered money movement, offering a faster, transparent alternative to legacy payment systems. Each payout is recorded on-chain, supporting greater auditability and compliance. BREAKING: Visa begins testing stablecoin payouts, starting with $USDC . The pilot allows U.S. businesses to pay in fiat, while recipients can choose to receive in USDC. pic.twitter.com/XaCpSeg38B — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 12, 2025 Visa’s expansion into digital assets has accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the company has processed more than $140 billion in crypto and stablecoin transactions and recently partnered with Stripe-owned Bridge to issue stablecoin-linked Visa cards. It also launched the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform, helping banks pilot stablecoin issuance and settlement. According to Visa’s 2025 Creator Economy Report, 57% of digital content creators ranked “instant access to funds” as their top priority in choosing digital payment methods, a need that Visa says stablecoins are uniquely positioned to meet. The pilot highlights Visa’s growing focus on blockchain innovation as part of its long-term money movement strategy. Western Union to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin on Solana Western Union is also entering the stablecoin market with plans to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) on the Solana blockchain in the first half of 2026. The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, will allow users to move money globally with lower fees and faster settlement times, reducing reliance on traditional banking intermediaries and volatile currency conversions. CEO Devin McGranahan described the move as a continuation of Western Union’s 175-year mission to simplify money transfers, this time through blockchain technology. He said Solana was chosen for its speed, scalability, and low-cost transactions, which are crucial for the company’s high-volume remittance business. By leveraging blockchain rails, Western Union aims to make remittances nearly instantaneous and more transparent.

Among these meme coins, Maxi Doge and Bitcoin Hyper are already among the favorites, having raised millions of dollars in their ongoing token presales. Maxi Doge draws in degens with its ‘max gainz’ attitude, while Bitcoin Hyper helps expand the Bitcoin ecosystem with its proposed Layer 2 network. December is creeping up, and traders are dusting off the ‘Santa rally’ playbook. Data tracked by CoinGlass shows Bitcoin (BTC) has closed most Decembers in the green , with gains as strong as the mid-40% range in some years. That pattern doesn’t guarantee upside, but it does tend to flip sentiment and push traders’ appetite towards riskier assets, including the best meme coins . When hunting for meme coins, more experienced traders seldom pick their options at random. Rather, they look into factors like seasonality along with the underlying premise of these tokens and real demand drivers. As such, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) have been in the sights of most crypto traders these days. Learn more about them below: 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) — Join Fellow Degens and Snap Up This High-Energy Meme Coin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans into degen culture and high-octane branding, but there’s more here than memes. For one, there’s the hefty 77% APY staking rewards, which are sure to boost participation among investors. Read more about the project by checking out our ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ page. The strategy is paying off pretty well for the project team. To date, Maxi Doge has already raised over $3.9M, signaling high interest among degens. With nearly half of its token supply allocated towards marketing, expect appetite for $MAXI to grow as the presale progresses. Overall, the project stays true to the meme coin spirit of fun like Maxi’s distant cousin Doge. If you have a huge appetite for risk and are ready to chase after ‘max gainz’ from your investment, then Maxi Doge is right up your alley. To get started, head on to the official Maxi Doge presale website, connect your crypto wallet to the presale widget, and buy $MAXI with your credit/debit card or crypto. Each token costs just $0.0002675, but with yet another price increase coming in a few hours, it’s best to act while they’re still cheap. Of course, you can also stake your tokens to earn passive rewards from your investment. HODLing is an option too if you prefer to invest long term, especially considering $MAXI’s potential to reach $0.0058 by the end of 2026, according to our Maxi Doge price prediction . Join the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale now. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — Help Build the Next Chapter of the Bitcoin Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presents itself as a high-throughput Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) utilizing SVM-style architecture and ZK-secured settlement paths , a narrative that has dominated 2025. What this means is that when the L2 launches, you’ll be able to enjoy fast transaction speeds and low fees in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Additionally, you can now utilize your $BTC for applications that were previously not possible, such as staking, trading, and interacting with dApps. Bitcoin Hyper’s success can have a tremendous impact on Bitcoin. Not only will it make transactions more efficient and expand the largest cryptocurrency’s utility, but it will also create a new wave of Bitcoin-themed meme coins that will further boost demand for Bitcoin itself. The project’s bold premise has unsurprisingly captured the attention of investors. It has already raised over $26.9M, easily making it one of this year’s best crypto presales . You can join in the fun too when you buy $HYPER tokens for only $0.013255 each. Doing so will also provide you with additional benefits, including governance rights, as well as access to exclusive features on the L2. Staking is another option, for which you’ll get 43% APY in staking rewards. Learn how to buy $HYPER tokens with our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide . But hurry because there’s another price increase happening in a few hours from now. To lock in your tokens, go to the official Bitcoin Hyper presale website right now. Get your $HYPER tokens here. 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) — Deep Liquidity, Headline Beta, Exchange Access If you want a listed meme coin with real depth, Official Trump ($TRUMP) fits the bill. With a market cap north of $1.5B with a price around the high-$7s, plus its namesake still making headlines day in and day out, it’s a coin you simply cannot ignore. It also helps that it’s widely available in major exchanges like Binance and OKX. That translates to tighter spreads and deeper books, allowing you to trade with more confidence, even during periods of high volatility, such as the one we’re currently experiencing. On Monday, for example, $TRUMP nearly hit $9.50 after a US government shutdown resolution led to a brief spike in the value of politically themed tokens. While it’s trading around $7 at the moment, it’s still up by nearly 25% over the past 30 days. Given the fact of its sensitivity to political headlines, we can’t entirely discount $TRUMP’s potential to go even higher. This can be especially true once the US government shutdown ends before the end of the year. The appeal here is straightforward. In a ‘Santa rally’ scenario, majors may lift first, then meme liquidity thickens. A token like $TRUMP with a large centralized exchange presence can become the default high-beta outlet for momentum traders who want to scale size without slippage-hell. Of course, political memes amplify event risk and mood swings; that’s part of the draw and the hazard. For traders calibrating exposure, this is the ‘liquid beta’ slot that complements higher-risk presales. Learn more about $TRUMP. Recap: With the year coming to a close, seasonality is back in the conversation, with multiple outlets flagging Bitcoin’s tendency to end December higher. If flows rotate into risk, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are well-positioned to capitalize on the situation. With millions of dollars raised in their respective presales, the sign that there’s still strong demand for meme coins can’t be any clearer.

Key Takeaways: Morgan Stanley warns Bitcoin has entered its “fall season,” advising investors to take profits before a potential crypto winter. Bitcoin’s drop below its 365-day moving average and stalled liquidity inflows signal weakening market momentum. Despite near-term caution, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong. The bank’s wealth management team is advising investors to take profits while prices remain elevated, warning that a potential “crypto winter” could follow. Morgan Stanley Strategist Says Bitcoin Entering ‘Fall Season,’ Time to Take Profits Speaking on the Crypto Goes Mainstream podcast , Denny Galindo, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said Bitcoin’s historical performance follows a repeating “three-up, one-down” pattern. “We are in the fall season right now,” Galindo explained. “Fall is the time for harvest — it’s when you want to take your gains. The question is how long this fall will last and when the next winter will start.” The comments come as Bitcoin’s price momentum softens. On Nov. 5, Bitcoin fell below $99,000, breaking under its 365-day moving average, a key technical support level used by traders to gauge long-term sentiment. CryptoQuant’s head of research Julio Moreno noted that the drop signaled a shift in market tone, while Bitrue analyst Andri Fauzan Adziima called it “a confirmation of a technical bear market.” The significance of Bitcoin losing the 365-day MA: It was the final confirmation to the start of the 2022 bear market. The price needs to cross back above it quickly. pic.twitter.com/9ChB28Zl5g — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) November 4, 2025 Adding to the cautious sentiment, crypto market maker Wintermute said market liquidity has stalled, with inflows from stablecoins, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and digital asset treasuries plateauing. The firm noted that these three components have been the primary drivers of crypto market depth since early 2025, but recent months have shown declining activity. Despite near-term headwinds, institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow. Michael Cyprys, head of US brokers, asset managers, and exchanges at Morgan Stanley Research, said that large investors increasingly view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a potential hedge against inflation and currency debasement. “Some institutional investors view Bitcoin as a macro hedge,” Cyprys said, adding that ETFs have made access easier. However, he noted that institutional allocations move slowly due to regulatory processes and long-term mandates. According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold more than $137 billion in total assets, with Ether ETFs accounting for an additional $22.4 billion. Analysts say this growing institutional exposure could temper volatility even as the market enters its cyclical slowdown. Bitcoin Stuck Between $106K–$116K as Long-Term Holders Dump and Volatility Fades Bitcoin’s typical November rally looks increasingly unlikely this year , as the market faces persistent selling pressure from long-term holders and fading institutional demand. The asset has been locked in a narrow range between $106,000 and $116,000 for two weeks following October’s sharp sell-off, signaling investor hesitation and a broader consolidation phase. Bitfinex’s latest market report shows that long-term holders have ramped up distribution to 104,000 BTC per month, the most aggressive selling since mid-July. Analysts warn that unless ETF inflows or new spot demand pick up, Bitcoin may remain range-bound, with downside risk toward $106,000 or even $100,000.

UNI price spiked by more than 70% in the last seven days as traders piled into the decentralized exchange’s ambitious governance plans. The surge comes amid a proposal to burn 100 million tokens and redirect protocol revenues to fund ongoing buybacks. This move is expected to transform Uniswap into a yield-generating ecosystem for holders. However, the UNI price jump helped it decouple from the sell sentiment hovering in the crypto market. Bitcoin price has dipped by almost 10% over the last 7 days. Uniswap whale activity hits 4-year high As per the data shared by Santiment, daily whale transactions have hit a 4-year high for UNI. This was coupled with the highest amount of new Uniswap wallets created in 3 years. It added that the retail FOMO is high at the moment. Meanwhile, it also projected another wave of rallies after the euphoria dies down. That spike would be based on the positive fundamental news and improved governance for the project. 🦄 Uniswap's price is +70% over the past week with the project's new fee proposal to burn 100M tokens as part of an initiative to redirect protocol revenues to token burns, and new feature launches to enhance liquidity provider rewards. 🐳 A 4-year high in daily whale… pic.twitter.com/XdfJvDmPQ9 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 11, 2025 On-chain data supports the hype. It has been reported that two wallets, likely controlled by a single whale, deposited 1.7 million UNI (worth $15 million) into Binance within hours of each other. Separately, two wallets linked to Uniswap moved 8.2 million UNI (worth $77 million) to Coinbase Prime. These tokens were originally released to early investors five years ago. UNI price has jumped by another 5% in the past 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $8.54 at press time. Uniswap is still down by 81% from its all-time high of $44.97, recorded on May 3, 2021. Its 24-hour trading dumped by 46% to stand at $1.79 billion. Uniswap eyes $650M volume with ‘UNIfication’ Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation unveiled their plan dubbed “ UNIfication ” last Monday. It seeks to activate long-discussed protocol fees on the platform with an aim to push it to $650 million in daily trading volume. The platform will use the proceeds for a perpetual token burn, too. If passed, the proposal would retroactively burn around 100 million UNI tokens from the treasury, pegged to fees generated since Uniswap’s inception. An expert highlighted that Uniswap has generated over a billion dollars in annual fees since 2018, but none of that value has flowed to tokenholders. Hopefully, this proposal finally closes that loop . Uniswap founder Hayden Adams sees the new plan as a reset moment for protocol governance. He stated that for the past five years, Labs has been unable to meaningfully participate in Uniswap governance, and “That ends today.” Crypto attorney Jake Chervinsky, in a post , stated that the Uniswap proposal isn’t the end of the decentralized DAO model, but it’s the next generation. He highlighted that tokens like UNI can provide holders with real ownership of on-chain infrastructure and cash flows. This can go on without asking them to design and vote on every single change and improvement in the project. He added that it’s not the same vision that many had five years ago, when DAO members were considered daily active managers of protocol development.

Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said the U.K. faces a “different set of risks” from the United States as it integrates stablecoins into its financial system. “We have to manage those carefully as we bring in this new form of money,” she told Reuters on Tuesday. The comments followed the bank’s release of a long-awaited consultation outlining a regulatory framework for systemic stablecoins, tokens expected to be widely used for payments. Bank of England proposes £20,000 individual limit on systemic stablecoin holdings to manage transition risks, but faces pushback from crypto industry over restrictive approach. #England #UK #Stablecoin https://t.co/4unfE0HurD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 10, 2025 The plan includes temporary holding caps of £20,000 ($26,000) for individuals and £10 million ($13 million) for firms, alongside a requirement for issuers to keep 40% of their reserves at the central bank in non-interest-bearing accounts. Will the U.K.’s Stablecoin Limits Prevent a Credit Crunch — or Create One? Breeden said the measure is designed to reduce stress on banks from deposit outflows into stablecoins. “Look at what happened with SVB and Circle; those numbers are broadly in line with that,” she said, referring to USDC’s depeg in 2023 after $3.3 billion of its reserves were trapped at Silicon Valley Bank. Officials fear that large-scale transfers of deposits from commercial banks into stablecoins could weaken banks’ lending capacity, leading to a credit crunch that could raise borrowing costs and slow growth. Governor Andrew Bailey recently warned that such outflows could cause “a precipitous drop in credit for businesses and households.” The proposed limits mark a softer stance than the Bank’s 2023 plan, which would have required stablecoin issuers to hold all reserves at the BoE. Still, the crypto industry says the current version remains overly restrictive. Bank of England Governor says stablecoins could reduce UK reliance on commercial banks while proposing controversial ownership caps. #UK #Stablecoin https://t.co/TW5EGT8a6O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 Coinbase executive Tom Duff Gordon called the limits “bad for UK savers, bad for the City, and bad for sterling,” adding that “no other major jurisdiction has deemed caps necessary.” Industry groups also questioned how such limits could be enforced without real-time tracking or digital ID systems. Simon Jennings, head of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, said, “Limits simply don’t work in practice.” The Bank’s consultation comes as the U.K. seeks to keep pace with U.S . developments. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act , establishing a federal stablecoin regime without ownership caps. Breeden said Britain is “moving just as quickly” and expects to finalize its framework in 2026. UK Eyes Global Stablecoin Leadership with New BoE-FCA Oversight Blueprint Under the U.K.’s dual-tier system, the BoE will oversee systemic payment stablecoins, while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulates non-systemic ones used mainly in trading. Issuers will be required to deposit part of their reserves with the central bank, earning returns on the remainder through short-term government securities. The initiative reflects growing government interest in blockchain modernization. In September, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent agreed to deepen transatlantic cooperation on crypto oversight . The UK and US have launched the Transatlantic Crypto Task Force to coordinate digital asset regulation and capital markets policy. #Crypto #UK #US https://t.co/3oVXOws8mq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 22, 2025 London has also launched a Digital Securities Sandbox , where firms including HSBC, J.P. Morgan, and the London Stock Exchange Group plan to issue regulated stablecoins and digital gilts. However, disagreements persist between the Bank and Treasury over how strict the rules should be. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the BoE’s proposed limits “frankly ridiculous,” pledging to cut crypto capital gains tax to 10% and establish a £5 billion Bitcoin reserve if elected. The global stablecoin market has now surpassed $312 billion , dominated by dollar-backed tokens from Tether and Circle, while sterling-based stablecoins remain under £600,000 in circulation.

The central bank is no longer a passive observer. As Taiwan’s legislature debates stablecoin governance, the central bank has called for a licensing role in the Financial Service Commission’s (FSC) draft Virtual Asset Services Act (VASA) in order to determine risks to foreign exchange and payment system rules. The draft act, led by the FSC, is Taiwan’s first dedicated effort to supervise digital assets businesses. The legislation will cover Taiwan dollar (TWD) and USD pegged stablecoin issuance. It is currently under review by the Executive Yuan – Taiwan’s highest administrative body. Several local banks are preparing for a regulated stablecoin era. O-Bank has expressed interest in launching a Taiwan dollar pegged coin. Meanwhile, KGI Bank signed a memorandum with Tether in October, to build token-enabled cross-border finance applications. Cathay United Bank is also exploring stablecoin issuance, pending regulatory clarity. Yet, within Taiwan’s digital asset community, the worry isn’t compliance – its relevance. “Exchanges are asking where a Taiwan issued stablecoin product is going to fit in the market,” said Charlie Chen, Secretary of Taiwan’s Virtual Asset Anti-Money Laundering Association (TVA3) and Chainvestigate, a crypto data analysis firm. “If the issuer can’t find a sustainable business model, it won’t matter how safe it is.” Intense international pressure Stablecoins are no longer a concept of the future. They are already a part of today’s financial reality. A Taiwan’s trade survey in October found that almost 5% of importers and exporters in the territory are using USD stablecoins. The uptake rate surprised James Lee, a senior advisor at the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) who initially estimated 0.5 percent. He argues that the data underscores the continuing and unrivaled dominance of USD stablecoins . “USD stablecoins will wipe out probably half of national currencies in 10 to 20 years. It will probably destroy quite a lot of the traditional banks if they don’t understand what they’re doing. So this is an opportunity, but it’s also a risk” The dilemma of minting a Taiwan dollar stablecoin Taiwan’s ambition to bring stablecoins under formal regulation now carries added complexity as issuers explore a Taiwan dollar and USD pegged stablecoin. But Lee warns against both ideas. He said Taiwan should be cautious due to the lack of scalability and the low interest return of roughly 1% on reserves compared to 4% in the U.S. “Why would somebody use a less well known stablecoin that is in USD, let alone a Taiwan dollar pegged stablecoin when they can use USDC and USDT for zero switching costs? It is very difficult for latecomers to compete with these aside from very niche players.” Lee argues that Taiwan should focus on the existing success of the USD stablecoin system and research how to build on that. He explained USD stablecoin works not because they need to trade with the U.S, but because they can trade among themselves and also with the virtual world. “Taiwanese companies need any edge they can get when they compete internationally. USD stablecoins in international trade will give them some edge.” Ongoing AML gaps The draft act, currently pending review, excludes AML provisions based on the belief that Taiwan’s 2024 Money Laundering Control Act already tightened oversight. The AML amendment severely reduced the number of digital asset exchanges from as many as 30 to nine. The FSC ordered 18 firms to cease operations until they pass the registration requirements. But the crypto Travel Rule which would compel exchanges to share cross border sender and recipient transfer details, has yet to take effect. Cross border crypto scams escalate Chen said the more immediate risk isn’t regulatory ambiguity but the rise in crypto-related scams and fraud. “Scams are happening everywhere in Taiwan,” he said. “From the regulator’s perspective, it’s not only a money laundering concern but a threat to investor confidence.” The cyberattack on Taiwan-based exchange BitoPro in May 2025 is a prime example which led to $11.5 million being stolen from hot wallets. “From my personal experience, when I help analyze where Taiwanese victims’ funds went, they always go to international exchanges,” Chen said. Once money is moved offshore authorities have little recourse. “If they’re not within our legal framework, law enforcement can only ask them if they’re willing to help,” Chen said. “It’s all voluntary. There’s no legal binding requirement.” Angela Ang, Head of APAC Policy at blockchain intelligence platform TRM Labs said it’s very difficult for governments to stop citizens from registering with an exchange that isn’t licensed in your jurisdiction. “Let’s say they were contacted by someone on a scam call, they were taught how to onramp their money to an offshore exchange. That is not something that you can stop by regulating exchanges.” But she said regulating the local digital asset ecosystem can still help. “If you want to move local currency, like fiat proceeds into an offshore exchange, at the end of the day you still need to have a local presence in order to on-ramp.” Quality design over pace James Lee, senior advisor at the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) believes tighter rules are almost always the better option as long as it’s smartly designed. But he stressed the best approach regulators can take is considering stablecoins as an issue beyond the scope of traditional regulatory bodies. “I think it is important to first understand what stablecoins are exactly. Then it needs to be examined from the point of national interest, not just currency. It’s not just about imports and exports or the financial sector. From that I think every country will be able to come up with different strategies.” Looking ahead Charlie Chen from Taiwan’s Virtual Asset Anti-Money Laundering Association (TVA3) & Chainvestigate, said Taiwan-dollar stablecoins might be able to reach pilot phase within the next two years. “It will be cautious, but a very important step for us,” he said. Chen added he hopes the stablecoin will run on a public chain, like Ethereum , to ensure liquidity and global access. “Otherwise it would lose much of its purpose,” he said.

With nearly the entire reporting season wrapped up, around half of the companies have reported earnings that beat forecasts, forcing analysts to raise their guidance and rethink all that noise about tariffs, shaky currencies, and macro risks that never really hit the way people thought they would. Low interest rates, tighter cost structures, higher prices, and a slowly recovering economy all played into the beats. The Stoxx Europe 600 is now up 14% year-to-date. Banks came out on top, jumping 55% so far in 2025. Energy companies also came through, even if their revenue came in lighter than expected. Refining margins carried them over the line. And the outlook is getting hotter. Guidance for 2026 earnings is now projected to climb by 11%, and 12% for 2027, not too far off from the S&P 500’s 12% and 14% projections. Banks, energy, and autos drive recovery Guillaume Jaisson, who leads the strategy team at Goldman Sachs, said, “The earnings season continues to deliver,” adding that most of the guidance has been confirmed and forecasts are now either holding up or moving higher. So much for that analyst caution. While stocks in Europe are starting to look more expensive, they’re still nowhere near overheated. The average forward price-to-earnings ratio hit 15, the highest it’s been in about four years. But that’s still well below the post-pandemic peak. On top of that, the Stoxx 600 is trading at a 35% discount to the S&P 500. Banks and energy were the earnings anchors this quarter. Net interest income held up well, and banks didn’t have to swallow big losses on loans. Meanwhile, energy names got help from better refining margins, even as oil prices stayed soft. Philip Richards, senior analyst at BI, said the bank sector had roughly a ten-to-one beat-to-miss ratio. Barclays, NatWest, HSBC, and Standard Chartered all posted stronger-than-expected earnings. The sector’s current earnings upgrade cycle, which started five years ago, looks like it’s going to keep rolling right through 2026. The energy side saw Shell, BP, and Eni post better-than-expected bottom lines. BP beat expectations on Q3 profit, giving its turnaround story a bit of a boost. The automotive sector (the one that’s been dragging for more than a year) finally showed a flicker of life. Profit warnings were the norm for five straight quarters, but this time around, the sector managed a positive surprise. Analysts gave credit to cost-cutting and restructuring plans, which helped improve margins and led to upgraded profit estimates. But let’s be clear: profits still fell year-on-year and sequentially. The surprise just means things didn’t fall off a cliff. AI reshapes operations, management stays optimistic Meanwhile, AI was everywhere in Europe’s Q3 earnings calls, with mentions hitting a record high, as firms across Europe are leaning into automation and efficiency gains. Laurent Douillet and Kaidi Meng, both strategists at BI, said , “AI is no longer a niche theme, but a key driver of productivity and profitability as 2026 beckons.” Tech firms, of course, did most of the talking, but banks weren’t silent. Banco Santander’s CEO, Hector Grisi, said they’re using AI to automate and cut down on manual work. ING Groep in the Netherlands estimated that 950 jobs could be eliminated by the end of 2026 due to the shift to digital lending. Consumer discretionary and energy companies also mentioned using AI for personalization, automation, and managing risk. Even the mood among executives has turned around. Management sentiment is now almost back to 2021 levels. Macro worries? Shrinking. That confidence is feeding back into forecasts, with Maximilian Uleer, who heads equity and cross-asset strategy at Deutsche Bank, predicting even more earnings upgrades.

As the cryptocurrency continued to struggle in posting a meaningful recovery, whale activity has notably picked up. This cohort has sent more than 19,500 BTC to Binance between October 12 and November 3. The stash is worth roughly $2 billion. What’s perhaps even more worrying that miners have followed suit. BTC Whales Flood Binance In its latest findings, CryptoQuant noted that while whale inflows to Binance had been sporadic in previous months, the recent surge is a clear behavioral shift that has added to the selling pressure weighing on Bitcoin’s price. The analysis focuses on transactions exceeding 1,000 BTC, a threshold used to track institutional or large-scale whale movements. When such inflows surpass the 90-day average by a wide margin, it points to a significant change in market pattern. This recent cluster of large transfers coincides with the market’s struggle to maintain momentum amid increased profit-taking by major holders. However, the analytics platform observed that in the past week, whale inflows have slowed, which means that the most intense phase of selling pressure may have already been absorbed. Beyond short-term whale movements, external factors such as continued macroeconomic pressures, cautious Fed policy signals, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty are adding another layer of resistance to BTC’s recovery. Fresh data identified a major resistance zone between $107,000 and $118,000, where long-term holders (LTHs) have been increasing exchange inflows and taking profits, which has effectively capped upward momentum. With the LTH-SOPR metric dropping to around 1.6, experts say that conviction among long-term investors appears to be fading. Miner Activity Surges Miner-related Bitcoin flows to Binance have also accelerated sharply in the fourth quarter. Data shows that more than 71,000 BTC, worth over $7 billion at an average price of around $104,000, has been transferred to Binance since the start of November. This uptick is one of the strongest periods of miner exchange activity this year. October had already seen massive miner transfers of more than 200,000 BTC, a level that aligns with the seasonal pattern of financial rebalancing typically observed before year-end. Miners appear to be changing their holding and selling patterns amidst BTC’s consolidation as well as the decline in mining rewards following the latest network difficulty adjustment. While rising exchange deposits can sometimes hint at potential selling pressure, CryptoQuant noted that these movements appear more aligned with miners securing operational liquidity, such as covering costs for energy, maintenance, and potential hardware upgrades, rather than aggressive profit-taking. “This trend reflects a healthy balance within the mining environment, where large institutions maintain a steady flow of profits without exerting negative pressure on the market. The recent spike in Bitcoin transfers to Binance may also point to a shift toward more flexible liquidity management strategies, particularly amid rising trading volumes in futures and derivatives markets.” The post Bitcoin Whales and Miners Are Moving Massive Sums: What Does This Mean for BTC’s Price? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Mining|Bitcoin Whales,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-12 11:53:41

Institutional hesitation and supply concerns could slow Bitcoin’s momentum and redirect capital flows toward emerging alternative plays. As traders chase volatility and culture-driven tokens, $MAXI delivers meme-fueled upside, a scarcity narrative, and powerful social momentum. With attention shifting from macro headlines to community assets, $MAXI is positioned to stand out as one of 2025’s breakout altcoins. Part of crypto’s original vision was as a neutral financial frontier; borderless, permissionless, and beyond the reach of politics. However, market-changing assets tend to draw drama, and the latest accusation in a report by the Chinese National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) shows that digital assets are becoming a new battleground in global power politics. China alleges that the US government orchestrated the theft of 127.272K $BTC back in 2020, then worth roughly $2.1B but now valued around $13B, from the LuBian mining pool . The report describes the incident as a ‘state-level hacking operation,’ involving sophisticated digital infiltration and the eventual movement of funds through hard-to-trace channels. The CVERC claims this wasn’t just a rogue cybercrime, but a deliberate act by US intelligence agencies. Washington has yet to respond, but analysts note that the mere existence of such a claim, made through official Chinese channels, is significant. It reflects an escalating digital arms race, where crypto assets are no longer just speculative instruments but geopolitical assets. Markets respond less to truth than to perception, and the perception of a $13B Bitcoin theft at state level could ripple across investor sentiment. And we’ve seen this rotation before. When central banks or governments clash over Bitcoin policy, traders often pivot into smaller coins that represent independence, rebellion, and cultural resonance. The US stealing Bitcoin from China could mark a major shift, but it’s the kind of crazy move some meme coins admire. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is just such a coin. The ‘state-level Bitcoin hack’ allegation may become 2025’s equivalent trigger for another round of volatility where culture beats compliance. And tokens like $MAXI could benefit from being unapologetically crypto-native. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – A New Big Dog Rules the Meme Coin Market Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a next-generation meme coin that maximizes viral community culture. Inspired by the spirit of Bitcoin maximalism and the success of Dogecoin, $MAXI positions itself as a culture coin for a new wave of retail investors who value transparency, engagement, and high-energy growth potential. Whoever it was that snagged the 127K $BTC back in 2020, they had the right idea as far as $MAXI is concerned: go big or go home. Maxi Doge’s message is simple – lift hard, trade hard, and ride $MAXI to the top of the $36.1B dog-themed meme market . Discover more about Maxi Doge in our $MAXI review . $MAXI pours 40% of its token supply into marketing, and for good reason; to give $MAXI the best chance at beating $DOGE and winning over the meme coin market, becoming one of the best altcoins in the process. The tokenomics also features a dedicated ‘Maxi Fund’ aimed at pushing $MAXI over the top with the best marketing opportunities. With Maxi, the vibe is all about pumping up trades and pumping up potential wins. $MAXI is currently priced at $0.0002675, and you can stake your tokens for 77% APY. By the way, our Maxi Doge price prediction believes this token has the potential to reach $0.0058 by the end of 2026. Thinking of joining in? Check out our guide to buying $MAXI . With $MAXI’s vision to rule the market, and with geopolitical tensions swirling around Bitcoin, now might be the perfect opening for Maxi Doge and its $3.9M+ presale. Besides, $MAXI trades not just on price, but on identity: being part of a digital tribe that embraces maximalism with a wink. The result? A high-conviction community asset that flourishes in precisely the kind of narrative chaos that traditional assets can’t stomach. Crypto thrives on stories, and few stories are bigger than the allegation that one superpower stole billions in Bitcoin from another. And whenever Bitcoin becomes a weapon, the top meme coins become the celebration; a rebellion against the seriousness, complexity, and control that institutions bring. That right there is where $MAXI fits the bill. Join the Maxi Doge presale before tomorrow’s price hike.

Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung told reporters on Wednesday in Taipei that the government is looking at all possible responses when other countries threaten Taiwan’s interests. “Of course, we hope not to have to use these measures, but if our counterparts harm our interests, we will need to respond,” Lin said. “This is indeed among the options under assessment, though that does not necessarily mean they will all be implemented.” When Lin was pressed to name which countries might be affected, he didn’t bite. He avoided confirming whether it was South Africa or someone else. What he did insist on was that Taiwan “doesn’t want to weaponize semiconductors.” Still, the context makes it obvious. In September last year, Taiwan announced export controls on South Africa, blaming the country for moves that, in Taipei’s words, “undermined our national and public security.” Two days later, the restrictions were lifted , suggesting hesitation inside Taiwan’s leadership about turning its most strategic tech asset into a foreign policy weapon. Taiwan triggered chip sanctions over South Africa dispute The conflict tracks back to a deepening diplomatic rift between Taiwan and South Africa, which cut formal ties with the island in the 1990s. Tensions resurfaced some time in 2023 when Taiwan accused South Africa of trying to downgrade its diplomatic presence. Specifically, Pretoria pushed Taiwan to move its Liaison Office from the capital to Johannesburg, a city considered the country’s commercial hub. And interestingly, that decision coincided with a BRICS summit hosted by South Africa and, of course attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping. As South Africa prepares to host the G20 leaders’ summit this month, with Xi once again expected to show up, the pressure on Taiwan has increased. In response, Taipei briefly pulled the trigger on chip controls. It was the first time Taiwan had ever unilaterally blocked chip exports to another country. But even with a more hardline tone under President Lai Ching-te, officials walked it back fast, probably worried about hurting companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which plays a critical role in global AI chip supply chains. And there’s no avoiding the elephant in the room, China, which remains one of Taiwan’s top chip buyers and is highly sensitive to any hint of semiconductor restrictions. Taiwan faces pressure from China, the U.S., and global markets Lai, who took office promising a firmer stance against Beijing, is now balancing a growing list of problems. While his administration has challenged China’s aggression more openly than any of his predecessors, not everyone at home is cheering. A good chunk of the public wants the government to focus on bread-and-butter issues instead of cross-strait drama. Things got more complicated in July, when the United States slapped a 20% tariff on Taiwanese goods, putting the island at a disadvantage compared to Japan and South Korea. That stung. Then in August, Lai reshuffled his cabinet for the first time since taking office, trying to calm political headwinds. And last week, Washington threw another curveball. The Trump administration, now back in the White House, reportedly blocked a $400 million military aid package to Taiwan, just as Trump was working on a broader trade deal with Beijing. The timing didn’t go unnoticed in Taipei.

The foundation’s recent announcement reveals a bold dYdX buyback proposal that would direct 75% of all protocol revenue toward repurchasing DYDX tokens from the open market. This strategic move represents one of the most significant treasury management decisions in DeFi history. What does the dYdX buyback proposal actually mean? The dYdX buyback initiative isn’t just another governance proposal – it’s a fundamental shift in how the protocol manages its substantial revenue streams. Under this plan, three-quarters of all fees generated by the platform would automatically flow into a dedicated buyback program. This creates a powerful mechanism where increased platform usage directly translates to token demand. Here’s how the revenue allocation breaks down: 75% for buybacks – Creating constant buying pressure 5% to Treasury subDAO – Funding ecosystem development 5% to Megavault – Supporting staking rewards Why is this dYdX buyback vote so crucial for token holders? The timing and scale of this dYdX buyback proposal make it particularly significant. With voting concluding on July 13 at 12:20 p.m. UTC, the community has a limited window to shape the protocol’s financial future. This isn’t just about short-term price action – it’s about establishing sustainable tokenomics that reward long-term holders. Successful implementation of the dYdX buyback program could create several key benefits: Reduced circulating supply over time Increased token scarcity and value Stronger alignment between protocol success and token appreciation Enhanced confidence from institutional investors How does the dYdX buyback compare to traditional corporate buybacks? While the concept of buybacks isn’t new in traditional finance, the dYdX buyback approach brings unique advantages to the decentralized world. Unlike corporate share repurchases that primarily benefit executives and large shareholders, the dYdX buyback program operates through transparent, on-chain mechanisms that benefit all token holders proportionally. The beauty of this dYdX buyback strategy lies in its automation and transparency. Every trade on the platform contributes to the buyback fund, creating a virtuous cycle where platform growth fuels token demand. This represents a revolutionary approach to value distribution in decentralized ecosystems. What challenges could the dYdX buyback program face? Despite the exciting potential, the dYdX buyback proposal isn’t without potential hurdles. Governance participation rates, market volatility, and regulatory considerations all play roles in determining the program’s success. However, the structured approach – with clear allocations to both buybacks and ecosystem development – shows thoughtful planning. The 5% allocation to the Treasury subDAO ensures continued protocol development, while the Megavault allocation maintains staking incentives. This balanced approach addresses multiple ecosystem needs simultaneously, making the dYdX buyback proposal more sustainable than simple redistribution models. Conclusion: A defining moment for decentralized governance The dYdX buyback vote represents more than just a financial decision – it’s a test case for sophisticated treasury management in DeFi. If successful, this model could set new standards for how decentralized protocols manage their resources and create value for token holders. The outcome on July 13 could influence similar decisions across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions When does the dYdX buyback vote conclude? Voting ends at 12:20 p.m. UTC on July 13, giving the community limited time to participate in this crucial decision. What percentage of revenue goes to the buyback program? The proposal allocates 75% of protocol revenue to buybacks, with 5% each going to the Treasury subDAO and Megavault. How will the dYdX buyback affect token price? While no guarantees exist, buybacks typically create buying pressure and reduce circulating supply, potentially supporting token value over time. Can regular users participate in the governance vote? Yes, any DYDX token holder can participate in the governance process through the official dYdX governance portal. What happens if the dYdX buyback proposal fails? If rejected, the current revenue distribution model continues unless the community proposes and passes an alternative arrangement. How often will buybacks occur under this program? The proposal suggests continuous buybacks as revenue accumulates, though specific implementation details may vary based on market conditions. Found this analysis of the dYdX buyback proposal helpful?

Such a sharp correction could now be over as $ETH rallies from the convergence of trendlines and horizontal support. Could this be the start of something much bigger? $ETH bounces from 3 converging trendlines Source: TradingView The $ETH price is currently bouncing from the convergence of a major trendline plus two smaller ones. When you have this much convergence the impetus from the bounce is going to be that much stronger, and as can be seen in the 4-hour chart above, this is certainly the case so far. The first target is the $3,680 horizontal resistance level. This will also mean a higher high. The following targets of $3,900 and then $4,250 would take out the next two highs, with the big psychological $4,000 level sandwiched in between. According to the Stochastic RSI indicators for the 4-hour time frame, there is plenty of gas in the tank to reach the first of these targets at the very least. $ETH breakout could be imminent Source: TradingView The daily time frame chart shows that the current bounce is confirming the break-back above the major descending trendline. The resistance at $3,680 and the descending trendline are the major part of what needs to be overcome by the bulls from here. At the bottom of the chart, a descending trendline in the RSI stretches right back into mid-July. So far the indicator line has respected this trend. However, after another bounce from the 20.00 level, the indicator line is not far from the downtrend line again. If it breaks through, this is likely to coincide with a breakout of the descending trend in the price action. Bullish weekly time frame gives possible target of $7,000 Source: TradingView The weekly chart does not look bad either for $ETH . Bears might point to the fact that the price is currently underneath the major ascending trendline, but will it still be there at the end of the week? Look at the size of the candle wick for the previous week. A big pattern has emerged now of a falling wedge. When/if the price touches the top of the wedge that will be the third touch that can confirm it as a pattern. Falling wedge patterns would normally break to the upside. One could also draw in a parallel line instead, and make this a bull flag. Either way, these are bullish. To top it all, as is the case for Bitcoin and much of crypto, the Stochastic RSI indicators have hit the bottom. Once they cross back up and head through the 20.00 level, big upside price momentum should be signalled. Around $7,000 is a final bull rally target.

The cryptocurrency landscape is shifting dramatically as Bitcoin selling pressure shows significant easing, creating exciting opportunities for investors. According to recent analysis, this reduction in selling pressure could pave the way for a remarkable rally toward $124,000. Why Is Bitcoin Selling Pressure Decreasing Now? The current market conditions reveal several positive indicators. The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) has dropped to levels not seen since previous market bottoms. This crucial metric suggests that stablecoin liquidity is accumulating, which typically signals preparation for a major bullish phase. Moreover, exchange data shows stablecoin reserves increasing while Bitcoin reserves decline, indicating that BTC is moving from short-term to long-term holders. What Technical Factors Support the $124K Bitcoin Target? From a technical perspective, Bitcoin faces a critical resistance level at $107,000. This represents the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern. The analysis suggests that a daily close above this level could halt the current downtrend and initiate the path toward $124,000. The reduced Bitcoin selling pressure combined with these technical factors creates a compelling bullish scenario. Key technical indicators to watch include: Daily closing prices above $107,000 resistance Falling wedge pattern breakout confirmation Volume trends supporting upward momentum Reduced exchange reserves indicating decreased Bitcoin selling pressure How Do On-Chain Metrics Confirm Reduced Selling Pressure? On-chain data provides concrete evidence of diminishing Bitcoin selling pressure. The SSR ratio decline mirrors patterns observed during historical market bottoms, suggesting we might be approaching a significant turning point. Additionally, the movement of Bitcoin from exchange wallets to long-term storage indicates that investors are adopting a hold strategy rather than seeking immediate profits. Critical on-chain signals include: Stablecoin Supply Ratio at multi-year lows Declining Bitcoin exchange reserves Increasing stablecoin liquidity on major exchanges Reduced net outflow from miner wallets What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? The combination of reduced Bitcoin selling pressure and improving technical indicators creates an optimistic outlook. However, investors should remain cautious and monitor key resistance levels. The $107,000 barrier represents a crucial test for Bitcoin’s momentum. A successful breakout could validate the $124,000 target, while failure to overcome this resistance might extend consolidation periods. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Path Forward Amid Changing Market Dynamics The current market analysis presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s potential upward movement. With Bitcoin selling pressure easing across multiple metrics and technical patterns suggesting bullish breakouts, the $124,000 target appears increasingly plausible. While market conditions remain dynamic, the convergence of positive on-chain data and technical indicators provides solid foundation for optimistic projections. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin selling pressure? Bitcoin selling pressure refers to the amount of BTC being sold in the market, which typically drives prices downward when excessive. Current data shows this pressure is decreasing significantly. How does reduced selling pressure affect Bitcoin price? When Bitcoin selling pressure decreases, it creates favorable conditions for price appreciation as buying demand can more easily overcome available supply. What is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR)? The SSR measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s market cap and the stablecoin supply. Lower SSR values indicate more stablecoin buying power available for Bitcoin purchases. How reliable is the $124,000 price target? While no price target is guaranteed, the $124,000 projection is based on multiple converging factors including technical analysis, on-chain data, and historical pattern recognition. What are the key resistance levels to watch? The $107,000 level represents the immediate critical resistance. A daily close above this price could confirm the bullish outlook and open path toward higher targets. How long might it take to reach $124,000? Timing depends on market conditions, but analysts suggest this target could be achieved within the current market cycle if bullish factors continue to strengthen. Found this analysis helpful?

According to the country’s Ministry of Finance, Russia’s CBDC program began in 2021 and was formalized through a legislative change two years later. Speaking to reporters in a press briefing, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy and Communications Anton Tkachev said workers and employers still have the right to choose between cash and crypto payments. “Receiving salaries in digital rubles is an additional opportunity for people. They can decide for themselves how to receive their wages,” Tkachev told several local news publications. He explained that introducing the state-backed digital currency gradually could create a “digital divide” among citizens with different levels of proficiency in digital instruments. Tkachev suggested implementing programs to improve digital literacy, creating competence centers, and developing educational initiatives. “Constant and comprehensive outreach work will help us teach how to use the digital ruble and make digital currency education a priority in the eyes of citizens,” he surmised. Digital ruble pilot payments had been issued in September The Russian Ministry of Finance reported in mid-September that the Russian Treasury had made the first wage payment in digital rubles to the chairman of the State Duma Finance Committee, Anatoly Aksakov. Aksakov spent the funds on restaurant bills and charitable donations to test the currency’s real-world functionality. Russia’s central bank officials will allow transactions between digital ruble accounts starting January 2026, although recipients can choose whether or not to accept payments in the digital currency. The full public launch is scheduled for September 1, 2026, after phased trials on government transfers, commercial transactions, and payments in transport and real estate. Still, the digital ruble’s reach will not extend to pensioners, after authorities have confirmed payments to retirees will not be converted into the CBDC. Yaroslav Nilov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Labor and Social Policy, said Russian pensioners will continue to receive funds via cash or bank cards. Central Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina supported Nilov’s sentiments, adding that the digital ruble is voluntary for state employees. “The Bank of Russia is not yet a participant in this pilot, but it will become one in the near future, and our employees will be able to voluntarily join this pilot. When the digital ruble becomes available to everyone, citizens can make that decision.” Smart contracts and regional testing programs The digital ruble has also been tested in regional projects by Ak Bars Bank, in partnership with the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance of Tatarstan. The bank’s pilot program transferred subsidies from the republican budget using digital rubles. Tagir Karimov, first deputy chairman of Ak Bars Bank, presented the project at the Finopolis forum earlier this year. The pilot focused on a subsidy program supporting expenses for publishing the laws of the Republic of Tatarstan, under conditions defined by a smart contract. Karimov confirmed that all technical steps in the roadmap had been completed, and the smart contract functionality on the digital ruble platform had been implemented. “All work according to the roadmap has been completed. Ak Bars Bank is ready to use the digital ruble in the budget process,” Karimov reported to Nabiullina. But according to strategy director at Finam Investment Company and lecturer at the Higher School of Economics Yaroslav Kabakov, it’ll be years before the digital ruble becomes palatable for the public. “It is unlikely that the digital ruble will immediately become widespread, especially if participation remains voluntary, since many are used to cash or bank cards and will not want to move to some ‘new account’ and application,” Kabakov reckoned. Cryptopolitan had covered a recent survey by the online financial comparison service “Выберу.ру” (vbr.ru) and the Russian branch of IT Smart Finance, which found that about 10% of Russians are prepared to invest in crypto assets. Digital currency awareness among those surveyed was around 80%, but only a mere 3% to 5% of individuals aged 25 to 50 currently have crypto holdings on record.

This strategic decision comes alongside impressive financial results, with the company reporting $740 million in revenue from USDC reserves during the third quarter. The potential native token launch represents a significant evolution in Circle’s ecosystem strategy. Why is Circle Considering a Native Token? Circle’s exploration of a native token on Arc blockchain stems from several strategic advantages. The company aims to enhance its stablecoin ecosystem while creating new utility opportunities. A native token could potentially streamline transactions, reduce costs, and improve overall network efficiency. Moreover, this move aligns with Circle’s broader vision of building a comprehensive digital financial infrastructure. Understanding Arc Blockchain’s Unique Position Arc blockchain, specifically optimized for stablecoins, offers distinct benefits for Circle’s operations. The platform provides enhanced security features and improved transaction speeds compared to general-purpose blockchains. This specialization allows for better integration with Circle’s existing USDC stablecoin infrastructure. The blockchain’s design focuses on scalability and regulatory compliance, making it ideal for financial applications. What Benefits Could This Native Token Bring? The introduction of a native token presents multiple advantages for Circle and its users: Enhanced ecosystem integration between different Circle products Improved transaction efficiency across the Arc blockchain network New governance possibilities for token holders Additional revenue streams beyond stablecoin services How Does USDC Performance Impact This Decision? Circle’s substantial $740 million Q3 revenue from USDC reserves demonstrates the company’s strong market position. This financial success provides the resources needed to explore innovative projects like the native token. The robust performance of USDC indicates healthy demand for stablecoin services, creating a solid foundation for expanding into new token offerings. This financial stability reduces execution risks associated with launching a new native token. What Challenges Might Circle Face? Despite the potential benefits, Circle must navigate several challenges. Regulatory compliance remains a critical consideration for any new token launch. Market competition in the blockchain space continues to intensify, requiring Circle to differentiate its offering effectively. Additionally, the company must ensure seamless integration between the proposed native token and its existing USDC infrastructure to maintain user trust and operational efficiency. Future Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem Circle’s potential native token launch could significantly influence the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Success with this initiative might encourage other stablecoin providers to develop similar native tokens on specialized blockchains. The move could also accelerate institutional adoption of blockchain technology by demonstrating practical business applications. Furthermore, it represents another step toward maturing digital asset infrastructure that bridges traditional and decentralized finance. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution in Digital Assets Circle’s consideration of a native token on Arc blockchain marks an important development in the evolution of digital assets. The company’s strong financial performance with USDC provides a solid foundation for this expansion. While challenges exist, the potential benefits for ecosystem integration and new utility opportunities make this a compelling strategic direction. As Circle continues to innovate, the cryptocurrency community watches closely to see how this potential native token might reshape stablecoin infrastructure and digital asset services. Frequently Asked Questions What is a native token in blockchain? A native token is the primary cryptocurrency built directly into a blockchain’s protocol, used for transaction fees, governance, and network operations. How would Circle’s native token differ from USDC? While USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, a native token would serve different functions like network governance, transaction fees, and ecosystem incentives. When might Circle launch this native token? Circle is currently in the consideration phase, with no official launch timeline announced. The company is evaluating technical and regulatory requirements. How could this affect USDC users? Existing USDC users might benefit from improved ecosystem integration and potentially lower transaction costs, but current USDC functionality should remain unchanged. What makes Arc blockchain special for stablecoins? Arc blockchain is specifically optimized for stablecoin operations, offering enhanced security, regulatory compliance features, and improved transaction efficiency. Will the native token be available to retail investors? Details about token distribution haven’t been announced, but typically native tokens become available through various channels including exchanges and ecosystem participation.

A focused institutional move can quickly shift the landscape. And for XRP, that whispers-of-a-wave is gaining clear shape. According to analyst FeFe on X, a large-scale influx— on the order of $10 billion—into XRP-backed spot ETFs could trigger a dramatic squeeze. He argues it would require purchasing slightly over 4 billion XRP at current prices. That math already sets the stage for potential imbalance between demand and supply. Supply Constraints on Exchanges On-chain data show meaningful reductions in XRP holdings on major exchanges. Exchange reserves have dropped by around 3.36 % since early October, a historically bullish sign tied to accumulation rather than distribution. Tbh $47 per XRP is on the table this week if there is a Shane Ellis style XRP squeeze on the exchanges. If there is enough inflow for the ETFs, $10 billion, then they need to buy >4 billion at current price. Only $3B on exchanges and #xrpsqueeze #minimoon — FeFe (@fefe01101100) November 11, 2025 Further, industry dashboards estimate that wholesale XRP holdings on centralized exchanges were about 4.9 billion tokens—roughly 10 % of total supply as of mid-2024. With limited visible shopping inventory, any large institutional buy would rapidly push bids higher. The Squeeze Mechanism Explained FeFe’s scenario mirrors a classic “buy the scarce asset fast” setup. When ETFs launch, they must buy underlying assets. If they source from thin exchange order books rather than deep OTC markets, they risk driving up prices rapidly. The combination of institutional allocation rushing into a token with a diminishing exchange-accessible supply creates the squeeze. It’s this dynamic that supports FeFe’s $47-target claim. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Context XRP is currently trading at approximately $2.40. Analysts anticipate a spot XRP ETF launch , which would open regulated institutional access and could unlock large flows. At the same time, exchange reserves are falling, and technical indicators show signs of consolidation before a breakout. When you map these elements—thin supply, incoming demand, ETF launch trigger—the foundation makes sense. Risks and Caveats This scenario isn’t guaranteed. Timing matters. Institutional flows might trickle rather than surge, reducing shock. OTC liquidity may absorb parts of the higher demand. Macro headwinds, regulatory risk, or exchange-specific idiosyncrasies could stall the move. Notably, analysts caution that while ETF filings are active, fresh flows have yet to confirm magnitude. Final Thought If ETF money enters at speed and supply remains constricted, then $47 per XRP moves from headline to plausible outcome. As FeFe notes, the key is more than narrative—it’s the arithmetic of billions of dollars and billions of tokens. When the pieces align, a squeeze isn’t just possible—it becomes probable.

54307736,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=858878,1762949196,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54307736.jpeg,Finnish tax office to ramp up crypto transaction tracking to tackle under-reporting,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/finland-to-ramp-up-crypto-tracking/,"Taxation officials in Finland are planning to step up the tracking of cryptocurrency transactions in an effort to boost tax reporting rates among investors in the Nordic nation. Despite a record number of filed crypto tax returns this year, some 100,000 Finnish citizens have failed to declare income from coin trading last year, the country’s tax authority estimated. Finnish tax service to boost tracking of crypto transactions The Finnish Tax Administration (Verohallinto) will intensify the tracking of transactions involving cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), starting from early 2026. The main motive behind the move is the large number of crypto sales that remain unreported by those who profit from them, the Yle news outlet reported. That’s despite the record-high number of taxpayers, around 18,000 in total, who declared income from cryptocurrency trading received last year. Finnish investors made some €225 million in capital gains (more than $260 million) from their activities on the market in 2024. About €68 million (over $78 million) was paid to the state in the form of income tax, Yle further detailed, quoting official stats. It also noted: “This year has seen a historically large number of crypto transactions.” However, only around 10% of all crypto trades get reported to Verohallinto currently, pointed out Juho Hasa, a senior advisor at the agency. The same reporting rate has been observed for several years now, and Finland is no exception among Nordic countries, the expert remarked. Crypto holders in Finland near half a million The Finnish tax authority has also estimated that approximately 450,000 taxpayers in Finland keep one cryptocurrency or another. That’s about 8% of its population of 5.6 million. The administration does not rely solely on tax declarations to make these calculations, as it’s empowered to request such data from crypto trading platforms and other service providers operating in Finland. Crypto owners are not required to report their holdings, as there’s currently no law obliging them to do so. However, providing information on the profits made is a must. Hasa revealed that around 100,000 people have failed to declare income derived from cryptocurrency investments last year. Tax evaders like these face higher taxation rates, he warned, and even criminal prosecution, in the case of large amounts of unreported gains. Verohallinto has filed around 200 criminal reports over such cases in the course of the past three years, the official highlighted, with their numbers growing exponentially. New regulations to facilitate crypto tracking Things are not going to become any easier for tax-dodging investors as upcoming regulations aim to facilitate authorities in their efforts to identify profits from transactions with digital assets. Finland prepares to implement CARF , the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework introduced by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ). It is a set of international rules enabling the collection of information about cryptocurrency holders and facilitating the exchange of tax-related data between the participating 70 nations. It resembles the Common Reporting Standard ( CRS ) applied to traditional financial assets. To achieve that, CARF imposes reporting obligations on service providers, making them responsible for gathering and relaying info on crypto activities to tax authorities. This exchange of data is expected to begin in 2027. Crypto platforms and intermediaries will require users to provide detailed personal information and keep a record of the transactions they have made. It will not be uncommon in the future for crypto users to see their tax forms filled out in advance with the numbers they need to report, Juho Hasa admitted. He expects up to 70,000 Finnish taxpayers to be “surprised,” once the CARF framework is implemented, and is convinced of the future increase in reported crypto profits and collected taxes. Finland ’s new rules governing the process will enter into force in January next year, but the change will be felt the following year, when Finns start filing their tax returns for 2026.

At this point, while whales have been at the forefront with recent purchases, declines are seen as buying opportunities. According to a post by crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale continues to frantically accumulate Etheruem (ETH). Accordingly, this whale purchased approximately $105 million more worth of ETH in an hour. A whale named “66kETHBorrow” has been frantically accumulating ETH since November 4th. Accordingly, the whale has purchased 385,718 ETH worth $1.33 billion since November 4th. $270 million of the funds used to purchase ETH were borrowed from Aave. Another whale continues to buy ASTER. According to Lookonchain's post, the whale named “ThisWillMakeYouLoveAgain,” who made over $36 million in profits from PEPE, has purchased ASTER again. Accordingly, the whale has purchased a total of 8.41 million ASTERs at an average price of $0.97 since November 4. It is stated that the whale currently has $1.1 million in unrealized profits. The newly created “bc1qt4” wallet purchased 1,130 BTC worth $116.6 million from FalconX in the last 9 hours. Whale “0x20d6” also purchased 523,007 Uniswap (UNI) worth $4.44 million through FalconX.

Much like yesterday, a large majority of the top 100 coins have dropped over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $154 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation is down by 1.8% on Wednesday morning (UTC); 87 of the top 100 coins and 9 of the top 10 coins are down today; BTC decreased by 1% to $103,854, and ETH fell by 2.6% to $3,459; Crypto traders and investors remain cautious despite the US government news; ‘The fundamentals of Ethereum have never looked stronger’; Ethereum is ‘emerging as Wall Street’s favourite blockchain’; As overvalued tech stocks face correction risks, crypto could benefit; US BTC spot ETFs saw inflows on Tuesday with $532.98 million, while ETH ETFs recorded no flows; Bitwise’s proposed spot Chainlink ETF seems to be close to launch; Crypto market sentiment drops again within the fear territory. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, 9 of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 1% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $103,854. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is down by 2.6%, now changing hands at $3,459. This is the second-highest decrease. The highest drop in the category is 3.2% by Solana (SOL) , which trades at $977. The only green coin is Tron (TRX) , which appreciated 0.5% to the price of $0.2994. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find 87 of them in the red. Official Trump (TRUMP) fell the most: 6.6% to $7.81. It’s followed by Arbitrum (ARB) , which fell 5.6% to the price of $0.2789. On the other hand, Canton (CC) appreciated the most: 25.4% to $0.1379, while Aster (ASTER) saw an increase of 7.9%, now standing at $1.16. And while optimism grows across various markets that the US is close to ending its government shutdown, crypto traders and investors remain cautious, and the sentiment remains subdued due to weak ETF inflows. Large Sums of Idle Capital May Be Coming Back Glassnode analysts have commented that BTC sits between $100,600 and $108,500 – the levels that act as support and resistance. A break of either one of the two is “likely to define the next directional trend,” they write. #Bitcoin is trading around $104K stuck between the 0.85 and 0.75 cost-basis quantiles ($108.5K / $100.6K). These levels have historically acted as support and resistance, with a break of either likely to define the next directional trend. https://t.co/ZIPAeR4AN2 pic.twitter.com/wJ4jH9PTvQ — glassnode (@glassnode) November 12, 2025 When it comes to ETH, Kevin Rusher, founder of RAAC , a real-world-asset (RWA) lending and borrowing ecosystem, noted that there was negative sentiment due to ETH’s decline from nearly $5,000. However, he says, “the fundamentals of Ethereum have never looked stronger, which is being driven by massive growth in stablecoins.” Per DeFi Llama , the total value locked in stablecoin RWA protocols on Ethereum increased from $133.8 billion at the beginning of August to over $167.5 billion on 11 November. Yet, in the same period, the total crypto market cap declined from around $3.85 trillion to $3.67 trillion. Moreover, last month, Ethereum stablecoin volume hit a record $2.8 trillion “as the broader market slowdown seems to have driven traders to seek further yield opportunities through stablecoins on Ethereum-based DeFi protocols.” Finally, Ethereum is also “emerging as Wall Street’s favourite blockchain thanks to the potential for stablecoins as a “viral” use case for payments,” Rusher writes. Meanwhile, Bitunix analyst commented on the AI investment boom potentially entering its late-stage bubble phase. “If the US AI sector continues to cool, both BTC and ETH could attract renewed flows from hedging and speculative capital.” They continue: “As overvalued tech stocks face correction risks, some capital may rotate out of equities and flow into high-beta assets — with crypto emerging as a natural alternative.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC trades at $103,854. The coin has dropped from the intraday high of $105,466 to the intraday low of $102,461, before recovering somewhat to the current price. Notably, over the past week, the price saw a dip below $100,000, hitting $99,376. The highest point in this timeframe was $106,562. It’s up 2.8% in a week. Should BTC continue dropping, it could hit $101,400 followed by $99,200. Conversely, a rise above $104,500 could confirm renewed bullish momentum, targeting $107,500 and $110,500 Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,459. It had a more gradual decrease from the day’s high of $3,591 to the low of $3,408. It’s still trading in a relatively tight range. When it comes to the 7-day timeframe, ETH moved between the low of $3,216 and the high of $3,633. It’s up 5.3% in a week. The price could still drop below $3,400 and towards $3,250. However, if the price goes above $3,600, a bullish momentum could proceed towards $3,850. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has decreased again, after yesterday’s brief rise. It remains within the fear zone. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 26 today , compared to 32 this time a day ago. Despite beneficial news over the past couple of days, there are still many economic and geopolitical factors concerning to investors. Therefore, given the lack of overall stability, low index is not surprising. Improvement in liquidity and volatility would be beneficial to the prices, as well as the sentiment.

By the closing time on 11 November, the S&P 500 was up by 0.21%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.31%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.18%. Most major indexes closed higher amid hopes the US government shutdown would end soon. Is this drop sustainable? The sustainability of the current drop is questionable.

Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast, low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks.

The RSI at 39.48 suggests the asset is moving out of oversold territory, hinting at potential short-term upside momentum. Bollinger Bands indicate reduced volatility, but the price remains below the mid-band resistance near $3.39, signaling that bullish confirmation is not yet strong. The MACD still reflects bearish pressure, implying a cautious sentiment. If ATOM sustains above $3.00, it could aim for $3.40 resistance; however, failure to maintain support at $2.50 may renew downward momentum toward $2.30 in the coming sessions.

The MACD’s slight upward crossover indicates momentum may shift in favor of buyers if sustained above $3.00. Bollinger Bands reflect reduced volatility, hinting at a possible breakout phase soon. The RSI remains near neutral levels, signaling room for either direction. If ATOM breaks the $3.10–$3.30 resistance zone, it could extend gains toward $3.50. However, failure to maintain above $2.85 may invite renewed selling pressure, potentially dragging prices toward $2.60. Overall, consolidation within this range precedes a potential decisive move in coming sessions. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmos’ current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $33.53 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will likely reach $110.10 in 2033. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $33.53 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos launched after its 2017 ICO and mainnet release in 2019, reaching a peak of $44 during the 2021 bull market. After April 2022, ATOM entered a long consolidation phase, mostly trading between $6 and $16. Throughout 2024, the price weakened further, dropping to the $4–$6 range and reaching lows near $4 as bearish sentiment grew. Early 2025 saw continued volatility, with ATOM fluctuating mostly between $4 and $5 despite brief rebounds. From July to September 2025, ATOM traded narrowly between $4.30–$4.70, showing limited momentum and ongoing market indecision. ATOM was trading around $4.40–$4.70, but bearish pressure pushed the price downward as broader market sentiment weakened. The price declined further, moving into the $4.00–$4.30 range, with repeated failed attempts to break above resistance. From the beginning of November, ATOM continued to trade sideways between $3.90–$4.20, showing low momentum, weak buyer strength, and consolidation near support levels.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-12 12:15:00

The company announced that Tether will emerge as the largest shareholder of VCIG following the closing of the transaction. VCI Global announced on Tuesday that the transaction aims to expand the entity’s footprint in the DeFi space, supporting blockchain-powered projects, AI features, and fintech within its Nasdaq-listed governance framework. The firm’s announcement detailed that VCI Global had already settled a transaction worth $50 million to acquire OOB tokens through a restricted share issuance to the OOB Foundation. According to the announcement, VCI Global will complete the remaining $50 million transaction to purchase OOB tokens after the token goes public. Tether on track to be VCI Global’s largest shareholder The company also announced that Tether will become its largest shareholder upon completion of the transaction. Moshe Schisser, Chairman of Oobit, briefed on the matter, stating that the transaction is more than a crypto-oriented deal. Schisser explained that the deal is part of a significant step aimed at “expanding the real-world utility and growth of the Oobit ecosystem.” Meanwhile, Oobit’s ambition to rebrand and expand its reach in the digital ecosystem has led to new developments involving significant on-chain migration. The crypto platform announced on November 9 that Oobit is migrating OBT from the Ethereum mainnet to the Solana blockchain. We’re excited to announce that Oobit is officially migrating $OBT to Solana! Migration starts today, November 9 — start your migration here: https://t.co/AtrJyFs0hy ⚠️This is the only official migration link — be cautious of fakes. — Oobit (@oobit) November 9, 2025 The firm noted that the migration will roll out in successive stages, including the opening of the migration portal on November 9 and its continuous operation for 10 days. Afterwards, the official token generation event and snapshot are scheduled to happen on November 12. The migration portal will close on November 19, paving the way for the OOB airdrop to eligible wallets. In July, the firm announced plans to incentivize the adoption of stablecoins with refunds, thereby extending its partnership deal with StablR. Cryptopolitan reported that Oobit announced plans to integrate MiCA-compliant and Tether-backed StablREUR and StablRUSD stablecoins to create a platform conducive to secure crypto payments. The announcement also claimed users will receive 5% cashback on every USDR and EURR purchase. Oobit is backed by major players, including Tether , Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, CMCC Global, and 468 Capital. Earlier this year, Oobit received $25 million from Tether in a Series A funding round, which was concluded by the stablecoin issuer to support ongoing cryptocurrency development and promote mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. The Series A funding round was led by Tether’s investment arm and attracted participation from pivotal industry leaders and strategic investors. Notable contributors in the funding round include CMCC Global’s Titan Fund, 468 Capital, and Anatoly Yakovenko. Tether expands outside stablecoin issuing Tether is the largest stablecoin issuer, commanding a market share of $183 billion at the time of this publication. Tether’s transparency page shows that the majority of USDT tokens are minted on the Ethereum network, followed by Tron and Solana. Notably, the crypto giant has set strategic investments to expand its reach outside stablecoin issuance. On Monday, video platform Rumble announced plans to acquire German AI cloud company Northern Data in a deal worth more than $760 million. The company listed Tether as one of its major investors. Tether also acquired a minor stake in Spanish crypto asset platform Bit2Me in August to expand its presence in the EU and Latin America. The stablecoin issuer’s effort to expand outside of crypto has held steady. In October, the company ranked among the top 20 global holders of U.S. debt after declaring U.S. Treasuries exposure worth $135 billion and $10 billion YTD profit. The firm ranks higher than sovereign holders, such as South Korea. Tether’s Q3 announcement also revealed that the company has gold reserves worth $12.9 billion and $9.9 billion in Bitcoin.

The flagship cryptocurrency’s recovery stalled on Tuesday as it registered a 2.80% drop to $103,009. Analysts have warned that historic November rallies may not materialize as Bitcoin continues trading in a range, stuck between $100,000 and $115,000, as long-term holders continue dumping their assets. Government Shutdown Nearly Over The US Senate has moved to restart the US government after nearly 40 days, as several Democratic lawmakers sided with Republicans to pass a funding bill. The US Senate held a late-night vote on Monday to vote for a bill that continues appropriations and extensions for the fiscal year 2026. The bill passed 60-40. The bill will fund the US government through January 31, 2026, but must pass through the House of Representatives before reaching President Trump’s desk. The House is expected to reconvene and vote on the bill on Wednesday, as Tuesday was a federal holiday. Prediction platform Polymarket expects the government to be functional by Friday. The shutdown, the longest in US history, saw key agencies furlough staff and reduce operations due to the lack of funding. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $524 million in net inflows on Tuesday, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading with $224 million, according to data from SoSoValue. Fidelity’s FBTC was second with $166 million in net inflows. This takes the historical inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs past $60 billion, with total assets under management at $137.83 billion, 7% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Analysts believe Bitcoin will not see a consistent recovery until spot Bitcoin ETF inflows remain sluggish. Long-term holders have also maintained a steady pace of selling, and QCP’s market insights highlighted only a small improvement in market sentiment, as traders remain wary of another liquidation event. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Analysts have warned that Bitcoin's ( BTC ) historic November rallies may not materialize this year as multiple signals and on-chain indicators suggest prolonged consolidation rather than upward momentum. The flagship cryptocurrency has been bogged down by persistent selling from large holders. Institutional demand has also waned following the October 10 crash, which saw over $20 billion liquidated. According to an analysis by Bitfinex, BTC has dropped nearly 9%, revisiting range lows. The analysis also reveals that long-term holders have accelerated BTC selling to the tune of 104,000 BTC per month, the highest since July. The analysts noted in their report, “Unless ETF inflows or new spot demand returns to absorb ongoing distribution, BTC is likely to remain range-bound, with a risk bias toward retesting the $106,000–$107,000 zone.” Bitfinex also warned that if selling pressure returns, price action could drag Bitcoin towards $100,000 again. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials are deeply divided over what is a greater threat: a sluggish labor market or persistent inflation. Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid had dissented against the rate cut in October, while Cleveland’s Beth Hammack and Dallas’s Lorie Logan have also opposed further rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the divisions, stating, “People just have different risk tolerances, so that leads you to people with disparate views.” According to data from TradingView, BTC dropped after hitting new November highs around $107,000. This formed a resistance zone that bulls could not overcome. Price action turned negative, pushing BTC down to current levels. The decline saw BTC fill the CME Gap at around $104,000. Prominent trader Daan Crypto Trades stated, “Another gap closed within the first few trading days of the week. This has become an incredibly reliable and predictable pattern by now. Most people are aware of this, so you'd assume at some point it would stop happening. Usually I'd agree, but this has been a high probability event for the past 4-5 years by now.” Trading resource Material Indicators highlighted that a snap sell-off by large BTC holders likely caused the price drop. “FireCharts shows a massive $240M market dump in the BTC order book. Interestingly, Brown Mega Whales only account for about $3M of that.” BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.15% on Friday and settling at $109,555. Price action remained positive on Saturday and Sunday as BTC rose 0.45% and 0.44% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,536. Selling pressure returned on Monday as the price fell nearly 4% and settled at $106,557. The bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,468. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $103,869. Source: TradingView BTC returned to bearish territory on Thursday, dropping to a low of $100,235 before settling at $101,290. The price slipped below $100,000 again on Friday, falling to a low of $99,170 before recovering and settling at $103,284, ultimately rising nearly 2%. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.97% on Saturday before rising 2.36% on Sunday and settling at $104,964. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC rose 1.23% and settled at $105,979. Buyers lost momentum on Tuesday as BTC fell nearly 3% and settled at $103,009. The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed $105,000 during the ongoing session, and is trading around $105,099. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan just dropped a bombshell prediction that could reshape how billion-dollar projects raise capital. According to his expert analysis, we’re about to witness the explosive return of regulated ICOs on an unprecedented scale. Why Are Regulated ICOs Making a Comeback? Coinbase’s new token issuance platform represents a turning point for the industry. Unlike the wild west days of 2017, today’s regulated ICOs operate within clear legal frameworks. This development signals maturity in the crypto space that could finally bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. Hougan’s prediction isn’t just speculation. He forecasts more than six separate offerings each reaching the $1 billion mark through platforms like Coinbase’s. This represents a massive vote of confidence in the future of compliant token sales. How Will Regulated ICOs Challenge Traditional IPOs? The emergence of billion-dollar regulated ICOs creates direct competition with conventional initial public offerings. Here’s why this matters: Global accessibility – Investors worldwide can participate without geographic restrictions Faster capital formation – Token sales can mobilize funds more efficiently than traditional routes Liquidity advantages – Tokens typically trade immediately after the offering concludes Reduced intermediaries – Blockchain technology streamlines the entire process This competitive dynamic could force traditional markets to evolve or risk becoming obsolete for tech startups seeking funding. What Makes Today’s Regulated ICOs Different? The key distinction lies in the regulatory compliance. Platforms like Coinbase ensure that these regulated ICOs meet strict standards that protect investors while maintaining innovation. Monad (MON) serves as the inaugural project on Coinbase’s platform, setting the precedent for future offerings. This approach addresses the main criticisms of earlier token sales by implementing: Proper due diligence procedures Transparent disclosure requirements Investor protection measures Legal compliance frameworks What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The prediction of multiple billion-dollar regulated ICOs signals several important trends. First, institutional confidence in cryptocurrency has reached new heights. Second, regulatory clarity is finally emerging after years of uncertainty. Third, the infrastructure supporting digital assets has matured significantly. For investors, this creates both opportunities and challenges. The professionalization of token offerings means better projects with stronger fundamentals. However, it also means increased competition for allocation in these high-profile sales. The Future of Capital Formation Is Here As we look toward 2025, the landscape for regulated ICOs appears brighter than ever. The combination of established platforms, clear regulations, and institutional participation creates the perfect environment for massive token offerings to thrive. This evolution represents more than just a revival – it’s the maturation of an entire asset class. The days of questionable token sales are giving way to professional, compliant offerings that can genuinely compete with traditional finance. Frequently Asked Questions What are regulated ICOs? Regulated ICOs are token offerings that operate within established legal frameworks, providing investor protections and compliance with securities laws. How do regulated ICOs differ from traditional IPOs? While both raise capital, regulated ICOs typically offer global accessibility, faster execution, and immediate secondary market trading through blockchain technology. Why is Coinbase’s platform significant? Coinbase’s entry brings credibility and regulatory compliance to token offerings, potentially attracting institutional investors who previously avoided ICOs. What risks remain with regulated ICOs? Despite improved regulations, investors still face market volatility, project failure risk, and regulatory changes that could impact token value. How can investors participate in these offerings? Participation typically requires meeting platform-specific requirements, which may include identity verification, accreditation status, and geographic eligibility. Will regulated ICOs replace traditional venture capital? While they provide an alternative funding path, regulated ICOs will likely coexist with traditional VC rather than completely replacing it.
