However, SOL ETFs managed to close the week with positive inflows, a clear sign that institutional investors still favor a bullish Solana price prediction . Bitcoin ETFs took the strongest hit as investors withdrew nearly $1 billion from these products, while ETH-linked funds saw their assets drop by $432 million. In contrast, Solana ETFs, including spot versions like the ones managed by REX-Osprey and Bitwise, received $118 million. Investors seem to have taken advantage of the strong sell-off that SOL experienced, which managed to push the token below $150 at some point last week, to scoop up the asset at a discount. At the time of writing, the two spot ETFs tied to Solana have attracted a combined $782 million in assets. Among them, the Bitwise Solana ETF (BSOL) has already taken the lead, despite launching only weeks ago, thanks to its higher staking reward structure which has drawn in more yield-focused investors. Solana Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout Out of Price Channel Could Push SOL to $300 The daily chart for Solana shows that the token hit a key area of demand at $155, from which it has apparently bounced in the past few days. The price has been on a downtrend since mid-September as it failed to stay above $200. Nonetheless, ETF inflows lately could be indicating that SOL has hit a local bottom. If the recovery commences, the price should first break out of that descending price channel. This would also mean a move above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). If that happens, we could see SOL recapturing the $200 area, and it could keep rising to $300 in the near term to finally make a new all-time high. If SOL manages to reclaim the $200 mark, it could quickly build momentum toward $300 and set the stage for a new all-time high. For those looking to get ahead of the next breakout, early-stage presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) offer a high-upside alternative. This unique mine-to-earn (M2E) crypto game has already pulled in millions from early investors by enabling users to mine meme coins using virtual mining rigs – no hardware needed. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Meme Coin Mining Easy and Hardware-Free Pepenode ($PEPENODE) reinvents crypto mining by eliminating the biggest barrier for most users — the need for costly equipment. Instead of setting up physical rigs, players can launch virtual servers, deploy mining rigs instantly, and scale their operations entirely online. This gamified approach makes mining more accessible, letting anyone join the action without the technical hassle or upfront hardware investment. The project fosters a competitive environment and rewards top miners with attractive meme coin airdrops like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN). In addition, 70% of the $PEPENODE spent on upgrades is burned to reduce the token’s circulating supply. As the game’s popularity increases, so will the demand for its utility token. Hence, analysts expect that $PEPENODE will rise rapidly once the presale ends. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card instead to complete the transaction. Buy $PEPENODE Here.

Prices lifted yesterday after the U.S. federal government shutdown came to an end , yet fears still remain that an AI-caused stock market bubble may be close to bursting. This is why the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are down slightly today, but some altcoins are showing signs that they could rally strongly in the coming weeks. One of these is the new Ethereum-based token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which recently opened its presale and is gaining serious momentum as it prepares to launch soon. New Crypto to Buy Today: Under $0.01 and About to List on Exchanges In fact, PEPENODE has now raised $2.1 million in its ongoing sale, which has been attracting investors largely by virtue of the coin’s unique fundamentals. These fundamentals revolve around the fact that PEPENODE is launching a first-of-its-kind mine-to-earn platform, which will provide users with the ability to mine cryptocurrencies without having to invest in expensive equipment. There's no better feeling than seeing those mined coins hit your wallet. It's ok.. Go ahead. Take as MANY as you can! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tVh4WSRNay — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 8, 2025 The way the platform works is by enabling users to build their own virtual mining rigs, which will consist of virtual mining nodes that participants can purchase using the PEPENODE token itself. The more nodes users buy, the greater their mining rewards will be, with PEPENODE paying out rewards in external tokens, such as the original Pepe and Fartcoin. Because more nodes equal more rewards, there will be a clear and strong incentive to accumulate more PEPENODE, something which should drive its price up over time. Added to this, holders of the coin will be able to stake, earning themselves an annual return that currently stands at 611%. These factors mean that PEPENODE arguably benefits from a much greater stimulus to growth than many other meme coins, giving it an edge over its competition. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with its allocation breakdown as follows: economics and treasury (35%), development (35%), infrastructure (15%), node rewards (7.5%), and listings (7.5%). How to Buy PEPENODE Before the Presale Closes PEPENODE’s presale doesn’t have that much time left before it closes, and before the token is listed on exchanges. However, investors can still join at the PEPENODE website, where they can connect a suitable wallet and buy the token in exchange for ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat currency. The coin is currently available at the price of $0.0011408, although this will rise later today. And it will continue to rise for the duration of the sale, meaning that interested investors should buy sooner rather than later. It’s likely that its launch could coincide with a market-wide recovery, with the imminent launch of altcoin ETFs having the potential to boost demand across the board. This is why PEPENODE is one of the best new cryptos to buy today, since its fundamentals and timing could result in big gains in the not-too-distant future.

According to commentary from community figure Skipper, approval of such a fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could open the floodgates to institutional capital and fundamentally shift XRP’s outlook. Skipper argues that once the SEC grants approval for an XRP ETF, large‐scale financial firms will gain a regulated route to exposure. He maintains that Wall Street would find it difficult to ignore a payments-oriented asset still trading relatively modestly. With institutions entering via an ETF, demand could rapidly absorb available supply. That dynamic, according to him, would place upward pressure on the token’s value. Built-in Supply Reduction Mechanism A second pillar of the case focuses on XRP’s deflationary characteristics. Skipper highlighted that every transaction on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) destroys a small amount of XRP, gradually reducing its total circulating supply. Unlike fixed-supply tokens such as Bitcoin, XRP’s adaptive supply model introduces a built-in tightening mechanism. In the combination of rising institutional demand and shrinking supply, Skipper sees the potential for meaningful value appreciation. Stablecoin Integration and Ecosystem Expansion Skipper also drew attention to RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Ripple Labs and built on the XRPL. He views RLUSD as a strategic lever to drive transaction volume across the XRPL, which in turn would increase the rate of XRP burns and reinforce the supply-contraction thesis. He pointed out that RLUSD achieved roughly a 604 % increase in circulation over six months and became one of the fastest-growing stablecoins globally, indicating that the project may still be in its early scaling phase. Ripple’s Strategic Choice and Competitive Advantage According to Skipper, the launch of RLUSD was not necessary for Ripple’s success, yet it was chosen deliberately. By issuing its own stablecoin rather than relying entirely on third‐party options, Ripple retains greater control over value flows, transaction settlement, and the utility of the XRPL. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skipper argues this approach gives the company a strategic edge. When an organization controls both the payment infrastructure and the settlement layer, the core token (XRP) can gain relevance beyond speculative usage. He contends that as investors grasp this integrated vision, institutional demand for XRP may rise sharply. Regulatory developments are advancing quickly. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) now lists several proposed XRP ETFs, including filings from Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton , Bitwise, and 21Shares. Canary Capital has targeted November 13 for launch, pending Nasdaq approval, while Franklin Templeton recently amended its filing to remove prior delay provisions, aiming for a late-November decision. ETF analyst Nate Geraci commented that the first XRP ETF registered under the Securities Act of 1933 could debut as soon as this week if approvals align. Meanwhile, Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, estimated potential inflows of roughly $10 billion within the first month of trading, a level of demand that could significantly impact market liquidity and price stability. The potential launch of a spot-XRP ETF may represent more than simply another financial product. For XRP, it could cause a shift into regulated institutional waters, matched with micro-supply contraction via transaction burns, and supported by an expanding stablecoin ecosystem built by Ripple. If these forces converge, the token may be positioned for meaningful price growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitwise’s spot Chainlink ETF has just appeared on the DTCC website under the ticker CLNK, marking a significant milestone in the journey toward mainstream crypto adoption. This development could open up new investment opportunities for those looking to gain exposure to Chainlink’s oracle network through traditional financial channels. What Does the Chainlink ETF Listing Mean for Investors? The appearance of Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation website represents a crucial step forward. However, it’s important to understand that this DTCC listing differs from SEC approval. The DTCC primarily handles clearing and settlement services, while the SEC focuses on regulatory compliance and investor protection. This Chainlink ETF development follows the successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Many industry experts see this as part of a broader trend toward cryptocurrency integration with traditional finance. The potential benefits include: Easier access for traditional investors Enhanced liquidity for Chainlink tokens Regulatory clarity through established frameworks Mainstream validation of blockchain technology How Does This Chainlink ETF Compare to Previous Crypto Funds? Unlike Bitcoin ETFs that track the price of Bitcoin directly, this Chainlink ETF would provide exposure to LINK tokens. Chainlink serves as a critical infrastructure component in the blockchain ecosystem, powering decentralized oracle networks that connect smart contracts with real-world data. The timing of this Chainlink ETF filing comes during a period of growing institutional interest in blockchain technology. Major financial institutions increasingly recognize the value of decentralized oracle networks for various applications, including: Decentralized finance protocols Insurance smart contracts Gaming and NFT platforms Supply chain management What Challenges Remain for the Chainlink ETF Approval? While the DTCC listing generates optimism, several hurdles remain before investors can actually trade this Chainlink ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission must still review and approve the application, a process that typically involves extensive scrutiny of market manipulation concerns, custody solutions, and investor protection measures. Market experts suggest that the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency ETFs has evolved gradually. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs established important precedents, but each new digital asset faces unique regulatory considerations. The Chainlink ETF application will likely undergo similar rigorous examination focused on: Market surveillance capabilities Custody and security arrangements Liquidity and price discovery mechanisms Investor education requirements Why This Chainlink ETF Matters for Crypto’s Future The potential approval of a Chainlink ETF represents more than just another investment product. It signals growing recognition of blockchain infrastructure’s importance beyond simple currency applications. Chainlink’s oracle technology enables smart contracts to interact with external data, making it fundamental to many real-world blockchain implementations. This Chainlink ETF development could pave the way for similar products focused on other essential blockchain infrastructure tokens. The success of such funds would demonstrate that investors value the underlying technology powering the decentralized web, not just speculative digital assets. Final Thoughts on the Chainlink ETF Opportunity The appearance of Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF on the DTCC website marks an exciting development in cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream financial acceptance. While regulatory approval remains uncertain, this progress indicates growing institutional confidence in blockchain infrastructure investments. As the crypto industry continues maturing, products like the Chainlink ETF bridge the gap between traditional finance and innovative blockchain technology. Investors should monitor this development closely, as it could signal new opportunities for diversified cryptocurrency exposure through regulated financial channels. Frequently Asked Questions What is the ticker symbol for Bitwise’s Chainlink ETF? The proposed Chainlink ETF carries the ticker symbol CLNK on the DTCC website. Does DTCC listing guarantee SEC approval? No, DTCC listing is separate from SEC review and doesn’t guarantee eventual exchange listing or regulatory approval. When can investors expect to trade this Chainlink ETF? There’s no confirmed timeline. The ETF must first receive SEC approval before becoming available for trading. How does a Chainlink ETF differ from buying LINK directly? An ETF provides regulated, traditional market exposure without dealing with crypto wallets or exchanges directly. What advantages does a Chainlink ETF offer? It offers easier access for traditional investors, potential tax advantages, and regulated custody solutions. Are there other cryptocurrency ETFs in development? Yes, several asset managers are exploring ETFs for various cryptocurrencies following Bitcoin ETF approvals. Found this analysis helpful?

Michael Selig is scheduled to appear on November 19 before the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has oversight of the CFTC. The nomination comes at a time of unusual uncertainty for the agency. The CFTC, whose primary responsibility has been to regulate derivatives and commodity markets, is likely to be given additional power to regulate cryptocurrencies. Legislators are also debating a bill that could transfer supervision of a broad swath of the crypto market from the SEC to the CFTC. President Donald Trump selected Selig to chair the commission earlier this month, after the previous nominee , Brian Quintenz, was removed. Quintenz’s nomination was stalled over the summer due to disagreements among influential industry figures. Senate to grill Selig on crypto oversight plan If approved, Selig would take over an agency currently run by a single commissioner . Acting Chair Caroline Pham has been the CFTC’s sole member since September, when the agency typically has five commissioners to foster balanced decision-making. Pham has said she will resign if a permanent chair is confirmed. That makes Selig likely to find himself initially at the helm of the CFTC without reinforcements at a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny and rapid developments in the crypto space. His supporters argue that his experience equips him with the technical expertise to regulate markets during a period of rapid innovation and structural change. He’ll still undoubtedly face the question among some lawmakers and policy analysts about whether his past ties him too closely to the interests of the crypto industry, especially at a time when regulators are facing mounting pressure to ramp up their oversight and enforcement. Senators are reportedly preparing to grill Selig over his views on the CFTC’s role in the crypto world. They will likely explore how aggressively the agency should pursue enforcement cases, how it should determine whether a digital asset falls within the jurisdiction of either the CFTC or SEC, and how to cooperate with the two regulators to avoid regulatory gaps. Questions may also revolve around whether Selig at the helm would be more inclined to foster innovative markets or solidify investors’ protections. Lawmakers pass crypto market structure bills Selig’s confirmation hearing will take place as Congress is rethinking the way the United States regulates digital assets. In July, the House of Representatives approved the CLARITY Act, which would clarify the line between what it sees as the roles of the SEC and CFTC in regulating cryptocurrencies and other new financial instruments. Under this proposed system, digital assets such as Bitcoin and other decentralized tokens would be overseen by the CFTC. The SEC’s authority would extend to crypto assets that fall within the definition of securities, such as those associated with investment contracts or issued by private companies. Traders’ platforms and exchanges would need to comply with new registration and reporting requirements aimed at increasing transparency and safeguarding consumers. In the most serious sections of the bill, much work remains for senators on the Agriculture and Banking Committees to hammer out compromises. Senate Republicans on the Agriculture Committee released a new discussion draft on Monday, signalling that more serious work has begun on the legislation, which had stalled as funding fights and last month’s government shutdown took precedence. These are high-stakes negotiations for the cryptocurrency industry. How the bill ultimately winds up will determine how crypto firms are allowed to raise capital, list assets, and interact with customers. It could also significantly expand the CFTC’s role in the financial system, setting the parameters of its authority for years to come. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This happened after a wave of selling by big-time holders and leftover tension from the October 10th liquidations, when Donald Trump’s surprise tariff announcement triggered a meltdown across crypto. Trading activity reflects the same sluggish tone. Open interest on Bitcoin futures has dropped to around $68 billion, down from $94 billion last month. That’s a massive drop in appetite. Funding rates are sitting flat, meaning no one’s loading up on leverage. The mood on exchange-traded products is just as sleepy. US-listed Bitcoin ETFs only pulled in $1 million in net inflows Monday, even as equities and credit climbed following Washington’s move to end the federal shutdown. Bitcoin futures dip, technicals stall, whales sell hard Technically, the coin’s stuck under the 200-day moving average, now near $110,000, which many traders see as a must-break level to shift the trend upward. Since the early October chaos, Bitcoin has bled about $340 billion in market value. And despite finishing the year with gains, it’s trailing both gold and tech stocks badly, something that hasn’t gone unnoticed by fast-moving investors looking for stronger trends elsewhere. George Mandres, senior trader at XBTO Trading, said: “It feels like a dead cat bounce. Equities are trading risk-on, but in crypto, it’s different. OG whales have been offloading serious amounts of coins, and that supply combined with weak ETF flows and pressure on premiums from crypto treasury firms is crushing sentiment.” Momentum traders aren’t seeing much hope either. Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG Australia, said what caught his attention was how Bitcoin mirrored the recent rebound in other risk assets, after that correlation broke down last month. “We need more than one session to confirm the link is back,” Tony said. “But I’d argue the correction from the $126,272 top might’ve ended at the recent $98,898 low. If we move above the 200-day average near $110,000, that’ll back that idea up.” Resistance caps rebound while key support looks fragile Overall crypto market cap slipped 1.1% Monday after gaining earlier in the day, with the 50-day average near $3.62 trillion holding as resistance. The rally stalled out at $3.6 trillion, and Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, warned the market could be forming another short-term top. “We’re still in a downtrend,” Alex said, “and the reduction in corporate buying is being felt.” Rachael Lucas, analyst at BTC Markets, called the recent price lift a “short-covering rally,” plus some institutional fear of missing out. She pointed to Bitcoin’s bounce off the 50-week SMA at around $103,000 after briefly dipping near $98,900. Now it’s eyeing the next resistance zone at $110,400, and if that’s cleared, Rachael said we could be heading to $115,600 or even $118,000. But the flip side isn’t pretty. If Bitcoin breaks below $103,000, the next stop could be $86,000. And if that doesn’t hold, deeper support sits at $82,000, near the 100-week SMA. Rachael warned that slipping below those numbers could spark another round of heavy selling.

The trend in 2025 is clear. Investors no longer want promises; they want verifiable returns and sustainable growth. And in this new race, one name is emerging with strength: RentStac (RNS). From Memes to Bricks: DeFi Gets Real While meme coins struggle to find practical applications, RentStac (RNS) has brought blockchain into the real world, transforming physical properties into digital assets. Each token represents a legal share of ownership within registered Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) that generate rental income, distributed monthly to investors. For the first time, DeFi is moving beyond pure speculation to become a genuine investment tool, with cash flows traceable and verifiable on-chain. Mathematical Potential: +1,980% Already Structured The RentStac (RNS) presale is in Phase 1 at $0.025 per token and has already surpassed $675,000 raised. By the end of the presale, in Phase 7, the price will rise to $0.52, guaranteeing an automatic +1,980% gain for those who enter now. And this is not a hypothetical estimate, it is the official price progression built into the project’s structure. A $10,000 investment today becomes $416,000 at the end of the presale, not counting the possibility of reaching $1 post-listing, which would lift the value to $800,000. While SHIB and DOGE must rely on new waves of enthusiasm to recover, RentStac (RNS) already has a growth plan integrated and supported by tangible assets. DeFi With Returns, Not Tweets Dogecoin built its fame on Elon Musk’s tweets. Shiba Inu thrived on community hype and expectations. But the market has changed: investors now look for real economic models. RentStac has introduced a dual-yield model, a system that combines token appreciation with monthly rental distributions. Capital inflows fuel periodic buybacks and burns, reducing supply and increasing token value over time. It is a solid financial logic, much closer to institutional portfolio management than to a retail gamble. Transparency and Security That Attract Institutions Beyond growth, RentStac (RNS) stands out for its focus on security. The project has achieved a 92.48% score on SolidityScan, is officially listed on CoinMarketCap, and is undergoing a CertiK audit. All funds are protected in multi-signature wallets, with independent oracle validations ensuring on-chain data integrity. This level of oversight, once reserved only for regulated funds, is now accessible to anyone through blockchain. Real-World Assets Are the New Frontier According to the latest forecasts from the World Economic Forum, more than $10 trillion in traditional assets will be tokenized by 2030. This market, known as RWA (Real-World Assets), represents the biggest expansion opportunity for DeFi since 2020. RentStac (RNS) is one of the few projects already operating in this space, and its multi-chain strategy across Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC positions it for global growth in the coming years. While SHIB and DOGE face a downward cycle and investors exit losing positions, smart capital is shifting toward projects that offer monthly income, fractional ownership, and transparent governance. An Inevitable Paradigm Shift The market is changing its skin. The “to the moon” narrative that sustained meme tokens is giving way to a more mature approach based on value, yield, and utility. RentStac (RNS) does not promise miracles; it delivers measurable results. A +1,980% return based on official data and an ecosystem built on concrete assets. It is the logical evolution of the crypto market: from digital speculation to the construction of real wealth.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-12 00:00:00
54287545,625319,1762905621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54287545.jpeg,Ethereum Supply on Binance Hits Lowest Level Since May – Long-Term Accumulation?,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-supply-binance-hits-lowest-level-since/,"Ethereum has regained the $3,500 level after a volatile week marked by heavy selling pressure and uncertainty across the crypto market. Bulls, who briefly lost control as ETH dipped below key support levels, are showing renewed strength as liquidity surges and sentiment begins to shift. According to a recent CryptoQuant report, data from Binance — the world’s largest Ethereum trading platform by volume — reveals a notable on-chain trend that could signal deeper structural strength. The ETH supply on Binance has been in steady decline since mid-year, following a peak between June and July. By November, it had dropped to its lowest level since last May, now sitting around the 0.0327 level. This consistent decrease in available ETH on exchanges typically reflects a migration of coins into cold storage or private wallets, suggesting that investors are opting to hold rather than sell. Historically, this behavior has been viewed as bullish in the medium to long term, as it reduces the amount of Ethereum available for immediate sale and relieves market pressure. Ethereum Exchange Supply Decline Signals Market Accumulation Phase In the CryptoQuant report , analyst Arab Chain highlights a notable divergence between Ethereum’s price action and exchange supply dynamics. The price of Ethereum (black line) climbed to consecutive highs near $4,500–$5,000 in August and September 2025 before retracing to around $3,500 today. Interestingly, this decline coincided with a sharp drop in exchange-held ETH supply, suggesting that many traders withdrew their coins after securing profits — likely moving them into cold storage in anticipation of longer-term accumulation. If this trend of declining Ethereum supply on Binance persists, market liquidity for ETH sales could tighten further. Such a contraction in sell-side supply often supports price stabilization, as reduced availability of tokens on exchanges lessens immediate selling pressure. In favorable macro or on-chain conditions, this setup could even help catalyze a renewed upward phase, especially if risk appetite among institutional and retail investors strengthens. However, Arab Chain cautions that continued weak demand or reduced network activity might limit any near-term upside, keeping prices in a sideways range. Despite short-term uncertainty, the broader on-chain picture reflects a transitional accumulation phase, where long-term holders dominate flows. This ongoing migration of ETH off exchanges — paired with increasing self-custody behavior — underlines growing investor conviction. If fundamental catalysts such as network upgrades, ETF approvals, or renewed DeFi activity align, Ethereum could be setting the stage for the next bullish leg of the cycle. ETH Price Analysis: Reclaiming Key Support Levels Ethereum is showing early signs of stabilization after reclaiming the $3,500 level, marking a modest but significant recovery from the recent capitulation phase that drove prices near $3,200. As seen in the daily chart, ETH has found temporary support at the 200-day moving average (red line), a historically reliable level that often defines the boundary between bullish and bearish cycles. The price is now testing resistance near the $3,600–$3,700 zone, where both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages converge. A breakout above this area could confirm renewed bullish momentum, potentially setting the stage for a move toward $3,900–$4,000, aligning with previous range highs. However, the overall structure still reflects caution. The failure to hold above $4,000 earlier this month underscores the ongoing battle between buyers attempting to regain control and sellers taking profits amid market uncertainty. Trading volume remains subdued compared to the August–September rally, suggesting that conviction among market participants is still rebuilding.

This is a redefinition of BTC’s role in the global financial architecture, opening pathways for integration that could finally merge the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized networks. Why Interoperability Is The Key To Bitcoin’s Next Phase The crypto world has grappled with a fundamental paradox, and Beyond is building the bridge that Bitcoin has been waiting for. The Founder of DrAlphaweb3 and ordinalcarrots, Dr.OVG, has highlighted that BTC will remain the leading store of value, but in many decentralized finance (DeFi) setups, it is either locked out or wrapped. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Holds $100K as Investors Move Toward This New DeFi Crypto Project By enabling BTC liquidity to move natively across chains, like layer 1s, layer 2s, and various DeFi protocols, Beyond is set to unleash BTCFi. Specifically, the initiative will enable BTC holders to lend, borrow, earn yield, and deploy their BTC without sacrificing decentralisation and security. This innovation is critical because it will unlock BTC utility as it grows to transition into an active player in the global DeFi economy. Dr.OVG concluded that traders might see some crazy runners, so individuals should position themselves accordingly. A project and protocol writer, Mattcrypted, has also mentioned that BTCFi thrives with seamless UX powered by LayerZero’s Omni-chain Fungible Token (OFT) technology. Meanwhile, Beyond bridges connections with Echoport Ordinals to 140+ chains and 200+ partners for users to move BTC and LSTs effortlessly. With Beyond mainnet set to go live in Q4, the network will support the meta protocol, sidechain wrappers, and L2 integrations. In this innovation, the dual sale structure behind the upcoming project is also designed to deliver bear market-proof valuation for token sales. The combination of a token launchpad and Ordinals participation will ensure wide accessibility during the token sales. On the technical front, EVMs would seamlessly operate as a trusted protocol backed by Animoca Brands and vVv, which is bullish, and Beyond would pioneer BTC connections across the ecosystem. Why Bitcoin Next Chapter Demands Interoperability Bitcoin is not meant to stay siloed. According to a Web3 builder, Jaouad, Beyond is a native BTC L1 interoperability layer that enables seamless movement of any token within Bitcoin while linking the flagship crypto, BRC-20s, Runes, and more to over 100 chains. Related Reading: Big Bitcoin Holders Are Selling, But Few Buyers Are Stepping In As Demand Weakens Jaouad stated that as a Wallchain Quaker, he’s actively grinding on the Beyond Mindshare Leaderboard, as 4% of the total BYD supply is dedicated to contributors, with 2% reserved for Epoch 1, which will wrap up on December 8. “If you are serious about BTCFi, this is the bridge you cannot ignore,” Jaouad noted.

The DTCC platform, which includes funds in the pre-launch phase, has already listed vehicles from Canary Capital, Bitwise, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton, among others, that will provide spot exposure to the native asset of the XRP Ledger. Sometime in next two weeks, I expect launch of first spot xrp ETFs… SEC had open litigation against Ripple for past five years, up until three months ago. IMO, launch of spot xrp ETFs represents final nail in coffin of previous anti-crypto regulators. Have come a *LONG* way. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 3, 2025 According to ETF expert Nate Geraci, these funds should be listed in a couple of weeks. Once they do, They could open up the floodgates for millions of dollars coming from both retail and institutional investors who will now have a regulated alternative to get exposure to the token. We could expect that the combined AUMs of these vehicles will rapidly surpass $1 billion, similar to what happened to Solana after Bitwise’s spot ETF entered the market. XRP Price Prediction: $4 In Sight if U.S. Government Shutdown Ends The 4-hour chart shows that XRP experienced strong selling pressure as it hit $2.50. The token could now retreat to the nearest relevant area at $2.38 to retest a former resistance from above. If buying pressure keeps building, XRP could attempt a breakout toward $3 this week, especially if news of the U.S. government shutdown resolution triggers renewed market optimism. Momentum is already picking up fast. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing overbought levels on the lower time frames, signaling strong demand and accelerating interest. If XRP pushes past the $3 resistance, it could open the door to a sharp move toward $4, particularly if ETF listings proceed as anticipated and market conditions keep improving. To make the most of potential gains, keeping your XRP secure is essential.

In a recent exclusive interview, he revealed that Bitcoin mining operations are confronting a perfect storm of threats that could reshape the entire cryptocurrency landscape. This alarming situation affects everyone from individual miners to large-scale operations. What Exactly Are the Three Threats to Bitcoin Mining? Fred Thiel identified three major challenges currently threatening Bitcoin mining profitability. First, intensifying competition makes it harder for miners to earn rewards. Second, rising energy costs squeeze profit margins. Third, declining revenue creates unsustainable business conditions. These three factors combine to create what Thiel describes as a ‘triple threat’ to the industry. Why Is Competition Becoming So Fierce in Bitcoin Mining? The Bitcoin mining space has become increasingly crowded as more players enter the market. Thiel explained that Bitcoin mining operates as a zero-sum game. When one company increases its mining capacity, it automatically reduces opportunities for others. This creates an environment where: New mining operations constantly join the network Existing miners upgrade their equipment regularly Everyone competes for the same block rewards Profit margins continue shrinking across the board How Are Rising Costs Impacting Bitcoin Mining Operations? Energy expenses represent the single largest cost for Bitcoin mining operations. Recent global energy price increases have hit miners particularly hard. Many operations that were profitable six months ago now struggle to break even. The situation becomes even more challenging because: Energy costs show no signs of decreasing Mining difficulty continues rising Equipment maintenance costs increase over time Cooling requirements add additional expenses What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Mining? The landscape of Bitcoin mining is undergoing significant transformation. Thiel highlighted an interesting trend where equipment manufacturers are now entering the mining space directly. This shift occurs because traditional mining companies have slowed their equipment purchases. This development suggests that the Bitcoin mining industry may be consolidating, with only the most efficient operations surviving. Can Bitcoin Mining Survive These Challenges? Despite the current difficulties, Thiel believes adaptation and innovation will determine which Bitcoin mining operations thrive. The most successful miners will likely be those who can optimize their energy efficiency and reduce operational costs. However, the current period represents a crucial test for the entire Bitcoin mining ecosystem. The Bitcoin mining industry stands at a crossroads, facing its most significant challenges since inception. While the triple threat of competition, costs, and falling revenue creates substantial pressure, it also forces innovation and efficiency improvements. The coming months will reveal which Bitcoin mining operations have the resilience and adaptability to navigate these turbulent waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main problem facing Bitcoin mining today? The main problem is the combination of three factors: intense competition from new miners, rising energy costs, and decreasing revenue from mining rewards. How does competition affect Bitcoin mining profitability? Increased competition means more miners are competing for the same block rewards, which reduces individual profitability and makes it harder to recover mining costs. Why are energy costs so important for Bitcoin mining? Energy represents the largest operational expense for Bitcoin mining. Higher energy costs directly reduce profit margins and can make mining unprofitable for many operations. What happens if Bitcoin mining becomes unprofitable? If Bitcoin mining becomes unprofitable, smaller operations may shut down, leading to industry consolidation and potentially affecting network security. Are equipment manufacturers really becoming miners themselves? Yes, according to Thiel, some equipment manufacturers are entering Bitcoin mining directly since traditional mining companies have reduced their equipment purchases. Can Bitcoin mining adapt to these challenges? Yes, through improved efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and technological innovation, Bitcoin mining can potentially overcome current challenges.

The report , titled “Digital Assets: How Can Valuation Differ From Traditional Assets?”, concluded that most of Ripple’s economic worth stems from its XRP holdings rather than its private-equity value. How Blockchain Valuations Differ from Conventional Models Houlihan Lokey’s analysis outlined how assessing blockchain companies diverges from traditional valuation methods. In conventional finance, equity ownership and cash flow typically determine worth. However, for firms built around blockchain networks, the report argued that native tokens frequently represent the primary store of value and the mechanism through which economic activity occurs. The firm observed that after the 2022 downturn, marked by exchange collapses and fraud scandals, many investors retreated from digital assets. Yet, the rebound in market confidence following Ripple’s legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), renewed institutional participation, and the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs signaled a shift back toward crypto exposure. Houlihan Lokey emphasized that, in blockchain ventures, investors often hold both equity and token positions because most of a project’s future returns are captured by its token rather than its shares. Ripple was used as a central example of this dynamic. XRP Holdings Influences Ripple’s Valuation The report highlighted that Ripple’s payments network is built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), where XRP acts as the native utility token. This link, the bank noted, ties Ripple’s financial value directly to XRP’s market price. At the time of the study, XRP traded around $0.60. Houlihan Lokey estimated that Ripple controlled roughly 46 billion XRP and maintained about $1 billion in cash and securities, assuming no liabilities. Using this data, the report modeled three valuation scenarios: Secondary-market pricing valued Ripple at $4.5 billion, implying an XRP price of $0.076 and an 84 percent discount to the underlying token value. Tender-offer pricing placed Ripple’s valuation at $11.3 billion, implying $0.224 per XRP and a 60 percent discount. Market-price alignment, using XRP’s actual price of $0.60, produced a theoretical valuation of $28.6 billion. The wide gap between these figures, the bank noted, illustrates how token fluctuations can meaningfully alter a blockchain firm’s estimated worth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Effect of Accounting Standards on Ripple’s Value Houlihan Lokey referenced the FASB ASU 2023-08 accounting rule, which requires digital assets to be reported at fair market value. If Ripple applied this standard, its XRP holdings would appear on the balance sheet at market prices rather than at cost. Under that approach, the company’s reported valuation would align closer to the upper-end figure of $28.6 billion. Applying the same methodology today yields significantly larger numbers. Ripple currently holds about 40 billion XRP, including 5 billion readily accessible tokens and 35 billion locked in escrow. With XRP recently trading around $2.44 , those tokens alone represent approximately $92 billion in value. Adding the company’s $1 billion in cash and securities brings the theoretical valuation to roughly $93 billion, more than triple the estimate from early 2024. At the Ripple Swell 2025 conference , the company announced a $500 million capital raise that lifted its private-market valuation to about $40 billion. Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse stated earlier in the year that a public listing remains a possibility, although not an immediate goal. Ripple President Monica Long later confirmed there is no timeline for an initial public offering (IPO). Houlihan Lokey’s findings highlight that Ripple’s corporate worth cannot be separated from XRP’s price. As long as the company’s core utility and assets are tied to the XRPL ecosystem, changes in XRP’s market value will continue to exert a major influence on Ripple’s perceived and reported valuation.

According to a report from CNBC, Lisa said the company’s data center unit will lead that growth with an 80% annual increase, pushing it toward tens of billions in sales by 2027. She said that forecast is based on the strength of existing deals and “customers that are currently working very closely with us.” Lisa also told analysts that AMD sees itself grabbing a double-digit share of the AI data center market over the same time frame. She framed it as a goal they are actively working toward. The AI hardware market is currently dominated by Nvidia, which holds more than 90% of the space and sits on a $4.6 trillion valuation. In comparison, AMD has a market cap around $387 billion, and Lisa made it clear they’re coming for more. AMD signs multi‑billion dollar deals to push GPU sales While Nvidia continues to rule the GPU space, AMD remains the only other serious player building this kind of AI hardware at scale. Lisa pointed to a multi-year deal with OpenAI signed in October, where the startup committed to buying billions worth of AMD’s Instinct AI chips, starting with a 1-gigawatt deployment in 2026. The agreement could also give OpenAI a 10% stake in AMD, depending on how things play out. Lisa didn’t stop there. She also mentioned fresh long-term agreements with both Oracle and Meta, showing that AMD is being actively chosen by big names. Shares of AMD have nearly doubled in 2025, even though the stock dropped 3% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the event. The decline came despite Lisa revealing a gross margin forecast between 55% and 58%, which was better than what most analysts expected. The company is also working closely with OpenAI to launch its next-gen Instinct MI400X chips, which are scheduled to ship in 2026. Lisa said these chips will be assembled into rack-scale systems, with 72 GPUs acting as one, a crucial design for massive AI workloads. This would put AMD in the same league as Nvidia, whose rack systems have already gone through three product cycles. AMD raises total AI market forecast and doubles down on CPUs Lisa laid out a new forecast: the total market for AI data center components and systems could hit $1 trillion per year by 2030, up from their previous estimate of $500 billion by 2028. That’s based on expected 40% annual growth, and the new projection now includes central processing units (CPUs) alongside GPUs. Lisa stressed that AMD’s Epyc CPUs remain the company’s best-selling product, going head-to-head with Intel and Arm-based designs in a competitive market. The company also continues making chips for game consoles, networking, and other devices. While Tuesday’s focus was AI, Lisa told shareholders not to ignore everything else. “The other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders, and that’s actually a very nice place to be,” said Lisa. This was AMD’s first financial analyst day since 2022, held as the company sits in the middle of a global AI arms race, where tech companies are spending hundreds of billions to build out AI infrastructure.

Mike said the quarter went as planned except for a setback involving what he called “a singular data center provider.” CNBC host Jim Cramer pushed harder during their live interview, saying some believed the delays were tied to multiple sites, not just one. Jim named data center facilities in Texas, Oklahoma, and North Carolina, all of which are associated with Core Scientific, the same company CoreWeave tried to acquire earlier this year for $9 billion before shareholders at Core Scientific voted against the deal. Mike did not confirm that connection. He kept repeating that the issue involved one provider. Shares of Core Scientific also closed 10% lower on Tuesday. Company sticks to one-provider explanation During CoreWeave’s quarterly earnings call on Monday, Mark Murphy, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities, asked Mike directly whether Core Scientific was the provider behind the delay. Mike declined to name the partner, and then at one point in the call, he said only one data center was affected out of 41 data centers in the company’s broader portfolio. But at another moment, Nitin Agrawal, the company’s CFO, said the issue came from “a single provider, data center provider partner.” When asked afterward how many sites were impacted, Mike allegedly told CNBC that teams were physically onsite with contractors and Core Scientific workers “every single day” trying to move construction and readiness forward after noticing the slowdown during the third quarter. He said the company responded by sending its own staff to the facilities to speed up progress and ensure the planned capacity expansion would not fall further behind schedule. Mike also told analysts that the delays would not affect the company’s backlog or prevent it from realizing the full value of signed contracts. Revenue rises, guidance falls, deal pipeline remains large CoreWeave reported $1.36 billion in revenue for its third quarter, a 134% increase from the $583.9 million posted one year earlier. Even with the strong revenue growth, the company now forecasts 2025 revenue between $5.05 billion and $5.15 billion, lower than the $5.29 billion average estimate from analysts. The lowered outlook, along with the data center delays, led JPMorgan to downgrade CoreWeave from Overweight to Neutral and reduce its December 2025 price target from $135 to $110, citing rising pressure across infrastructure supply chains. Despite the downgrade, the analysts said their view of the company’s broader long-term position “remains unchanged,” pointing to increasing demand for high-performance computing capacity across AI development and training workloads. JPMorgan also said that CoreWeave revenue growth could bounce back in early 2026, assuming the current bottlenecks resolve and planned infrastructure comes online. CoreWeave has been expanding rapidly as major tech firms compete for GPU-heavy compute. In September, the company announced a $14.2 billion AI cloud infrastructure agreement with Meta, only days after expanding its existing deal with OpenAI to $22.4 billion. Its backlog nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter to $56 billion, with new customers such as CrowdStrike, Poolside, Rakuten, and Jasper joining the platform. The delays have become an important test of how fast CoreWeave can turn demand into working infrastructure at scale. For now, Mike is choosing to hold the line: the company will not publicly blame Core Scientific, even if everyone already knows who the “single provider” is.

The earlier price for the same Digital Edition in Japan was ¥72,980, and the global price for the standard PS5 unit is $499. Orders open Thursday, and the console goes on sale November 21. This is a Japan-only product, not intended for global use. The company said it wants to make the system easier for Japanese players to afford. Hideaki Nishino, chief executive officer of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said during the livestream announcement that the company wants “many players in Japan to enjoy the PS5 and its great lineup of games.” After his statement, the livestream moved directly into details about the model and how it fits into the company’s current market strategy. Sony’s Japan-only pricing mimics Nintendo Switch 2 launch method Sony’s decision closely mimics the strategy of Nintendo, which recently released a Japan-only, Japanese-language edition of the Switch 2 alongside its global versions, which at the time helped drive the fastest launch sales the industry has seen. Nintendo has dominated the console market in Japan across several hardware generations for decades now. This price change also lands not long after Sony was forced to raise PS5 prices globally. Those increases were tied to US tariffs placed on imported goods under President Donald Trump. At the time, those tariffs pushed production and shipping costs higher, and the company said it needed to protect its margins. But in any case, Japan has been a difficult market for the PlayStation platform for years, with local tastes leaning heavily toward Nintendo’s lineup and handheld-oriented play styles. Sony’s profit forecast surges as its entertainment and camera divisions strengthen At the same time, Sony Group Corp. raised its operating profit outlook to ¥1.43 trillion ($9.3 billion) for the fiscal year ending in March, up 8% from its previous projection. That revision came after the company reported ¥429 billion in operating profit for the quarter ending in September. Those numbers beat analyst expectations. Strong performance came from several parts of the company, including entertainment and mobile camera sensors. Recent major anime film releases, including Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, contributed to increased revenue in its entertainment segment. Shares of the company surged as much as 6.7% in Tokyo on Wednesday, reaching the highest intraday level in more than a month. Along with that, Sony announced a ¥100 billion share buyback, matching a similar move from Nintendo following its Switch 2 success. The company also lifted sales and profit forecasts for its smart sensing division, which provides high-end smartphone camera sensors to companies such as Apple, even though it has recently lost some ground to Samsung in that space. Expectations for smartphone demand improved as this year’s iPhone lineup sold better than last year’s. In gaming performance, the company sold 3.9 million PS5 units in the most recent quarter, which is higher than the number sold in the same period last year. Software sales also increased, including titles from Sony’s own first-party development studios. But active PlayStation users measured 119 million, a huge decline from the previous quarter. Sony heads into the year-end sales season facing competition from Nintendo’s Switch 2, which is compatible with the entire existing Switch library and is expected to be one of the most in-demand items during holiday gift purchases in Japan and worldwide.

The deal had advanced to the due diligence stage before both parties “mutually agreed to not move forward.” News of the deal falling through has generated curiosity among crypto enthusiasts; many eyes had been monitoring its progress, as it was one of the largest deals ever for a stablecoin startup. Why did Coinbase call off the BVNK deal? Unfortunately, as at the time of this coverage, it hasn’t been made clear why the two companies chose not to move forward with the deal, even though they had both gone as far as entering into exclusivity in October, meaning the startup temporarily lost the right to entertain offers from other bidders. Had the deal gone through , Coinbase would have paid about $2 billion as acquisition price for BVNK, which is nearly double the $1.1 billion the fintech icon Stripe paid to acquire the stablecoin startup Bridge in a deal that concluded in February. “We’re continuously seeking opportunities to expand on our mission and product offerings,” said Coinbase’s spokesperson in a statement . “After discussing a potential acquisition of BVNK, both parties mutually agreed to not move forward.” The botched deal was one of the high-value acquisitions targeting stablecoin infrastructure, an area Coinbase has been spending massively on during President Trump’s second term. Back in August, the exchange acquired derivatives trading platform Deribit for $2.9 billion and maintains a close relationship with its USDC issuer, Circle. Stablecoin M&A is still at an all-time high Coinbase has been on an M&A spending spree this year, and according to Brian Armstrong, the company’s CEO, the purpose of all the wheeling and dealing is to service the company’s core focus, which revolves around trading and payments. Of course, it is not the only company doing this, and its massive deal with BVNK falling through does not affect the trend, nor does it look like it can discourage the other well-capitalized crypto natives who want to capitalize on the novel application. Over the past year, stablecoin M&A has remained a hot trend in crypto and fintech, with proponents claiming stablecoins can upscale legacy financial infrastructure, speed up cross-border payments, and reduce transaction fees. They have been around for quite some time, but the big banks are only just waking up to their merits, setting off an unprecedented scramble for innovation in the sector. Banks and the largest payments networks like Mastercard and Stripe have been exploring stablecoin acquisitions of their own. Mastercard, one of the most notable TradiFi companies to explore the stablecoin sector, previously expressed interest in acquiring BVNK but is now in discussions to acquire the crypto and stablecoin infrastructure company Zerohash for between $1.5 and $2 billion. Smaller FinTechs and crypto companies are not left out of the race either, with the likes of Modern Treasury, the late-stage payments company, spending about $40 million on acquiring the stablecoin startup Beam.

This significant transaction highlights the continued accumulation strategy of one of Ethereum’s largest holders, now controlling a staggering 355,000 ETH valued at $1.21 billion. Who Is This Mysterious Ethereum Whale? The whale address beginning with 0xE5C has been consistently building its Ethereum position through strategic withdrawals from major exchanges. This investor’s pattern reveals a long-term accumulation strategy rather than short-term trading. The same Ethereum whale previously withdrew 60,000 ETH from Binance and deposited those funds into Aave, demonstrating sophisticated portfolio management. What Does This Massive Withdrawal Signal? Large withdrawals from exchanges typically indicate several possible scenarios: Long-term holding strategy – Moving assets off exchanges suggests reduced intention to sell immediately Confidence in price appreciation – Accumulating during market fluctuations shows belief in future growth DeFi integration plans – Previous Aave deposits hint at potential yield farming strategies This Ethereum whale activity often serves as a market indicator that experienced traders watch closely. When major holders move significant amounts off exchanges, it typically reduces immediate selling pressure and can signal bullish sentiment. How Do Whale Movements Impact Ethereum’s Market? Whale transactions create substantial market effects that ripple through the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The actions of this particular Ethereum whale influence market psychology and can trigger following behaviors among smaller investors. Moreover, reduced exchange supply often precedes price increases as available liquid assets decrease. However, it’s crucial to understand that whale watching requires context. While this withdrawal appears bullish, comprehensive market analysis should consider multiple factors including: Overall market trends and sentiment Broader cryptocurrency adoption rates Regulatory developments affecting Ethereum Technical analysis of price charts What Can Retail Investors Learn From This Ethereum Whale? While most investors don’t have billions to move markets, there are valuable lessons from observing this Ethereum whale ‘s behavior. The consistent accumulation pattern demonstrates conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Additionally, the strategic movement between exchanges and DeFi protocols shows sophisticated asset management that retail investors can emulate on smaller scales. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing often involves: Patience and long-term perspective Strategic accumulation during market dips Proper security practices for stored assets Diversification across different protocols Conclusion: Understanding the Big Picture The recent movements by this substantial Ethereum whale provide fascinating insights into high-level cryptocurrency strategy. While individual transactions shouldn’t dictate investment decisions, they offer valuable context about market sentiment and large investor behavior. The continued accumulation of Ethereum by major holders suggests underlying confidence in the network’s future despite short-term market volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What is a cryptocurrency whale? A cryptocurrency whale is an individual or entity that holds large amounts of a particular digital asset, enough to potentially influence market prices through their trading activities. Why do whales move assets off exchanges? Whales typically move assets off exchanges for long-term storage, enhanced security, participation in DeFi protocols, or to reduce immediate selling pressure on markets. How can I track whale movements? You can monitor whale activity through blockchain explorers like Etherscan, specialized tracking platforms like Whale Alert, or on-chain analysis tools that identify large transactions. Should I follow whale investment strategies? While observing whale movements provides valuable market insights, always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. What risks do whale movements create? Large whale transactions can cause price volatility, create temporary liquidity issues, and sometimes trigger cascading effects in leveraged positions across exchanges. How significant is this particular Ethereum whale? This whale holds approximately 0.3% of all circulating Ethereum, making them one of the largest individual holders and their movements particularly noteworthy for market analysts.

This trend is now rippling through the bond market. Bonds issued by leading “hyperscalers”—tech giants such as Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Oracle Corp. , which are heavily investing in massive data centre projects—have declined in recent weeks. Such bonds are yielding 0.78 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to Bank of America data — the most since April, when volatility erupted in markets following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. In September, the spread was only 0.5 percentage points — a notable shift in investor attitudes. The widening spread reflects growing investor unease over the way tech giants are turning to debt markets to finance their massive investments in AI infrastructure. “The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management. Trillion-dollar AI buildout raises debt and energy concerns JPMorgan estimates that building AI infrastructure will cost more than $5 trillion, requiring financing from every corner of public and private markets—ranging from traditional bonds to private credit and even potential government participation. The enormous scale of AI investment has raised concerns over potential overcapacity, long-term profitability, and energy consumption. Tech titans Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are expected to spend more than $400 billion on data centres in 2026, on top of over $350 billion this year. Large tech firms, including mainstream tech companies, are increasing their borrowing for AI-related infrastructure, despite holding around $350 billion in liquid assets. Analysts estimate that the companies may produce $725 billion in operating cash flow by 2026. Yet, despite this strong position of liquidity, a flood of debt from such high-rated issuers is chasing new money into credit markets, indicative of a wider push towards more leverage to fuel the AI capital expenditure boom. In recent weeks, Meta, Alphabet, and Oracle have each hit the bond market with massive offerings—some extending up to 40 years in maturity. Meta last month secured a $27 billion private debt deal with investors, including Pimco and Blue Owl Capital, to finance its “Hyperion” data centre in Louisiana. The company followed that up with a $30 billion bond sale at the end of October—the largest corporate bond issuance since 2023. Alphabet issued $25 billion in bonds in early November, including $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $7.5 billion in Europe. Meanwhile, Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds in September to fund infrastructure leases such as OpenAI’s “Stargate” data centre in Abilene, Texas. Oracle’s bonds under pressure Analysts say Oracle’s debt has been particularly hard hit. A Financial Times index tracking Oracle’s bonds issued before its latest sale has dropped nearly 5% since mid-September, compared to a 1% decline for the broader Ice Data Services index of U.S. high-grade tech debt. Oracle now has approximately $96 billion in long-term debt, accumulated through deals to lease computing power to the makers of ChatGPT. This OpenAI collaboration is expected to generate $300 billion in revenue over five years. However, Moody’s has cautioned that there are risks associated with Oracle’s dependence on a handful of AI firms to aid growth. Some analysts view the recent sell-off as a healthy sign of price discovery in a new credit cycle. George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group, noted that as long as they are still pricing incremental risk, it’s a good sign. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Her comments come a day after the central bank released a set of long-awaited proposals for regulating systemic stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies and designed for use in everyday payments. Breeden recalls 2023 stress lessons from SVB and Circle depeg The proposal states individual holdings of stablecoins would be limited to £20,000 and require issuers to deposit 40% of the assets backing their tokens with the Bank of England, where they would earn no interest. According to Breeden , the proposed deposit requirement was based on lessons from past stress events, such as the March 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. At the time, even the USDC stablecoin issued by Circle briefly lost its $1 peg after $3.3 billion of its reserves were trapped at the failed bank when depositors rushed to withdraw funds. “Look at what happened with SVB, with Circle – those numbers are broadly in line with that,” she said. “That’s why we’re proposing 40% rather than a smaller number.” Breeden is also in support of the temporary cap of £20,000 per person and £10 million for most businesses, stating that such limits would halve the stress on banks and credit creation caused by deposit outflows into stablecoins. In a banking system like Britain’s, where around 85% of mortgages and consumer loans are funded directly through bank deposits, such a shift could constrict credit availability, she noted. “We have a different set of risks to manage as we transition to bringing in this new form of money,” Breeden said, contrasting the UK’s bank-dependent financial structure with the non-bank finance markets in the United States, which are relatively larger and more liquid than the UK’s. The Bank of England’s latest framework replaces a 2023 plan that would have forced stablecoin issuers to hold 100% of reserves as unremunerated deposits at the central bank, a proposal that industry participants had called unworkable. Diverging path between the US and the UK Breeden’s remarks highlight how differently the United Kingdom is treating stablecoins compared to the United States, where US regulators and the President Donald Trump-led administration have taken a more permissive view of stablecoins and crypto innovation. The current administration has even advanced legislation, such as the GENIUS Act to make extensive provisions for stablecoins as well as their issuers. The Bank’s proposals cover only systemic stablecoins, those intended for use in retail and wholesale payments, leaving the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to supervise non-systemic tokens used primarily for crypto trading. Breeden also stressed the importance of ensuring that consumers can identify which coins are genuinely backed by safe assets and which are not. Without naming specific issuers, she pointed to the global dominance of dollar-based stablecoins such as Tether and Circle, making a reference to El Salvador, where Tether moved its headquarters to earlier this year. Bank of England wants to balance stability and innovation While industry groups continue to say that the proposed caps and liquidity rules could negatively impact the sector’s growth as other parts of the world continue to advance and adopt friendlier regulations, Breeden stated that banks and stablecoin issuers will need to adapt. If stablecoins gain traction, she said, the bank would expect lenders to develop new wholesale funding sources to replace lost deposits. The Bank of England has stated that it will not remove the £20,000 cap until it is satisfied that doing so poses no threat to financial stability.

This dramatic shift indicates changing market dynamics that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital barometer for market sentiment, and this recent decline suggests we might be entering a period of Bitcoin dominance. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Measure? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index provides a clear snapshot of market performance by comparing the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. This important metric excludes stablecoins and wrapped coins to give us a pure view of market dynamics. The index operates on a simple but powerful principle: when 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, we officially enter an altcoin season. The current reading of 26 sits far below the 75 threshold needed to declare an altcoin season. This significant gap tells us that most alternative cryptocurrencies are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. Understanding this Altcoin Season Index movement helps investors make informed decisions about their portfolio allocations. Why Should You Care About This 4-Point Drop? The four-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index represents more than just a number change. It signals a potential shift in market leadership from altcoins back to Bitcoin. Several factors could be driving this movement: Increased institutional Bitcoin interest through ETF approvals Market uncertainty driving investors toward established assets Regulatory developments affecting smaller cryptocurrencies more significantly Risk aversion during periods of economic uncertainty This Altcoin Season Index movement suggests that traders are becoming more cautious about speculative altcoin investments. The index serves as an early warning system for changing market conditions. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Smart investors use the Altcoin Season Index as part of their broader market analysis toolkit. When the index reads below 50, it typically indicates Bitcoin season dominance. However, this doesn’t mean you should completely avoid altcoins. Instead, consider these strategic approaches: Increase Bitcoin exposure during low Altcoin Season Index periods Research fundamentally strong altcoins that may recover quickly Dollar-cost average into promising projects during market dips Monitor the index for signs of reversal above 50 The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 26 suggests that patience and selective investing may be the wisest approach. Remember that market conditions can change rapidly, and the index provides real-time guidance for these shifts. What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Current Levels Historical analysis of the Altcoin Season Index reveals interesting patterns. Periods with readings below 30 have often preceded significant market movements. However, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. The cryptocurrency market evolves constantly, and each cycle brings new dynamics. Previous instances where the Altcoin Season Index dropped to similar levels have typically lasted several weeks to months. During these periods, Bitcoin often demonstrates relative strength while altcoins consolidate or decline. This current movement in the Altcoin Season Index aligns with traditional market rotation patterns seen in other asset classes. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors The Altcoin Season Index decline to 26 provides valuable insights for market participants. First, it confirms that Bitcoin continues to maintain its leadership position in the cryptocurrency space. Second, it suggests that altcoin investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making new investments. Most importantly, the Altcoin Season Index reminds us that cryptocurrency markets move in cycles. While we’re currently in a Bitcoin-dominant phase, conditions can change quickly. Successful investors maintain balanced portfolios and use tools like the Altcoin Season Index to inform their decisions rather than dictate them. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps identify market trends and investor sentiment shifts. How often does the index update? The index updates daily, providing current market conditions and trend analysis for cryptocurrency investors. What does a score of 26 mean? A score of 26 indicates that only 26% of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting strong Bitcoin dominance in the current market. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. The index provides context for market conditions, but investment decisions should consider your strategy, risk tolerance, and research on individual projects. How accurate is the Altcoin Season Index for predicting trends? While helpful for identifying current market conditions, the index works best when combined with other analysis tools and shouldn’t be used alone for predictions. Can the index help with timing investments? It can provide context for market cycles, but successful investing typically involves long-term strategies rather than short-term timing based on single indicators. Found this analysis helpful?

Reports indicate that the regulators’ decision demonstrates the country’s commitment to strengthening digital finance regulations. It also highlights a significant shift in how digital assets in the UK can be traded, cleared, and settled, establishing a significant step towards creating advanced regulated market systems. With this approval, ClearToken solidifies its position as the 57th company to secure approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since the start of the UK’s Cryptoasset Register on January 10, 2020. The FCA approves ClearToken’s cryptocurrency settlement platform ClearToken announced on Tuesday that it had obtained approval from the FCA to operate CT Settle, its Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement platform. Following this approval , analysts noted that the platform will enable users to effectively spot trading stablecoins , regular currencies, and crypto assets. Additionally, they said that once CT Settle is operational, regulated financial institutions will have access to a digital asset settlement system that complies with certain regulatory standards, similar to traditional financial systems. When reporters reached out to ClearToken to comment on the topic of discussion, the company stated that the primary goal of CT Settle is to eliminate obstacles that institutions are reluctant to adopt digital assets, particularly due to concerns over counterparty risk, market efficiency, and liquidity. Niki Beattie, the chair of ClearToken, also weighed in on the situation. As a strategic expert in financial market structure with over 30 years of experience in technology and capital markets, Beattie acknowledged that this authorisation will catalyse the widespread adoption of digital assets. The FCA’s decision to approve ClearToken marks an emerging trend in the UK, where relevant companies are incorporating digital assets into the regular financial system. The UK government intends to integrate digital assets into mainstream finance Reliable sources reported that the Bank of England initiated discussions regarding stablecoins earlier this week and is seeking feedback on new rules that might be implemented next year. This announcement followed reports that the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, had softened his stance on the potential risks that stablecoins pose to financial stability, demonstrating a more pragmatic approach towards regulation. This move comes as individuals raise concerns about the UK falling behind other countries in adopting stablecoins. These worries escalate particularly because the UK is lagging behind the US, which has advanced with the GENIUS Act . Meanwhile, HM Treasury published a draft policy paper in April, outlining its plans to regulate crypto assets. This document aims to describe specific types of digital assets with precision, including crucial activities such as issuance, custody, and trading, while adhering to the UK regulatory framework. The UK government has also made the market for crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) accessible to everyday investors, indicating a broader effort to integrate digital assets into mainstream finance.

While giants such as Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) continue to be huge long-term hold assets, attention is being drawn to newer, high-growth coins that are significantly undervalued compared to their utilizable worth. It is here that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts attention. Valued at a considerably low price of $0.035, MUTM coin is making headlines as one of the best cryptos to buy at the moment, thanks to increasing use cases within DeFi credit markets, tokenized lending systems, as well as a hot presale phase which has garnered substantial interest from investors. With a forecast of a huge 10x-50x price appreciation as it becomes a public asset, Mutuum Finance is increasingly becoming the top crypto to hold before the start of a huge market rally. Cardano (ADA) Stalled at Strong Support as Market Conditions Remain Unclear Cardano (ADA) is presently supported at the level of $0.50, but buyers have not demonstrated adequate strength for a change in trend. A breach of this level would mean a fall to about $0.40, demonstrating the token’s volatility in a stabilization environment. But a breakthrough at $0.61 could mean a rise to $0.75, a level beyond which a possible correction could follow. The condition of ADA, though cautious, lingers behind some of the prominent altcoins, as investors increasingly search for alternatives having potent initial development, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a token witnessing a dramatically growing DeFi ecosystem and becoming one of the best cryptos to buy for early adopters. XRP Extends Consolidation Around Significant Support-Level The current status for Ripple (XRP) indicates a consolidation phase surrounding the $2.16 level, implying a possible upcoming recovery as long as the purchase momentum picks up. Observers are particularly interested in the $2.36–$2.43 region, as a return to this level could potentially set the stage for a rise towards $2.78. Nevertheless, a breach of the $2.16 level could bring about a significant downturn, making investors cautious about the upcoming period. Meanwhile, XRP is facing this complicated market condition, investors have become interested in newer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has continued to receive attention concerning the novel DeFi ecosystem and is widely regarded as the top crypto to watch in 2025. Mutuum Finance is Close to Reaching a Full Capacity Level in Current Phase Mutuum Finance is progressing quite well in the DeFi market, as it is about to enter Phase 7 of its presale, which will reach the maximum limit soon. The tokens can be bought for $0.035, making it the best investment opportunity for buyers as the token price will increase by 20% in Phase 7 to $0.04. After five successful presale phases, Mutuum Finance has become one of the most awaited crypto launches of 2025. The presale event has so far raised over $18.58 million from more than 17,850 investors, undoubtedly marking worldwide acceptance of the project concept. Its transparency, innovation, and sustainable model have brought MUTM into the limelight as one of the best cryptos to buy as the next bull market draws near, cementing its reputation as a top crypto in early-stage DeFi. Stablecoin Launch to Transform DeFi Among the upcoming milestones for Mutuum Finance is the development and deployment of a collateralized stablecoin, which will be pegged to the value of the US dollar. The stablecoin will form the basis for lending on the Mutuum Finance platform. By integrating stable assets into their transactions, Mutuum Finance will be able to offer returns to all of its members, from the common trader to the institutional investors. The development of such a stablecoin increases the strength of Mutuum Finance, making MUTM one of the best cryptos to buy for utility-focused investors. Mutuum Finance has so far raised over $18.58 million from more than 17,850 investors, with the presale’s Phase 6 being close to sold out at $0.035. The fact that the token has a genuine DeFi use case, under-collateralized lending, tokenized lending, as well as a planned stablecoin, means MUTM has huge upside potential as an investment and is considered the top crypto for early investors. The upcoming presale price for Phase 7, at $0.04, is the last chance investment opportunity. Acquire MUTM tokens today in the presale so you can be ready for the next crypto bull market, which may bring 10x-50x returns and establish MUTM as the next big crypto in the DeFi market.

54289062,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=852133,1762909202,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54289062.jpeg,Most Reliable Bitcoin Boom Indicator Just Went Off-Script: Expert,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/most-reliable-bitcoin-boom-indicator-off-script/,"Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony “The Bull” Severino argues that Bitcoin’s most dependable macro tell—the copper-to-gold ratio—has broken character at the very moment the market typically enters a parabolic phase, leaving the post-halving script in disarray and altcoins without their usual rotation. Why The Copper/Gold Ratio Is Crucial For Bitcoin In a 16-minute video analysis published on November 10, Severino frames the copper/gold ratio as a “growth versus fear index,” where copper strength signals expansion, rising yields and appetite for risk, while gold outperformance maps to recession risk, falling yields and risk-off behavior. “When gold is performing better than copper, it typically means economic slowdown [and] general recession fears,” he said, adding that copper’s industrial demand anchors the ratio to the business cycle. The punchline: the ratio’s cyclical turn that historically coincides with Bitcoin’s vertical phase simply never arrived. “They say the most dangerous thing to say in investing is that this time is different. Well, this time is different,” Severino said. “The business cycle based on the copper versus gold ratio did not turn back up.” Severino contends that the four-year halving lore is at best incomplete and at worst misattributed. He overlays prior halving dates with a Fisher Transform signal on the copper/gold ratio and observes that the true inflection has historically been macro, not supply-driven. “I never really thought it was the halving,” he said. “The same halving date started a bull run in the Nasdaq the halving in Bitcoin would not really have any effect on tech stocks.” In his construction, the halving has coincided with, rather than caused, the ratio’s upswing and a risk-on impulse that typically propels Bitcoin beyond prior highs into a final, parabolic leg. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? Key Reasons Explained This cycle diverged. After briefly producing a “higher high” in the ratio—the first since roughly 2010—copper/gold failed to establish a higher low and instead printed “another lower low,” marking, in Severino’s words, the lowest reading in about 15 years on his chart—“since pretty much since the Great Recession.” The Fisher Transform that had historically flipped up to confirm the risk-on window never delivered the full follow-through. “It was supposed to send Bitcoin into the final stage of its parabolic rally […] we didn’t go parabolic after going above all-time high. We’re just kind of meandering sideways.” Is The Bitcoin Cycle Top In? Timing-wise, that failure matters. Severino measures roughly a year between the ratio’s go-signal and Bitcoin’s cycle top in prior episodes. By that yardstick, “we really should have topped” already or, if anchored to the March breakout above the 2021 high, would at least be entering a risk-off window. But without the definitive risk-on impulse, the cycle landmarks blur. “Because we didn’t get the full risk on, I don’t know where the risk off signal is,” he said. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Analysis: Pre-Rally Signals Point To $180,000 Target In Q1 2026 The implications extend to altcoins and Bitcoin dominance. Historically, the ratio’s green “risk-on” phase lined up with “alt season,” but this time the setup never materialized. “You normally get your alt season at these green points […] We didn’t get it here,” Severino said, noting Bitcoin dominance is holding key support on higher-timeframe views. He also highlights an “extremely strong negative correlation” between Bitcoin and the copper/gold ratio at present; in past cycles, correlation drifting toward zero tended to coincide with altseason. “None of the conditions for altcoin season seem to be here based on past economic signals,” he added. Severino stops short of a deterministic call. The ratio’s trend structure is ambiguous—one failed breakout from a long downtrend does not make an uptrend—and the Fisher signal could still turn. But until it does, he argues, macro says caution. “We’re still in the fear sort of side of this ratio. We need to still be defensive and we should be risk off. When this starts to turn back up, we can consider being bullish risk assets again.” That ambiguity, he suggests, is precisely why Bitcoin’s post-ATH drift has defied the well-worn four-year narrative: “It just didn’t do the same thing as it did in the past […] We are different. It is genuinely different this time.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,486.

Related Reading: Hedera Hashgraph Added To Google BigQuery Public Datasets The new guidance, issued under Revenue Procedure 2025-31, allows ETFs and trusts holding proof-of-stake (PoS) assets such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to stake their holdings and distribute staking rewards directly to investors, without jeopardizing their tax status. U.S. Treasury Opens Door for Crypto ETF Staking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the advances as a major step in keeping the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain innovation. The framework introduces a “ safe harbor ” for regulated funds, clarifying how staking rewards will be taxed and distributed. Investors will now pay taxes only when they take control of rewards, while the ETFs themselves remain exempt from trust-level taxation. Industry experts hailed the decision as the final piece of regulatory clarity needed to unlock institutional participation in staking. Analysts estimate the change could bring $3 billion to $6 billion in new inflows to staking-based crypto products within the next year. Strict Compliance Rules for Fund Managers To qualify under the new framework, ETFs must meet specific conditions. Funds can only hold a single digital asset and cash, work with qualified custodians for key management, and engage independent staking providers to handle validator operations. This structure ensures investor protection while bridging traditional finance and decentralized blockchain systems. It mirrors earlier SEC approvals from September 2025, which cleared listing rules for crypto ETFs and confirmed that certain staking operations do not constitute unregistered securities. Bill Hughes, senior counsel at Consensys, said the policy “eliminates the biggest legal and tax uncertainty that kept institutions from integrating staking into regulated products.” The guidance, he added, gives fund sponsors confidence to offer yield-bearing ETFs that generate passive income for investors through network validation. From Policy Uncertainty to Passive Income Until now, U.S. fund managers had avoided staking due to regulatory ambiguity and fear of losing favorable tax treatment. With this guidance, both retail and institutional investors can earn 3–7% annual staking rewards on assets like ETH and SOL through ETFs, without running their own nodes or managing wallets. The announcement follows weeks of government inactivity during the record 40-day U.S. shutdown , making it one of the first major regulatory actions since the reopening. It signals a return to policy momentum and a broader embrace of digital assets by Washington. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dump Finally Over?

The Scion Asset Management founder said that the major cloud and AI infrastructure companies, what he called “hyperscalers,” are bending accounting rules to make their earnings look stronger than they really are. Burry warns of overstated profits in ORCL, META through 2028 In a post Monday on X, Burry said these tech giants are understating depreciation expenses by pretending their AI chips and servers will last longer than they actually do. “Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings—one of the more common frauds of the modern era,” he wrote. Burry added that companies massively increasing capital spending on Nvidia chips and servers with two-to-three-year product cycles should not be extending the lifespan of that hardware on paper. Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, this accounting method will understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the AI industry. He said Oracle’s profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and Meta’s by about 21% by 2028. Burry’s accusation points at how GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) lets companies decide the “useful life” of an asset. When a business buys big-ticket equipment like servers or semiconductors, it spreads the cost over several years. If the company claims those assets last longer, the annual depreciation expense becomes smaller, which makes profits appear larger. Burry said this practice distorts the truth about how quickly AI infrastructure loses value. CNBC reported it was unable to independently verify whether these companies are doing this. Burry doubles down with new shorts and industry backlash Burry, famous for betting against the housing market before the 2008 financial crisis, had last week revealed new put options against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, with about $187 million in puts against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir, though the exact strike prices and expiration dates weren’t listed in his SEC filing. Cryptopolitan later reported that Alex Karp, the Palantir CEO, hit back at Burry’s bet, calling it “super weird” and “bats— crazy.” Despite his comments, Nvidia stock surged nearly 6% on Monday after a 7% crash last week, while Palantir rose by 9% following an 11% decline before. But Tuesday was not so good for Nvidia’s stock, specifically SoftBank announced it had sold its entire stake in what is the most valuable company on earth (about 32.1 million shares worth $5.83 billion). That made NVDA lose around 3% while SoftBank itself had slid by more than 7% as Wednesday.

If Republicans vote for him, Deaton would gain the party’s ballot line, a significant boost to his campaign heading into November. Deaton’s introduction to national politics came as he followed a plethora of news stories in the case filed against Ripple Labs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He was one of thousands of XRP investors who claimed they believed the SEC had harmed ordinary people with its delayed actions. Over the years, his work and the criticism he has heaped upon federal agencies have made him a figure of authority to many crypto investors on what is known as “Crypto Twitter.” Massachusetts remains a tough political ground for him. The state has one of the most reliably Democratic electorates in the country. Deaton lost to Warren in 2024 by almost 20 percentage points. Deaton paints himself as the reform candidate Deaton is defining his new campaign as a larger effort focused on government accountability, transparency, and economic equity . His website addresses issues such as supporting working families, combating inflation, improving services for veterans, and enhancing public safety. Unlike his last race, crypto isn’t the basis of his platform. This strategic shift appears deliberate. Five years later, in 2024, Deaton is running as an unabashed crypto rights candidate at a time when the industry thought it was fighting for regulatory existence. His race against Warren — a vocal critic of digital assets — spurred donors and online supporters to action. But circumstances have changed. The friendlier tone of the second Trump administration toward digital asset policy has alleviated some anxieties in the industry. By contrast, Sen. Markey, who is not a pro-crypto stalwart, lacks the same national profile or emotional impact in the crypto industry that Warren holds. That means, political analysts say, that Deaton will need to start reaching out more broadly, especially to independents and working-class conservatives outside the state’s urban centres. Crypto plays less of a visible role this time Although crypto is less visible in his campaign messaging, the industry remains associated with his brand and fundraising operation. His campaign donation page accepts donations in a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. His bio also mentions his previous defence of XRP’s investors and his criticism of how the SEC is handling this endeavour. One major variable that could determine how far his campaign gets: backing from one of crypto’s big political action committees, notably Fairshake. Against that backdrop, the PAC invested tens of millions in Senate and House races in 2024, influencing outcomes in states with close margins. Deaton has publicly expressed his belief that he could win if Fairshake and other industry groups decide to invest in the race. Last year, however, Fairshake did not support his race against Warren and instead sought to target races in battleground states. To date, the PAC has not indicated that it will support him in 2026. Without that support, Deaton could be at a disadvantage in matching Sen. Markey’s fundraising muscle — the senator has deep ties to both state and national Democratic donor networks. It’s still early in the race. Deaton needs first to gain the support of the state GOP, continue growing his grassroots base, and demonstrate that he can become more than just a candidate adored by crypto advocates. If he is successful, the race could once again draw national attention.

54289510,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/the-importance-of-education-and-awareness-in-improving-cryptos-public-perception,1762909924,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/54289510.jpeg,The Importance of Education and Awareness in Improving Crypto’s Public Perception,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/the-importance-of-education-and-awareness-in-improving-cryptos-public-perception,"As blockchain technology and cryptocurrency become more prevalent in mainstream finance and society, the need for clear, effective education and awareness is growing. Many people are still unfamiliar with basic blockchain and crypto concepts like digital wallets, NFTs, and crypto exchanges. Increasing public knowledge of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies is an important initiative to assist people new to these concepts in dispelling myths and reducing public scepticism. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Knowledge Gaps There exist many gaps in public understanding of blockchain technology. Recent studies have indicated that more than 70% of American adults do not invest in cryptocurrency since nearly half of non-investors lack the basic understanding of how it works. In addition, nearly 60% can define cryptocurrency, and roughly 80% have difficulty explaining the basics of blockchain infrastructure. These gaps further worsen the barriers to integrating blockchain technology into mainstream financial systems and society, and lead to unavoidable issues such as vulnerabilities to scams, technology misuse, and investment losses. Education Through Entertainment and Gamification Bridging knowledge gaps in blockchain understanding requires creative and strategic educational approaches. One such approach is using entertainment platforms such as iGaming to introduce people to basic blockchain and crypto concepts while they play. Play-to-earn systems made possible by the blockchain and casual mobile app crypto games make the learning experience interactive and demystify crypto mechanics through gameplay. Online casinos are great examples of how entertainment and gaming not only introduce people to crypto concepts but also help to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Many online casinos support various cryptocurrencies, allowing players to gain experience with Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Players exploring online gaming casinos with Cardplayer get to experience gamified rewards and utilise the fast, secure payment systems powered by cryptocurrencies. The Importance of Community Learning Resources In addition to gamified learning resources, many free community learning resources have started providing crypto education to the public. These resources are often created by crypto industry experts and advocates with the intent of enabling decentralised education. Free resources such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer structured online educational programs, while online communities, such as BitcoinTalk and Reddit, provide community-driven forums and posts created by industry experts. These community resources are crucial tools required for increasing accessibility to crypto education. Educational Programs Offered by Traditional Educational Institutions In addition to community-led educational resources, many traditional educational institutions are now offering accredited crypto academic programs. These programs include full online and in-person courses on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency that are created by industry experts and developers. Accredited academic courses are playing an important role in legitimising crypto education and increasing public trust in crypto services. Major universities and educational institutions like MIT, Duke, and NYU provide crypto education with scholarly credibility, as these institutions validate blockchain and crypto learning as a new field of computer science. The Role of Media in Crypto Education The media plays an important role in changing the negative perceptions of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Leveraging media platforms provides a convenient way to reach the broader public and educate people on crypto through the means of documentaries, news features, and talk shows. Mainstream media’s ubiquity and accessibility provide an unobtrusive entry point for blockchain technology and crypto education. These platforms allow for knowledge to be packaged in bite-sized and balanced educational resources. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The dramatic increase has prompted comparisons to digital assets, with analysts exploring how such a gain would translate for cryptocurrencies like XRP. Gold’s Market Value Surged by Over $700 Billion in a Day Over the past week, gold prices have recovered sharply from a low of $3,928 per ounce on November 4, climbing above $4,000 and posting four consecutive daily advances. On November 10, the asset saw its steepest single-day increase since early May, rising 2.85 % to close near $4,115 per ounce. Data from the World Gold Council show that global above-ground gold reserves currently total about 216,265 metric tons, equivalent to 6.954 billion ounces. Using those figures, gold’s estimated market capitalization at the start of November 10 stood near $27.85 trillion, based on the $4,005 opening price. By the close of the day, the value of those reserves reached approximately $28.62 trillion, reflecting a one-day increase of $765.1 billion. This sharp expansion underscores gold’s continued strength as a global store of value amid changing market conditions. XRP’s Market Potential Under a Similar Condition For context, even the entire cryptocurrency market, valued at roughly $3.48 trillion, has not experienced a single-day increase on the scale of gold’s $765 billion surge. The largest daily market-wide gain in recent weeks was about $203 billion, recorded on October 12 during a 5.57 % rise across major tokens. On November 10, XRP also performed well, appreciating 6.76 %, surpassing gold’s percentage gain. However, due to its smaller overall valuation, the move translated to a more modest $9.6 billion addition, bringing its market capitalization to $151.82 billion. To assess the implications of a comparable $765 billion rise for XRP, it helps to apply the same scale of market growth. If XRP’s valuation expanded by that amount from its current level of about $146.88 billion, its market capitalization would reach approximately $911.88 billion. With an estimated 60 billion XRP tokens in circulation, a total valuation of $911.88 billion would correspond to a theoretical price of roughly $15.20 per token. This figure does not represent a forecast but a mathematical extrapolation based on gold’s one-day performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The comparison highlights how market capitalization changes directly affect token pricing in finite-supply digital assets. While such an increase is unlikely to occur within a single trading session, it provides insight into the potential scale of XRP’s valuation under extreme liquidity conditions. Analyst Expectations and Broader Market Context Interestingly, several market analysts have cited $15 as a realistic long-term target for XRP under favorable conditions. Commentators, including Vincent Van Code, CryptoInsightUK, and EGRAG Crypto, have all suggested similar price levels, referencing macroeconomic trends and growing institutional adoption. While XRP’s daily market movements remain influenced by broader crypto volatility, gold’s latest surge serves as a useful benchmark for understanding how large-scale capital inflows could affect digital-asset valuations if comparable momentum ever reached the sector. Gold’s $765 billion daily increase underscores the magnitude of value shifts that can occur in high-liquidity markets. Applying the same growth scale to XRP would place its price near $15 , aligning with some analysts’ long-term projections. Although such an outcome remains hypothetical, it illustrates the vast potential that large-scale investment inflows could have on digital-asset capitalization.

Despite uncertainty among traders, key on-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that a new surge may be brewing — provided current momentum continues to build. According to top analyst MorenoDV, Bitcoin is entering a liquidity configuration that has only appeared a handful of times since 2020, each marking a pivotal turning point in the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. He explains that when stablecoin reserves reach extreme levels relative to Bitcoin’s market cap, the market rarely stays quiet for long. This setup typically signals an imbalance between available liquidity and Bitcoin’s valuation — meaning that a large pool of “dry powder” is sitting on the sidelines, waiting to be deployed. Historically, such conditions have preceded strong directional moves, either upward or downward, depending on how confidence returns to the market. Stablecoin Liquidity Suggests a Critical Turning Point for Bitcoin According to MorenoDV, one of the most important indicators to watch right now is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) — a metric that compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total market cap of all stablecoins. When SSR drops, it means stablecoin liquidity is expanding relative to Bitcoin’s value — or, in simpler terms, there’s more “dry powder” sitting on the sidelines waiting to be deployed. Currently, the SSR has fallen back to its lower historical range around 13, the same zone that marked market bottoms in mid-2021 and again throughout 2024. In each of those instances, Bitcoin was consolidating quietly before launching into strong recovery rallies. A similar pattern can be seen in the Binance Bitcoin/Stablecoin Reserve Ratio, which shows stablecoin reserves rising while BTC reserves continue to decline. This dynamic often signals that investors are positioning capital for accumulation — a sign of seller exhaustion and structural capitulation where weak hands exit, and strong hands begin quietly rebuilding positions. MorenoDV notes that from a risk/reward standpoint, these phases historically present asymmetric opportunities — limited downside, but expanding upside as liquidity rotates back into Bitcoin. Still, this zone acts as both an accumulation opportunity and a final support line. If these liquidity levels hold, Bitcoin could soon see another upward impulse toward new highs. But if they break decisively, it may confirm the end of the current cycle’s structure and trigger a deeper revaluation phase before the next growth leg begins. Holding the Line Above $100K Bitcoin continues to defend the $100K–$105K range, a key structural zone that has served as both support and consolidation throughout the cycle. On the weekly chart, BTC remains above its 50-week moving average (blue line) — a level that has historically acted as a springboard for mid-cycle recoveries. The current candle shows a mild rebound after testing the $104K region, signaling that bulls are attempting to regain control. However, volume remains subdued compared to previous rallies, indicating a cautious tone among market participants following recent liquidations. A decisive close above $108K–$110K would strengthen bullish momentum and confirm a potential continuation toward the $115K–$120K resistance zone. Conversely, losing the 50-week MA could trigger a retest of lower supports near $95K–$98K, marking a deeper correction phase. Despite the mixed sentiment, the structure remains intact within a broader uptrend. The long-term moving averages — particularly the 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) — continue to slope upward, confirming that Bitcoin’s macro trend is still bullish.

Bitcoin Apparent Demand Has Flipped Positive Recently In a new post on X, Julio Moreno, head of research at on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, has talked about the latest trend in the Apparent Demand for Bitcoin. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the amount of spot demand that’s currently present for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark The indicator’s value is calculated by taking the difference between BTC’s production and changes in its inventory. “Production” here refers to the amount that miners are introducing into circulation each day. Similarly, the asset’s “inventory” is the amount stashed away in the 1-year inactive supply. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows how the 30-day sum of the Apparent Demand has changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day sum of the Bitcoin Apparent Demand fell into the negative territory last month, suggesting demand for the asset was decreasing. Recently, however, the metric has witnessed a sharp surge back into the positive territory. Thus, it would appear that, for the first time since early October, demand for BTC is growing again. While spot buying demand may be growing now, attention over in the perpetual futures market is down. As on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post, the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest has remained at low levels since last month’s leverage flush. The Futures Open Interest here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to Bitcoin that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. From the chart, it’s visible this metric saw a huge plunge in October as the drawdown in the BTC price liquidated a large amount of positions. The indicator has remained at its lows since this decline, indicating that there isn’t much speculative buildup happening in the market. “Derivatives activity has slowed materially, mirroring the broader backdrop of subdued market sentiment,” noted Glassnode. Related Reading: XRP Jumps To $2.56 Despite 240% Increase In Profit Taking Another side of the sector where demand has been weak is the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As the chart shared by Glassnode in a separate X post shows, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs have mostly seen outflows since early October. “This trend points to a broader de-risking phase among ETF investors,” explained the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced some of its latest recovery as its price has come down to $103,200.

Fortune reported the companies were in late-stage discussions pending due diligence, and the firms entered exclusivity in October, which barred BVNK from engaging other bidders. It was not immediately clear why the deal collapsed. The deal was expected to be closed later this year or early next, given the pace of diligence and the exclusivity terms. Coinbase has ended acquisition talks with U.K.-based stablecoin infrastructure firm BVNK, which had been valued at around $2 billion. A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that the two companies entered an exclusivity period in October and conducted due diligence, but… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 11, 2025 Coinbase didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Coinbase Deal Collapse Terminates What Could Have Been Largest Stablecoin Acquisition Yet The move ends what would have been one of the largest stablecoin-focused acquisitions to date. BVNK helps customers use stablecoins for payments and cross-border transfers, and had become a target as exchanges and payments companies race to build settlement rails around dollar-linked tokens. For scale, Stripe paid about $1.1b to acquire stablecoin startup Bridge in a deal that closed in February. At $2b, the BVNK purchase would have nearly doubled that price tag. Coinbase’s interest came with an inside view. Coinbase Ventures is an investor in BVNK, alongside Haun Ventures, Tiger Global, and the venture arms of Visa and Citi. BVNK raised $50m in December and was valued at roughly $750m at the time. BVNK May Attract New Suitors After Coinbase Walks Away From $2B Deal Fortune previously noted both Coinbase and Mastercard were in advanced discussions about a BVNK deal , signaling strong demand for assets that can speed settlement and lower costs in global payments. The decision now removes a key uncertainty from Coinbase’s short-term strategy. Even so, the exchange remains central to rising stablecoin flows. Meanwhile, BVNK continues to be well-funded and active in a market still attracting major buyers. Looking ahead, investors will be watching closely. BVNK may reopen talks with new bidders, while Coinbase could turn its focus to smaller acquisitions or partnerships to expand its stablecoin and payments business.

Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden has issued a stark warning that could reshape how Britain approaches digital currency regulation. Her recent statements highlight how easing stablecoin rules might create dangerous vulnerabilities in our financial system. Why Stablecoin Rules Matter for Financial Security Sarah Breeden’s interview with Reuters revealed serious concerns about the potential consequences of relaxed stablecoin regulations. She emphasized that these digital assets represent more than just technological innovation – they introduce significant risks that must be carefully managed. The stability of our entire financial ecosystem could depend on getting these stablecoin rules right. According to Breeden, the introduction of new forms of money through stablecoins presents challenges that regulators cannot ignore. She specifically warned that inadequate stablecoin rules could undermine financial stability and potentially trigger a credit crisis. This isn’t just theoretical – we’ve seen how quickly digital asset volatility can spread to traditional markets. How Holding Limits Protect Against Bank Runs The Bank of England has taken concrete steps to address these concerns through specific holding limitations. Here’s what you need to know about the new caps: Individual investors: £10,000 maximum (approximately $12,700) Businesses: £10 million maximum (approximately $12.7 million) These stablecoin rules serve a crucial purpose. Breeden explained that setting holding limits helps reduce pressure on banks during potential crisis situations. When people can only hold limited amounts of stablecoins, it prevents massive, rapid withdrawals that could overwhelm traditional banking institutions. The Hidden Dangers of Inadequate Stablecoin Regulation What makes these stablecoin rules so essential? The answer lies in understanding the interconnected nature of modern finance. Stablecoins aren’t isolated digital tokens – they’re increasingly linked to traditional banking systems and credit markets. Weak stablecoin rules could create domino effects that spread throughout the entire financial ecosystem. Breeden’s warning comes at a critical time as more countries consider their approach to digital currency regulation. The UK’s cautious stance on stablecoin rules reflects lessons learned from previous financial crises and recent crypto market turbulence. Proper stablecoin rules aren’t about stifling innovation but about ensuring that progress doesn’t come at the cost of financial stability. What These Stablecoin Rules Mean for Investors and Businesses For individual investors and corporations, understanding these stablecoin rules is essential for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. The holding limits provide clear boundaries while the broader regulatory framework aims to create a safer environment for everyone participating in the crypto economy. The Bank of England’s approach to stablecoin rules demonstrates how central banks worldwide are grappling with the challenge of integrating new financial technologies while maintaining system stability. As Breeden noted, getting these stablecoin rules wrong could have consequences far beyond the crypto sector alone. Conclusion: Balancing Innovation and Protection The Bank of England’s position on stablecoin rules represents a careful balancing act between encouraging financial innovation and protecting economic stability. While some may view the regulations as restrictive, Breeden’s warnings highlight the genuine risks of moving too quickly without proper safeguards. The future of digital finance depends on getting these stablecoin rules right from the beginning. Frequently Asked Questions What are the main concerns about easing stablecoin regulations? The primary concern is that relaxed stablecoin rules could undermine financial stability and potentially trigger a credit crisis by creating vulnerabilities in the banking system. What are the specific holding limits for stablecoins in the UK? The Bank of England has set caps of £10,000 for individual investors and £10 million for businesses regarding stablecoin holdings. How do holding limits protect against bank runs? Setting maximum holding amounts reduces the pressure on banks during crisis situations by preventing massive, rapid withdrawals that could overwhelm traditional banking institutions. Why does the Bank of England consider stablecoins risky? Stablecoins introduce new forms of money that present significant risks to financial stability, particularly because of their potential connections to traditional banking and credit systems. Are other countries implementing similar stablecoin rules? Many countries are developing their own approaches to stablecoin regulation, with the UK taking a particularly cautious stance based on financial stability concerns. How might these rules affect cryptocurrency innovation? While the rules create boundaries, they’re designed to allow innovation to continue within a framework that protects overall financial stability. Found this analysis of stablecoin regulation helpful?

Bitwise launched the first U.S. Solana ETF, drawing $420mn despite the SEC shutdown, while SoFi Bank became the first in the U.S. to enable direct Bitcoin trading for 12.6mn users. At the same time, China’s hacking accusations against the U.S. added fresh geopolitical tension to an already volatile market. Bitwise Launches First U.S. Solana ETF Despite SEC Shutdown Bitwise Asset Management has made history by launching the first spot Solana ETF (ticker: BSOL) on the New York Stock Exchange. The fund debuted on October 28, becoming the first U.S. altcoin-based ETF and marking a major milestone for the crypto industry.

The product gives investors a regulated and secure way to gain exposure to Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SoFi Becomes First U.S. Bank to Offer Bitcoin Trading SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) has become the first national bank in the United States to let customers buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin directly within their bank accounts. The feature is part of the new SoFi Crypto platform, which will roll out to 12.6 million users by the end of 2025. JUST IN: SoFi became the first national chartered bank to allow #Bitcoin and crypto trading. pic.twitter.com/NRt3xZLHO6 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 11, 2025 CEO Anthony Noto called it a “pivotal moment when banking meets crypto,” describing it as a secure and regulated way for consumers to enter digital assets. The launch follows new OCC and FDIC guidelines under President Trump’s deregulatory agenda, allowing banks to handle cryptocurrency trading and custody. Unlike exchanges, SoFi provides FDIC-insured accounts and strict compliance monitoring, appealing to cautious investors. SoFi also plans to launch crypto-integrated lending and a stablecoin, signaling its deeper move into blockchain finance and boosting confidence in Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption. China Accuses U.S. of Role in Massive Bitcoin Hack China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) has accused the United States of involvement in one of the largest Bitcoin thefts in history, the 2020 hack of the LuBian mining pool, which resulted in the loss of 127,000 BTC. Beijing claims the breach was part of a coordinated cyber operation linked to U.S. intelligence agencies. The stolen Bitcoin, worth billions of dollars, has reportedly been traced across multiple wallets and mixers. The accusation adds new tension to the ongoing U.S.–China tech and cybersecurity rivalry, as both nations ramp up blockchain oversight and digital finance security measures. Bitcoin Holds $103K as Bulls Defend Key Support Zone Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading near $103,300, consolidating after last week’s high around $107,500. On the 4-hour chart, BTC is forming a rising wedge, a pattern that often signals short-term pullbacks after strong rallies. The latest rejection near the wedge top came with a bearish engulfing candle, hinting at profit-taking. Despite the dip, BTC stays above the 20-EMA, showing that bullish sentiment remains intact. The RSI at 45 points to neutral momentum, leaving room for a rebound if buyers step in near support. The next key levels sit at $101,400 and $99,200, both areas where demand previously returned. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A move above $104,500 could confirm renewed bullish momentum, targeting $107,500 and $110,500 — the wedge’s upper boundary. But a break below $101,400 risks deeper losses toward $99,200. For traders, buying dips around $101K–$103K with stops below $99K remains the preferred setup. If momentum rebuilds, Bitcoin could aim for $111,000, supported by rising institutional inflows and steady macro sentiment. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $26.8 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013255 before the next increase.

According to court documents, Qian – also known as the Chinese “Goddess Of Wealth” – pleaded guilty on September 29, 2025 to acquiring and possessing criminal property in the form of Bitcoin. Reports have disclosed that police seized more than 61,000 BTC during a 2018 raid, an amount worth at least $6.5 billion at current market rates. Major Seizure Prompts Court Action Investigators say the haul came from an investment scheme run in China between 2014 and 2017. Prosecutors link the activity to a company named Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology Co Ltd, which allegedly promised high returns to thousands of people. Reports put the number of victims at more than 128,000. That figure has raised questions about how any recovered funds could be shared among so many claimants. China’s “Goddess Of Wealth” Faces Jail In UK Over $6 Billion Bitcoin Scam https://t.co/LdnTWVl3xz pic.twitter.com/M7b329kEkB — NDTV WORLD (@NDTVWORLD) November 10, 2025 The Arrest And The Evidence Trail According to police statements, Qian left China around 2017 and later used false travel documents, including a St Kitts & Nevis passport, to live in the UK. In 2018, officers searched a property in Hampstead and found wallets and devices that helped them trace the crypto holdings. Records shown in court link transfers and accounts to the scheme that defrauded investors . The items seized in that operation are central to the Crown’s case and to plans for victim compensation. Compensation And Cross-Border Challenges Reports have outlined the legal and practical hurdles ahead. The Bitcoin seized in 2018 has risen massively in value since then, which complicates decisions about how to return money to those harmed. Lawyers say cross-border claims between UK authorities and Chinese victims could take years to sort out. Based on reports, one worry is conflicting claims over who is entitled to the assets and whether victims will receive the current market value of the Bitcoin or the value at the time of seizure. Sentencing Timeline And Possible Penalties According to court sources, Qian could face up to 14 years behind bars under the charges she admitted. Sentencing was expected to take place soon after the guilty plea, although exact dates have not been confirmed publicly by the court in all outlets. Judges will consider the scale of the loss, the number of victims, and the role Qian played in moving or hiding the funds when deciding the sentence. Investigations And Next Steps UK authorities including the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service are coordinating efforts to secure the remaining assets and to set up processes for victims to claim funds.

Bitcoin Is Struggling At This Make-Or-Break Zone,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-at-make-or-break-zone/,"Bitcoin is currently locked in a decisive struggle at a make-or-break resistance zone. After a strong attempt to push higher, BTC was rejected and has retreated to a pivotal support area. The next few sessions are crucial: bulls must quickly reclaim the critical overhead resistance, or risk triggering a wider market retreat back toward lower support levels. Battle At Resistance: Can Bitcoin Reclaim $107,000–$108,000? In a recent update, Crypto Candy noted that Bitcoin’s price action continues to unfold largely as anticipated, maintaining strength and structure across key levels. After enduring a volatile period, BTC held firmly within the $99,000–$101,000 support zone. This strong defense from buyers set the stage for a rebound toward the upper resistance area around $107,000–$108,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Valuation Reset: MVRV Slides Into Macro Correction Territory — What This Means At present, the $107,000–$108,000 range is acting as a critical barrier, and Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim this zone could determine its short-term direction. The current consolidation suggests a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with buyers aiming to push for a breakout, while sellers are attempting to cap further upside. The outcome of this battle may set the tone for the next decisive move in the market. If the current momentum fails to hold, Crypto Candy suggests a pullback to lower levels could follow, giving bears another short-term edge. However, Crypto Candy added that if Bitcoin successfully reclaims the $107,000–$108,000 range, the market could shift back in favor of the bulls. Such a breakout would likely trigger renewed buying pressure, potentially driving the price higher toward the $116,000–$118,000 zone or even beyond. BTC Faces Rejection At Resistance, Support At $105,000 In Focus Presenting an outlook, Crypto VIP Signal revealed that BTC has recently reached a key resistance area but was immediately rejected on its first attempt. This initial failure suggests that a significant pocket of selling pressure is positioned at that level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Lacks Conviction, Market Signals Another Pullback Risk Following this rejection, the price has now moved down to the $105,000 support level. The analyst stresses that the market must hold this specific price point, as it represents a crucial line of defense against a deeper pullback. Crypto VIP Signal warns that if there is a decisive break and a close below $105,000, the market could see a significant drop toward the next major support in the $103,000 zone. However, the crypto analyst highlighted that another attempt to retest the initial resistance area is expected in the coming days. This implies the rejection may be a healthy setback before bulls try to breach the critical ceiling again.
