53472372,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841866,1761084934,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53472372.jpeg,"Lockheed Martin, RTX, GE Aerospace, and Northrop Grumman all raised 2025 guidance after stronger Q3 profits",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lockheed-martin-rtx-hike-guidance-defense/,"Lockheed Martin and RTX raised their full-year guidance on Tuesday after both companies saw a surge in orders from governments expanding their defense budgets. Their third-quarter numbers topped expectations, and both are now planning for even more growth going into 2025. Lockheed said it’s increasing production across its divisions due to what CEO Jim Taiclet called “unprecedented demand” from both U.S. and foreign customers. The company now expects revenue between $74.25 billion and $74.75 billion, with earnings per share between $22.15 and $22.35. Lockheed reported Q3 earnings of $6.95 per share on $18.61 billion in revenue, beating estimates of $6.36 and $18.56 billion. Taiclet also confirmed investment in digital systems and physical production lines to support “top defense priorities”, including the $175 billion U.S. Golden Dome project, which begins construction in 2025 and already has $25 billion earmarked in next year’s defense budget. RTX lifts revenue target after tariff impact fades RTX followed with an upgrade of its own, pushing full-year adjusted earnings guidance from $5.80–$5.95 to a range of $6.10–$6.20, and revenue expectations from $84.75–$85.5 billion up to $86.5–$87 billion. The firm’s stock jumped 9% after Tuesday’s update. CEO Chris Calio said they’re staying focused on delivering a $251 billion backlog and scaling output across critical programs. RTX’s total revenue climbed 12% to $22.48 billion in the third quarter. In July, RTX had warned of a $500 million tariff hit and cut guidance. But now, those impacts seem to be absorbed. The company also saw growth across both its aerospace and defense arms, with Calio pointing to new investments in next-gen tech and manufacturing as reasons for the upward revision. GE, Northrop also beat earnings as defense spending climbs GE Aerospace, which supplies both commercial and defense markets, said Q3 adjusted revenue hit $11.31 billion, far above the $10.41 billion estimate. The company raised full-year revenue growth from “mid-teens” to “high-teens” and pushed free cash flow guidance from $6.5–$6.9 billion to $7.1–$7.3 billion. Deliveries of LEAP engines, used in Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A321neo jets, jumped 40% year over year. Meanwhile, defense deliveries alone surged 83%, showing just how fast military orders are ramping up. Northrop Grumman also beat profit expectations, reporting $7.67 EPS for the quarter versus a $6.46 Wall Street target. Its revenue missed estimates slightly, but total sales still rose 4%, with a 14% increase in its defense systems division. The company raised its 2025 EPS guidance by 65 cents, now forecasting $25.65 to $26.05. CEO Kathy Warden said, “We are once again increasing our 2025 EPS guidance,” and pointed to faster response efforts and better output across programs. Across all four companies (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, and GE), the same pattern held: higher orders, stronger production, and tighter guidance. The rise in U.S. defense spending plays a huge role in that. The Trump administration is requesting $849.8 billion for the 2025 defense budget, up from $842 billion in 2024, and way above the $742 billion level from 2022. The White House cited threats from Russia, Iran, and North Korea as justification for the larger outlays. Every one of these contractors is cashing in. All four beat Q3 earnings. All four raised their guidance. And all four are building to meet the demands of a world where defense orders just keep coming. Defense spending has become one of the few consistent growth drivers this year, even with tariffs, inflation, and global instability. And right now, that growth is all over the numbers. With new missiles, aircraft, and war-tech rolling off the line, the defense sector has become the safest bet in a chaotic global market. Defense now makes up a larger share of these companies’ revenue than at any point in the last five years. None of them is slowing down. GE is delivering more. RTX is expanding backlog output. Lockheed is scaling capacity. Northrop is hiking EPS targets. And behind it all, Washington is writing the checks. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

53472263,https://cryptonews.com/?p=441463,1761085800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53472263.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-ethereum-cardano-ripple-by-the-end-of-2025/,"China’s leading ChatGPT rival, DeepSeek AI, has released an ambitious outlook predicting that XRP, Cardano, and Ethereum could generate rapid, explosive gains for investors as the New Year approaches. Traditionally, “Uptober” has signaled the onset of extended bullish momentum in the crypto sector. This year initially followed that pattern, with Bitcoin climbing to a record high on Monday, October 6, fueling widespread optimism across the digital asset space. However, that enthusiasm faded fast when Donald Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports sparked one of the sharpest single-day sell-offs in crypto history. A brief rebound earlier this week hinted at recovery potential, but it was quickly erased as traders turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting, hoping for signs of looser monetary policy. Seasoned investors, however, remain calm, many viewing the correction as a natural market reset. Historically, deep pullbacks have often paved the way for powerful rallies, helping eliminate overleveraged positions and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. Ethereum (ETH): DeepSeek Targets $10,000 for the Leading Smart Contract Platform As the backbone of decentralized applications and DeFi protocols, Ethereum ($ETH) commands a $543 billion market cap with over $85.16 billion in total value locked across its ecosystem. Source: DeepSeek AI DeepSeek AI predicts ETH could surge to $15,000 by year’s end, representing a 280% increase from its current $3,949 price point. Further tailwinds could emerge if the Trump administration moves forward with comprehensive crypto-friendly reforms, potentially injecting the regulatory confidence needed for wider institutional participation. ETH is currently battling resistance near the upper $4,000 range; a successful breakout could clear a path toward $6,000 or higher. Even if prices stay below $4,000, Ethereum maintains solid support between $3,500 and $3,700. A strong October rally could propel ETH as high as $6,500 and potentially establish a new all-time high, with $12,000 remaining the year-end target in a full-fledged bull scenario. Cardano ($ADA): DeepSeek Foresees Up to 1,200% Growth This Quarter Within the DeFi landscape, Cardano ($ADA) continues to position itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum, attracting a vibrant developer base and fueling innovative blockchain applications. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano differentiates itself through a peer-reviewed, research-oriented approach emphasizing scalability, sustainability, and formal verification. Currently boasting a $24.8 billion market cap, Cardano remains a major smart contract platform, though it would require a fourfold expansion to rival Solana and seriously contest Ethereum’s dominance. DeepSeek’s optimistic outlook envisions ADA climbing to $7–$10 by late 2025, up to a 1,370% surge from its present level near $0.6801. Technically, ADA has already broken out of a bullish flag pattern established over the summer, facing initial resistance around $1.10. Should October’s rally gain traction, ADA could approach $2 in the short term, while sustained bullish momentum might drive it well beyond its 2021 all-time high of $3.09. XRP ($XRP): DeepSeek Predicts an Upswing Toward $10 DeepSeek’s AI-driven projections indicate that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could be primed for a significant breakout, with potential gains lifting the price between $5 and $10 before year’s end, roughly quadrupling its current value of around $2.51. Ripple scored a landmark victory earlier this year after a five-year legal standoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reigniting investor confidence and driving XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its highest level since 2017. Over the past twelve months, XRP has rallied 359%, outperforming market giants Bitcoin (+67%) and Ethereum (+46%). Chart analysis highlights three bullish flag formations emerging in 2025, two of which appeared during the summer, patterns that typically precede strong upward moves. As October’s seasonality trends align with potential ETF approvals, improving regulatory clarity, and new Ripple partnerships, DeepSeek suggests XRP could make a run toward the coveted $10 mark. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Meme Coin Channeling Dogecoin’s Spirit and Degen Energy A newcomer to the meme coin space, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a self-described “energetic cousin” of Dogecoin, has entered presale mode, already securing over $3.7 million from investors eager for the next viral crypto sensation. Built as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, MAXI aims to deliver faster, greener, and lower-cost transactions than Dogecoin. The project emphasizes community engagement, viral marketing, and gamified initiatives such as trading contests and brand partnerships to foster adoption. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” dedicated to marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem growth. Staking is already live, offering up to 82% APY, though yields vary with participation. The ongoing presale prices MAXI at $0.000264, with incremental price increases as funding milestones are achieved. Tokens are available via MetaMask and Best Wallet .

Despite recent declines, many analysts suggest these pullbacks are setting the stage for the biggest bull run the sector has ever seen At the start of October, Bitcoin surged to a record-breaking $126,080, igniting a rapid flow of capital into leading altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which had already been on record-setting runs throughout the past year. However, that wave of optimism quickly faded. Markets slumped following Donald Trump’s declaration of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, sparking a sharp sell-off across digital assets. Investor sentiment remains cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Still, many experts see the downturn as a constructive correction, one that’s purging excessive leverage and weak hands before the next leg higher. Below are several altcoins to watch as they stand to gain the most should the market enter its final major bull cycle before widespread adoption. Ripple (XRP): Positioned to Dominate 2025’s Global Payments Market Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) token powers a fast and cost-efficient international payment network that continues to challenge legacy transfer systems such as SWIFT. Backed by partnerships with top-tier U.S. financial firms and support from the UN Capital Development Fund, XRP has climbed to third place by market capitalization, exceeding $149.4 billion. The launch of Ripple’s new dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, further underscores the company’s push into the booming stablecoin segment. Over the past twelve months, XRP has soared 359%, reaching a seven-year peak of $3.65 in mid-July, far outperforming Bitcoin’s 67% gain during the same period. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 42 and a price slowly converging with its 30-day moving average, XRP could be poised for renewed upside momentum. Chart patterns reveal two bullish flag formations dating back to the summer, suggesting more growth potential if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Should the U.S. Congress pass comprehensive crypto regulations, some analysts believe XRP could rally toward the $5–$10 range. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The Meme Coin Evolving Into a Utility Powerhouse Since its debut in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the world’s second-largest meme coin, boasting a market capitalization of over $6 billion. Within the past 24 hours, SHIB has gained 1.4%, outperforming much of the meme coin sector, mirroring its predecessor Dogecoin’s resilience. Thanks to its size and expanding ecosystem, SHIB now trades more like a blue-chip crypto asset than a speculative token, currently priced around $0.00001043. Technically, SHIB has established two bullish patterns over the past year: a descending wedge from November to March and a flag pattern since May. A breakout above $0.000022 could open the door to $0.00003 by late October, with potential targets between $0.00006 and $0.00009 if a major rally develops. Unlike many meme tokens, SHIB’s utility continues to grow. Its ecosystem includes Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 network built to reduce gas fees and boost transaction speeds, along with upcoming privacy tools aimed at expanding real-world use. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Still Aiming for $1 Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the pioneer of the meme coin movement, launched in 2013, maintains its status as the largest in the category with a $30 billion market cap and a loyal “Doge Army” community. After gaining celebrity attention in 2021 from figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, DOGE saw renewed excitement earlier this year amid speculation about a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF. The token climbed above $0.25 in May but has since retraced to roughly $0.2038, although it rose 2% overnight amid a simultaneous 2% rise in crypto’s now-$3.86 trillion market cap. Performing even better, the meme coin sector as a whole rose 4% overnight to $64.8 billion, with DOGE accounting for about half of that, making it one of the market’s more stable assets. Its price now tends to move in tandem with blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. DOGE’s real-world adoption continues to grow: Tesla now accepts it for merchandise purchases, while PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE payments. Should positive regulatory shifts reignite investor optimism, DOGE could retest its 2021 high of $0.7316, or even surpass it, before the year’s end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): 2025’s Most Ambitious Meme Coin Presale Fusing Innovation with Bitcoin Utility Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has emerged as one of 2025’s most buzzworthy presale tokens, combining the humor and hype of meme culture with the technological backbone of Bitcoin. It enhances the Bitcoin ecosystem by introducing a proprietary Layer-2 solution that enables ultra-fast, low-cost transactions. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER integrates features such as decentralized governance through a DAO, smart contract functionality, and a native meme coin bridge for seamless Bitcoin transfers. The presale has already raised more than $24.4 million, and analysts suggest early investors could see 10x or greater returns post-launch. A recent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. HYPER tokens power all network activities, including staking, governance, and fees, and early adopters can earn up to 48% APY through staking rewards. Bitcoin is going HYPER. This may be the next major breakout project. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

On that note, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $108,000 in the past week, while Ripple’s XRP and Cardano (ADA) dropped over 10%. Amid the growing risk of uncertainties, one project stands out as the only project in the market offering bullish momentum. Digitap ($TAP) , an omni-bank ecosystem, is built to blend crypto and fiat transactions, digital wallets, and card payments in one platform. Digitap’s infrastructure offers instant utility and its live app has increased demand for the $TAP presale. This explains why the presale is selling out quickly. Hence, $TAP is the best cryptocurrency to buy now. Bitcoin Falters As $TAP Emerges as Safe Haven BlackRock listed its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange on October 20, 2025, focusing on the UK retail investors. The move marks the first time UK-based investors can enjoy direct BTC exposure via traditional brokerage accounts. On the other hand, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is planning to let local banks trade and keep cryptos. Based on its official report , the planned reform would allow banks to trade cryptocurrencies like they trade stocks or government bonds. Despite these developments, Bitcoin dropped below $107,000 in the past week amid growing global risk aversion and leveraged liquidations. The biggest crypto has struggled to rise above $112,000 since the October 10, widespread market dip. While BTC struggles, investors have shifted focus to $TAP, whose presale has delivered gains amid current market volatility. XRP Slides as Investors Rotate to $TAP XRP suffered significant losses in mid-October during the broader market bloodbath. The drop reflected weakening leverage, although Ripple is constantly making developments around tokenization and cross-border payments. While fundamentals remain strong , the general risk-off environment is hitting XRP hard. The token is affected by macro-driven conditions that have increased uncertainties in the global markets. These scenarios have affected the token’s price negatively, pinning it down by 6% in the last week. With XRP struggling below $2.50 , analysts say the token’s upside momentum seems limited in the near term. The bearish momentum appears to be pushing investors to seek more lucrative alternatives. The only token that has maintained its bullish momentum consistently in October 2025 is Digitap’s coin. $TAP has attracted investors in its presale due to its instant utility and it keeps hitting multiple milestones quickly in an early stage. Therefore, the presale token is the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Cardano’s Growth Stalls as $TAP Gains Momentum Cardano’s recent performance is a representation of the sentiment dominating the crypto space. ADA lacks breakout momentum and its reaction is underwhelming to bullish roadmap announcements. For instance, Cardano’s community treasury exceeded 1.6 billion ADA and reached a value of nearly $1 billion. Remarkably, this treasury balance highlighted financial flexibility. Therefore, the network seems prepared to fund development without involving outside investors. Despite the many developments, ADA failed to surge due to a market wide drop. The token dropped over 5% in the past week and is still in the red zone. Interestingly, its value is greatly influenced by long-term ecosystem growth, instead of immediate utility. While ADA’s upside momentum is threatened by the increased volatility, smart capital is flowing into $TAP. Its underlying Digitap network is continuously developing an omni-banking platform that incorporates crypto into everyday transactions. Therefore, $TAP is the best crypto coin to buy now. Digitap Bridges Fiat and Crypto as $TAP Demand Soars The crypto giants are struggling as macro-economic conditions take center stage. While BTC, XRP, and ADA slide, $TAP is quietly gaining ground. Built as an omni-bank ecosystem, Digitap has integrated fiat-banking rails, crypto wallets, cross-chain settlement, and card spending into one app. This new ICO crypto offers instant utility that the struggling giants cannot offer. Its underlying platform is designed to enable users to transact globally using cards/smart rails that connect its ecosystem to everyday spending. Digitap attracts users via its cross-chain wallet bridging, card functions, instant FX, and tap-to-pay features. Since $TAP’s infrastructure connects currencies and is not a standalone project, its utility is tangible and instant. Thus, investors are buying into its presale aggressively to shield their portfolios from the increased market volatility. $TAP’s demand also grew after its app went live in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The launch of this app enabled the coin to transition from a vision into a practical market product. Security and Utility Drive Massive Demand for $TAP Investors prefer projects that guarantee the safety of their money. Notably, $TAP is one such coin. Its platform was audited and approved by Solidproof and Coinsult, guaranteeing that investors can use it to transact safely. $TAP’s presale seems to have convinced investors in its early stage. It has recorded extensive success unseen in most of the other presale tokens that came before it. The coin’s demand has grown massively because it offers real utility. Since everything is hosted on one app, Digitap makes crypto investments easy and smooth for all users. Additionally, its exclusive tokenomics strategy rewards adoption in the long term with staking protocols that reduce the token’s circulating supply. Digitap has built-in burn mechanics extensively linked to its usage. Its capped supply of 2 billion tokens means deflationary pressure could increase with demand. Its merchant integrations, consistent building, and app launch explain why capital is flowing into it. USE THE CODE “LIVEAPP30” FOR 30% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES $TAP Presale Momentum Builds as Investors Seek Stability $TAP’s presale is selling out quickly with its increased demand supported by the project’s utility. The token has achieved multiple milestones as investors buy it to shield their portfolios against the market wide volatility. In that context, experts say $TAP could deliver massive gains in the coming years as its supply decreases and demand grows. $TAP is in Stage 3 of its presale, selling at $0.0194. The current investors will record a 38.14% profit when the coin moves to the next stage of the presale at $0.0268. Over 65 million $TAP tokens have been acquired, and has raised at least $870K. Those investors who acquired $TAP in Stage 1 have recorded a 55.2% gain after the coin’s value surged from $0.0125 to its current price. The constant growth makes Digitap ($TAP) rank among the best DeFi coins to buy now. $TAP Defies Market Dip With Strong Presale Momentum With Bitcoin dropping below $108K and altcoins like XRP and ADA down over 5% in the past week, the crypto sector is struggling with volatility. For most investors, they wonder where the next sustainable growth will come from. Digitap comes in ready with a compelling solution. It is an omni-bank platform built for utility in global finance rising above the purely speculative token swings. As the market repositions toward usable infrastructure, the $TAP presale seems to offer the only constant bullish trend in the market. Adoption metrics can now be measured on the project’s live app and scarcity mechanics seem to boost its growth potential. Hence, $TAP could deliver huge gains in the coming bull cycle.

Metaverses. Memecoins. NFTs. Decentralized IDs. In the case of non-fungible tokens, the perihelion was undoubtedly the sale, in March 2021, of the Everydays art collage for $69.3 million at Christie’s. Four and a half years on, the august auction house has quietly closed its specialist digital art division, a reflection of diminished interest in the collectibles. Today, there are a few contenders for the ‘hottest narrative in crypto’, one of them being IP-based protocols – the sort that enables intellectual property to be tokenized and tracked to drive fan engagement. The sports world is making the early running here, with a number of IP-based protocols finding favor among fans of soccer, basketball, and cricket. Blockchain and Sports: A Perfect Match? If you’ve watched a Premier League football match lately, you’ve probably noticed a hoarding advertising a crypto company – blockchain.com, Kraken, Tezos. In fact, multiple clubs boast an official crypto trading partner, with names like OKX and BingX adorning players’ shirt sleeves. All of which is to say that partnerships and sponsorship deals between global sports brands and leading Web3 companies, are nothing new. Hell, the LA Lakers – arguably the world’s best-known basketball team – play at the Crypto.com Arena. Those deals are about brand recognition, of course, proving that trading platforms aren’t shy about flexing in a bid to win over mainstream users. But as far as the actual synergies between blockchain and sports are concerned, they are plentiful. And IP-based protocols are doing wonders for fan engagement through things like fan tokens and dApps. A perfect example is Sweet , a Web3 platform that has licensing agreements with both the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS), both of whom deploy “innovative gamified blockchain collectible experiences on Sweet to drive new revenue streams and fan engagement.” The ultimate ambition of Sweet is to improve the way leagues and athletes interact with fans and vice versa. The platform has already rolled out fun, skill-based sports mini games, with players issued a SCOR-ID to ensure a verifiable ‘footprint’ of their activities. In this way, leagues and teams can identify their most committed fans. Recently, Sweet joined forces with TON Foundation to release sports-themed sticker packs inside Telegram’s FUSE Sticker store, with the inaugural release focused on cricket’s greatest spin bowlers. While that isn’t headline-making news on its own, the kicker is that these digital collectibles have in-game utility, triggering power-ups and enhancing gameplay in the aforementioned mini games. Thus, the sticker packs are perfectly situated at the intersection of blockchain, gaming, and sports fandom. Sweet’s vision goes beyond digital ownership, creating a means by which engagement can be recorded and hardcore supporters compensated. With interactions documented on users’ SCOR-ID, the prospect of earning meaningful rewards like signed memorabilia, tickets, and exclusive experiences becomes very real. Needless to say, Sweet has its own digital token in the form of $SCOR, which powers its sports games on Telegram, 44% of its supply ring-fenced for things like in-game incentives and rewards. The Future of Fandom The Web3 tech stack is vying to be the technological engine of fandom’s future, with a combination of blockchain and NFTs empowering supporters to load up on digital characters and playable assets tied to real sports action. It’s an intriguing proposition, and it’s telling that the big sports leagues have already given their seal of approval. Whether you’re a gamer, collector, or just a sports fan looking to show support, now’s a good time to plug in and see what all the fuss is about.

Even so, on-chain flow shows whales accumulating roughly 200 million ADA as developers push fresh upgrades. However, fundamentals have brightened with Cardano’s Hydra scaling and Midnight privacy tech advanced, daily transaction value topped $10B, and ADA joined the S&P Digital Markets 50, all factors often cited by institutions building longer-term positions. Derivatives data echo the mixed tone as open interest has climbed above $600M, reflecting active speculation despite price compression, while steady exchange outflows point to broader staking/long-term holding behavior. Can a MACD ‘Golden Cross’ Repeat June’s 60% Rally? Momentum remains conflicted. The daily MACD is nearing a bullish crossover, a pattern that preceded June’s 60% ADA surge from the $0.53 zone to $0.93 within weeks. Oversold oscillators (daily RSI 33, negative CCI, soft Awesome Oscillator) suggest sellers may be tiring into support, yet the ADX still favors the prevailing trend, arguing for patience until confirmation. Technically, bulls must reclaim $0.664 and the 20-DMA to neutralize near-term downside. Above, $0.74–$0.77 (former support now resistance) and $0.80 align with a descending trendline from the Aug. 14 swing, forming a decisive ceiling. A clean break and hold over $0.71–$0.74 (0.618 Fib confluence/EMA cluster) would strengthen the case for a trend reversal, and reopen talk of a move toward over $1.00 if momentum expands. ADA Price Levels and Outlook: Support First, Then Confirmation Near term, analysts see range-bound risk with downside skew. Models project $0.542–$0.590 over the next week if sellers press, with the Ichimoku Kijun support near $0.583 acting as a pivot. Immediate levels to watch for Cardano (ADA) remain well-defined as the token trades within a tightening range. On the downside, support is seen at $0.639, followed by $0.602 and $0.583, with a breakdown below $0.60 likely to expose the $0.542 zone. On the upside, resistance sits near $0.664, aligning with the 20-day moving average (20-DMA), while stronger hurdles appear around $0.74–$0.77 and the $0.80 trendline, which marks a key test for sustained bullish momentum.

Within hours, FLOKI’s price jumped nearly 30% and 24-hour volume exploded 780–817% to roughly $656–$662 million, lifting the token to an intraday high near $0.000088, its best level in almost two weeks. Related Reading: All It Took Was A Tweet: FLOKI Jumps 27% After Musk Mentions It Mentions across X, Reddit, and Telegram climbed 65%, while crypto’s Fear & Greed Index nudged from Fear (37) to Neutral (52), signaling fresh retail participation. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) logged modest gains, but FLOKI led meme coins by a wide margin. Breakout Case vs. Bull-Trap Warnings Technicians say FLOKI is retesting a pivotal demand band around $0.00008. A daily close and hold above $0.000075 keeps the breakout thesis alive toward $0.00009, with $0.00010 on the table if momentum and volumes persist. Open Interest surged 162% to about $37.5 million, and long-side liquidations wiped out $275K in shorts during the squeeze. On Binance, negative funding suggests crowded shorts paying to stay positioned, fuel for further upside if price grinds higher. Still, some analysts flag bull-trap risk. The RSI tipped into overbought (>70) during the spike, a zone that historically invites cooling moves; a quick reset back into the 50–70 band would be a healthier springboard. Liquidity “heatmaps” show dense clusters both above and below spot, implying two-way volatility as the price hunts orders before choosing direction. If FLOKI fails to reclaim/hold $0.00009, technicians eye pullbacks toward $0.000072, with a deeper bear case pointing to $0.00004 if risk aversion returns. FLOKI's price records some losses after a small push upwards on the daily chart. Source: FLOKIUSD on Tradingview Key FLOKI Levels as the Market Slips 3% Currently, FLOKI hovers around $0.0000737, down 12% on the day, mirroring the broader market downturnwith Bitcoin near $107,000 and Ethereum around $3,800. In the near term, traders are watching key technical levels that could dictate FLOKI’s next move. Immediate support sits between $0.000072 and $0.000070, with a deeper downside risk toward $0.00004 if momentum fails to hold. Related Reading: CryptoQuant’s Moreno Eyes Bitcoin At $195,000 If This Happens The $0.000080 level acts as the crucial pivot point, a decisive close above it would strengthen the bullish trend and open the path toward higher targets. On the upside, resistance lies at $0.00009, followed by $0.00011 if buying volume expands. With liquidity thin and sentiment still fragile after recent liquidations, celebrity-driven spikes can overextend quickly. However, if flows remain constructive, negative funding persists, open interest stays elevated, and spot demand confirms, FLOKI’s rally could reignite, potentially surpassing the psychological $0.00009 level.

In his latest market update, he highlighted a key demand zone visible on the monthly chart, which he believes could serve as the foundation for XRP’s next upward movement. Currently, XRP remains under pressure after its early October price drop. Following a brief recovery on October 10, the token has been unable to reclaim the $2.5 resistance level, let alone the psychological $3 threshold. At the time of writing, XRP has declined by nearly 15.49% for the month . XRP Approaching a Crucial Demand Zone Despite its recent weakness, Ether Nasyonal maintains a bullish outlook. He pointed out that XRP’s latest correction has brought the asset back to a significant demand area between $1.6 and $2, a range that historically played an important role during previous market cycles. $XRP is cooking something up. Chart has been inverted, but the story remains the same. XRP is still gathering strength within the demand zone emerging from the 2018 major resistance. While the direction may seem confusing, the structure is clear. The next major move… https://t.co/HT9Sqhembx pic.twitter.com/s5grcnCMFZ — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 19, 2025 According to Nasyonal, this zone previously served as a resistance area during the 2020–2021 bull market, capping XRP’s growth amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. During that period, XRP reached a local peak of $1.96 in April 2021 before losing momentum below its 2018 record high. The analyst noted that in late 2024, following renewed market optimism, XRP once again tested and broke through this same region, climbing to a new high of $3.4 in January 2025. Since that rally, XRP has repeatedly returned to retest the $1.6–$2 zone each time it encounters resistance near the $3 level. Nasyonal interprets this recurring pattern as evidence that the range has transitioned into a strong support level for the asset. He believes the latest price decline represents another test of this zone and that XRP may soon attempt another upward move if the area continues to hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Sentiment and Price Outlook Ether Nasyonal explained that the current market structure suggests consolidation before another potential breakout. He emphasized that the $3 mark remains a key price level that must be reclaimed for bullish momentum to resume. Once that threshold is cleared, the next major resistance lies around $3.4, the January 2025 peak that coincides with XRP’s 2018 all-time high. A successful break above $3.4, he added, could set the stage for XRP to challenge the July 2025 high of $3.66 and potentially aim for new record levels. In a separate analysis, Nasyonal drew parallels between the current price behavior and XRP’s 2017–2018 cycle. During that earlier period, XRP encountered persistent resistance around $0.06, repeatedly falling to a lower support zone near $0.028 before eventually rallying to $3.31 in early 2018. He suggested that a similar pattern might now be unfolding on a larger scale Recent data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment supports Nasyonal’s view of an impending shift. The platform reported that XRP has seen a surge in negative sentiment among investors in recent weeks. Historically, Santiment noted, similar spikes in bearish sentiment have often preceded price recoveries. Although Nasyonal did not provide a specific price target for XRP’s next move, he concluded that the asset’s current positioning above a long-term demand zone signals potential for renewed upward momentum if market conditions improve.

As crypto leaders and Senate Democrats prepare to debate new digital asset rules in D.C., the market itself is writing its own story of resilience. Litecoin and Toncoin have slipped 2.16% and 3.70%, but traders aren’t running for the exits. Instead, many are scanning the top new crypto presales today , looking for the next big opportunity before regulation reshapes the field. The broader picture feels more alive than ever. The Uptober rally may have cooled, but whales are quietly accumulating again, and the Fed’s upcoming rate decision on October 29 could unlock fresh liquidity. Amid this cocktail of macro shifts, policy debates, and pre-Halloween jitters, one project: BullZilla ($BZIL), has managed to turn the noise into momentum. With its structured presale, transparent growth engine, and verified 2,843% ROI potential, it’s quickly becoming the headline name investors whisper about when discussing “next millionaire-maker.” BullZilla ($BZIL): The 1000x Meme Coin Turning Heads Among the Top New Crypto Presales Today BullZilla’s presale is currently in Stage 7 (Bag Signal Activated), and the momentum is hard to ignore. Priced at $0.00017907, the project has raised over $940,000 from 3,100+ holders, distributing 31 billion tokens to date. As one of the top new crypto presales today , BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine ensures a predictable and transparent growth model across its 24 presale stages. With a listing target of $0.00527141, the verified ROI from Stage 7C stands at 2,843%, offering measurable upside for current participants. Early buyers from Stage 1 have already achieved returns exceeding 3,000%, proving the project’s consistent trajectory. The blend of staking rewards, deflationary burns, and stage-based price surges has positioned BullZilla as one of the most credible and rewarding presales of 2025. Here’s What Happens If You Invest $1,000 in BullZilla Right Now At the current price of $0.00017907, a $1,000 investment secures approximately 5.58 million $BZIL tokens. When the listing price hits $0.00527141, that same investment could grow to around $29,400, marking a 2,843% gain. Each stage adds a 3.71% increase, meaning investors who act early capture greater value at every progression. With staking and referral rewards layered on top, BullZilla’s presale offers real, compounding potential even before launch. How to Join BullZilla — The Top New Crypto Presales Today Joining the BullZilla presale is fast and decentralized. Visit the official BullZilla website, connect a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and purchase using ETH or USDT (ERC-20). Once the presale concludes, tokens can be claimed directly from the portal. Participants also gain access to referral bonuses and staking tiers, boosting passive rewards. With each stage increasing by 4.37%, early participants lock in the best entry opportunities before public trading begins. Litecoin (LTC): Macro Resilience Amid Market Fluctuations Litecoin is trading at $93.05, down 2.16% in the past 24 hours, with daily trading volume exceeding $580 million. Despite the short-term dip, the asset continues to demonstrate resilience and strong fundamentals. Its wide adoption for payments and increasing integration into global merchant platforms keep Litecoin relevant. The network’s rising hashrate and reduced transaction fees reinforce investor confidence, maintaining its reputation as one of the most reliable and battle-tested altcoins in circulation. Analysts see the current pullback as a healthy correction following early Uptober gains. Litecoin’s stability, combined with its steady user growth and established infrastructure, makes it a favorite among long-term holders. The renewed institutional interest after Bitcoin ETF approvals has also contributed to its sustained relevance. With improved liquidity and robust on-chain activity, Litecoin is well-positioned to benefit once retail momentum returns, potentially outperforming other mid-cap assets in the next phase of the market cycle. Toncoin (TON): Ecosystem Growth Driving Long-Term Utility Toncoin currently trades at $2.20, down 3.70%, with a $146.9 million 24-hour trading volume. The short-term decline mirrors a general market cooldown, yet Toncoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Backed by deep integration within Telegram, the TON ecosystem has rapidly become one of the most active Layer-1 blockchains. Its ultra-fast transaction speeds, low gas fees, and commitment to developer incentives continue to attract new projects, further expanding its influence in decentralized applications and cross-chain interoperability. The TON network’s growing validator base and consistent performance underline its long-term potential. Analysts view its blend of community-driven governance and practical real-world utility as a major advantage over many competitors. Toncoin’s cross-border payments capability and expanding DeFi presence are steadily building institutional trust. As new partnerships form and network activity grows, Toncoin is expected to remain a strong contender for investors seeking utility-based exposure to the evolving Web3 economy. Conclusion October hasn’t surprised anyone yet. Between regulatory debates in Washington, the Fed’s looming rate cut, and Halloween’s reminder that fear can move markets faster than facts, crypto investors are navigating both chaos and opportunity. Litecoin and Toncoin continue to prove their staying power, backed by real ecosystems and long-term fundamentals.

By 2028, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $28.45. In 2031, $TRUMP will range between $34.14 to $46.22. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Following President Trump’s “newfound” crypto inclination, the $TRUMP meme coin was birthed. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The coin has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, with an initial 200 million tokens unlocked at launch. Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors, such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official Trump price predictions for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $5.87 Market Capitalization $1.185B Trading Volume $374.95M Circulating Supply 199.99M TRUMP All-time High $75.35 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $1.21 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $6.13 24-h Low $5.84 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 11.24% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 35.79 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $7.75 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 34 (Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $9.88 Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown TRUMP consolidates near $5.86 after heavy selling, with weakening bearish momentum. The coin’s resistance stands at $6.70, while $5.00 is the critical support level. Short-term rangebound action is likely between $5.60 and $6.20 until volume returns. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for October 21, TRUMP coin is trading around $5.86, down 1.89% for the day, holding slightly above the lower Bollinger Band at $4.89 while facing overhead resistance near the mid-band at $6.68. The Bollinger Bands remain wide, signaling persistent volatility, but the narrowing of recent candles hints that the sharp sell-off may be stabilizing. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative, though histogram bars have begun to flatten, suggesting that bearish momentum is slowing. Despite this, the price continues to hover under key resistance, and any failure to close above $6.00 could see sellers regain control toward the $5.00 and $4.89 support levels. Conversely, a bullish candle breaking and closing above $6.70 could open the path toward $7.20–$7.50. Volume activity has been modest, showing a lack of strong conviction from either side. Until a breakout forms, the coin is likely to oscillate within this tight range. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart reveals that TRUMP has faced repeated rejections around the $6.05 zone, forming a series of wicks that reflect indecision and selling pressure. The Alligator lines are converging tightly, showing a lack of directional strength, consistent with a sideways market. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 48.96 remains neutral, while the OBV trending downward at -273M reflects muted accumulation. This confirms that buying strength has not yet returned in volume, and price could retest $5.80–$5.60 before any rebound attempt. If bulls successfully defend $5.80, it may create a minor bounce back toward $6.00–$6.10; however, failure here risks a slide back to $5.00. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $6.81 SELL SMA 5 $6.42 SELL SMA 10 $6.37 SELL SMA 21 $7.00 SELL SMA 50 $7.75 SELL SMA 100 $8.58 SELL SMA 200 $9.88 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $6.99 SELL EMA 5 $7.39 SELL EMA 10 $7.87 SELL EMA 21 $8.30 SELL EMA 50 $8.85 SELL EMA 100 $9.58 SELL EMA 200 $10.75 SELL What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis TRUMP’s current structure shows stabilization after its decline but lacks signs of a decisive bullish reversal. Expect sideways movement between $5.60 and $6.30 in the short term, with a possible upside recovery only if volume supports a breakout above $6.70. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $5–8 consolidation over the past month as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to hit $1,000, its market cap would need to rise over 100× into the hundreds of billions, or even trillions if locked supply is released. With dilution risks, weak fundamentals, regulation, and competition, the chance of this happening in the next few years is very low.” Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges. Recent news/opinion on $TRUMP As reported by Cryptopolitan, Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) confirmed during the Korea Blockchain Week 2025 event that the company will soon launch a debit card with Apple Pay integration. The card will be linked to its USD1 stablecoin and integrated with an application focused on retail use cases to tap into consumer payments.

Official TRUMP historic price sentiment Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Official Trump coin was launched on January 17, 2025, just a few days before the US presidential inauguration. Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April end, but has since maintained an average price of about $10.5. Official Trump coin traded between $8.07 and $10.13 in August.

Data now suggests massive whale movements toward Binance confirm profit-taking and panic-selling patterns. XRP Holders Unload Their Bags Since the start of October, XRP whales have shown a notable change in behavior amidst growing selling pressure. Data from the Whale to Exchange Flow chart for Binance, shared by CryptoQuant, found a sharp rise in whale deposits beginning October 1st, which maintained steady momentum until October 17th. The inflow reached its highest level on October 11th, with Whale to Exchange Transactions surging to 43,000. This is a clear indication of significant XRP transfers to centralized exchanges. Such large-scale movements typically mean that whales are preparing to liquidate holdings, realize profits, or mitigate risk in the backdrop of market uncertainty. This on-chain activity is closely in line with XRP’s price performance during the same period. As the whale deposits accelerated, XRP’s price experienced a steep decline as it dropped from above 3 to around 2.3. The correlation between increased exchange inflows and the falling price strongly supports the view that increased whale activity on Binance contributed to the mounting selling pressure throughout the first half of October. Whales were not the only cohort driving XRP’s sell pressure in October. Data revealed that smaller investors also played a crucial role in the market downturn. The month recorded a steady uptick in XRP transfers to Binance, especially in the ~1,000 XRP transaction group. Additionally, there were occasional inflows from larger 100K and 1M XRP tranches. These inflows reached their highest levels since last June and coincided with XRP’s price decline from near $3.0 to the $2.3-$2.6 range by mid-month. The surge in small tranche deposits points to increased activity from retail investors or, potentially, the splitting of larger holdings into smaller batches before selling. Such a pattern reflects a broader distribution phase, where selling pressure originates from a wide base of participants. Retail Pessimism Attention has now turned to how smaller traders are responding to the crypto asset’s turbulent price swings. According to Santiment, XRP is currently seeing widespread retail pessimism. On-chain data revealed that a large portion of the crowd has been selling at a loss, accompanied by a noticeable uptick in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across social channels. Historically, such conditions have often preceded bullish reversals, as prices tend to move contrary to retail sentiment. When traders capitulate or express excessive fear, it often means that market bottoms are near and that stronger hands are accumulating.

Währenddessen legten Bitcoin und Ethereum leicht zu, weil Anleger wieder mutiger werden. Experten sehen darin eine Reaktion auf positive Wirtschaftsdaten und nachlassende Spannungen zwischen den USA und China. Gold fällt, Krypto steigt – und die Finanzwelt schaut überrascht zu. Nach einem Rekordhoch sackt der Goldpreis plötzlich ab, während Bitcoin und Ethereum wieder gefragt sind. Warum wechseln Anleger so schnell von Sicherheit zu Risiko? Der Markt zeigt, dass sich die Stimmung rasant drehen kann. Gold verliert nach Rekordhoch deutlich an Wert Noch am Montag hatte der Goldpreis ein neues Rekordhoch erreicht – über 4.380 US-Dollar pro Unze. Doch schon am Dienstag fiel er plötzlich um rund 5,5 Prozent auf 4.118 Dollar. Das war der größte Tagesverlust seit dem Jahr 2013. Eine Unze ist übrigens etwa 31,1 Gramm. Der starke Preisrückgang zeigt, wie schnell Anleger ihre Stimmung ändern können. 1 Kg of Gold = 1 BTC. Both assets are now valued at approximately $123,000. It took human civilization 5,000 years to reach that price for gold. Bitcoin did it in 16 years. pic.twitter.com/Z10Az5fuUh — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) October 7, 2025 Marktbeobachter sprechen von einer „technischen Korrektur“. Das bedeutet, dass viele Investoren nach dem starken Anstieg Gewinne mitgenommen haben. Jake Ostrovskis, ein Analyst bei der Handelsfirma Wintermute, sagt: „Viele hatten auf weiter steigende Preise gesetzt – nun werden diese Wetten aufgelöst.“ Er betont aber, dass das noch kein langfristiger Trend sei. Bitcoin und Ethereum nutzen die Gelegenheit Während Gold schwächelte, stiegen die großen Kryptowährungen leicht an. Bitcoin lag am Dienstag bei etwa 112.000 US-Dollar – ein Prozent mehr als am Vortag. Ethereum, die Nummer zwei unter den digitalen Währungen, stieg auf rund 4.000 Dollar. Auch wenn die Gewinne klein waren, zeigten sie, dass Investoren wieder etwas risikofreudiger werden. Kryptowährungen gelten als riskant, weil ihre Preise stark schwanken können. Doch wenn sichere Anlagen wie Gold fallen, suchen viele Anleger nach Alternativen mit höherem Gewinnpotenzial. Bitcoin profitiert dann oft, weil viele ihn inzwischen als „digitales Gold“ sehen – also als Wertspeicher, der unabhängig von klassischen Märkten funktioniert. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Gute Wirtschaftsdaten sorgen für Optimismus Auch an der Wall Street liefen die Geschäfte gut. Mehrere große US-Unternehmen, darunter General Motors, meldeten starke Quartalsergebnisse. Analyst Carlos Guzman von der Firma GSR erklärt: „Die Gewinne zeigen, dass die Wirtschaft robuster ist als gedacht.“ Wenn die Wirtschaft stabil bleibt, sind die Sorgen vor einer Rezession kleiner – und Anleger trauen sich wieder mehr. Guzman spricht von einem „guten Start in die Berichtssaison“. Damit ist die Zeit gemeint, in der börsennotierte Unternehmen ihre Zahlen veröffentlichen. Gute Ergebnisse machen Investoren optimistisch – und das hebt oft auch die Stimmung an den Kryptomärkten. Was die Inflation mit all dem zu tun hat Am Freitag sollen neue Inflationszahlen aus den USA veröffentlicht werden. Die Inflation misst, wie stark die Preise im Durchschnitt steigen. Experten erwarten eine Rate von etwa 3,1 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahr. Das ist wichtig, weil sie Einfluss auf die Zinsen der US-Notenbank (der „Federal Reserve“) hat. Wenn die Inflation nicht zu hoch ist, könnte die Fed bald die Zinsen senken. Das würde Kredite günstiger machen – und riskantere Anlagen wie Aktien oder Kryptowährungen attraktiver. Doch wenn die Preise stärker steigen als erwartet, dürfte die Zentralbank vorsichtiger bleiben. Das könnte die aktuelle Risikofreude schnell wieder dämpfen. Gold bleibt wichtig – aber Anleger suchen Alternativen Trotz des Preissturzes bleibt Gold für viele ein Symbol der Sicherheit. Es verliert nie komplett an Wert und wird seit Jahrhunderten als Schutz vor Krisen genutzt. Trotzdem sagen einige Experten, dass der Markt für Gold zuletzt „überfüllt“ war – also zu viele Anleger gleichzeitig auf steigende Preise gesetzt hatten. Holy Shit…If just 4% of Gold rotates into Bitcoin… the price will double pic.twitter.com/LKJ67A29a0 — Nathan Sloan (@_NathansTweet) October 21, 2025 David Hernandez von 21Shares erklärt, dass es sich bei dem aktuellen Rückgang eher um eine „Rotation“ handelt. Das bedeutet, Kapital wandert kurzfristig aus sicheren Anlagen wie Gold in riskantere Bereiche wie Kryptowährungen. Binance-Mitgründer Changpeng Zhao sieht das ähnlich: „Gold wird nicht verschwinden – aber Bitcoin hat auf lange Sicht mehr Potenzial.“ Zwischen Risiko und Sicherheit – ein neuer Balanceakt Die Märkte stehen an einem interessanten Punkt: Einerseits locken Chancen durch sinkende Zinsen und eine starke Wirtschaft. Andererseits bleibt das Risiko groß, dass geopolitische Spannungen oder neue Daten die Stimmung wieder kippen lassen. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Für Anleger bedeutet das: Vorsicht und Flexibilität sind gefragt. Gold hat an Glanz verloren, aber es bleibt eine stabile Grundlage. Bitcoin und andere Kryptowährungen gewinnen zwar an Bedeutung, doch sie bleiben schwankungsanfällig. Die Kunst liegt darin, das Gleichgewicht zwischen Sicherheit und Rendite zu finden – wie auf einer Waage zwischen Gold und digitalem Geld.

The country’s financial watchdog is close to making its decision on whether to permit members of banking groups to launch crypto trading services. This move could reshape Japan’s tightly controlled digital asset market. This comes in when the crypto market is dealing with high selling pressure. The cumulative market cap dipped by another 2% over the last 24 hours to hover around $3.70 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 31% to stand at $224 billion. This suggests that investors are moving their funds quickly amid high turbulence. Japan may lift crypto ban for banks According to reports, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is also considering scrapping its longstanding ban that prevents banks from buying and holding crypto for investment purposes. If this gets approved, the move would mark one of Japan’s c rucial policy overhauls since it legalized crypto exchanges in 2017. It is expected that this step would bring mainstream banking muscle into a sector long dominated by fintechs and securities firms. As of now, subsidiaries of banking groups are barred from registering as crypto asset service providers. It is done under the Banking Act. The FSA’s proposed revision would allow securities subsidiaries of these groups to handle crypto trading. It will give them a level playing field with rivals under securities companies such as SBI Holdings and Rakuten Securities. A report mentioned that the regulator is expected to make its case during an upcoming meeting of the Financial Services Council. Discussions with an advisory body to the Prime Minister will center on establishing a framework that lets banks trade and hold crypto assets in the same way they handle stocks or government bonds. However, it will enforce risk management and disclosure standards. The FSA is treading carefully as it plans to require bank-affiliated securities firms to clearly warn retail investors about the volatility of the crypto market. It added that Bitcoin and other digital assets lack tangible backing, and large holdings could expose banks to balance-sheet stress if prices collapse. This is a concern that led the FSA to ban direct investment back in 2020. Bitcoin stuck in turbulence Japan’s stance seems more pragmatic than restrictive. Major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity are entering the crypto arena through Bitcoin ETFs and Tokyo appears eager to keep pace. A supportive decision could also strengthen Japan’s position as a regional digital finance hub. The digital assets market remained full of turbulence. Bitcoin caught a bid on Tuesday, climbing as gold and silver staged rare double-digit tumbles. BTC price surged past $113K just to dive below the $109K mark. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $108,773 at the press time. Gold saw its steepest drop in years as it fell more than 5% to $4,130, while silver plunged nearly 8%. The selloff unwound months of gains driven by central bank easing, US-China trade tension, and more. The sudden reversal seems to have sent traders back into crypto. Bitcoin futures open interest has jumped to over $32 billion from $28 billion since the brutal Oct. 10 wipeout that erased $20 billion in leveraged positions.

53475101,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841883,1761091126,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53475101.jpeg,Meta partners with Blue Owl to accelerate AI infrastructure growth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-forms-27b-joint-venture-with-blue-owl/,"Meta announced on Tuesday that it has entered a $27 billion joint venture with Blue Owl Capital to finance and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. Under the agreement, Blue Owl will hold an 80% stake in the venture, while Meta will retain a 20% stake and manage construction and property operations at the Richland Parish facility. As part of the deal, Blue Owl contributed approximately $7 billion in cash, and Meta received a one-time payout of $3 billion. Meta said the partnership provides it with the “speed and flexibility” needed to construct the data center and advance its “long-term AI ambitions.” Meta partners with Blue Owl to accelerate AI infrastructure growth The Hyperion data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, is expected to provide over 2 gigawatts of computing power to train large language models, the technology that powers tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Doug Ostrover and Marc Lipschultz, Co-CEOs of Blue Owl, said Hyperion is “an ambitious project that reflects the scale and speed required to power the next generation of AI infrastructure.” Morgan Stanley estimates that major tech firms, including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and CoreWeave, are on pace to spend $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year. OpenAI has recently inked several agreements worth more than $1 trillion to secure around 26 gigawatts of computing power, enough to supply electricity to roughly 20 million U.S. homes. According to Meta’s finance chief, Susan Li, Tuesday’s deal is “a bold step forward.” The firm has signed leases for the facility with a four-year initial term, including an option to extend, and anticipates that the project will create more than 500 jobs upon completion. Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, noted that it definitely helps them mitigate risks at the expense of their ownership stake. He continued to say that Meta won’t be required to provide nearly as much capital and can look to finance other facilities or AI infrastructure. “It also minimizes the debt they are taking on for equipment and property in the event there is a bursting of the AI bubble.” A few months ago, Meta announced that it had chosen Louisiana to host its largest data center. The construction of that facility is expected to be done by 2030. It is being built on a site roughly the size of 1,700 football fields. According to Local utility Entergy, the new data center could use almost double the electricity used by the city of New Orleans on a peak day. Meta has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence as it competes with tech giants like Alphabet and OpenAI, both of which are also building massive data centers to support next-generation AI models. In January, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank launched the Stargate joint venture, pledging $500 billion to build data centers in the coming years. The first Stargate facility went live in September in Abilene, Texas, about 180 miles west of Dallas. Recently, Google announced that it would invest $15 billion in a data center project in southern India, making it the search giant’s biggest AI hub outside America.

An example of a firm that has adopted this approach is Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, in its recent $20 billion fundraising round. In this approach, the firm leases chips rather than owning them outright. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the new round is more significant than initially expected. It is linked to xAI’s plan to utilize Nvidia processors for Colossus 2, its biggest data center, located in Memphis. The total package mixes equity and debt. Reports show that about $7.5 billion is in equity, while as much as $12.5 billion is in debt. The deal is structured through a special purpose vehicle that purchases Nvidia GPUs and rents them back to xAI for a five-year period, providing financiers a path to recover their investment without exposing themselves to company-level risk.

Many projects operate behind closed doors, offering speculation instead of proof, but BlockDAG is rewriting that narrative through full visibility and verifiable progress. This is not just another presale built on hype. BlockDAG (BDAG) has embraced a transparency-first approach, giving the public a clear view of its roadmap, audited code, and leadership. Every element is designed to invite verification rather than avoid it. With $430 million raised, a live testnet, and over 3.5M active users mining through its X1 app, BlockDAG is showing the industry what accountability looks like in practice. Verified Transparency Defines BlockDAG’s Credibility The question “Is BlockDAG trustworthy?” deserves an answer grounded in proof, not promises. Unlike most presales that hide behind vague teams and unverified operations, BlockDAG operates in complete transparency across every layer of its ecosystem. Its whitepaper is publicly available and includes detailed allocations for team incentives, ecosystem expansion, community rewards, and treasury funds, allowing anyone to verify the flow of resources with precision. The live Dashboard V4 provides constant visibility into every presale milestone. It tracks how many BDAG coins have been sold, the current batch stage, and the ROI potential based on the projected $0.05 listing price. This transparency removes uncertainty for newcomers and creates a sense of real accountability that few projects deliver. Beyond data, BlockDAG’s leadership, CEO Antony Turner, CTO Jeremy Harkness, and Head of Security Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj, appear regularly in AMAs, public keynotes, and video updates. Their consistent visibility ensures the project is built by real professionals, not hidden teams, marking BlockDAG as a rare example of verified trust within presales. Dual Audits and Live Testnet Strengthen BlockDAG’s Foundation Security forms the backbone of any credible blockchain, and BlockDAG is one of the few presales to prioritize it before launch. The project has completed independent audits by CertiK and Halborn, two of the industry’s most respected security firms. Both audits have been published with transparent summaries, confirming that all major vulnerabilities were resolved. This early verification sets a precedent for reliability and foresight that most presale projects lack. In addition to its dual audits, BlockDAG’s Awakening Testnet is fully live and publicly accessible, supporting functions such as EVM compatibility, token transfers, and contract deployment. A working blockchain explorer is also available for anyone to test and observe transactions, reinforcing the idea that the ecosystem already operates beyond theory. With the Batch 31 presale price fixed at $0.0015 for only a few days with the code TGE, buyers are gaining access to a proven network backed by functionality, not speculation. Complementing this digital foundation, BlockDAG’s X1 miner has crossed 3.5M global users. Visible Accountability Makes BlockDAG the Model of Trust While many presale projects still function under anonymity, leaving buyers guessing about who controls their funds or whether products even exist, BlockDAG has made transparency its standard. It has replaced speculation with verifiable metrics, showing clear audit results, measurable presale progress, and visible leadership. Traders can see exactly how much has been raised, $430 million, and where it is being deployed. Every step is traceable, every claim verifiable. BlockDAG’s credibility extends beyond code and communication. Its miner hardware shipments are being publicly reviewed, and its partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team , facilitated by Playfly Sports, adds mainstream legitimacy that few crypto projects achieve before listing. When compared to anonymous presales that vanish after launch, BlockDAG stands as proof that visibility breeds confidence. For those seeking the top crypto presale with audits and active validation, BDAG offers more than promises; it offers the power to verify. Key Takeaways BlockDAG is proving its credibility not through marketing but through measurable results. A fully public leadership team, verified audits, an operational testnet, and real-time presale data confirm a structure built on openness rather than speculation. With $430 million raised and more than 3.5M users already mining through its X1 app, the project continues to set new standards for real-world participation. At $0.0015, the entry point remains one of the most transparent and rewarding in crypto. In a market filled with anonymous ventures, BlockDAG’s model of accountability and tangible delivery makes it a clear example of verified value in motion.

You’ll Need Iron Nerves — Or ‘Mental Illness’, Analyst Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/you-want-1k-xrp-youll-need-iron-nerves-or-mental-illness-analyst-says/,"A pro-XRP software developer sparked fresh debate this week by saying it takes “serious conviction” to hold volatile coins like XRP through long, wild swings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Goes Big — $255M Longs Opened Before Trump–China Summit Vincent Van Code said holding XRP all the way to $1,000 — let alone $10,000 — would take “mental illness.” His comments have drawn attention not just for the blunt wording but for the story they tell about the human side of crypto risk. Holder Psychology Under Stress According to Van Code, the real test begins long before a coin hits big numbers. He pointed to Bitcoin as an example: Bitcoin traded under $1 in 2010 and now sits above $110,000. Many claim they would have held from those early days, but Van Code argued most people would have sold around $100. Every talks about “oh if I bought BTC for $1 id because billionaire today”. What you fail to realize is 99% of people would sell even at $100. Or what about when it dumped from $10k down to $1k then back up again. You really have to almost be mentally unstable to hold from $1… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 19, 2025 Reports have also noted whales who were inactive for more than a decade recently moving coins bought for under $1,000 and cashing out millions or billions. The famous case of the French buyer who spent 10,000 BTC on pizza remains a blunt reminder that people do sell, sometimes at huge regret. XRP Near Key Demand Zone Technical calls are mixed. Ether Nasyonal, a crypto analyst, told followers that XRP is “cooking something” on the 1-month chart and highlighted an important demand zone. Following the sharp drop and quick bounce on Oct. 10, XRP failed to break past $2.5 and is still short of the $3 level. The token is down 14% this month. $XRP is cooking something up. Chart has been inverted, but the story remains the same. XRP is still gathering strength within the demand zone emerging from the 2018 major resistance. While the direction may seem confusing, the structure is clear. The next major move… https://t.co/HT9Sqhembx pic.twitter.com/s5grcnCMFZ — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL 💹🧲 (@EtherNasyonaL) October 19, 2025 Past movements add weight to caution: XRP plunged more than 90% after peaking above $3 back in 2018, a crash that punished holders who sold in panic and then watched prices recover later. Personal Stories And Public Bets Some holders frame their approach as a long-term plan. One user, TheXFactor33, said he has held XRP for over eight years and has weathered multiple crashes. Van Code has said he mentally removed the money from his balance sheet and intends not to sell even if prices head far higher. He told followers his aim is to convert the stake into something concrete for his family, such as buying a home for his children. Long-Term Bets Face Real Tests Views on how high XRP could go differ widely. Some analysts project a bullish scenario that sees XRP at $1,000 by 2040, a forecast that would require years of patience — roughly a 15-year hold from today’s levels under $3 — and a lot of market resilience.

This projection has reignited discussions within the crypto community about what such a shift could mean for other digital assets, including XRP. While Bitcoin has recently faced selling pressure, falling below several key support levels, gold has continued to rise, setting new records amid global market uncertainty. Over the past week, gold’s value climbed to an unprecedented $4,381 per ounce, lifting its total market capitalization above $30 trillion, the highest for any asset class. CZ Says Bitcoin Will “Eventually” Flip Gold In a recent statement, CZ expressed confidence that Bitcoin will surpass gold’s valuation, though he admitted that the timeline remains uncertain. According to him, Bitcoin’s superior portability, verifiability, and capped supply make it better suited to become the world’s dominant store of value in the long term. Prediction: Bitcoin will flip gold. I don't know exactly when. Might take some time, but it will happen. Save the tweet. pic.twitter.com/bR4Bq0JeVE — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 20, 2025 Currently, Bitcoin holds a market capitalization of $2.14 trillion, compared to gold’s $30.3 trillion. This means Bitcoin would need to expand by roughly 1,315% to reach parity with gold. Given its circulating supply of about 19.93 million BTC, such an increase would place Bitcoin’s price near $1.52 million per coin. Although this target may seem distant, CZ maintains that it is achievable as digital assets continue to gain global acceptance. He also noted that market cycles and macroeconomic conditions could influence how quickly this milestone is reached. Ripple Effects Across the Crypto Market If Bitcoin were to achieve a $30 trillion valuation, analysts agree that it would likely trigger a dramatic expansion across the wider cryptocurrency sector. Historically, the broader crypto market tends to mirror Bitcoin’s movements, with altcoins often experiencing significant appreciation during BTC bull cycles. At present, Bitcoin commands roughly 59.6% of the entire crypto market’s capitalization, which stands at $3.61 trillion. If this dominance remains consistent when Bitcoin reaches a $30.3 trillion valuation, the overall crypto market could grow to around $50.8 trillion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Under this scenario, XRP, currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, could benefit considerably. XRP presently accounts for approximately 4.03% of the global crypto market, corresponding to a market capitalization of $145.6 billion. If the total market capitalization reaches $50.8 trillion while XRP retains its 4.03% share, its market value would increase to approximately $2.04 trillion. With an estimated circulating supply of 60 billion XRP, this would imply a potential price of $34 per token. XRP’s Potential Within a Growing Market While the theoretical calculation appears promising, analysts caution that market behavior is rarely this linear. Even if Bitcoin were to surpass gold, the extent to which altcoins would benefit depends on several factors, including investor sentiment, liquidity conditions, and institutional participation. Moreover, XRP’s trajectory would also be influenced by Ripple’s ongoing adoption strategy, regulatory clarity surrounding the token, and developments within the cross-border payments sector. Despite these uncertainties, the projection underscores how closely tied XRP’s price action remains to Bitcoin’s overall market performance. Should Bitcoin embark on the type of expansion envisioned by CZ, XRP and other established altcoins could see substantial gains, even if not proportionate to BTC’s growth.

Altcoins are losing strength across the board, and growing concern among traders has fueled renewed talk of a potential bear market. The recent downturn has pushed Ethereum closer to its key technical levels, with investors closely watching whether it can maintain support or if another leg down is imminent. However, not everyone is bearish. On-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that Bitmine, one of the largest Ethereum holders, just made a massive purchase — acquiring 63,539 ETH worth approximately $251.6 million. Large, timely purchases during drawdowns don’t guarantee a reversal, but they often reveal where deep-pocketed participants think value sits. At a minimum, it injects fresh demand at a moment when sentiment is fragile and reactive. From here, the tape matters. If ETH can hold this support and compress into a higher low, the market may start to treat the recent selloff as a shakeout rather than a regime shift. Lose it decisively and the “bear market” calls will likely get louder. For now, Ethereum sits at a crossroads—pressure building, skepticism rising, and one sizable buy hinting that the story isn’t finished yet. Bitmine Adds Ethereum Amid Market Weakness According to Lookonchain, Ethereum whale Bitmine made a major move just eight hours ago — three newly created wallets received a total of 63,539 ETH, worth approximately $251.6 million, from Kraken and BitGo. The on-chain activity sparked renewed discussion among analysts, as such large-scale transfers during a period of selling pressure often reflect institutional accumulation rather than routine repositioning. This addition pushes Bitmine’s holdings to 3,299,553 ETH, valued at around $13.07 billion, representing roughly 2.73% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. The sheer scale of this position places Bitmine among the most influential holders of ETH, capable of impacting both sentiment and liquidity across the network. Analysts often interpret these types of movements as confidence signals, particularly when they occur in periods of heightened volatility. At a time when Ethereum is struggling to maintain key support levels and broader market confidence is fragile, such accumulation could serve as a stabilizing force — or at least a psychological one. Historically, similar whale activity has preceded local price recoveries as supply tightens and market participants reassess short-term bearish bias. Still, the broader context cannot be ignored. Ethereum remains vulnerable to macro headwinds, and on-chain flows alone may not offset systemic selling. What’s clear, however, is that Bitmine’s latest accumulation stands out as a show of conviction — an assertive move that suggests some large holders still view current price levels as a long-term opportunity rather than a signal of deeper decline. Testing A Pivotal Price Level On the 3-day chart, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to stabilize after a period of sharp selling pressure, currently trading around $3,871. The broader structure still shows an uptrend, but recent candles reveal a clear slowdown in bullish momentum. After peaking near $4,800, ETH entered a correction that brought price back toward the 50-period moving average (blue line), which now serves as a key short-term support level. This zone has historically acted as a pivot during mid-cycle consolidations, and holding above it would keep Ethereum within a healthy market structure. However, if ETH loses this level, the next significant support lies between $3,400 and $3,500, where the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) moving averages converge — an area that often attracts long-term buyers. To the upside, ETH needs a decisive close above $4,000–$4,200 to regain momentum and potentially retest the $4,500 resistance, which has been a strong rejection level since late September. Overall, the 3D chart paints a picture of short-term weakness within a broader bullish framework. Ethereum’s ability to defend its mid-range support will determine whether this correction evolves into accumulation or signals the start of a deeper market retrace.

With the ever-increasing scalability and efficiency of the networks, institutional pressure to purchase ETH remains very high. However, Ethereum is now being overtaken by all estimates, by a relatively unknown DeFi protocol in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token that has already raised more than $17.7 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a two-sided approach to lending which integrates Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract to maximize the effectiveness of capital which has drawn the interest of DeFi investors eager to find the most optimal cryptocurrency to invest in today before the next bull cycle. Its distinctive framework, rising presale, and CertiK-backed security review has convinced a few that Mutuum Finance is an early-phase undertaking like the growth of Ethereum in its baby stages. Ethereum Faces Stiff Opposition as Bulls target at $5,000 Ethereum (ETH) is approximately at $4,147, before a key point of resistance at $4,222, where the long-term holders have begun to take profits and this trend is eroding its progress to the highly anticipated $5,000 mark. On-chain indicators confirm a Holder Accumulation Ratio of only 30, which is nowhere near the ideal 50, with less conviction and constant distribution by larger hand. Breaking out above $4,222 strongly would re-open the optimism, while failure to break higher would push ETH down to $3,872. In the meantime as Ethereum makes its next move, investors have been following the emerging DeFi crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which most regard as a new engine of behemoth profitability in the next market cycle and one of the strongest crypto to buy today. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the talk of the DeFi community and crypto market with increasing investor buzz driving the project forward. Already selling 70% of its sixth presale, the demand is viewed as an indication of increasing confidence in the project and has fueled rumors among investors looking for the safest bet of cryptocurrencies to invest in. The token can be purchased for $0.035 today. Thus far, over 17,330 buyers have collectively bought a total of $17.7 million of MUTM tokens. The stampede validates increased global interest in Mutuum Finance’s decentralized financial long-term risk-taking model. At speed, MUTM is the leading crypto to buy now, attracting buyers and traders who are looking for a new cryptocurrency that has real-world tangible DeFi utility and value. For interested investors who are eager to know what crypto to buy now or searching for the best crypto to invest in for 2025, experts now recommend MUTM. Mutuum Finance will soon release its lending and borrowing protocol , another titanic leap towards building its decentralized infrastructure. The platform will first go on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Mutuum Leaderboard Rewards Mutuum Finance leaderboard is fueling a buying spree among investors with its incentive and 24-hour competition. Top 24-hour buyer leaders purchased $12,538, $11,667, and $1,027 MUTM tokens respectively, proof of the higher activity and buying spree among the community players during presale. Individual players who reach the top spot on the leaderboard are rewarded with $500 MUTM as an appreciation for persistence and dedication. A single trade by one player within 24 hours is what is tallied to earn a reward. Ethereum (ETH) is at close to $4,000, but where the attention is centered is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a $0.035 DeFi Phase 6 token that is 70% sold and has raised $17.7M. With its dual-loan model, CertiK audit, and Q4 2025 protocol launch, MUTM is widely regarded as the best crypto to invest in today, making it a top choice for those evaluating what crypto to buy now, challenging Ethereum’s initial boom.

Bitcoin slipped under $110,000 intraday and Ethereum fell below $3,900, dragging most altcoins into the red as a risk-off wave rippled across digital assets. The drawdown follows one of the harshest months of the year. The market has erased roughly $370 billion in value, with as much as $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated and $65 billion wiped from futures open interest, resetting activity to early-2025 levels. Related Reading: Winklevoss-Led Gemini Exchange Unveils New Credit Card Featuring Solana Rewards Institutional support thinned as spot Bitcoin ETFs posted about $1.23B in weekly net outflows, including $366M on Friday alone, removing a key buyer during sell pressure. At the same time, a major AWS outage disrupted access on leading venues, including Coinbase and several DeFi front ends, widening spreads and accelerating forced unwinds. Within 24 hours , over $240M in long positions, mostly BTC and ETH, were liquidated, briefly pushing Bitcoin toward $107,500. Musk/SpaceX Wallet Move Fuels Fear As Macro Tensions Simmer Nerves frayed further after trackers flagged SpaceX transfers totaling 2,395 BTC ($268M). While on-chain analysts suggest the flows look like internal custody reshuffles, with receiving wallets still inactive, the timing sparked “Is Musk selling?” headlines and added to headline risk. The backdrop was already fragile as renewed U.S.–China trade tensions, a stronger dollar, and U.S. fiscal uncertainty have pushed investors toward cash and safe havens. Micro catalysts didn’t help confidence. A Paxos operational error that minted an astronomical number of PYUSD units (quickly reversed) reminded traders of infrastructure risk just as liquidity thinned. Meanwhile, altcoins bled more than majors (averaging 4% drop) as SOL, BNB, ADA and DOGE posted deeper single-day declines, while XRP showed relative resilience on fresh institutional headlines. The rotation underscores a classic flight to quality: when BTC wobbles, smaller caps usually underperform. What To Watch Next Technically, Bitcoin faces layered resistance near $112,000–$115,500, with supports at $108,000, $105,000–$102,000, and the psychological $100,000 zone. A decisive daily close back above the 50-day region ($113,000) would help stabilize momentum; lose $101,700 and the market risks a deeper bearish phase as stop-losses and auto-deleveraging re-ignite.

Wave 3 Tells A Story Of A Surge For Ethereum, bulls want to reclaim $4,000 and the $4,050–$4,150 supply area; failure keeps pressure on toward $3,700–$3,600. Near-term catalysts remain firmly macro, with the upcoming U.S. CPI print and any Federal Reserve hints on rate cuts or quantitative tightening (QT) likely to shift liquidity dynamics quickly. On the micro side, investors should monitor ETF flows to see if outflows ease, as well as exchange uptime and whale behavior.

53476728,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87177,1761094827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says Shiba Inu (SHIB) Would Enter Trend Reversal Zone If…,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-shiba-inu-shib-would-enter-trend-reversal-zone-if/,"Shiba Inu, one of the leading meme-inspired cryptocurrencies, has maintained stability around a major support zone, prompting renewed optimism among analysts that the asset could be preparing for a potential reversal . Despite prolonged weakness across the broader market, SHIB continues to attract attention from traders monitoring its technical structure. The token has dropped by 1.7% over the past week, 18.77% in the last 30 days, and more than 42% since the start of the year. These declines indicate a dominant bearish trend, but some analysts argue that SHIB’s long-term structure remains intact. SHIB Holding at a Key Support Range Market analyst ForexDremVantage recently published an update highlighting that Shiba Inu has managed to sustain its position above a crucial support level near $0.000010. He emphasized that maintaining this range could be essential for preventing further downside pressure and potentially setting the stage for recovery. According to the analyst, this zone has served as an accumulation area since March 2025, as investors continue to consolidate holdings at these lower levels. Other market commentators have expressed similar views, noting that prolonged accumulation at major support areas often precedes significant price movement. Potential Recovery Levels Identified In his latest assessment, ForexDremVantage also outlined additional technical levels that may influence SHIB’s short-term trajectory. He identified $0.0000119 as the next significant area of demand, describing it as both a potential recovery target and a region containing substantial supply pressure. The analyst projected that a move toward this range would represent approximately a 20% increase from the current trading level of $0.000001047. Successfully reclaiming this price point could serve as confirmation of renewed bullish momentum, signaling that the market is ready for the next upward phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, he cautioned that several resistance zones remain overhead. The most immediate obstacle is a descending trendline that has consistently limited price advances since May, when SHIB last traded at $0.00001765. Technical data shows that this trendline currently aligns near $0.000013, about 31% above current prices. Confirmation of a Bullish Reversal According to ForexDremVantage, a decisive breakout above the descending trendline would likely bring Shiba Inu into what he describes as the “trend reversal zone.” This region begins near the May 12 high of $0.00001765, representing a potential 78% gain from current levels. Reaching and maintaining a price above this threshold would, in his view, confirm a transition from a bearish to a bullish trend. Such a move would also establish new targets at $0.000020 and $0.000025, levels that could define the next phase of SHIB’s market cycle. While SHIB continues to trade under pressure, its ability to hold key support areas suggests that sellers may be losing momentum. Analysts note that if buying interest increases at the current range, the asset could be positioned for a gradual recovery. However, sustained gains will depend on whether the token can overcome multiple layers of resistance and maintain consistent trading volume. For now, the market’s focus remains on whether Shiba Inu can preserve the $0.000010 support level. A breakdown below this threshold could expose the asset to new lows, while a confirmed move above $0.000013 could signal the start of a broader recovery phase.

This is where the outcome is expected to determine BTC’s overall direction and confirm a continuation of a bull market or bear market correction. Why This Zone Will Define Bitcoin’s Next Expansion Phase In an X post, an institutional-grade reporter, Bitcoin Vector, has highlighted that BTC has entered its decisive battleground between $110,000 and $115,000, which could determine the trajectory of the entire cycle. In the past week, spot demand, which is the engine of sustained rallies, was notably weak and capped by the escalating US-China trade tensions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Disbelief Phase’ – Could Short Sellers Face The Next Squeeze? As those tensions eased, that spot demand showed signs of returning, allowing BTC to claw its way back above the critical $110,000 level. Despite recovery back into the battleground, momentum remains negative and flat. Without sustained inflow and spot demand, the bullish structure could fade fast, leaving BTC exposed to another pullback. However, if demand holds and momentum turns up, BTC advances deeper into the battleground. A failure to maintain this range and BTC may risk retreating again and raising the white flag. A full-time crypto trader, Sykodelic, has also offered a highly optimistic prediction that Bitcoin will be back to an All-Time High (ATH) by the end of the month. The market is still in uncertainty and fear, where BTC thrives for its next leg higher. This is the stage of the cycle where disbelief dominates. As a result, traders convince themselves the rally is over, and that’s when BTC starts to move again. By the time BTC approaches its previous highs, traders will finally believe again, which often happens when another long flush clears out late entrants. Technically, BTC price is moving back above the 4-hour 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). Each time, Bitcoin successfully retests this level as support, the price continues to expand higher. “I think the worst is behind us,” Sykodelic noted. The Supply Battle That Shapes The Next Cycle The current Bitcoin market is in a supply tug-of-war between two powerful forces. According to the ambassador of MGBX_EN, BitBull, long-term holders (LTHs) have been constantly offloading their coins, while institutions are aggressively absorbing the supply through Spot ETFs and Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Hits $2.25 Billion Following Market Crash — What Could This Mean? Meanwhile, the treasury holdings have quietly surpassed $120 billion, with BTC still dominating the stack. Spot ETFs alone have absorbed tens of thousands of coins this quarter, proving that institutional demand remains strong. However, LTHs are still selling faster than ETFs, and DATs can absorb. Historically, when this kind of accelerated LTH distribution occurs, BTC tends to lose short-term momentum. This is not a bearish setup, but it does imply that the upside remains temporarily capped until the selling pressure fades. Thus, institutions are buying the strength, not the bottoms. Ultimately, the next major breakout hinges on when long-term holders stop distributing and return to accumulation mode.

To remain competitive in the cloud computing industry, the sources pointed out that the deal, which is still being worked out, would have the tech giant offering cloud computing services to Anthropic. This is not Google’s first time investing in the artificial intelligence firm. The firm previously invested approximately $3 billion in Anthropic; the tech giant committed to investing $2 billion in the AI startup in 2023 and followed up with another $1 billion investment early this year. Anthropic raises large amounts of funds to stay competitive in the AI industry Anthropic and Google’s upcoming $10B cloud computing deal has ignited debates in the tech ecosystem. To address this heated discussion, reporters reached out to both Anthropic and Google to comment and request further information on the progress of the talks, but the companies chose not to respond. Sources familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the talks, however, hinted that the talks were still in the initial stage, suggesting that details might change. In the meantime, recent data in after-hours trading revealed that Google’s stock surged by more than 3.5%. At the same time, that of Amazon.com Inc., another crucial investor and cloud service provider for Anthropic, encountered a decline of around 2%. Founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, Anthropic’s headquarters is based in San Francisco, California, at 548 Market St. The company is well-known for its Claude series of large language models, which rival OpenAI’s GPT models. Like other firms in the AI field, the startup has been raising substantial amounts of money to keep pace with the intense competition in advancing AI technology. Still, industry experts believe that the company requires more resources for research, the implementation of new ideas, and growing consumer interest to solidify its position as a leader in AI. Goal-oriented with a focus on AI leadership, the company recently engaged in initial findings talks with MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, just a month after finalizing a $13 billion funding round. This funding round, led by Iconiq Capital and featuring Fidelity Management and Research Co. and Lightspeed Venture Partners as co-leads, nearly tripled the valuation of the US-based AI startup firm to $183 billion. This amount includes the funds raised. Amazon pledges to invest around $8 billion in Anthropic Besides Google, Amazon also pledged to invest around $8 billion in Anthropic. Notably, the company is a key AI client of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a significant user of Amazon’s custom AI chips. This was after reliable sources highlighted that in 2024, Amazon.com Inc. invested an additional $4 billion into the AI startup firm, boosting its investment in one of OpenAI’s biggest rivals. Both companies announced the investment. Additionally, it was confirmed after a previous investment of approximately $4 billion in Anthropic, which occurred the same year. Under the previous investment deal, Anthropic was required to utilize Amazon Web Services data centers for some of its computing tasks. It also involved using AI chips designed by AWS. Despite Amazon’s substantial investments in Anthropic, research from sources has revealed that the company is strongly connected to Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc. Meanwhile, in a blog post, Anthropic pointed out that Amazon’s additional $4 billion investment signaled AWS’s position as the firm’s primary cloud and training partner. Moreover, the AI startup company revealed its intentions to use Amazon’s AI chips to develop its most advanced models. Therefore, with this deal, Anthropic confirmed Amazon as its minority investor.

53477573,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841906,1761095541,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53477573.jpeg,Asia exchanges crack down on crypto hoarders masquerading as listed firms,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/asia-exchanges-crack-down-on-crypto-hoarders/,"Asia’s top three stock markets are tightening their listing rules and supervising companies to ensure they don’t become quasi–crypto investment vehicles. The move comes as regulators across the region are catching on to an emergent phenomenon of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs). These firms exist, first and foremost, to collect and hold cryptocurrencies rather than run traditional businesses. The gathering resistance represents a pivot for an industry that contributed to the surge of Bitcoin in 2025. The world’s largest digital currency reached a record $126,251 on Oct. 6, its historical high and an 18% year-to-date gain, as public companies around the world adopted Bitcoin-hoarding tactics pioneered by Michael Saylor’s $70 billion MicroStrategy Inc. However, enthusiasm has waned in recent months. DAT share prices have fallen sharply in tandem with a broader crypto market correction, with retail investors estimated to have lost more than $17 billion, according to 10X Research. Hong Kong moves to rein in digital treasuries Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (HKEX) has reportedly either rejected or challenged at least five firms seeking to transition into treasury models centered on digital assets over the past few months, citing listing rules that prohibit maintaining a large liquid position of holdings. None of the apps has been approved. A rule of the exchange classifies companies with majority assets in cash or short-term investments as “cash companies,” which may be suspended or delisted. The policy aims to discourage shell companies from exploiting their listed status to generate speculative gains. “Listing regulations directly shape how fast and how cleanly a digital-asset treasury model can operate,” said Rick Maeda, a Tokyo-based crypto analyst at Presto Research. Rules that are “predictable and accommodative” attract capital and boost investor confidence, while harsher environments hinder DATs’ execution speed, he added. An HKEX spokesperson stated that the exchange’s framework ensures all listed and applying companies maintain “viable and sustainable” business operations. India and Australia follow suit In India, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) recently rejected Jetking Infotrain’s application to issue new shares via preferential allotment after the company announced plans to invest part of the proceeds in crypto assets. The firm has appealed the decision, as stated in regulatory filings. Australia has adopted a similarly cautious stance. The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) bars listed companies from holding more than 50% of their balance sheets in cash or cash-like assets, a rule that effectively blocks the DAT model. Software firm Locate Technologies Ltd., which began purchasing Bitcoin earlier this year, is now shifting its listing to New Zealand, where the NZX has shown greater openness to hosting DATs. An ASX spokesperson said that while crypto treasury strategies aren’t explicitly banned, firms pursuing them should consider structuring their exposure as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to comply with listing standards. Japan stands out as the only major Asia-Pacific market where listed companies can freely adopt digital-asset treasury strategies. Local regulations permit firms to maintain substantial cash reserves, offering greater flexibility to invest in Bitcoin. “Once a company discloses it is purchasing Bitcoin, it’s difficult to conclude that such actions are unacceptable,” said Hiromi Yamaji, CEO of Japan Exchange Group, in a September press conference. Japan currently leads the region with 14 listed Bitcoin-holding firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. Among them is hotel operator Metaplanet Inc., which holds roughly $3.3 billion in Bitcoin. The company’s stock soared earlier this year before falling more than 70% from its June peak. However, even Japan’s DAT-friendly landscape may be changing. MSCI Inc., one of the world’s largest index providers, has proposed excluding DAT-heavy firms from its global indexes, arguing they resemble investment funds. The move followed Metaplanet’s $1.4 billion share sale in September, with most proceeds directed toward Bitcoin purchases. Travis Lundy, Japan equity analyst at Smartkarma, warned that if MSCI’s proposal goes through, it could strip DATs of passive fund inflows and remove their valuation premium.” The divergent approaches across Asia highlight the ongoing regulatory challenge of striking a balance between innovation in digital asset management and investor protection. While Japan’s flexible rules have encouraged experimentation, Hong Kong, India, and Australia are tightening oversight to maintain market integrity and avoid speculative excesses.

Diddy Moves To Appeal His 4 Year Prison Sentence According to an October 20 court filing in New York federal court, Combs has plans to appeal two prostitution-related charges he was convicted of back in July. Combs, who was sentenced to 50 months in prison for the charges earlier this month, was also acquitted of racketeering and sex trafficking charges. The rapper-turned-mogul has been ordered to pay $500,0000 fine and five years of supervised release. Combs is currently being held at Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in New York City, where he previously lived in the same prison block as former crypto kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried. Sources told NBC News in a September 2024 report that Bankman-Fried and Combs were being held in a “barrack-style area” which housed no more than 20 inmates who may have required “special detention” due to their high-profile status. The prison is widely known for its poor conditions and heightened violence, particularly in regard to stabbings. Sam Bankman-Fried Speaks Out Over 2022 Arrest Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is also in the middle of appealing his 2023 conviction on seven counts of fraud tied to his time at FTX. The former “king of crypto” was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the massive digital asset scheme that saw FTX investors drained out of $8 billion. Several former associates of Bankman-Fried also testified against him, including FTX chief technical officer, Gary Wang, the crypto platform’s former head of engineering, Nishad Singh and one-time Alameda Research CEO, Caroline Ellison.

Anutin rejected claims that Vorapak had been appointed to head the country’s anti-scam committee, saying that “There’s no such appointment.” News outlets had written that Anutin had appointed Vorapak the previous day. “His name isn’t on the list — never was, never will be. I’m the chairman,” he added, while stating that oversight of financial matters remains under Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas, while investigations fall to the Justice Ministry. Project Brazen’s Whale Hunting newsletter alleged that Vorapak’s wife received $3 million in cryptocurrency payments tied to a cross-border criminal network linked to South African Benjamin Mauerberger, who is considered a fugitive. The report, citing corporate filings in Singapore, suggested the transactions could be linked to illicit online operations that have proliferated across the Mekong region. Vorapak has strongly denied the allegations. Government under pressure to distance itself Anutin’s comments are seen by some as an attempt to draw a line between the deputy minister and Thailand’s anti-scam campaign. Finance Minister Ekniti had previously told reporters that Vorapak would lead a task force to trace “grey money” flows connected to the syndicates, a remark that fueled speculation about his role in the committee. That group, known as the Connect the Dots task force, was created to map financial and identity data tied to online scams and illegal remittances. Ekniti said the task force aims to complete coordination work by December, in partnership with key agencies including the Bank of Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Anti-Money Laundering Office. However, the revelation that Vorapak was linked to the task force, coupled with the Whale Hunting report, has raised concerns of potential conflicts of interest within the Finance Ministry. Expanding threat of regional scam syndicates The controversy speaks to Thailand’s mounting challenge in combating online scam operations that have become industrial in scale across Southeast Asia . Many of the syndicates are based in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, often near the Thai and Chinese borders, and are known to traffic victims who are forced to carry out online fraud, including investment and romance scams. Earlier this month, some South Korean citizens allegedly working for such syndicates were repatriated from Cambodia , while Myanmar’s junta raided a major scam compound, detaining over 2,000 workers and seizing Starlink satellite equipment. The United Nations has warned that these networks continue to expand, and they highlight the role the rise of cryptocurrency payments and the use of satellite internet to evade detection play in all of these. Political and economic implications Anutin’s administration, while still new, has positioned the anti-scam drive as a cornerstone of its digital policy, both to safeguard Thai citizens and to restore investor confidence. Thailand’s partnership with the United States on cybersecurity enforcement also signals a commitment to international cooperation. “If anyone is found guilty, the law will take care of them,” Anutin told reporters. However, questions still remain over how the government will pursue investigations if senior officials are implicated.

To achieve this, the company seeks approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after submitting a filing to the commission. Meanwhile, reliable sources have noted that this index is crucial in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as it measures the performance of the top 20 cryptocurrencies based on their market capitalization. Crypto fund providers embrace crypto ETF approval in the sector ProShares shared the new fund’s name, suggesting it will be known as ProShares CoinDesk Crypto 20 ETF. According to the company, it will enable investors to invest in key cryptocurrencies, including Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin. On the other hand, the SEC filing highlighted that this ETF is designed to reflect the performance of the CoinDesk 20 Index. Notably, this will not account for fees and other expenses. Reliable sources have also conducted research and discovered that the index will not comprise wrapped tokens, meme coins, or stablecoins, but will instead focus on cryptocurrencies with significant market capitalizations and strong liquidity. To support this claim, the market benchmark prominently includes BTC, ETH, and XRP, with SOL also being one of the largest assets in the index. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ProShares’ move illustrates a growing trend among crypto fund providers seeking approval for crypto ETFs. An example is VanEck , which recently updated its Solana ETF application and reduced fees to 0.3%. Regarding ProShares’ crypto ETF, the company has made it clear that its ETF will not directly own any cryptocurrencies. Instead, it aims to gain exposure in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by using swaps, derivatives, and similar financial tools linked to the assets in the index. Sources have confirmed that this approach is highly preferred in the market, citing examples like the recent update of 21Shares’s S-1 filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF seeking approval from the SEC. They also highlighted that this investment setup will comply with the current regulatory standards. Additionally, it will enable investors to acquire the performance of the crypto market via a regulated option. The fund intends to set up a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands to manage certain derivative contracts. However, it will ensure that these contracts do not surpass 25% of its total assets. ProShares seeks more crypto-related investment options In 2021, ProShares introduced a Bitcoin futures ETF, marking the first US bitcoin-linked ETF. Since its launch, the company has been actively working on developing more crypto-related investment options. ProShares increased its interest in this sector after the latest filing highlighted that several institutions preferred diversified crypto baskets to help them mitigate the uncertainties surrounding individual assets. Regarding the CoinDesk 20 Index’s updated process, it undergoes an update every three months. Moreover, it includes some of the most popularly traded coins, such as BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA, and Avalanche. This aligns with a broader trend, as REX–Osprey has recently submitted filings for several ETFs linked to altcoins, including ADA, HYPE, XLM, and SUI. If approved, the ProShares CoinDesk Crypto 20 ETF will be positioned as one of the first US diversified crypto ETFs.

Market analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode cost-basis distribution heatmap showing a heavy band at that level Dogecoin Bulls Face $2.2 Billion Wall “10.50 billion $DOGE were accumulated at $0.21. That’s a big resistance zone forming. Keep this level on your radar!” he wrote. The underlying tooltip on Ali’s chart (timestamped Oct. 19, 2025, UTC) pinpoints a Cost Basis Range: $0.21062334–$0.21144839 with Supply: 10,575,420,761.332544 DOGE clustered there. At $0.21, that cohort represents roughly $2.22 billion in supply. The technical context around that same band adds weight to the on-chain reading. In a separate TradingView chart shared Oct. 20, Ali noted that Dogecoin “just bounced off the channel support and looks set to climb. Eyes on $0.29 first, then $0.45 and $0.86.” Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 His channel overlay tracks price respecting an ascending structure across multiple tests since 2023, with intermediate waypoints aligning closely to classical retracement and extension levels. Notably, the $0.21 area intersects the 0.618 retracement at ~$0.21205 on his plot—an overlap of technical and realized-price resistance that helps explain the current stall and the importance of clearing this shelf with convincing volume. DOGE Whales Continue To Accumulate A separate on-chain lens from Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) focuses on holder concentration dynamics. Sharing a long-horizon chart titled “Percent of Supply Held by Top 1% Addresses,” the analyst observed, “The supply held %1 data downward trend has not yet been seen as the price moves toward a new all-time high. To the moon > Target: $1.30.” The graphic shows the top-1% cohort maintaining an elevated—and recently rising—share of supply as price has recovered from the cycle lows. While such concentration is often interpreted as a proxy for large-holder conviction or tighter float, it can simultaneously amplify directional moves when those balances rotate; for now, the absence of a downtrend in the metric suggests no broad distribution from the largest addresses has materialized. Related Reading: Next Dogecoin Stop Could Be $0.33 If This Level Holds, Analyst Says Read together, the three signals sketch a coherent near-term battleground. First, the cost-basis heatmap identifies a thick realized-supply node precisely where spot is grappling—$0.21—implying latent sell pressure from holders looking to exit at break-even and equally strong validation if price can flip the level into support. Second, Ali’s price structure marks that same zone as Fibonacci resistance within an established rising channel, sharpening the inflection. Third, top-holder concentration has not rolled over, reducing evidence (so far) of heavy distribution into strength. If bulls absorb the ~$2.2 billion equivalent sitting at $0.21 and reclaim the 0.618 band, Ali’s stepped upside $0.29 (0.786 Fib), $0.46 (1.0 Fib) and $0.86 (1.272 Fib extension) path provides a clear roadmap of overhead targets; if they fail, the confluence argues for a renewed retest of channel support before any larger move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.195.

Short-term players are watching a break above $112,200 for signs of renewed strength, while long-term holders still sit largely in profit. Reports have disclosed that easing US–China tensions may help risk assets like Bitcoin in the near term, adding a geopolitical layer to price action. Macro Risks Could Shape Next Downturn According to analyst Willy Woo, the next crypto bear market could be driven by a classic “business cycle” slump rather than the usual crypto rhythms. He pointed out that two cycles have overlapped so far: the four-year Bitcoin halving rhythm and swings in M2 money supply. Woo warned that a true business cycle contraction — the kind seen around 2001 and 2008 — would be a different test for Bitcoin’s role in markets. We had two 4y cycles superimposed Now it’s only one; global M2 liquidity Next bear IMO will be defined by another cycle people forget about → the business cycle The last biz cycle downturns that really took hold was 2008 and 2001, from before crypto markets were invented pic.twitter.com/inHqQH7zWx — Willy Woo (@woonomic) October 20, 2025 Historical Events Offer A Guide The dot-com downturn around 2001 saw US stocks fall roughly 50% over two years. And during the 2008 financial crisis the S&P 500 dropped about 56% as credit froze and GDP fell. Those events happened before crypto existed, which is why Woo says crypto has not yet been stress-tested by a full-scale recession. Based on reports, that concern is about how liquidity would change and how quickly investors would sell riskier holdings. Liquidity And Recession Signals The National Bureau of Economic Research tracks employment, personal income, industrial production and retail sales to spot recessions. Right now there is no across-the-board signal that a deep downturn is imminent, though some risks are elevated. Trade tariffs are one factor that trimmed growth in the first half of 2025 and are expected to weigh on GDP into the first half of 2026, analysts said. That kind of slower growth can sap liquidity and pressure markets. $BTC has reclaimed the $109,000-$110,000 support zone. The next crucial level to reclaim is $112,000, which could push Bitcoin higher. With US-China trade tensions easing, I think BTC could rally more from here. pic.twitter.com/D8VNses1ix — Ted (@TedPillows) October 20, 2025 What Traders Are Watching Next Analyst Ted Pillows said Bitcoin has regained a foothold between $109,000 and $110,000, and he pointed to $112,000 as the next resistance that matters. A clean move above that zone could invite more buyers. Conversely, a sharp liquidity squeeze from a broader recession could force Bitcoin to move more like tech stocks did in past downturns, not like gold. The Real Test Woo said the real test for Bitcoin will come when cash gets tight and investors must choose where to park money — not from the usual crypto triggers. This period, he said, will expose who treated Bitcoin as a hedge and who treated it as a high-risk bet, and that outcome will shape institutional behavior and market rules going forward.

The statement is a direct response to earlier criticisms by Trump-appointed AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who accused Anthropic of pushing a “woke” agenda and fear-mongering to capture regulators and harm the startup ecosystem. Dario Amodei defended Anthropic from accusations Amodei was forced to address the “inaccurate claims” about his company’s startup policy stances after the constant criticism from David Sacks, the current AI and crypto czar. In the statement, published on Anthropic’s official website, Amodei highlighted how the company is aligned with the Trump administration across “key areas of AI policy,” and that it is interested in working with “anyone serious about getting this right.” “I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development,” Amodei’s statement read . Anthropic , whose valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years, got on Sacks’ radar last week after Jack Clark, one of the company’s co-founders and its current head of policy, published an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,” sparking a debate over AI regulation online. Sacks did not like the essay, and he was quite vocal with his criticism, accusing Anthropic of “running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,” according to a post on X. According to him, the company is “principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem,” a point Amodei directly tackled in his statement by explaining that startups are among Anthropic’s most important customers. “We work with tens of thousands of startups and partner with hundreds of accelerators and VCs,” he wrote. “Claude is powering an entirely new generation of AI-native companies. Damaging that ecosystem makes no sense for us.” As far as Amodei is concerned, the company’s longstanding position has been that a uniform federal approach is preferable to a patchwork of state laws, and that has not changed. “When we agree, we say so. When we don’t, we propose an alternative for consideration,” Amodei said. “We do this because we are a public benefit corporation with a mission to ensure that AI benefits everyone and to maintain America’s lead in AI.” The clash between Sacks and one of Anthropic’s defenders A week after Sack’s criticism, Billionaire tech investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman rose to Anthropic’s defense , calling the startup “one of the good guys.” Hoffman, who is a partner at VC firm Greylock, which, he revealed, has invested in Anthropic, took to X to classify Anthropic among the few AI companies trying to “deploy AI the right way” which is “thoughtfully, safely, and enormously beneficial for society.” “Some other labs are making decisions that clearly disregard safety and societal impact (e.g., bots that sometimes go full-fascist) and that’s a choice,” he added. It did not take Sacks long to find the post, which he quickly responded to, triggering a virtual standoff between them on X. In one post, Sacks claimed the “real issue” is “Anthropic’s agenda to backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California.” Sacks also called Hoffman “the leading funder of lawfare and dirty tricks against President Trump” while Elon Musk, whose AI lab was not listed in Hoffman’s post, also chimed in with a one-word endorsement of Sacks’ stance. Hoffman responded by writing: “Shows you didn’t read the post (not shocked). When you are ready to have a professional conversation about AI’s impact on America, I’m here to chat.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Nailwal expressed frustration with Ethereum’s community, but said he remained loyal, even as he faced criticism over Polygon’s classification. Inside Ethereum Power Struggles In response, Buterin highlighted the contributions of Polygon and Nailwal personally, describing the project as more than a “not just boring finance app.” He gave a shoutout to Polygon’s Layer 2 work and said that it has made Ethereum stronger. The Ethereum co-founder’s acknowledgment came amid Nailwal’s candid reflections about the social and market pressures surrounding Polygon. Nailwal spoke about the difficulty of categorizing Polygon as a Layer 1 or Layer 2, and pointed out how such distinctions influence market perception and valuation. He described being called out by stakeholders for not labeling Polygon a Layer 1, despite the chain’s deep integration with Ethereum. Nailwal also alluded to moments of personal conflict, while noting that navigating the Ethereum community had felt like a “shit show” at times, while simultaneously expressing respect for Buterin as someone he “looked up to as an ideal for how things should be built in this world.” Ethereum Elite Under Fire Nailwal’s response comes after Ethereum core developer Péter Szilágyi published a lengthy letter he first shared privately with Ethereum Foundation (EF) leadership in May 2024. In it, Szilágyi outlined long-standing frustrations with governance, compensation, and the emergence of an Ethereum “elite” that ultimately answers to Buterin. He described feeling like a “useful fool,” caught between loyalty to Ethereum and personal dissatisfaction, and criticized the perceived dissonance between public portrayals of his leadership role and how responsibilities were handled internally. Szilágyi highlighted compensation issues and mentioned that underpayment created incentives for top contributors to explore opportunities elsewhere, which ended up opening space for concentrated influence among high-profile insiders. While he said that Ethereum remains a powerful protocol, these structural and social dynamics create ongoing challenges for long-term contributors navigating recognition, opportunity, and principle within the network. “Do I find Ethereum fixable? No, not really. I don’t see how any of this can be reversed. I feel the Foundation blew allegiance to it beyond reversal. I feel Vitalik – with all his good intents – created the ruling elite who will never relinquish control anymore, so you either play ball or you get sidelined (at least they pay well apparently). As for Geth, I feel we are considered a problem in the grand scheme of things in Ethereum – myself at the centre of that problem – so I don’t really see a bright future for myself with my pushbacks against the issues I see.” The post Polygon’s Nailwal Bashes the Ethereum Community, Buterin Steps In With Surprising Praise appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Ethereum|Polygon (MATIC)|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|MATIC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-22 02:45:49

The excitement centers on Evernorth, a project aiming to strengthen XRP’s role in institutional and decentralized finance. JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a prominent crypto influencer on X, shared Garlinghouse’s post with the community. This mention from one of the most followed voices in the XRP community gave further visibility to what many see as a defining step in Ripple’s long-term strategy. Garlinghouse announced that Ripple has joined a coalition of major investors supporting Evernorth . In his post, he said he and the Ripple team are proud to partner with Evernorth and that the project is “building something special.” Among the listed investors are SBI Holdings, Pantera Capital, Kraken, GSR, and Rippleworks. Their combined participation marks one of the most substantial institutional alignments seen around XRP to date. BREAKING: CEO of @Ripple – Brad Garlinghouse is excited about the largest institutional #XRP treasuries in the world! pic.twitter.com/nZRKUdqrwv — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 20, 2025 Evernorth’s Institutional Ambition At the center of the announcement is Evernorth’s goal to establish one of the largest institutional XRP treasuries in the world, with plans to raise over $1 billion in gross proceeds. The move is designed to solidify XRP’s presence in high-value markets and deepen its use within institutional frameworks. Evernorth’s approach includes participating in institutional lending, liquidity provisioning, and creating DeFi yield opportunities using XRP as the foundation. Evernorth also plans to strengthen the XRP Ledger by contributing to validator operations. According to the statement, the initiative will operate XRP validators to “strengthen the resilience and decentralization of the ledger.” This focus on validator participation demonstrates a commitment not only to XRP’s market expansion but also to the security and stability of the network itself. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Integration Through RLUSD and DeFi Access A major component of Evernorth’s plan involves leveraging Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. One of the images shared by JackTheRippler describes this as an on-ramp into XRP-based decentralized finance, opening pathways for yield generation and lending built around XRP collateral. For institutional players, the integration of RLUSD could simplify access to XRP liquidity while reducing volatility concerns, thereby increasing XRP’s utility across multiple financial applications. Evernorth’s DeFi and institutional focus positions XRP to evolve from a payments bridge asset into a key tool for liquidity, lending, and capital market applications. Market Development and Adoption Potential Evernorth plans to advance XRP’s real-world utility across payments, capital markets, and tokenized assets, reinforcing its role in global finance. By connecting institutional systems with blockchain-based liquidity and DeFi tools, Ripple and its partners are driving adoption and long-term growth. With major investors backing the project and visibility boosted by JackTheRippler, XRP’s position as a scalable and essential digital asset continues to strengthen within both institutional and decentralized finance.

53480252,611050,1761102008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53480252.jpeg,"GENIUS Act Could Shield Bitcoin From Fed Oversight, Governor Barr Warns",https://bitcoinist.com/genius-act-shield-bitcoin-from-fed/,"Federal Reserve Governor Michael S. Barr used a keynote at DC Fintech Week to praise Congress for finally drawing lines around stablecoins—then immediately warned that the new law’s drafting could open channels for risk and regulatory arbitrage, including a pathway for Bitcoin-linked instruments to sit inside stablecoin reserves with only indirect Federal Reserve visibility. Bitcoin May Exploit Loophole In GENIUS Act Speaking in Washington on October 16, Barr said “payments innovation is accelerating,” and acknowledged that the newly enacted GENIUS Act “provides some clarity to issuers of stablecoins about how they can fit into the regulatory and supervisory framework,” potentially speeding development of new payment products. But he stressed that “success in accomplishing these goals will depend on the details of regulatory implementation,” adding bluntly: “Regulators have a lot of work to do to implement the act.” The most pointed warning came in Barr’s discussion of what the statute now counts as permissible reserve assets for payment stablecoins. The GENIUS Act’s core safety mechanism is to restrict reserves to a list of high-quality, liquid instruments. Yet the text also allows reserves formed via overnight repurchase agreements backed by “any medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a foreign government.” Barr highlighted the practical consequence with a concrete example: “For example, until quite recently, El Salvador treated Bitcoin as legal tender, and it still specifically permits Bitcoin to be used for transactions on a voluntary basis. As a result, an issuer could argue that Bitcoin repo could qualify as an eligible reserve asset for a stablecoin.” He cautioned that if Bitcoin prices “were to drop sharply in value, a stablecoin issuer could be stuck holding the Bitcoin that had declined in value, potentially compromising the one-to-one backing of the stablecoin liabilities,” concluding that “to the extent possible, regulations should be put in place to eliminate or minimize such risks.”Barr’s Bitcoin example ties directly to his broader concern: the GENIUS Act creates a mosaic of overseers—four federal agencies plus every state and territorial regulator can serve as primary supervisor of permitted stablecoin issuers. Not Only Bitcoin: More Crypto Risks In his view, that multiplicity risks creating uneven interpretations of the law’s guardrails and incentives for “charter choice” that could blunt federal prudential intent. “There might be a great deal of heterogeneity in the regulatory frameworks that apply to permitted issuers… The resulting array of charter choice options, unless carefully managed, may provide incentives for regulatory arbitrage,” he said. Beyond the foreign-authorized medium-of-exchange clause, Barr flagged other reserve-design openings that could transmit stress. He noted that the GENIUS Act allows uninsured deposits to count as permissible reserves and recalled their role as a “key risk factor during the March 2023 banking stress.” The law empowers regulators to limit concentrations in such deposits, he said, but “it will matter how these rules are written.” His critique extended to scope and structure. The statute empowers federal and state regulators to authorize a wide range of activities for stablecoin issuers—“digital asset service provider” and “incidental” businesses beyond pure issuance. Barr warned that issuers “are likely to seek to stretch these activities limitations,” even to the point of arguing they could “perform the full range of activities conducted by FTX ,” provided they make certain representations and maintain appropriate accounting. That breadth, he suggested, could leave some issuers operating with risk profiles far afield from narrow payments functions while escaping consolidated capital regimes if housed in trust-chartered entities—an echo of historical vulnerabilities. On capital, Barr argued the law’s issuer-level requirements could prove “too narrow” once firms branch into these additional lines, particularly when the act carves bank-affiliated issuers out of consolidated capital coverage. “Appropriate capital requirements are another area where coordination among federal and state regulators is key,” he said, adding that the statute’s standard for judging whether state rules are “substantially similar” to federal requirements will matter in practice. He also pressed on consumer-protection gaps. The act does not sweep in all instruments commonly marketed as “stablecoins,” allowing certain dollar-denominated tokenized products to remain outside the new regime. That omission, Barr warned, risks confusing users into believing they are protected when “there are no prudential protections of any kind.” He urged federal and state enforcers to use unfair-and-deceptive-practices authorities to police misrepresentations and noted the law lacks the fraud and unauthorized-transfer protections that apply to traditional payment rails.

Bitcoin Top Not In Yet – More Upside Ahead? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, there is a 55% probability that the Bitcoin top for the ongoing market cycle is not in yet. The analyst highlighted BTC’s recent on-chain flows to support their claim. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? In their analysis, PelinayPA noted that although BTC’s price has tumbled from more than $126,000 to around $109,000 in the second half of 2025, there has been a noticeable increase in 0-1 day BTC inflows to exchanges. A rise in 0-1 days BTC inflows to exchange typically has two implications – short-term traders are taking profits, and there is a temporary phase of repositioning of liquidity as traders transfer their holdings to exchanges, anticipating price volatility. The analyst added that BTC held for more than six months is largely inactive, indicating that long-term holders are likely not selling despite the recent market crash. This signals market confidence among long-term holders, minimizing the possibility of another major sell-off in the near term. PelinayPA remarked that such behavior typically occurs in the mid or maturing stages of a bull cycle, where any dip in price is seen as an opportunity to accumulate instead of a trend reversal. Currently, the Bitcoin market is in a natural consolidation phase within an ongoing uptrend. The analyst added: In the short term, Bitcoin could revisit the $102K region as short term traders continue to take profits. However, since this selling pressure originates mainly from newer holders, it is unlikely to disrupt the broader bullish structure. These dips may offer attractive entry opportunities. Concluding, Pelinay commented that the lack of selling activity among BTC holders in the 6-months to 10-year time-band range shows that there is a 55% probability that the bull market top has not yet formed. BTC Could Dip To $102,000 The CryptoQuant contributor noted that, although it is likely that the BTC bull market top is not in yet, it does not mean that the top cryptocurrency would not see further temporary decline. If selling persists, BTC could once again test the $102,000 support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Feels “Too Efficient” As Arbitrage Opportunities Vanish – What It Means For Price? Similarly, crypto analyst Elliot Waves Academy remarked that BTC has likely finished the bullish leg of the ongoing market cycle. The analyst added that BTC is likely to consolidate around its current levels. That said, a fellow CryptoQuant contributor noted that BTC has entered the ‘disbelief phase,’ and may take the bears by surprise with a sharp surge in price. At press time, BTC trades at $108,472, down 2% in the past 24 hours.
