53472372,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841866,1761084934,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53472372.jpeg,"Lockheed Martin, RTX, GE Aerospace, and Northrop Grumman all raised 2025 guidance after stronger Q3 profits",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lockheed-martin-rtx-hike-guidance-defense/,"Lockheed Martin and RTX raised their full-year guidance on Tuesday after both companies saw a surge in orders from governments expanding their defense budgets. Their third-quarter numbers topped expectations, and both are now planning for even more growth going into 2025. Lockheed said it’s increasing production across its divisions due to what CEO Jim Taiclet called “unprecedented demand” from both U.S. and foreign customers. The company now expects revenue between $74.25 billion and $74.75 billion, with earnings per share between $22.15 and $22.35. Lockheed reported Q3 earnings of $6.95 per share on $18.61 billion in revenue, beating estimates of $6.36 and $18.56 billion. Taiclet also confirmed investment in digital systems and physical production lines to support “top defense priorities”, including the $175 billion U.S. Golden Dome project, which begins construction in 2025 and already has $25 billion earmarked in next year’s defense budget. RTX lifts revenue target after tariff impact fades RTX followed with an upgrade of its own, pushing full-year adjusted earnings guidance from $5.80–$5.95 to a range of $6.10–$6.20, and revenue expectations from $84.75–$85.5 billion up to $86.5–$87 billion. The firm’s stock jumped 9% after Tuesday’s update. CEO Chris Calio said they’re staying focused on delivering a $251 billion backlog and scaling output across critical programs. RTX’s total revenue climbed 12% to $22.48 billion in the third quarter. In July, RTX had warned of a $500 million tariff hit and cut guidance. But now, those impacts seem to be absorbed. The company also saw growth across both its aerospace and defense arms, with Calio pointing to new investments in next-gen tech and manufacturing as reasons for the upward revision. GE, Northrop also beat earnings as defense spending climbs GE Aerospace, which supplies both commercial and defense markets, said Q3 adjusted revenue hit $11.31 billion, far above the $10.41 billion estimate. The company raised full-year revenue growth from “mid-teens” to “high-teens” and pushed free cash flow guidance from $6.5–$6.9 billion to $7.1–$7.3 billion. Deliveries of LEAP engines, used in Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A321neo jets, jumped 40% year over year. Meanwhile, defense deliveries alone surged 83%, showing just how fast military orders are ramping up. Northrop Grumman also beat profit expectations, reporting $7.67 EPS for the quarter versus a $6.46 Wall Street target. Its revenue missed estimates slightly, but total sales still rose 4%, with a 14% increase in its defense systems division. The company raised its 2025 EPS guidance by 65 cents, now forecasting $25.65 to $26.05. CEO Kathy Warden said, “We are once again increasing our 2025 EPS guidance,” and pointed to faster response efforts and better output across programs. Across all four companies (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, and GE), the same pattern held: higher orders, stronger production, and tighter guidance. The rise in U.S. defense spending plays a huge role in that. The Trump administration is requesting $849.8 billion for the 2025 defense budget, up from $842 billion in 2024, and way above the $742 billion level from 2022. The White House cited threats from Russia, Iran, and North Korea as justification for the larger outlays. Every one of these contractors is cashing in. All four beat Q3 earnings. All four raised their guidance. And all four are building to meet the demands of a world where defense orders just keep coming. Defense spending has become one of the few consistent growth drivers this year, even with tariffs, inflation, and global instability. And right now, that growth is all over the numbers. With new missiles, aircraft, and war-tech rolling off the line, the defense sector has become the safest bet in a chaotic global market. Defense now makes up a larger share of these companies’ revenue than at any point in the last five years. None of them is slowing down. GE is delivering more. RTX is expanding backlog output. Lockheed is scaling capacity. Northrop is hiking EPS targets. And behind it all, Washington is writing the checks. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

53472263,https://cryptonews.com/?p=441463,1761085800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53472263.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-ethereum-cardano-ripple-by-the-end-of-2025/,"China’s leading ChatGPT rival, DeepSeek AI, has released an ambitious outlook predicting that XRP, Cardano, and Ethereum could generate rapid, explosive gains for investors as the New Year approaches. Traditionally, “Uptober” has signaled the onset of extended bullish momentum in the crypto sector. This year initially followed that pattern, with Bitcoin climbing to a record high on Monday, October 6, fueling widespread optimism across the digital asset space. However, that enthusiasm faded fast when Donald Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports sparked one of the sharpest single-day sell-offs in crypto history. A brief rebound earlier this week hinted at recovery potential, but it was quickly erased as traders turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting, hoping for signs of looser monetary policy. Seasoned investors, however, remain calm, many viewing the correction as a natural market reset. Historically, deep pullbacks have often paved the way for powerful rallies, helping eliminate overleveraged positions and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. Ethereum (ETH): DeepSeek Targets $10,000 for the Leading Smart Contract Platform As the backbone of decentralized applications and DeFi protocols, Ethereum ($ETH) commands a $543 billion market cap with over $85.16 billion in total value locked across its ecosystem. Source: DeepSeek AI DeepSeek AI predicts ETH could surge to $15,000 by year’s end, representing a 280% increase from its current $3,949 price point. Further tailwinds could emerge if the Trump administration moves forward with comprehensive crypto-friendly reforms, potentially injecting the regulatory confidence needed for wider institutional participation. ETH is currently battling resistance near the upper $4,000 range; a successful breakout could clear a path toward $6,000 or higher. Even if prices stay below $4,000, Ethereum maintains solid support between $3,500 and $3,700. A strong October rally could propel ETH as high as $6,500 and potentially establish a new all-time high, with $12,000 remaining the year-end target in a full-fledged bull scenario. Cardano ($ADA): DeepSeek Foresees Up to 1,200% Growth This Quarter Within the DeFi landscape, Cardano ($ADA) continues to position itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum, attracting a vibrant developer base and fueling innovative blockchain applications. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano differentiates itself through a peer-reviewed, research-oriented approach emphasizing scalability, sustainability, and formal verification. Currently boasting a $24.8 billion market cap, Cardano remains a major smart contract platform, though it would require a fourfold expansion to rival Solana and seriously contest Ethereum’s dominance. DeepSeek’s optimistic outlook envisions ADA climbing to $7–$10 by late 2025, up to a 1,370% surge from its present level near $0.6801. Technically, ADA has already broken out of a bullish flag pattern established over the summer, facing initial resistance around $1.10. Should October’s rally gain traction, ADA could approach $2 in the short term, while sustained bullish momentum might drive it well beyond its 2021 all-time high of $3.09. XRP ($XRP): DeepSeek Predicts an Upswing Toward $10 DeepSeek’s AI-driven projections indicate that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could be primed for a significant breakout, with potential gains lifting the price between $5 and $10 before year’s end, roughly quadrupling its current value of around $2.51. Ripple scored a landmark victory earlier this year after a five-year legal standoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reigniting investor confidence and driving XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its highest level since 2017. Over the past twelve months, XRP has rallied 359%, outperforming market giants Bitcoin (+67%) and Ethereum (+46%). Chart analysis highlights three bullish flag formations emerging in 2025, two of which appeared during the summer, patterns that typically precede strong upward moves. As October’s seasonality trends align with potential ETF approvals, improving regulatory clarity, and new Ripple partnerships, DeepSeek suggests XRP could make a run toward the coveted $10 mark. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Meme Coin Channeling Dogecoin’s Spirit and Degen Energy A newcomer to the meme coin space, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a self-described “energetic cousin” of Dogecoin, has entered presale mode, already securing over $3.7 million from investors eager for the next viral crypto sensation. Built as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, MAXI aims to deliver faster, greener, and lower-cost transactions than Dogecoin. The project emphasizes community engagement, viral marketing, and gamified initiatives such as trading contests and brand partnerships to foster adoption. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” dedicated to marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem growth. Staking is already live, offering up to 82% APY, though yields vary with participation. The ongoing presale prices MAXI at $0.000264, with incremental price increases as funding milestones are achieved. Tokens are available via MetaMask and Best Wallet .

Despite recent declines, many analysts suggest these pullbacks are setting the stage for the biggest bull run the sector has ever seen At the start of October, Bitcoin surged to a record-breaking $126,080, igniting a rapid flow of capital into leading altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which had already been on record-setting runs throughout the past year. However, that wave of optimism quickly faded. Markets slumped following Donald Trump’s declaration of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, sparking a sharp sell-off across digital assets. Investor sentiment remains cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Still, many experts see the downturn as a constructive correction, one that’s purging excessive leverage and weak hands before the next leg higher. Below are several altcoins to watch as they stand to gain the most should the market enter its final major bull cycle before widespread adoption. Ripple (XRP): Positioned to Dominate 2025’s Global Payments Market Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) token powers a fast and cost-efficient international payment network that continues to challenge legacy transfer systems such as SWIFT. Backed by partnerships with top-tier U.S. financial firms and support from the UN Capital Development Fund, XRP has climbed to third place by market capitalization, exceeding $149.4 billion. The launch of Ripple’s new dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, further underscores the company’s push into the booming stablecoin segment. Over the past twelve months, XRP has soared 359%, reaching a seven-year peak of $3.65 in mid-July, far outperforming Bitcoin’s 67% gain during the same period. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 42 and a price slowly converging with its 30-day moving average, XRP could be poised for renewed upside momentum. Chart patterns reveal two bullish flag formations dating back to the summer, suggesting more growth potential if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Should the U.S. Congress pass comprehensive crypto regulations, some analysts believe XRP could rally toward the $5–$10 range. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The Meme Coin Evolving Into a Utility Powerhouse Since its debut in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the world’s second-largest meme coin, boasting a market capitalization of over $6 billion. Within the past 24 hours, SHIB has gained 1.4%, outperforming much of the meme coin sector, mirroring its predecessor Dogecoin’s resilience. Thanks to its size and expanding ecosystem, SHIB now trades more like a blue-chip crypto asset than a speculative token, currently priced around $0.00001043. Technically, SHIB has established two bullish patterns over the past year: a descending wedge from November to March and a flag pattern since May. A breakout above $0.000022 could open the door to $0.00003 by late October, with potential targets between $0.00006 and $0.00009 if a major rally develops. Unlike many meme tokens, SHIB’s utility continues to grow. Its ecosystem includes Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 network built to reduce gas fees and boost transaction speeds, along with upcoming privacy tools aimed at expanding real-world use. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Still Aiming for $1 Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the pioneer of the meme coin movement, launched in 2013, maintains its status as the largest in the category with a $30 billion market cap and a loyal “Doge Army” community. After gaining celebrity attention in 2021 from figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, DOGE saw renewed excitement earlier this year amid speculation about a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF. The token climbed above $0.25 in May but has since retraced to roughly $0.2038, although it rose 2% overnight amid a simultaneous 2% rise in crypto’s now-$3.86 trillion market cap. Performing even better, the meme coin sector as a whole rose 4% overnight to $64.8 billion, with DOGE accounting for about half of that, making it one of the market’s more stable assets. Its price now tends to move in tandem with blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. DOGE’s real-world adoption continues to grow: Tesla now accepts it for merchandise purchases, while PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE payments. Should positive regulatory shifts reignite investor optimism, DOGE could retest its 2021 high of $0.7316, or even surpass it, before the year’s end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): 2025’s Most Ambitious Meme Coin Presale Fusing Innovation with Bitcoin Utility Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has emerged as one of 2025’s most buzzworthy presale tokens, combining the humor and hype of meme culture with the technological backbone of Bitcoin. It enhances the Bitcoin ecosystem by introducing a proprietary Layer-2 solution that enables ultra-fast, low-cost transactions. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER integrates features such as decentralized governance through a DAO, smart contract functionality, and a native meme coin bridge for seamless Bitcoin transfers. The presale has already raised more than $24.4 million, and analysts suggest early investors could see 10x or greater returns post-launch. A recent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. HYPER tokens power all network activities, including staking, governance, and fees, and early adopters can earn up to 48% APY through staking rewards. Bitcoin is going HYPER. This may be the next major breakout project. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

On that note, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $108,000 in the past week, while Ripple’s XRP and Cardano (ADA) dropped over 10%. Amid the growing risk of uncertainties, one project stands out as the only project in the market offering bullish momentum. Digitap ($TAP) , an omni-bank ecosystem, is built to blend crypto and fiat transactions, digital wallets, and card payments in one platform. Digitap’s infrastructure offers instant utility and its live app has increased demand for the $TAP presale. This explains why the presale is selling out quickly. Hence, $TAP is the best cryptocurrency to buy now. Bitcoin Falters As $TAP Emerges as Safe Haven BlackRock listed its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange on October 20, 2025, focusing on the UK retail investors. The move marks the first time UK-based investors can enjoy direct BTC exposure via traditional brokerage accounts. On the other hand, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is planning to let local banks trade and keep cryptos. Based on its official report , the planned reform would allow banks to trade cryptocurrencies like they trade stocks or government bonds. Despite these developments, Bitcoin dropped below $107,000 in the past week amid growing global risk aversion and leveraged liquidations. The biggest crypto has struggled to rise above $112,000 since the October 10, widespread market dip. While BTC struggles, investors have shifted focus to $TAP, whose presale has delivered gains amid current market volatility. XRP Slides as Investors Rotate to $TAP XRP suffered significant losses in mid-October during the broader market bloodbath. The drop reflected weakening leverage, although Ripple is constantly making developments around tokenization and cross-border payments. While fundamentals remain strong , the general risk-off environment is hitting XRP hard. The token is affected by macro-driven conditions that have increased uncertainties in the global markets. These scenarios have affected the token’s price negatively, pinning it down by 6% in the last week. With XRP struggling below $2.50 , analysts say the token’s upside momentum seems limited in the near term. The bearish momentum appears to be pushing investors to seek more lucrative alternatives. The only token that has maintained its bullish momentum consistently in October 2025 is Digitap’s coin. $TAP has attracted investors in its presale due to its instant utility and it keeps hitting multiple milestones quickly in an early stage. Therefore, the presale token is the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Cardano’s Growth Stalls as $TAP Gains Momentum Cardano’s recent performance is a representation of the sentiment dominating the crypto space. ADA lacks breakout momentum and its reaction is underwhelming to bullish roadmap announcements. For instance, Cardano’s community treasury exceeded 1.6 billion ADA and reached a value of nearly $1 billion. Remarkably, this treasury balance highlighted financial flexibility. Therefore, the network seems prepared to fund development without involving outside investors. Despite the many developments, ADA failed to surge due to a market wide drop. The token dropped over 5% in the past week and is still in the red zone. Interestingly, its value is greatly influenced by long-term ecosystem growth, instead of immediate utility. While ADA’s upside momentum is threatened by the increased volatility, smart capital is flowing into $TAP. Its underlying Digitap network is continuously developing an omni-banking platform that incorporates crypto into everyday transactions. Therefore, $TAP is the best crypto coin to buy now. Digitap Bridges Fiat and Crypto as $TAP Demand Soars The crypto giants are struggling as macro-economic conditions take center stage. While BTC, XRP, and ADA slide, $TAP is quietly gaining ground. Built as an omni-bank ecosystem, Digitap has integrated fiat-banking rails, crypto wallets, cross-chain settlement, and card spending into one app. This new ICO crypto offers instant utility that the struggling giants cannot offer. Its underlying platform is designed to enable users to transact globally using cards/smart rails that connect its ecosystem to everyday spending. Digitap attracts users via its cross-chain wallet bridging, card functions, instant FX, and tap-to-pay features. Since $TAP’s infrastructure connects currencies and is not a standalone project, its utility is tangible and instant. Thus, investors are buying into its presale aggressively to shield their portfolios from the increased market volatility. $TAP’s demand also grew after its app went live in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The launch of this app enabled the coin to transition from a vision into a practical market product. Security and Utility Drive Massive Demand for $TAP Investors prefer projects that guarantee the safety of their money. Notably, $TAP is one such coin. Its platform was audited and approved by Solidproof and Coinsult, guaranteeing that investors can use it to transact safely. $TAP’s presale seems to have convinced investors in its early stage. It has recorded extensive success unseen in most of the other presale tokens that came before it. The coin’s demand has grown massively because it offers real utility. Since everything is hosted on one app, Digitap makes crypto investments easy and smooth for all users. Additionally, its exclusive tokenomics strategy rewards adoption in the long term with staking protocols that reduce the token’s circulating supply. Digitap has built-in burn mechanics extensively linked to its usage. Its capped supply of 2 billion tokens means deflationary pressure could increase with demand. Its merchant integrations, consistent building, and app launch explain why capital is flowing into it. USE THE CODE “LIVEAPP30” FOR 30% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES $TAP Presale Momentum Builds as Investors Seek Stability $TAP’s presale is selling out quickly with its increased demand supported by the project’s utility. The token has achieved multiple milestones as investors buy it to shield their portfolios against the market wide volatility. In that context, experts say $TAP could deliver massive gains in the coming years as its supply decreases and demand grows. $TAP is in Stage 3 of its presale, selling at $0.0194. The current investors will record a 38.14% profit when the coin moves to the next stage of the presale at $0.0268. Over 65 million $TAP tokens have been acquired, and has raised at least $870K. Those investors who acquired $TAP in Stage 1 have recorded a 55.2% gain after the coin’s value surged from $0.0125 to its current price. The constant growth makes Digitap ($TAP) rank among the best DeFi coins to buy now. $TAP Defies Market Dip With Strong Presale Momentum With Bitcoin dropping below $108K and altcoins like XRP and ADA down over 5% in the past week, the crypto sector is struggling with volatility. For most investors, they wonder where the next sustainable growth will come from. Digitap comes in ready with a compelling solution. It is an omni-bank platform built for utility in global finance rising above the purely speculative token swings. As the market repositions toward usable infrastructure, the $TAP presale seems to offer the only constant bullish trend in the market. Adoption metrics can now be measured on the project’s live app and scarcity mechanics seem to boost its growth potential. Hence, $TAP could deliver huge gains in the coming bull cycle.

53474663,611019,1761087613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53474663.jpeg,"Whales Accumulate Millions in ADA as Bearish Momentum Persists, Can Cardano Repeat Its 60% Rally?",https://bitcoinist.com/whales-ada-as-bearish-persists-cardano-repeat-rally/,"Cardano (ADA) slipped about 4% to $0.64, trading below the 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages ($0.735, $0.804, $0.741), a setup that keeps short- and medium-term pressure tilted lower. Even so, on-chain flow shows whales accumulating roughly 200 million ADA as developers push fresh upgrades. However, fundamentals have brightened with Cardano’s Hydra scaling and Midnight privacy tech advanced, daily transaction value topped $10B, and ADA joined the S&P Digital Markets 50, all factors often cited by institutions building longer-term positions. Derivatives data echo the mixed tone as open interest has climbed above $600M, reflecting active speculation despite price compression, while steady exchange outflows point to broader staking/long-term holding behavior. Can a MACD ‘Golden Cross’ Repeat June’s 60% Rally? Momentum remains conflicted. The daily MACD is nearing a bullish crossover, a pattern that preceded June’s 60% ADA surge from the $0.53 zone to $0.93 within weeks. Oversold oscillators (daily RSI 33, negative CCI, soft Awesome Oscillator) suggest sellers may be tiring into support, yet the ADX still favors the prevailing trend, arguing for patience until confirmation. Technically, bulls must reclaim $0.664 and the 20-DMA to neutralize near-term downside. Above, $0.74–$0.77 (former support now resistance) and $0.80 align with a descending trendline from the Aug. 14 swing, forming a decisive ceiling. A clean break and hold over $0.71–$0.74 (0.618 Fib confluence/EMA cluster) would strengthen the case for a trend reversal, and reopen talk of a move toward over $1.00 if momentum expands. ADA Price Levels and Outlook: Support First, Then Confirmation Near term, analysts see range-bound risk with downside skew. Models project $0.542–$0.590 over the next week if sellers press, with the Ichimoku Kijun support near $0.583 acting as a pivot. Immediate levels to watch for Cardano (ADA) remain well-defined as the token trades within a tightening range. On the downside, support is seen at $0.639, followed by $0.602 and $0.583, with a breakdown below $0.60 likely to expose the $0.542 zone. On the upside, resistance sits near $0.664, aligning with the 20-day moving average (20-DMA), while stronger hurdles appear around $0.74–$0.77 and the $0.80 trendline, which marks a key test for sustained bullish momentum.

Within hours, FLOKI’s price jumped nearly 30% and 24-hour volume exploded 780–817% to roughly $656–$662 million, lifting the token to an intraday high near $0.000088, its best level in almost two weeks. Related Reading: All It Took Was A Tweet: FLOKI Jumps 27% After Musk Mentions It Mentions across X, Reddit, and Telegram climbed 65%, while crypto’s Fear & Greed Index nudged from Fear (37) to Neutral (52), signaling fresh retail participation. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) logged modest gains, but FLOKI led meme coins by a wide margin. Breakout Case vs. Bull-Trap Warnings Technicians say FLOKI is retesting a pivotal demand band around $0.00008. A daily close and hold above $0.000075 keeps the breakout thesis alive toward $0.00009, with $0.00010 on the table if momentum and volumes persist. Open Interest surged 162% to about $37.5 million, and long-side liquidations wiped out $275K in shorts during the squeeze. On Binance, negative funding suggests crowded shorts paying to stay positioned, fuel for further upside if price grinds higher. Still, some analysts flag bull-trap risk. The RSI tipped into overbought (>70) during the spike, a zone that historically invites cooling moves; a quick reset back into the 50–70 band would be a healthier springboard. Liquidity “heatmaps” show dense clusters both above and below spot, implying two-way volatility as the price hunts orders before choosing direction. If FLOKI fails to reclaim/hold $0.00009, technicians eye pullbacks toward $0.000072, with a deeper bear case pointing to $0.00004 if risk aversion returns. FLOKI's price records some losses after a small push upwards on the daily chart. Source: FLOKIUSD on Tradingview Key FLOKI Levels as the Market Slips 3% Currently, FLOKI hovers around $0.0000737, down 12% on the day, mirroring the broader market downturnwith Bitcoin near $107,000 and Ethereum around $3,800. In the near term, traders are watching key technical levels that could dictate FLOKI’s next move. Immediate support sits between $0.000072 and $0.000070, with a deeper downside risk toward $0.00004 if momentum fails to hold. Related Reading: CryptoQuant’s Moreno Eyes Bitcoin At $195,000 If This Happens The $0.000080 level acts as the crucial pivot point, a decisive close above it would strengthen the bullish trend and open the path toward higher targets. On the upside, resistance lies at $0.00009, followed by $0.00011 if buying volume expands. With liquidity thin and sentiment still fragile after recent liquidations, celebrity-driven spikes can overextend quickly. However, if flows remain constructive, negative funding persists, open interest stays elevated, and spot demand confirms, FLOKI’s rally could reignite, potentially surpassing the psychological $0.00009 level.

In his latest market update, he highlighted a key demand zone visible on the monthly chart, which he believes could serve as the foundation for XRP’s next upward movement. Currently, XRP remains under pressure after its early October price drop. Following a brief recovery on October 10, the token has been unable to reclaim the $2.5 resistance level, let alone the psychological $3 threshold. At the time of writing, XRP has declined by nearly 15.49% for the month . XRP Approaching a Crucial Demand Zone Despite its recent weakness, Ether Nasyonal maintains a bullish outlook. He pointed out that XRP’s latest correction has brought the asset back to a significant demand area between $1.6 and $2, a range that historically played an important role during previous market cycles. $XRP is cooking something up. Chart has been inverted, but the story remains the same. XRP is still gathering strength within the demand zone emerging from the 2018 major resistance. While the direction may seem confusing, the structure is clear. The next major move… https://t.co/HT9Sqhembx pic.twitter.com/s5grcnCMFZ — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 19, 2025 According to Nasyonal, this zone previously served as a resistance area during the 2020–2021 bull market, capping XRP’s growth amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. During that period, XRP reached a local peak of $1.96 in April 2021 before losing momentum below its 2018 record high. The analyst noted that in late 2024, following renewed market optimism, XRP once again tested and broke through this same region, climbing to a new high of $3.4 in January 2025. Since that rally, XRP has repeatedly returned to retest the $1.6–$2 zone each time it encounters resistance near the $3 level. Nasyonal interprets this recurring pattern as evidence that the range has transitioned into a strong support level for the asset. He believes the latest price decline represents another test of this zone and that XRP may soon attempt another upward move if the area continues to hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Sentiment and Price Outlook Ether Nasyonal explained that the current market structure suggests consolidation before another potential breakout. He emphasized that the $3 mark remains a key price level that must be reclaimed for bullish momentum to resume. Once that threshold is cleared, the next major resistance lies around $3.4, the January 2025 peak that coincides with XRP’s 2018 all-time high. A successful break above $3.4, he added, could set the stage for XRP to challenge the July 2025 high of $3.66 and potentially aim for new record levels. In a separate analysis, Nasyonal drew parallels between the current price behavior and XRP’s 2017–2018 cycle. During that earlier period, XRP encountered persistent resistance around $0.06, repeatedly falling to a lower support zone near $0.028 before eventually rallying to $3.31 in early 2018. He suggested that a similar pattern might now be unfolding on a larger scale Recent data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment supports Nasyonal’s view of an impending shift. The platform reported that XRP has seen a surge in negative sentiment among investors in recent weeks. Historically, Santiment noted, similar spikes in bearish sentiment have often preceded price recoveries. Although Nasyonal did not provide a specific price target for XRP’s next move, he concluded that the asset’s current positioning above a long-term demand zone signals potential for renewed upward momentum if market conditions improve.

As crypto leaders and Senate Democrats prepare to debate new digital asset rules in D.C., the market itself is writing its own story of resilience. Litecoin and Toncoin have slipped 2.16% and 3.70%, but traders aren’t running for the exits. Instead, many are scanning the top new crypto presales today , looking for the next big opportunity before regulation reshapes the field. The broader picture feels more alive than ever. The Uptober rally may have cooled, but whales are quietly accumulating again, and the Fed’s upcoming rate decision on October 29 could unlock fresh liquidity. Amid this cocktail of macro shifts, policy debates, and pre-Halloween jitters, one project: BullZilla ($BZIL), has managed to turn the noise into momentum. With its structured presale, transparent growth engine, and verified 2,843% ROI potential, it’s quickly becoming the headline name investors whisper about when discussing “next millionaire-maker.” BullZilla ($BZIL): The 1000x Meme Coin Turning Heads Among the Top New Crypto Presales Today BullZilla’s presale is currently in Stage 7 (Bag Signal Activated), and the momentum is hard to ignore. Priced at $0.00017907, the project has raised over $940,000 from 3,100+ holders, distributing 31 billion tokens to date. As one of the top new crypto presales today , BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine ensures a predictable and transparent growth model across its 24 presale stages. With a listing target of $0.00527141, the verified ROI from Stage 7C stands at 2,843%, offering measurable upside for current participants. Early buyers from Stage 1 have already achieved returns exceeding 3,000%, proving the project’s consistent trajectory. The blend of staking rewards, deflationary burns, and stage-based price surges has positioned BullZilla as one of the most credible and rewarding presales of 2025. Here’s What Happens If You Invest $1,000 in BullZilla Right Now At the current price of $0.00017907, a $1,000 investment secures approximately 5.58 million $BZIL tokens. When the listing price hits $0.00527141, that same investment could grow to around $29,400, marking a 2,843% gain. Each stage adds a 3.71% increase, meaning investors who act early capture greater value at every progression. With staking and referral rewards layered on top, BullZilla’s presale offers real, compounding potential even before launch. How to Join BullZilla — The Top New Crypto Presales Today Joining the BullZilla presale is fast and decentralized.

Participants also gain access to referral bonuses and staking tiers, boosting passive rewards. With each stage increasing by 4.37%, early participants lock in the best entry opportunities before public trading begins. Litecoin (LTC): Macro Resilience Amid Market Fluctuations Litecoin is trading at $93.05, down 2.16% in the past 24 hours, with daily trading volume exceeding $580 million. Despite the short-term dip, the asset continues to demonstrate resilience and strong fundamentals. Its wide adoption for payments and increasing integration into global merchant platforms keep Litecoin relevant. The network’s rising hashrate and reduced transaction fees reinforce investor confidence, maintaining its reputation as one of the most reliable and battle-tested altcoins in circulation. Analysts see the current pullback as a healthy correction following early Uptober gains. Litecoin’s stability, combined with its steady user growth and established infrastructure, makes it a favorite among long-term holders. The renewed institutional interest after Bitcoin ETF approvals has also contributed to its sustained relevance. With improved liquidity and robust on-chain activity, Litecoin is well-positioned to benefit once retail momentum returns, potentially outperforming other mid-cap assets in the next phase of the market cycle. Toncoin (TON): Ecosystem Growth Driving Long-Term Utility Toncoin currently trades at $2.20, down 3.70%, with a $146.9 million 24-hour trading volume. The short-term decline mirrors a general market cooldown, yet Toncoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Backed by deep integration within Telegram, the TON ecosystem has rapidly become one of the most active Layer-1 blockchains. Its ultra-fast transaction speeds, low gas fees, and commitment to developer incentives continue to attract new projects, further expanding its influence in decentralized applications and cross-chain interoperability. The TON network’s growing validator base and consistent performance underline its long-term potential. Analysts view its blend of community-driven governance and practical real-world utility as a major advantage over many competitors. Toncoin’s cross-border payments capability and expanding DeFi presence are steadily building institutional trust. As new partnerships form and network activity grows, Toncoin is expected to remain a strong contender for investors seeking utility-based exposure to the evolving Web3 economy. Conclusion October hasn’t surprised anyone yet. Between regulatory debates in Washington, the Fed’s looming rate cut, and Halloween’s reminder that fear can move markets faster than facts, crypto investors are navigating both chaos and opportunity. Litecoin and Toncoin continue to prove their staying power, backed by real ecosystems and long-term fundamentals. But while the big names battle volatility, BullZilla ($BZIL) is quietly scripting its own success story. With a verified 2,843% ROI potential, transparent presale mechanics, and growing investor momentum, it’s carving a place among the top new crypto presales today . As Uptober gives way to a decisive Q4, those looking past short-term noise may find that BullZilla represents not just a meme but a moment worth catching.

By 2028, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $28.45. In 2031, $TRUMP will range between $34.14 to $46.22. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Following President Trump’s “newfound” crypto inclination, the $TRUMP meme coin was birthed. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The coin has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, with an initial 200 million tokens unlocked at launch. Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors, such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official Trump price predictions for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $5.87 Market Capitalization $1.185B Trading Volume $374.95M Circulating Supply 199.99M TRUMP All-time High $75.35 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $1.21 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $6.13 24-h Low $5.84 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 11.24% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 35.79 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $7.75 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 34 (Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $9.88 Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown TRUMP consolidates near $5.86 after heavy selling, with weakening bearish momentum. The coin’s resistance stands at $6.70, while $5.00 is the critical support level. Short-term rangebound action is likely between $5.60 and $6.20 until volume returns. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for October 21, TRUMP coin is trading around $5.86, down 1.89% for the day, holding slightly above the lower Bollinger Band at $4.89 while facing overhead resistance near the mid-band at $6.68. The Bollinger Bands remain wide, signaling persistent volatility, but the narrowing of recent candles hints that the sharp sell-off may be stabilizing. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative, though histogram bars have begun to flatten, suggesting that bearish momentum is slowing. Despite this, the price continues to hover under key resistance, and any failure to close above $6.00 could see sellers regain control toward the $5.00 and $4.89 support levels. Conversely, a bullish candle breaking and closing above $6.70 could open the path toward $7.20–$7.50. Volume activity has been modest, showing a lack of strong conviction from either side. Until a breakout forms, the coin is likely to oscillate within this tight range. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart reveals that TRUMP has faced repeated rejections around the $6.05 zone, forming a series of wicks that reflect indecision and selling pressure. The Alligator lines are converging tightly, showing a lack of directional strength, consistent with a sideways market. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 48.96 remains neutral, while the OBV trending downward at -273M reflects muted accumulation. This confirms that buying strength has not yet returned in volume, and price could retest $5.80–$5.60 before any rebound attempt. If bulls successfully defend $5.80, it may create a minor bounce back toward $6.00–$6.10; however, failure here risks a slide back to $5.00. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $6.81 SELL SMA 5 $6.42 SELL SMA 10 $6.37 SELL SMA 21 $7.00 SELL SMA 50 $7.75 SELL SMA 100 $8.58 SELL SMA 200 $9.88 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $6.99 SELL EMA 5 $7.39 SELL EMA 10 $7.87 SELL EMA 21 $8.30 SELL EMA 50 $8.85 SELL EMA 100 $9.58 SELL EMA 200 $10.75 SELL What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis TRUMP’s current structure shows stabilization after its decline but lacks signs of a decisive bullish reversal. Expect sideways movement between $5.60 and $6.30 in the short term, with a possible upside recovery only if volume supports a breakout above $6.70. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $5–8 consolidation over the past month as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to hit $1,000, its market cap would need to rise over 100× into the hundreds of billions, or even trillions if locked supply is released. With dilution risks, weak fundamentals, regulation, and competition, the chance of this happening in the next few years is very low.” Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges. Recent news/opinion on $TRUMP As reported by Cryptopolitan, Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) confirmed during the Korea Blockchain Week 2025 event that the company will soon launch a debit card with Apple Pay integration. The card will be linked to its USD1 stablecoin and integrated with an application focused on retail use cases to tap into consumer payments.

Official TRUMP historic price sentiment Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Official Trump coin was launched on January 17, 2025, just a few days before the US presidential inauguration. Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April end, but has since maintained an average price of about $10.5. Official Trump coin traded between $8.07 and $10.13 in August.

Data now suggests massive whale movements toward Binance confirm profit-taking and panic-selling patterns. XRP Holders Unload Their Bags Since the start of October, XRP whales have shown a notable change in behavior amidst growing selling pressure. Data from the Whale to Exchange Flow chart for Binance, shared by CryptoQuant, found a sharp rise in whale deposits beginning October 1st, which maintained steady momentum until October 17th. The inflow reached its highest level on October 11th, with Whale to Exchange Transactions surging to 43,000. This is a clear indication of significant XRP transfers to centralized exchanges. Such large-scale movements typically mean that whales are preparing to liquidate holdings, realize profits, or mitigate risk in the backdrop of market uncertainty. This on-chain activity is closely in line with XRP’s price performance during the same period. As the whale deposits accelerated, XRP’s price experienced a steep decline as it dropped from above 3 to around 2.3. The correlation between increased exchange inflows and the falling price strongly supports the view that increased whale activity on Binance contributed to the mounting selling pressure throughout the first half of October. Whales were not the only cohort driving XRP’s sell pressure in October. Data revealed that smaller investors also played a crucial role in the market downturn. The month recorded a steady uptick in XRP transfers to Binance, especially in the ~1,000 XRP transaction group. Additionally, there were occasional inflows from larger 100K and 1M XRP tranches. These inflows reached their highest levels since last June and coincided with XRP’s price decline from near $3.0 to the $2.3-$2.6 range by mid-month. The surge in small tranche deposits points to increased activity from retail investors or, potentially, the splitting of larger holdings into smaller batches before selling. Such a pattern reflects a broader distribution phase, where selling pressure originates from a wide base of participants. Retail Pessimism Attention has now turned to how smaller traders are responding to the crypto asset’s turbulent price swings. According to Santiment, XRP is currently seeing widespread retail pessimism. On-chain data revealed that a large portion of the crowd has been selling at a loss, accompanied by a noticeable uptick in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across social channels. Historically, such conditions have often preceded bullish reversals, as prices tend to move contrary to retail sentiment. When traders capitulate or express excessive fear, it often means that market bottoms are near and that stronger hands are accumulating.

Währenddessen legten Bitcoin und Ethereum leicht zu, weil Anleger wieder mutiger werden. Experten sehen darin eine Reaktion auf positive Wirtschaftsdaten und nachlassende Spannungen zwischen den USA und China. Gold fällt, Krypto steigt – und die Finanzwelt schaut überrascht zu. Nach einem Rekordhoch sackt der Goldpreis plötzlich ab, während Bitcoin und Ethereum wieder gefragt sind. Warum wechseln Anleger so schnell von Sicherheit zu Risiko? Der Markt zeigt, dass sich die Stimmung rasant drehen kann. Gold verliert nach Rekordhoch deutlich an Wert Noch am Montag hatte der Goldpreis ein neues Rekordhoch erreicht – über 4.380 US-Dollar pro Unze. Doch schon am Dienstag fiel er plötzlich um rund 5,5 Prozent auf 4.118 Dollar. Das war der größte Tagesverlust seit dem Jahr 2013. Eine Unze ist übrigens etwa 31,1 Gramm. Der starke Preisrückgang zeigt, wie schnell Anleger ihre Stimmung ändern können. 1 Kg of Gold = 1 BTC. Both assets are now valued at approximately $123,000. It took human civilization 5,000 years to reach that price for gold. Bitcoin did it in 16 years. pic.twitter.com/Z10Az5fuUh — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) October 7, 2025 Marktbeobachter sprechen von einer „technischen Korrektur“. Das bedeutet, dass viele Investoren nach dem starken Anstieg Gewinne mitgenommen haben. Jake Ostrovskis, ein Analyst bei der Handelsfirma Wintermute, sagt: „Viele hatten auf weiter steigende Preise gesetzt – nun werden diese Wetten aufgelöst.“ Er betont aber, dass das noch kein langfristiger Trend sei. Bitcoin und Ethereum nutzen die Gelegenheit Während Gold schwächelte, stiegen die großen Kryptowährungen leicht an. Bitcoin lag am Dienstag bei etwa 112.000 US-Dollar – ein Prozent mehr als am Vortag. Ethereum, die Nummer zwei unter den digitalen Währungen, stieg auf rund 4.000 Dollar. Auch wenn die Gewinne klein waren, zeigten sie, dass Investoren wieder etwas risikofreudiger werden. Kryptowährungen gelten als riskant, weil ihre Preise stark schwanken können. Doch wenn sichere Anlagen wie Gold fallen, suchen viele Anleger nach Alternativen mit höherem Gewinnpotenzial. Bitcoin profitiert dann oft, weil viele ihn inzwischen als „digitales Gold“ sehen – also als Wertspeicher, der unabhängig von klassischen Märkten funktioniert. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Gute Wirtschaftsdaten sorgen für Optimismus Auch an der Wall Street liefen die Geschäfte gut. Mehrere große US-Unternehmen, darunter General Motors, meldeten starke Quartalsergebnisse. Analyst Carlos Guzman von der Firma GSR erklärt: „Die Gewinne zeigen, dass die Wirtschaft robuster ist als gedacht.“ Wenn die Wirtschaft stabil bleibt, sind die Sorgen vor einer Rezession kleiner – und Anleger trauen sich wieder mehr. Guzman spricht von einem „guten Start in die Berichtssaison“. Damit ist die Zeit gemeint, in der börsennotierte Unternehmen ihre Zahlen veröffentlichen. Gute Ergebnisse machen Investoren optimistisch – und das hebt oft auch die Stimmung an den Kryptomärkten. Was die Inflation mit all dem zu tun hat Am Freitag sollen neue Inflationszahlen aus den USA veröffentlicht werden. Die Inflation misst, wie stark die Preise im Durchschnitt steigen. Experten erwarten eine Rate von etwa 3,1 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahr. Das ist wichtig, weil sie Einfluss auf die Zinsen der US-Notenbank (der „Federal Reserve“) hat. Wenn die Inflation nicht zu hoch ist, könnte die Fed bald die Zinsen senken. Das würde Kredite günstiger machen – und riskantere Anlagen wie Aktien oder Kryptowährungen attraktiver. Doch wenn die Preise stärker steigen als erwartet, dürfte die Zentralbank vorsichtiger bleiben. Das könnte die aktuelle Risikofreude schnell wieder dämpfen. Gold bleibt wichtig – aber Anleger suchen Alternativen Trotz des Preissturzes bleibt Gold für viele ein Symbol der Sicherheit. Es verliert nie komplett an Wert und wird seit Jahrhunderten als Schutz vor Krisen genutzt. Trotzdem sagen einige Experten, dass der Markt für Gold zuletzt „überfüllt“ war – also zu viele Anleger gleichzeitig auf steigende Preise gesetzt hatten. Holy Shit…If just 4% of Gold rotates into Bitcoin… the price will double pic.twitter.com/LKJ67A29a0 — Nathan Sloan (@_NathansTweet) October 21, 2025 David Hernandez von 21Shares erklärt, dass es sich bei dem aktuellen Rückgang eher um eine „Rotation“ handelt. Das bedeutet, Kapital wandert kurzfristig aus sicheren Anlagen wie Gold in riskantere Bereiche wie Kryptowährungen. Binance-Mitgründer Changpeng Zhao sieht das ähnlich: „Gold wird nicht verschwinden – aber Bitcoin hat auf lange Sicht mehr Potenzial.“ Zwischen Risiko und Sicherheit – ein neuer Balanceakt Die Märkte stehen an einem interessanten Punkt: Einerseits locken Chancen durch sinkende Zinsen und eine starke Wirtschaft. Andererseits bleibt das Risiko groß, dass geopolitische Spannungen oder neue Daten die Stimmung wieder kippen lassen. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Für Anleger bedeutet das: Vorsicht und Flexibilität sind gefragt. Gold hat an Glanz verloren, aber es bleibt eine stabile Grundlage. Bitcoin und andere Kryptowährungen gewinnen zwar an Bedeutung, doch sie bleiben schwankungsanfällig. Die Kunst liegt darin, das Gleichgewicht zwischen Sicherheit und Rendite zu finden – wie auf einer Waage zwischen Gold und digitalem Geld.

The country’s financial watchdog is close to making its decision on whether to permit members of banking groups to launch crypto trading services. This move could reshape Japan’s tightly controlled digital asset market. This comes in when the crypto market is dealing with high selling pressure. The cumulative market cap dipped by another 2% over the last 24 hours to hover around $3.70 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 31% to stand at $224 billion. This suggests that investors are moving their funds quickly amid high turbulence. Japan may lift crypto ban for banks According to reports, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is also considering scrapping its longstanding ban that prevents banks from buying and holding crypto for investment purposes. If this gets approved, the move would mark one of Japan’s c rucial policy overhauls since it legalized crypto exchanges in 2017. It is expected that this step would bring mainstream banking muscle into a sector long dominated by fintechs and securities firms. As of now, subsidiaries of banking groups are barred from registering as crypto asset service providers. It is done under the Banking Act. The FSA’s proposed revision would allow securities subsidiaries of these groups to handle crypto trading. It will give them a level playing field with rivals under securities companies such as SBI Holdings and Rakuten Securities. A report mentioned that the regulator is expected to make its case during an upcoming meeting of the Financial Services Council. Discussions with an advisory body to the Prime Minister will center on establishing a framework that lets banks trade and hold crypto assets in the same way they handle stocks or government bonds. However, it will enforce risk management and disclosure standards. The FSA is treading carefully as it plans to require bank-affiliated securities firms to clearly warn retail investors about the volatility of the crypto market. It added that Bitcoin and other digital assets lack tangible backing, and large holdings could expose banks to balance-sheet stress if prices collapse. This is a concern that led the FSA to ban direct investment back in 2020. Bitcoin stuck in turbulence Japan’s stance seems more pragmatic than restrictive. Major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity are entering the crypto arena through Bitcoin ETFs and Tokyo appears eager to keep pace. A supportive decision could also strengthen Japan’s position as a regional digital finance hub. The digital assets market remained full of turbulence. Bitcoin caught a bid on Tuesday, climbing as gold and silver staged rare double-digit tumbles. BTC price surged past $113K just to dive below the $109K mark. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $108,773 at the press time. Gold saw its steepest drop in years as it fell more than 5% to $4,130, while silver plunged nearly 8%. The selloff unwound months of gains driven by central bank easing, US-China trade tension, and more. The sudden reversal seems to have sent traders back into crypto. Bitcoin futures open interest has jumped to over $32 billion from $28 billion since the brutal Oct. 10 wipeout that erased $20 billion in leveraged positions.

Under the agreement, Blue Owl will hold an 80% stake in the venture, while Meta will retain a 20% stake and manage construction and property operations at the Richland Parish facility. As part of the deal, Blue Owl contributed approximately $7 billion in cash, and Meta received a one-time payout of $3 billion. Meta said the partnership provides it with the “speed and flexibility” needed to construct the data center and advance its “long-term AI ambitions.” Meta partners with Blue Owl to accelerate AI infrastructure growth The Hyperion data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, is expected to provide over 2 gigawatts of computing power to train large language models, the technology that powers tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Doug Ostrover and Marc Lipschultz, Co-CEOs of Blue Owl, said Hyperion is “an ambitious project that reflects the scale and speed required to power the next generation of AI infrastructure.” Morgan Stanley estimates that major tech firms, including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and CoreWeave, are on pace to spend $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year. OpenAI has recently inked several agreements worth more than $1 trillion to secure around 26 gigawatts of computing power, enough to supply electricity to roughly 20 million U.S. homes. According to Meta’s finance chief, Susan Li, Tuesday’s deal is “a bold step forward.” The firm has signed leases for the facility with a four-year initial term, including an option to extend, and anticipates that the project will create more than 500 jobs upon completion. Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, noted that it definitely helps them mitigate risks at the expense of their ownership stake. He continued to say that Meta won’t be required to provide nearly as much capital and can look to finance other facilities or AI infrastructure. “It also minimizes the debt they are taking on for equipment and property in the event there is a bursting of the AI bubble.” A few months ago, Meta announced that it had chosen Louisiana to host its largest data center. The construction of that facility is expected to be done by 2030. It is being built on a site roughly the size of 1,700 football fields. According to Local utility Entergy, the new data center could use almost double the electricity used by the city of New Orleans on a peak day. Meta has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence as it competes with tech giants like Alphabet and OpenAI, both of which are also building massive data centers to support next-generation AI models. In January, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank launched the Stargate joint venture, pledging $500 billion to build data centers in the coming years. The first Stargate facility went live in September in Abilene, Texas, about 180 miles west of Dallas. Recently, Google announced that it would invest $15 billion in a data center project in southern India, making it the search giant’s biggest AI hub outside America.

An example of a firm that has adopted this approach is Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, in its recent $20 billion fundraising round. In this approach, the firm leases chips rather than owning them outright. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the new round is more significant than initially expected. It is linked to xAI’s plan to utilize Nvidia processors for Colossus 2, its biggest data center, located in Memphis. The total package mixes equity and debt. Reports show that about $7.5 billion is in equity, while as much as $12.5 billion is in debt. The deal is structured through a special purpose vehicle that purchases Nvidia GPUs and rents them back to xAI for a five-year period, providing financiers a path to recover their investment without exposing themselves to company-level risk.

Many projects operate behind closed doors, offering speculation instead of proof, but BlockDAG is rewriting that narrative through full visibility and verifiable progress. This is not just another presale built on hype. BlockDAG (BDAG) has embraced a transparency-first approach, giving the public a clear view of its roadmap, audited code, and leadership. Every element is designed to invite verification rather than avoid it. With $430 million raised, a live testnet, and over 3.5M active users mining through its X1 app, BlockDAG is showing the industry what accountability looks like in practice. Verified Transparency Defines BlockDAG’s Credibility The question “Is BlockDAG trustworthy?” deserves an answer grounded in proof, not promises. Unlike most presales that hide behind vague teams and unverified operations, BlockDAG operates in complete transparency across every layer of its ecosystem. Its whitepaper is publicly available and includes detailed allocations for team incentives, ecosystem expansion, community rewards, and treasury funds, allowing anyone to verify the flow of resources with precision. The live Dashboard V4 provides constant visibility into every presale milestone. It tracks how many BDAG coins have been sold, the current batch stage, and the ROI potential based on the projected $0.05 listing price. This transparency removes uncertainty for newcomers and creates a sense of real accountability that few projects deliver. Beyond data, BlockDAG’s leadership, CEO Antony Turner, CTO Jeremy Harkness, and Head of Security Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj, appear regularly in AMAs, public keynotes, and video updates. Their consistent visibility ensures the project is built by real professionals, not hidden teams, marking BlockDAG as a rare example of verified trust within presales. Dual Audits and Live Testnet Strengthen BlockDAG’s Foundation Security forms the backbone of any credible blockchain, and BlockDAG is one of the few presales to prioritize it before launch. The project has completed independent audits by CertiK and Halborn, two of the industry’s most respected security firms. Both audits have been published with transparent summaries, confirming that all major vulnerabilities were resolved. This early verification sets a precedent for reliability and foresight that most presale projects lack. In addition to its dual audits, BlockDAG’s Awakening Testnet is fully live and publicly accessible, supporting functions such as EVM compatibility, token transfers, and contract deployment. A working blockchain explorer is also available for anyone to test and observe transactions, reinforcing the idea that the ecosystem already operates beyond theory. With the Batch 31 presale price fixed at $0.0015 for only a few days with the code TGE, buyers are gaining access to a proven network backed by functionality, not speculation. Complementing this digital foundation, BlockDAG’s X1 miner has crossed 3.5M global users. Visible Accountability Makes BlockDAG the Model of Trust While many presale projects still function under anonymity, leaving buyers guessing about who controls their funds or whether products even exist, BlockDAG has made transparency its standard. It has replaced speculation with verifiable metrics, showing clear audit results, measurable presale progress, and visible leadership. Traders can see exactly how much has been raised, $430 million, and where it is being deployed. Every step is traceable, every claim verifiable. BlockDAG’s credibility extends beyond code and communication. Its miner hardware shipments are being publicly reviewed, and its partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team , facilitated by Playfly Sports, adds mainstream legitimacy that few crypto projects achieve before listing. When compared to anonymous presales that vanish after launch, BlockDAG stands as proof that visibility breeds confidence. For those seeking the top crypto presale with audits and active validation, BDAG offers more than promises; it offers the power to verify. Key Takeaways BlockDAG is proving its credibility not through marketing but through measurable results. A fully public leadership team, verified audits, an operational testnet, and real-time presale data confirm a structure built on openness rather than speculation. With $430 million raised and more than 3.5M users already mining through its X1 app, the project continues to set new standards for real-world participation. At $0.0015, the entry point remains one of the most transparent and rewarding in crypto. In a market filled with anonymous ventures, BlockDAG’s model of accountability and tangible delivery makes it a clear example of verified value in motion.

You’ll Need Iron Nerves — Or ‘Mental Illness’, Analyst Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/you-want-1k-xrp-youll-need-iron-nerves-or-mental-illness-analyst-says/,"A pro-XRP software developer sparked fresh debate this week by saying it takes “serious conviction” to hold volatile coins like XRP through long, wild swings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Goes Big — $255M Longs Opened Before Trump–China Summit Vincent Van Code said holding XRP all the way to $1,000 — let alone $10,000 — would take “mental illness.” His comments have drawn attention not just for the blunt wording but for the story they tell about the human side of crypto risk. Holder Psychology Under Stress According to Van Code, the real test begins long before a coin hits big numbers. He pointed to Bitcoin as an example: Bitcoin traded under $1 in 2010 and now sits above $110,000. Many claim they would have held from those early days, but Van Code argued most people would have sold around $100. Every talks about “oh if I bought BTC for $1 id because billionaire today”. What you fail to realize is 99% of people would sell even at $100. Or what about when it dumped from $10k down to $1k then back up again. You really have to almost be mentally unstable to hold from $1… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 19, 2025 Reports have also noted whales who were inactive for more than a decade recently moving coins bought for under $1,000 and cashing out millions or billions. The famous case of the French buyer who spent 10,000 BTC on pizza remains a blunt reminder that people do sell, sometimes at huge regret. XRP Near Key Demand Zone Technical calls are mixed. Ether Nasyonal, a crypto analyst, told followers that XRP is “cooking something” on the 1-month chart and highlighted an important demand zone. Following the sharp drop and quick bounce on Oct. 10, XRP failed to break past $2.5 and is still short of the $3 level. The token is down 14% this month. $XRP is cooking something up. Chart has been inverted, but the story remains the same. XRP is still gathering strength within the demand zone emerging from the 2018 major resistance. While the direction may seem confusing, the structure is clear. The next major move… https://t.co/HT9Sqhembx pic.twitter.com/s5grcnCMFZ — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL 💹🧲 (@EtherNasyonaL) October 19, 2025 Past movements add weight to caution: XRP plunged more than 90% after peaking above $3 back in 2018, a crash that punished holders who sold in panic and then watched prices recover later. Personal Stories And Public Bets Some holders frame their approach as a long-term plan. One user, TheXFactor33, said he has held XRP for over eight years and has weathered multiple crashes. Van Code has said he mentally removed the money from his balance sheet and intends not to sell even if prices head far higher. He told followers his aim is to convert the stake into something concrete for his family, such as buying a home for his children. Long-Term Bets Face Real Tests Views on how high XRP could go differ widely. Some analysts project a bullish scenario that sees XRP at $1,000 by 2040, a forecast that would require years of patience — roughly a 15-year hold from today’s levels under $3 — and a lot of market resilience.

This projection has reignited discussions within the crypto community about what such a shift could mean for other digital assets, including XRP. While Bitcoin has recently faced selling pressure, falling below several key support levels, gold has continued to rise, setting new records amid global market uncertainty. Over the past week, gold’s value climbed to an unprecedented $4,381 per ounce, lifting its total market capitalization above $30 trillion, the highest for any asset class. CZ Says Bitcoin Will “Eventually” Flip Gold In a recent statement, CZ expressed confidence that Bitcoin will surpass gold’s valuation, though he admitted that the timeline remains uncertain. According to him, Bitcoin’s superior portability, verifiability, and capped supply make it better suited to become the world’s dominant store of value in the long term. Prediction: Bitcoin will flip gold. I don't know exactly when. Might take some time, but it will happen. Save the tweet. pic.twitter.com/bR4Bq0JeVE — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 20, 2025 Currently, Bitcoin holds a market capitalization of $2.14 trillion, compared to gold’s $30.3 trillion. This means Bitcoin would need to expand by roughly 1,315% to reach parity with gold. Given its circulating supply of about 19.93 million BTC, such an increase would place Bitcoin’s price near $1.52 million per coin. Although this target may seem distant, CZ maintains that it is achievable as digital assets continue to gain global acceptance. He also noted that market cycles and macroeconomic conditions could influence how quickly this milestone is reached. Ripple Effects Across the Crypto Market If Bitcoin were to achieve a $30 trillion valuation, analysts agree that it would likely trigger a dramatic expansion across the wider cryptocurrency sector. Historically, the broader crypto market tends to mirror Bitcoin’s movements, with altcoins often experiencing significant appreciation during BTC bull cycles. At present, Bitcoin commands roughly 59.6% of the entire crypto market’s capitalization, which stands at $3.61 trillion. If this dominance remains consistent when Bitcoin reaches a $30.3 trillion valuation, the overall crypto market could grow to around $50.8 trillion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Under this scenario, XRP, currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, could benefit considerably. XRP presently accounts for approximately 4.03% of the global crypto market, corresponding to a market capitalization of $145.6 billion. If the total market capitalization reaches $50.8 trillion while XRP retains its 4.03% share, its market value would increase to approximately $2.04 trillion. With an estimated circulating supply of 60 billion XRP, this would imply a potential price of $34 per token. XRP’s Potential Within a Growing Market While the theoretical calculation appears promising, analysts caution that market behavior is rarely this linear. Even if Bitcoin were to surpass gold, the extent to which altcoins would benefit depends on several factors, including investor sentiment, liquidity conditions, and institutional participation. Moreover, XRP’s trajectory would also be influenced by Ripple’s ongoing adoption strategy, regulatory clarity surrounding the token, and developments within the cross-border payments sector. Despite these uncertainties, the projection underscores how closely tied XRP’s price action remains to Bitcoin’s overall market performance. Should Bitcoin embark on the type of expansion envisioned by CZ, XRP and other established altcoins could see substantial gains, even if not proportionate to BTC’s growth.

Altcoins are losing strength across the board, and growing concern among traders has fueled renewed talk of a potential bear market. The recent downturn has pushed Ethereum closer to its key technical levels, with investors closely watching whether it can maintain support or if another leg down is imminent. However, not everyone is bearish. On-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that Bitmine, one of the largest Ethereum holders, just made a massive purchase — acquiring 63,539 ETH worth approximately $251.6 million. Large, timely purchases during drawdowns don’t guarantee a reversal, but they often reveal where deep-pocketed participants think value sits. At a minimum, it injects fresh demand at a moment when sentiment is fragile and reactive. From here, the tape matters. If ETH can hold this support and compress into a higher low, the market may start to treat the recent selloff as a shakeout rather than a regime shift. Lose it decisively and the “bear market” calls will likely get louder. For now, Ethereum sits at a crossroads—pressure building, skepticism rising, and one sizable buy hinting that the story isn’t finished yet. Bitmine Adds Ethereum Amid Market Weakness According to Lookonchain, Ethereum whale Bitmine made a major move just eight hours ago — three newly created wallets received a total of 63,539 ETH, worth approximately $251.6 million, from Kraken and BitGo. The on-chain activity sparked renewed discussion among analysts, as such large-scale transfers during a period of selling pressure often reflect institutional accumulation rather than routine repositioning. This addition pushes Bitmine’s holdings to 3,299,553 ETH, valued at around $13.07 billion, representing roughly 2.73% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. The sheer scale of this position places Bitmine among the most influential holders of ETH, capable of impacting both sentiment and liquidity across the network. Analysts often interpret these types of movements as confidence signals, particularly when they occur in periods of heightened volatility. At a time when Ethereum is struggling to maintain key support levels and broader market confidence is fragile, such accumulation could serve as a stabilizing force — or at least a psychological one. Historically, similar whale activity has preceded local price recoveries as supply tightens and market participants reassess short-term bearish bias. Still, the broader context cannot be ignored. Ethereum remains vulnerable to macro headwinds, and on-chain flows alone may not offset systemic selling. What’s clear, however, is that Bitmine’s latest accumulation stands out as a show of conviction — an assertive move that suggests some large holders still view current price levels as a long-term opportunity rather than a signal of deeper decline. Testing A Pivotal Price Level On the 3-day chart, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to stabilize after a period of sharp selling pressure, currently trading around $3,871. The broader structure still shows an uptrend, but recent candles reveal a clear slowdown in bullish momentum. After peaking near $4,800, ETH entered a correction that brought price back toward the 50-period moving average (blue line), which now serves as a key short-term support level. This zone has historically acted as a pivot during mid-cycle consolidations, and holding above it would keep Ethereum within a healthy market structure. However, if ETH loses this level, the next significant support lies between $3,400 and $3,500, where the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) moving averages converge — an area that often attracts long-term buyers. To the upside, ETH needs a decisive close above $4,000–$4,200 to regain momentum and potentially retest the $4,500 resistance, which has been a strong rejection level since late September. Overall, the 3D chart paints a picture of short-term weakness within a broader bullish framework. Ethereum’s ability to defend its mid-range support will determine whether this correction evolves into accumulation or signals the start of a deeper market retrace.

With the ever-increasing scalability and efficiency of the networks, institutional pressure to purchase ETH remains very high. However, Ethereum is now being overtaken by all estimates, by a relatively unknown DeFi protocol in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token that has already raised more than $17.7 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a two-sided approach to lending which integrates Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract to maximize the effectiveness of capital which has drawn the interest of DeFi investors eager to find the most optimal cryptocurrency to invest in today before the next bull cycle. Its distinctive framework, rising presale, and CertiK-backed security review has convinced a few that Mutuum Finance is an early-phase undertaking like the growth of Ethereum in its baby stages. Ethereum Faces Stiff Opposition as Bulls target at $5,000 Ethereum (ETH) is approximately at $4,147, before a key point of resistance at $4,222, where the long-term holders have begun to take profits and this trend is eroding its progress to the highly anticipated $5,000 mark. On-chain indicators confirm a Holder Accumulation Ratio of only 30, which is nowhere near the ideal 50, with less conviction and constant distribution by larger hand. Breaking out above $4,222 strongly would re-open the optimism, while failure to break higher would push ETH down to $3,872. In the meantime as Ethereum makes its next move, investors have been following the emerging DeFi crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which most regard as a new engine of behemoth profitability in the next market cycle and one of the strongest crypto to buy today. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the talk of the DeFi community and crypto market with increasing investor buzz driving the project forward. Already selling 70% of its sixth presale, the demand is viewed as an indication of increasing confidence in the project and has fueled rumors among investors looking for the safest bet of cryptocurrencies to invest in. The token can be purchased for $0.035 today. Thus far, over 17,330 buyers have collectively bought a total of $17.7 million of MUTM tokens. The stampede validates increased global interest in Mutuum Finance’s decentralized financial long-term risk-taking model. At speed, MUTM is the leading crypto to buy now, attracting buyers and traders who are looking for a new cryptocurrency that has real-world tangible DeFi utility and value. For interested investors who are eager to know what crypto to buy now or searching for the best crypto to invest in for 2025, experts now recommend MUTM. Mutuum Finance will soon release its lending and borrowing protocol , another titanic leap towards building its decentralized infrastructure. The platform will first go on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Mutuum Leaderboard Rewards Mutuum Finance leaderboard is fueling a buying spree among investors with its incentive and 24-hour competition. Top 24-hour buyer leaders purchased $12,538, $11,667, and $1,027 MUTM tokens respectively, proof of the higher activity and buying spree among the community players during presale. Individual players who reach the top spot on the leaderboard are rewarded with $500 MUTM as an appreciation for persistence and dedication. A single trade by one player within 24 hours is what is tallied to earn a reward. Ethereum (ETH) is at close to $4,000, but where the attention is centered is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a $0.035 DeFi Phase 6 token that is 70% sold and has raised $17.7M. With its dual-loan model, CertiK audit, and Q4 2025 protocol launch, MUTM is widely regarded as the best crypto to invest in today, making it a top choice for those evaluating what crypto to buy now, challenging Ethereum’s initial boom.

Bitcoin slipped under $110,000 intraday and Ethereum fell below $3,900, dragging most altcoins into the red as a risk-off wave rippled across digital assets. The drawdown follows one of the harshest months of the year. The market has erased roughly $370 billion in value, with as much as $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated and $65 billion wiped from futures open interest, resetting activity to early-2025 levels. Related Reading: Winklevoss-Led Gemini Exchange Unveils New Credit Card Featuring Solana Rewards Institutional support thinned as spot Bitcoin ETFs posted about $1.23B in weekly net outflows, including $366M on Friday alone, removing a key buyer during sell pressure. At the same time, a major AWS outage disrupted access on leading venues, including Coinbase and several DeFi front ends, widening spreads and accelerating forced unwinds. Within 24 hours , over $240M in long positions, mostly BTC and ETH, were liquidated, briefly pushing Bitcoin toward $107,500. Musk/SpaceX Wallet Move Fuels Fear As Macro Tensions Simmer Nerves frayed further after trackers flagged SpaceX transfers totaling 2,395 BTC ($268M). While on-chain analysts suggest the flows look like internal custody reshuffles, with receiving wallets still inactive, the timing sparked “Is Musk selling?” headlines and added to headline risk. The backdrop was already fragile as renewed U.S.–China trade tensions, a stronger dollar, and U.S. fiscal uncertainty have pushed investors toward cash and safe havens. Micro catalysts didn’t help confidence. A Paxos operational error that minted an astronomical number of PYUSD units (quickly reversed) reminded traders of infrastructure risk just as liquidity thinned. Meanwhile, altcoins bled more than majors (averaging 4% drop) as SOL, BNB, ADA and DOGE posted deeper single-day declines, while XRP showed relative resilience on fresh institutional headlines. The rotation underscores a classic flight to quality: when BTC wobbles, smaller caps usually underperform. What To Watch Next Technically, Bitcoin faces layered resistance near $112,000–$115,500, with supports at $108,000, $105,000–$102,000, and the psychological $100,000 zone. A decisive daily close back above the 50-day region ($113,000) would help stabilize momentum; lose $101,700 and the market risks a deeper bearish phase as stop-losses and auto-deleveraging re-ignite.

Wave 3 Tells A Story Of A Surge For Ethereum, bulls want to reclaim $4,000 and the $4,050–$4,150 supply area; failure keeps pressure on toward $3,700–$3,600. Near-term catalysts remain firmly macro, with the upcoming U.S. CPI print and any Federal Reserve hints on rate cuts or quantitative tightening (QT) likely to shift liquidity dynamics quickly. On the micro side, investors should monitor ETF flows to see if outflows ease, as well as exchange uptime and whale behavior.

53476728,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87177,1761094827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says Shiba Inu (SHIB) Would Enter Trend Reversal Zone If…,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-shiba-inu-shib-would-enter-trend-reversal-zone-if/,"Shiba Inu, one of the leading meme-inspired cryptocurrencies, has maintained stability around a major support zone, prompting renewed optimism among analysts that the asset could be preparing for a potential reversal . Despite prolonged weakness across the broader market, SHIB continues to attract attention from traders monitoring its technical structure. The token has dropped by 1.7% over the past week, 18.77% in the last 30 days, and more than 42% since the start of the year. These declines indicate a dominant bearish trend, but some analysts argue that SHIB’s long-term structure remains intact. SHIB Holding at a Key Support Range Market analyst ForexDremVantage recently published an update highlighting that Shiba Inu has managed to sustain its position above a crucial support level near $0.000010. He emphasized that maintaining this range could be essential for preventing further downside pressure and potentially setting the stage for recovery. According to the analyst, this zone has served as an accumulation area since March 2025, as investors continue to consolidate holdings at these lower levels. Other market commentators have expressed similar views, noting that prolonged accumulation at major support areas often precedes significant price movement. Potential Recovery Levels Identified In his latest assessment, ForexDremVantage also outlined additional technical levels that may influence SHIB’s short-term trajectory. He identified $0.0000119 as the next significant area of demand, describing it as both a potential recovery target and a region containing substantial supply pressure. The analyst projected that a move toward this range would represent approximately a 20% increase from the current trading level of $0.000001047. Successfully reclaiming this price point could serve as confirmation of renewed bullish momentum, signaling that the market is ready for the next upward phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, he cautioned that several resistance zones remain overhead. The most immediate obstacle is a descending trendline that has consistently limited price advances since May, when SHIB last traded at $0.00001765. Technical data shows that this trendline currently aligns near $0.000013, about 31% above current prices. Confirmation of a Bullish Reversal According to ForexDremVantage, a decisive breakout above the descending trendline would likely bring Shiba Inu into what he describes as the “trend reversal zone.” This region begins near the May 12 high of $0.00001765, representing a potential 78% gain from current levels. Reaching and maintaining a price above this threshold would, in his view, confirm a transition from a bearish to a bullish trend. Such a move would also establish new targets at $0.000020 and $0.000025, levels that could define the next phase of SHIB’s market cycle. While SHIB continues to trade under pressure, its ability to hold key support areas suggests that sellers may be losing momentum. Analysts note that if buying interest increases at the current range, the asset could be positioned for a gradual recovery. However, sustained gains will depend on whether the token can overcome multiple layers of resistance and maintain consistent trading volume. For now, the market’s focus remains on whether Shiba Inu can preserve the $0.000010 support level. A breakdown below this threshold could expose the asset to new lows, while a confirmed move above $0.000013 could signal the start of a broader recovery phase.

This is where the outcome is expected to determine BTC’s overall direction and confirm a continuation of a bull market or bear market correction. Why This Zone Will Define Bitcoin’s Next Expansion Phase In an X post, an institutional-grade reporter, Bitcoin Vector, has highlighted that BTC has entered its decisive battleground between $110,000 and $115,000, which could determine the trajectory of the entire cycle. In the past week, spot demand, which is the engine of sustained rallies, was notably weak and capped by the escalating US-China trade tensions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Disbelief Phase’ – Could Short Sellers Face The Next Squeeze? As those tensions eased, that spot demand showed signs of returning, allowing BTC to claw its way back above the critical $110,000 level. Despite recovery back into the battleground, momentum remains negative and flat. Without sustained inflow and spot demand, the bullish structure could fade fast, leaving BTC exposed to another pullback. However, if demand holds and momentum turns up, BTC advances deeper into the battleground. A failure to maintain this range and BTC may risk retreating again and raising the white flag. A full-time crypto trader, Sykodelic, has also offered a highly optimistic prediction that Bitcoin will be back to an All-Time High (ATH) by the end of the month. The market is still in uncertainty and fear, where BTC thrives for its next leg higher. This is the stage of the cycle where disbelief dominates. As a result, traders convince themselves the rally is over, and that’s when BTC starts to move again. By the time BTC approaches its previous highs, traders will finally believe again, which often happens when another long flush clears out late entrants. Technically, BTC price is moving back above the 4-hour 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). Each time, Bitcoin successfully retests this level as support, the price continues to expand higher. “I think the worst is behind us,” Sykodelic noted. The Supply Battle That Shapes The Next Cycle The current Bitcoin market is in a supply tug-of-war between two powerful forces. According to the ambassador of MGBX_EN, BitBull, long-term holders (LTHs) have been constantly offloading their coins, while institutions are aggressively absorbing the supply through Spot ETFs and Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Hits $2.25 Billion Following Market Crash — What Could This Mean? Meanwhile, the treasury holdings have quietly surpassed $120 billion, with BTC still dominating the stack. Spot ETFs alone have absorbed tens of thousands of coins this quarter, proving that institutional demand remains strong. However, LTHs are still selling faster than ETFs, and DATs can absorb. Historically, when this kind of accelerated LTH distribution occurs, BTC tends to lose short-term momentum. This is not a bearish setup, but it does imply that the upside remains temporarily capped until the selling pressure fades. Thus, institutions are buying the strength, not the bottoms. Ultimately, the next major breakout hinges on when long-term holders stop distributing and return to accumulation mode.

To remain competitive in the cloud computing industry, the sources pointed out that the deal, which is still being worked out, would have the tech giant offering cloud computing services to Anthropic. This is not Google’s first time investing in the artificial intelligence firm. The firm previously invested approximately $3 billion in Anthropic; the tech giant committed to investing $2 billion in the AI startup in 2023 and followed up with another $1 billion investment early this year. Anthropic raises large amounts of funds to stay competitive in the AI industry Anthropic and Google’s upcoming $10B cloud computing deal has ignited debates in the tech ecosystem. To address this heated discussion, reporters reached out to both Anthropic and Google to comment and request further information on the progress of the talks, but the companies chose not to respond. Sources familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the talks, however, hinted that the talks were still in the initial stage, suggesting that details might change. In the meantime, recent data in after-hours trading revealed that Google’s stock surged by more than 3.5%. At the same time, that of Amazon.com Inc., another crucial investor and cloud service provider for Anthropic, encountered a decline of around 2%. Founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, Anthropic’s headquarters is based in San Francisco, California, at 548 Market St. The company is well-known for its Claude series of large language models, which rival OpenAI’s GPT models. Like other firms in the AI field, the startup has been raising substantial amounts of money to keep pace with the intense competition in advancing AI technology. Still, industry experts believe that the company requires more resources for research, the implementation of new ideas, and growing consumer interest to solidify its position as a leader in AI. Goal-oriented with a focus on AI leadership, the company recently engaged in initial findings talks with MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, just a month after finalizing a $13 billion funding round. This funding round, led by Iconiq Capital and featuring Fidelity Management and Research Co. and Lightspeed Venture Partners as co-leads, nearly tripled the valuation of the US-based AI startup firm to $183 billion. This amount includes the funds raised. Amazon pledges to invest around $8 billion in Anthropic Besides Google, Amazon also pledged to invest around $8 billion in Anthropic. Notably, the company is a key AI client of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a significant user of Amazon’s custom AI chips. This was after reliable sources highlighted that in 2024, Amazon.com Inc. invested an additional $4 billion into the AI startup firm, boosting its investment in one of OpenAI’s biggest rivals. Both companies announced the investment. Additionally, it was confirmed after a previous investment of approximately $4 billion in Anthropic, which occurred the same year. Under the previous investment deal, Anthropic was required to utilize Amazon Web Services data centers for some of its computing tasks. It also involved using AI chips designed by AWS. Despite Amazon’s substantial investments in Anthropic, research from sources has revealed that the company is strongly connected to Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc. Meanwhile, in a blog post, Anthropic pointed out that Amazon’s additional $4 billion investment signaled AWS’s position as the firm’s primary cloud and training partner. Moreover, the AI startup company revealed its intentions to use Amazon’s AI chips to develop its most advanced models. Therefore, with this deal, Anthropic confirmed Amazon as its minority investor.

53477573,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=841906,1761095541,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53477573.jpeg,Asia exchanges crack down on crypto hoarders masquerading as listed firms,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/asia-exchanges-crack-down-on-crypto-hoarders/,"Asia’s top three stock markets are tightening their listing rules and supervising companies to ensure they don’t become quasi–crypto investment vehicles. The move comes as regulators across the region are catching on to an emergent phenomenon of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs). These firms exist, first and foremost, to collect and hold cryptocurrencies rather than run traditional businesses. The gathering resistance represents a pivot for an industry that contributed to the surge of Bitcoin in 2025. The world’s largest digital currency reached a record $126,251 on Oct. 6, its historical high and an 18% year-to-date gain, as public companies around the world adopted Bitcoin-hoarding tactics pioneered by Michael Saylor’s $70 billion MicroStrategy Inc. However, enthusiasm has waned in recent months. DAT share prices have fallen sharply in tandem with a broader crypto market correction, with retail investors estimated to have lost more than $17 billion, according to 10X Research. Hong Kong moves to rein in digital treasuries Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (HKEX) has reportedly either rejected or challenged at least five firms seeking to transition into treasury models centered on digital assets over the past few months, citing listing rules that prohibit maintaining a large liquid position of holdings. None of the apps has been approved. A rule of the exchange classifies companies with majority assets in cash or short-term investments as “cash companies,” which may be suspended or delisted. The policy aims to discourage shell companies from exploiting their listed status to generate speculative gains. “Listing regulations directly shape how fast and how cleanly a digital-asset treasury model can operate,” said Rick Maeda, a Tokyo-based crypto analyst at Presto Research. Rules that are “predictable and accommodative” attract capital and boost investor confidence, while harsher environments hinder DATs’ execution speed, he added. An HKEX spokesperson stated that the exchange’s framework ensures all listed and applying companies maintain “viable and sustainable” business operations. India and Australia follow suit In India, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) recently rejected Jetking Infotrain’s application to issue new shares via preferential allotment after the company announced plans to invest part of the proceeds in crypto assets. The firm has appealed the decision, as stated in regulatory filings. Australia has adopted a similarly cautious stance. The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) bars listed companies from holding more than 50% of their balance sheets in cash or cash-like assets, a rule that effectively blocks the DAT model. Software firm Locate Technologies Ltd., which began purchasing Bitcoin earlier this year, is now shifting its listing to New Zealand, where the NZX has shown greater openness to hosting DATs. An ASX spokesperson said that while crypto treasury strategies aren’t explicitly banned, firms pursuing them should consider structuring their exposure as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to comply with listing standards. Japan stands out as the only major Asia-Pacific market where listed companies can freely adopt digital-asset treasury strategies. Local regulations permit firms to maintain substantial cash reserves, offering greater flexibility to invest in Bitcoin. “Once a company discloses it is purchasing Bitcoin, it’s difficult to conclude that such actions are unacceptable,” said Hiromi Yamaji, CEO of Japan Exchange Group, in a September press conference. Japan currently leads the region with 14 listed Bitcoin-holding firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. Among them is hotel operator Metaplanet Inc., which holds roughly $3.3 billion in Bitcoin. The company’s stock soared earlier this year before falling more than 70% from its June peak. However, even Japan’s DAT-friendly landscape may be changing. MSCI Inc., one of the world’s largest index providers, has proposed excluding DAT-heavy firms from its global indexes, arguing they resemble investment funds. The move followed Metaplanet’s $1.4 billion share sale in September, with most proceeds directed toward Bitcoin purchases. Travis Lundy, Japan equity analyst at Smartkarma, warned that if MSCI’s proposal goes through, it could strip DATs of passive fund inflows and remove their valuation premium.” The divergent approaches across Asia highlight the ongoing regulatory challenge of striking a balance between innovation in digital asset management and investor protection. While Japan’s flexible rules have encouraged experimentation, Hong Kong, India, and Australia are tightening oversight to maintain market integrity and avoid speculative excesses. For now, the DAT model, which once symbolized corporate enthusiasm for crypto, is losing momentum as regulators remind markets that digital-asset accumulation, without a sustainable business behind it, remains a risky proposition.

The rapper-turned-mogul has been ordered to pay $500,0000 fine and five years of supervised release. Combs is currently being held at Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in New York City, where he previously lived in the same prison block as former crypto kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried. Sources told NBC News in a September 2024 report that Bankman-Fried and Combs were being held in a “barrack-style area” which housed no more than 20 inmates who may have required “special detention” due to their high-profile status. The prison is widely known for its poor conditions and heightened violence, particularly in regard to stabbings. Sam Bankman-Fried Speaks Out Over 2022 Arrest Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is also in the middle of appealing his 2023 conviction on seven counts of fraud tied to his time at FTX. The former “king of crypto” was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the massive digital asset scheme that saw FTX investors drained out of $8 billion. Several former associates of Bankman-Fried also testified against him, including FTX chief technical officer, Gary Wang, the crypto platform’s former head of engineering, Nishad Singh and one-time Alameda Research CEO, Caroline Ellison.

Anutin rejected claims that Vorapak had been appointed to head the country’s anti-scam committee, saying that “There’s no such appointment.” News outlets had written that Anutin had appointed Vorapak the previous day. “His name isn’t on the list — never was, never will be. I’m the chairman,” he added, while stating that oversight of financial matters remains under Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas, while investigations fall to the Justice Ministry. Project Brazen’s Whale Hunting newsletter alleged that Vorapak’s wife received $3 million in cryptocurrency payments tied to a cross-border criminal network linked to South African Benjamin Mauerberger, who is considered a fugitive. The report, citing corporate filings in Singapore, suggested the transactions could be linked to illicit online operations that have proliferated across the Mekong region. Vorapak has strongly denied the allegations. Government under pressure to distance itself Anutin’s comments are seen by some as an attempt to draw a line between the deputy minister and Thailand’s anti-scam campaign. Finance Minister Ekniti had previously told reporters that Vorapak would lead a task force to trace “grey money” flows connected to the syndicates, a remark that fueled speculation about his role in the committee. That group, known as the Connect the Dots task force, was created to map financial and identity data tied to online scams and illegal remittances. Ekniti said the task force aims to complete coordination work by December, in partnership with key agencies including the Bank of Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Anti-Money Laundering Office. However, the revelation that Vorapak was linked to the task force, coupled with the Whale Hunting report, has raised concerns of potential conflicts of interest within the Finance Ministry. Expanding threat of regional scam syndicates The controversy speaks to Thailand’s mounting challenge in combating online scam operations that have become industrial in scale across Southeast Asia . Many of the syndicates are based in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, often near the Thai and Chinese borders, and are known to traffic victims who are forced to carry out online fraud, including investment and romance scams. Earlier this month, some South Korean citizens allegedly working for such syndicates were repatriated from Cambodia , while Myanmar’s junta raided a major scam compound, detaining over 2,000 workers and seizing Starlink satellite equipment. The United Nations has warned that these networks continue to expand, and they highlight the role the rise of cryptocurrency payments and the use of satellite internet to evade detection play in all of these. Political and economic implications Anutin’s administration, while still new, has positioned the anti-scam drive as a cornerstone of its digital policy, both to safeguard Thai citizens and to restore investor confidence. Thailand’s partnership with the United States on cybersecurity enforcement also signals a commitment to international cooperation. “If anyone is found guilty, the law will take care of them,” Anutin told reporters. However, questions still remain over how the government will pursue investigations if senior officials are implicated. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

To achieve this, the company seeks approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after submitting a filing to the commission. Meanwhile, reliable sources have noted that this index is crucial in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as it measures the performance of the top 20 cryptocurrencies based on their market capitalization. Crypto fund providers embrace crypto ETF approval in the sector ProShares shared the new fund’s name, suggesting it will be known as ProShares CoinDesk Crypto 20 ETF. According to the company, it will enable investors to invest in key cryptocurrencies, including Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin. On the other hand, the SEC filing highlighted that this ETF is designed to reflect the performance of the CoinDesk 20 Index. Notably, this will not account for fees and other expenses. Reliable sources have also conducted research and discovered that the index will not comprise wrapped tokens, meme coins, or stablecoins, but will instead focus on cryptocurrencies with significant market capitalizations and strong liquidity. To support this claim, the market benchmark prominently includes BTC, ETH, and XRP, with SOL also being one of the largest assets in the index. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ProShares’ move illustrates a growing trend among crypto fund providers seeking approval for crypto ETFs. An example is VanEck , which recently updated its Solana ETF application and reduced fees to 0.3%. Regarding ProShares’ crypto ETF, the company has made it clear that its ETF will not directly own any cryptocurrencies. Instead, it aims to gain exposure in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by using swaps, derivatives, and similar financial tools linked to the assets in the index. Sources have confirmed that this approach is highly preferred in the market, citing examples like the recent update of 21Shares’s S-1 filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF seeking approval from the SEC. They also highlighted that this investment setup will comply with the current regulatory standards. Additionally, it will enable investors to acquire the performance of the crypto market via a regulated option. The fund intends to set up a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands to manage certain derivative contracts. However, it will ensure that these contracts do not surpass 25% of its total assets. ProShares seeks more crypto-related investment options In 2021, ProShares introduced a Bitcoin futures ETF, marking the first US bitcoin-linked ETF. Since its launch, the company has been actively working on developing more crypto-related investment options. ProShares increased its interest in this sector after the latest filing highlighted that several institutions preferred diversified crypto baskets to help them mitigate the uncertainties surrounding individual assets. Regarding the CoinDesk 20 Index’s updated process, it undergoes an update every three months. Moreover, it includes some of the most popularly traded coins, such as BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA, and Avalanche. This aligns with a broader trend, as REX–Osprey has recently submitted filings for several ETFs linked to altcoins, including ADA, HYPE, XLM, and SUI. If approved, the ProShares CoinDesk Crypto 20 ETF will be positioned as one of the first US diversified crypto ETFs. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Market analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) highlighted a Glassnode cost-basis distribution heatmap showing a heavy band at that level Dogecoin Bulls Face $2.2 Billion Wall “10.50 billion $DOGE were accumulated at $0.21. That’s a big resistance zone forming. Keep this level on your radar!” he wrote. The underlying tooltip on Ali’s chart (timestamped Oct. 19, 2025, UTC) pinpoints a Cost Basis Range: $0.21062334–$0.21144839 with Supply: 10,575,420,761.332544 DOGE clustered there. At $0.21, that cohort represents roughly $2.22 billion in supply. The technical context around that same band adds weight to the on-chain reading. In a separate TradingView chart shared Oct. 20, Ali noted that Dogecoin “just bounced off the channel support and looks set to climb. Eyes on $0.29 first, then $0.45 and $0.86.” Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 His channel overlay tracks price respecting an ascending structure across multiple tests since 2023, with intermediate waypoints aligning closely to classical retracement and extension levels. Notably, the $0.21 area intersects the 0.618 retracement at ~$0.21205 on his plot—an overlap of technical and realized-price resistance that helps explain the current stall and the importance of clearing this shelf with convincing volume. DOGE Whales Continue To Accumulate A separate on-chain lens from Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) focuses on holder concentration dynamics. Sharing a long-horizon chart titled “Percent of Supply Held by Top 1% Addresses,” the analyst observed, “The supply held %1 data downward trend has not yet been seen as the price moves toward a new all-time high. To the moon > Target: $1.30.” The graphic shows the top-1% cohort maintaining an elevated—and recently rising—share of supply as price has recovered from the cycle lows. While such concentration is often interpreted as a proxy for large-holder conviction or tighter float, it can simultaneously amplify directional moves when those balances rotate; for now, the absence of a downtrend in the metric suggests no broad distribution from the largest addresses has materialized. Related Reading: Next Dogecoin Stop Could Be $0.33 If This Level Holds, Analyst Says Read together, the three signals sketch a coherent near-term battleground. First, the cost-basis heatmap identifies a thick realized-supply node precisely where spot is grappling—$0.21—implying latent sell pressure from holders looking to exit at break-even and equally strong validation if price can flip the level into support. Second, Ali’s price structure marks that same zone as Fibonacci resistance within an established rising channel, sharpening the inflection. Third, top-holder concentration has not rolled over, reducing evidence (so far) of heavy distribution into strength. If bulls absorb the ~$2.2 billion equivalent sitting at $0.21 and reclaim the 0.618 band, Ali’s stepped upside $0.29 (0.786 Fib), $0.46 (1.0 Fib) and $0.86 (1.272 Fib extension) path provides a clear roadmap of overhead targets; if they fail, the confluence argues for a renewed retest of channel support before any larger move. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.195.

Short-term players are watching a break above $112,200 for signs of renewed strength, while long-term holders still sit largely in profit. Reports have disclosed that easing US–China tensions may help risk assets like Bitcoin in the near term, adding a geopolitical layer to price action. Macro Risks Could Shape Next Downturn According to analyst Willy Woo, the next crypto bear market could be driven by a classic “business cycle” slump rather than the usual crypto rhythms. He pointed out that two cycles have overlapped so far: the four-year Bitcoin halving rhythm and swings in M2 money supply. Woo warned that a true business cycle contraction — the kind seen around 2001 and 2008 — would be a different test for Bitcoin’s role in markets. We had two 4y cycles superimposed Now it’s only one; global M2 liquidity Next bear IMO will be defined by another cycle people forget about → the business cycle The last biz cycle downturns that really took hold was 2008 and 2001, from before crypto markets were invented pic.twitter.com/inHqQH7zWx — Willy Woo (@woonomic) October 20, 2025 Historical Events Offer A Guide The dot-com downturn around 2001 saw US stocks fall roughly 50% over two years. And during the 2008 financial crisis the S&P 500 dropped about 56% as credit froze and GDP fell. Those events happened before crypto existed, which is why Woo says crypto has not yet been stress-tested by a full-scale recession. Based on reports, that concern is about how liquidity would change and how quickly investors would sell riskier holdings. Liquidity And Recession Signals The National Bureau of Economic Research tracks employment, personal income, industrial production and retail sales to spot recessions. Right now there is no across-the-board signal that a deep downturn is imminent, though some risks are elevated. Trade tariffs are one factor that trimmed growth in the first half of 2025 and are expected to weigh on GDP into the first half of 2026, analysts said. That kind of slower growth can sap liquidity and pressure markets. $BTC has reclaimed the $109,000-$110,000 support zone. The next crucial level to reclaim is $112,000, which could push Bitcoin higher. With US-China trade tensions easing, I think BTC could rally more from here. pic.twitter.com/D8VNses1ix — Ted (@TedPillows) October 20, 2025 What Traders Are Watching Next Analyst Ted Pillows said Bitcoin has regained a foothold between $109,000 and $110,000, and he pointed to $112,000 as the next resistance that matters. A clean move above that zone could invite more buyers. Conversely, a sharp liquidity squeeze from a broader recession could force Bitcoin to move more like tech stocks did in past downturns, not like gold. The Real Test Woo said the real test for Bitcoin will come when cash gets tight and investors must choose where to park money — not from the usual crypto triggers. This period, he said, will expose who treated Bitcoin as a hedge and who treated it as a high-risk bet, and that outcome will shape institutional behavior and market rules going forward.

The statement is a direct response to earlier criticisms by Trump-appointed AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who accused Anthropic of pushing a “woke” agenda and fear-mongering to capture regulators and harm the startup ecosystem. Dario Amodei defended Anthropic from accusations Amodei was forced to address the “inaccurate claims” about his company’s startup policy stances after the constant criticism from David Sacks, the current AI and crypto czar. In the statement, published on Anthropic’s official website, Amodei highlighted how the company is aligned with the Trump administration across “key areas of AI policy,” and that it is interested in working with “anyone serious about getting this right.” “I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development,” Amodei’s statement read . Anthropic , whose valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years, got on Sacks’ radar last week after Jack Clark, one of the company’s co-founders and its current head of policy, published an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,” sparking a debate over AI regulation online. Sacks did not like the essay, and he was quite vocal with his criticism, accusing Anthropic of “running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,” according to a post on X. According to him, the company is “principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem,” a point Amodei directly tackled in his statement by explaining that startups are among Anthropic’s most important customers. “We work with tens of thousands of startups and partner with hundreds of accelerators and VCs,” he wrote. “Claude is powering an entirely new generation of AI-native companies. Damaging that ecosystem makes no sense for us.” As far as Amodei is concerned, the company’s longstanding position has been that a uniform federal approach is preferable to a patchwork of state laws, and that has not changed. “When we agree, we say so. When we don’t, we propose an alternative for consideration,” Amodei said. “We do this because we are a public benefit corporation with a mission to ensure that AI benefits everyone and to maintain America’s lead in AI.” The clash between Sacks and one of Anthropic’s defenders A week after Sack’s criticism, Billionaire tech investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman rose to Anthropic’s defense , calling the startup “one of the good guys.” Hoffman, who is a partner at VC firm Greylock, which, he revealed, has invested in Anthropic, took to X to classify Anthropic among the few AI companies trying to “deploy AI the right way” which is “thoughtfully, safely, and enormously beneficial for society.” “Some other labs are making decisions that clearly disregard safety and societal impact (e.g., bots that sometimes go full-fascist) and that’s a choice,” he added. It did not take Sacks long to find the post, which he quickly responded to, triggering a virtual standoff between them on X. In one post, Sacks claimed the “real issue” is “Anthropic’s agenda to backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California.” Sacks also called Hoffman “the leading funder of lawfare and dirty tricks against President Trump” while Elon Musk, whose AI lab was not listed in Hoffman’s post, also chimed in with a one-word endorsement of Sacks’ stance. Hoffman responded by writing: “Shows you didn’t read the post (not shocked).

Nailwal also alluded to moments of personal conflict, while noting that navigating the Ethereum community had felt like a “shit show” at times, while simultaneously expressing respect for Buterin as someone he “looked up to as an ideal for how things should be built in this world.” Ethereum Elite Under Fire Nailwal’s response comes after Ethereum core developer Péter Szilágyi published a lengthy letter he first shared privately with Ethereum Foundation (EF) leadership in May 2024. In it, Szilágyi outlined long-standing frustrations with governance, compensation, and the emergence of an Ethereum “elite” that ultimately answers to Buterin. He described feeling like a “useful fool,” caught between loyalty to Ethereum and personal dissatisfaction, and criticized the perceived dissonance between public portrayals of his leadership role and how responsibilities were handled internally. Szilágyi highlighted compensation issues and mentioned that underpayment created incentives for top contributors to explore opportunities elsewhere, which ended up opening space for concentrated influence among high-profile insiders. While he said that Ethereum remains a powerful protocol, these structural and social dynamics create ongoing challenges for long-term contributors navigating recognition, opportunity, and principle within the network. “Do I find Ethereum fixable? No, not really. I don’t see how any of this can be reversed. I feel the Foundation blew allegiance to it beyond reversal. I feel Vitalik – with all his good intents – created the ruling elite who will never relinquish control anymore, so you either play ball or you get sidelined (at least they pay well apparently). As for Geth, I feel we are considered a problem in the grand scheme of things in Ethereum – myself at the centre of that problem – so I don’t really see a bright future for myself with my pushbacks against the issues I see.” The post Polygon’s Nailwal Bashes the Ethereum Community, Buterin Steps In With Surprising Praise appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Ethereum|Polygon (MATIC)|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|MATIC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-22 02:45:49

The excitement centers on Evernorth, a project aiming to strengthen XRP’s role in institutional and decentralized finance. JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a prominent crypto influencer on X, shared Garlinghouse’s post with the community. This mention from one of the most followed voices in the XRP community gave further visibility to what many see as a defining step in Ripple’s long-term strategy. Garlinghouse announced that Ripple has joined a coalition of major investors supporting Evernorth . In his post, he said he and the Ripple team are proud to partner with Evernorth and that the project is “building something special.” Among the listed investors are SBI Holdings, Pantera Capital, Kraken, GSR, and Rippleworks. Their combined participation marks one of the most substantial institutional alignments seen around XRP to date. BREAKING: CEO of @Ripple – Brad Garlinghouse is excited about the largest institutional #XRP treasuries in the world! pic.twitter.com/nZRKUdqrwv — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 20, 2025 Evernorth’s Institutional Ambition At the center of the announcement is Evernorth’s goal to establish one of the largest institutional XRP treasuries in the world, with plans to raise over $1 billion in gross proceeds. The move is designed to solidify XRP’s presence in high-value markets and deepen its use within institutional frameworks. Evernorth’s approach includes participating in institutional lending, liquidity provisioning, and creating DeFi yield opportunities using XRP as the foundation. Evernorth also plans to strengthen the XRP Ledger by contributing to validator operations. According to the statement, the initiative will operate XRP validators to “strengthen the resilience and decentralization of the ledger.” This focus on validator participation demonstrates a commitment not only to XRP’s market expansion but also to the security and stability of the network itself. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Integration Through RLUSD and DeFi Access A major component of Evernorth’s plan involves leveraging Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. One of the images shared by JackTheRippler describes this as an on-ramp into XRP-based decentralized finance, opening pathways for yield generation and lending built around XRP collateral. For institutional players, the integration of RLUSD could simplify access to XRP liquidity while reducing volatility concerns, thereby increasing XRP’s utility across multiple financial applications. Evernorth’s DeFi and institutional focus positions XRP to evolve from a payments bridge asset into a key tool for liquidity, lending, and capital market applications. Market Development and Adoption Potential Evernorth plans to advance XRP’s real-world utility across payments, capital markets, and tokenized assets, reinforcing its role in global finance. By connecting institutional systems with blockchain-based liquidity and DeFi tools, Ripple and its partners are driving adoption and long-term growth. With major investors backing the project and visibility boosted by JackTheRippler, XRP’s position as a scalable and essential digital asset continues to strengthen within both institutional and decentralized finance.

53480252,611050,1761102008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53480252.jpeg,"GENIUS Act Could Shield Bitcoin From Fed Oversight, Governor Barr Warns",https://bitcoinist.com/genius-act-shield-bitcoin-from-fed/,"Federal Reserve Governor Michael S. Barr used a keynote at DC Fintech Week to praise Congress for finally drawing lines around stablecoins—then immediately warned that the new law’s drafting could open channels for risk and regulatory arbitrage, including a pathway for Bitcoin-linked instruments to sit inside stablecoin reserves with only indirect Federal Reserve visibility. Bitcoin May Exploit Loophole In GENIUS Act Speaking in Washington on October 16, Barr said “payments innovation is accelerating,” and acknowledged that the newly enacted GENIUS Act “provides some clarity to issuers of stablecoins about how they can fit into the regulatory and supervisory framework,” potentially speeding development of new payment products. But he stressed that “success in accomplishing these goals will depend on the details of regulatory implementation,” adding bluntly: “Regulators have a lot of work to do to implement the act.” The most pointed warning came in Barr’s discussion of what the statute now counts as permissible reserve assets for payment stablecoins. The GENIUS Act’s core safety mechanism is to restrict reserves to a list of high-quality, liquid instruments. Yet the text also allows reserves formed via overnight repurchase agreements backed by “any medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a foreign government.” Barr highlighted the practical consequence with a concrete example: “For example, until quite recently, El Salvador treated Bitcoin as legal tender, and it still specifically permits Bitcoin to be used for transactions on a voluntary basis. As a result, an issuer could argue that Bitcoin repo could qualify as an eligible reserve asset for a stablecoin.” He cautioned that if Bitcoin prices “were to drop sharply in value, a stablecoin issuer could be stuck holding the Bitcoin that had declined in value, potentially compromising the one-to-one backing of the stablecoin liabilities,” concluding that “to the extent possible, regulations should be put in place to eliminate or minimize such risks.”Barr’s Bitcoin example ties directly to his broader concern: the GENIUS Act creates a mosaic of overseers—four federal agencies plus every state and territorial regulator can serve as primary supervisor of permitted stablecoin issuers. Not Only Bitcoin: More Crypto Risks In his view, that multiplicity risks creating uneven interpretations of the law’s guardrails and incentives for “charter choice” that could blunt federal prudential intent. “There might be a great deal of heterogeneity in the regulatory frameworks that apply to permitted issuers… The resulting array of charter choice options, unless carefully managed, may provide incentives for regulatory arbitrage,” he said. Beyond the foreign-authorized medium-of-exchange clause, Barr flagged other reserve-design openings that could transmit stress. He noted that the GENIUS Act allows uninsured deposits to count as permissible reserves and recalled their role as a “key risk factor during the March 2023 banking stress.” The law empowers regulators to limit concentrations in such deposits, he said, but “it will matter how these rules are written.” His critique extended to scope and structure. The statute empowers federal and state regulators to authorize a wide range of activities for stablecoin issuers—“digital asset service provider” and “incidental” businesses beyond pure issuance. Barr warned that issuers “are likely to seek to stretch these activities limitations,” even to the point of arguing they could “perform the full range of activities conducted by FTX ,” provided they make certain representations and maintain appropriate accounting. That breadth, he suggested, could leave some issuers operating with risk profiles far afield from narrow payments functions while escaping consolidated capital regimes if housed in trust-chartered entities—an echo of historical vulnerabilities. On capital, Barr argued the law’s issuer-level requirements could prove “too narrow” once firms branch into these additional lines, particularly when the act carves bank-affiliated issuers out of consolidated capital coverage. “Appropriate capital requirements are another area where coordination among federal and state regulators is key,” he said, adding that the statute’s standard for judging whether state rules are “substantially similar” to federal requirements will matter in practice. He also pressed on consumer-protection gaps. The act does not sweep in all instruments commonly marketed as “stablecoins,” allowing certain dollar-denominated tokenized products to remain outside the new regime. That omission, Barr warned, risks confusing users into believing they are protected when “there are no prudential protections of any kind.” He urged federal and state enforcers to use unfair-and-deceptive-practices authorities to police misrepresentations and noted the law lacks the fraud and unauthorized-transfer protections that apply to traditional payment rails.

Bitcoin Top Not In Yet – More Upside Ahead? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, there is a 55% probability that the Bitcoin top for the ongoing market cycle is not in yet. The analyst highlighted BTC’s recent on-chain flows to support their claim. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? In their analysis, PelinayPA noted that although BTC’s price has tumbled from more than $126,000 to around $109,000 in the second half of 2025, there has been a noticeable increase in 0-1 day BTC inflows to exchanges. A rise in 0-1 days BTC inflows to exchange typically has two implications – short-term traders are taking profits, and there is a temporary phase of repositioning of liquidity as traders transfer their holdings to exchanges, anticipating price volatility. The analyst added that BTC held for more than six months is largely inactive, indicating that long-term holders are likely not selling despite the recent market crash. This signals market confidence among long-term holders, minimizing the possibility of another major sell-off in the near term. PelinayPA remarked that such behavior typically occurs in the mid or maturing stages of a bull cycle, where any dip in price is seen as an opportunity to accumulate instead of a trend reversal. Currently, the Bitcoin market is in a natural consolidation phase within an ongoing uptrend. The analyst added: In the short term, Bitcoin could revisit the $102K region as short term traders continue to take profits. However, since this selling pressure originates mainly from newer holders, it is unlikely to disrupt the broader bullish structure. These dips may offer attractive entry opportunities. Concluding, Pelinay commented that the lack of selling activity among BTC holders in the 6-months to 10-year time-band range shows that there is a 55% probability that the bull market top has not yet formed. BTC Could Dip To $102,000 The CryptoQuant contributor noted that, although it is likely that the BTC bull market top is not in yet, it does not mean that the top cryptocurrency would not see further temporary decline. If selling persists, BTC could once again test the $102,000 support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Feels “Too Efficient” As Arbitrage Opportunities Vanish – What It Means For Price? Similarly, crypto analyst Elliot Waves Academy remarked that BTC has likely finished the bullish leg of the ongoing market cycle. The analyst added that BTC is likely to consolidate around its current levels. That said, a fellow CryptoQuant contributor noted that BTC has entered the ‘disbelief phase,’ and may take the bears by surprise with a sharp surge in price. At press time, BTC trades at $108,472, down 2% in the past 24 hours.

According to CoinShares , digital-asset investment products recorded $513 million in outflows last week, the second-largest withdrawal of 2025. Bitcoin accounted for the majority of the pullback, seeing $946 million in redemptions as fund managers reduced risk positions after sharp market swings. Despite the downturn, activity remained high, with exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes near $51 billion, nearly double the yearly average. This indicates traders are still repositioning rather than exiting the market entirely. U.S. Leads the Selling, Europe Buys the Dip Outflows were concentrated in the United States, where funds shed roughly $621 million in a single week. In contrast, European investors took the opposite stance, Germany, Switzerland, and Canada saw combined inflows of about $144 million, reflecting dip-buying sentiment after the October 10 liquidation event that erased nearly $19 billion from crypto exchanges. Among providers, BlackRock’s iShares and Grayscale saw the heaviest redemptions, totaling more than $1 billion combined. Fidelity and Bitwise experienced smaller withdrawals, while multi-asset funds in Europe posted only mild outflows of around $29 million. Bitcoin Technical Analysis and Price Forecast Bitcoin’s chart shows price consolidation within an ascending channel, holding near $107,950 after a rejection at $111,730. The 20-EMA and 50-EMA are flattening, signaling short-term indecision. However, a long lower wick on the recent candle suggests dip-buying interest around $107,700, aligning with the channel’s lower boundary. The RSI near 45 indicates neutral momentum, with a potential bullish divergence forming. If BTC holds above $107,400, it could rebound toward $111,700 and $115,900. A decisive break below that level would expose downside targets near $104,400 and $101,100. For traders, a long entry near $107,700 with a stop at $106,900 and target between $111,600–$115,900 offers a favorable setup. As volatility narrows, a breakout in either direction could define Bitcoin’s Q4 trajectory, potentially reviving optimism for a renewed institutional rally into year-end. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $24.3 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013145 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

53481986,611010,1761105607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53481986.jpeg,Here’s Why The FLOKI Price Jumped 22% – It Has Nothing To Do With Dogecoin,https://bitcoinist.com/why-the-floki-price-jumped-22/,"FLOKI has stunned the crypto market with a quick 22% surge in the past 24 hours after gathering the attention of crypto traders and meme-coin enthusiasts. The price spike, which saw the meme coin climb from around $0.000066 to as high as $0.0000879, came with a sudden surge in trading volume across major exchanges. The first thought is that the move might be linked to Dogecoin’s momentum , but the real reason turned out to be something entirely different: a new post by Elon Musk that instantly went viral on the social media platform X. Flōki Is Back On The Job The rally began shortly after Elon Musk shared a humorous, AI-generated video of a Shiba Inu dog on X. In the clip, the dog appears sitting at a desk wearing glasses and a tie, jumping on the table and muttering, “Numbers, numbers, numbers… Is this working? Yay,” alongside the caption, “Flōki is back on the job as X CEO!” Within minutes of the post, FLOKI’s trading activity skyrocketed, and trading volume soared more than 700 percent. The cryptocurrency community instantly connected the post to the token, pushing its price upward by over 20 percent in just hours. FLOKI had been trading around $0.00006966 before the post, looking to break above $0.00007. However, after the post, the meme coin’s price had broken above this level and had even broken past $0.0000 within a few hours. Therefore, the move confirmed that it was Musk’s post alone that triggered the run, as there were no concurrent updates from the FLOKI development team or new exchange listings. Why It Had Nothing To Do With Dogecoin Although Elon Musk’s name has long been associated with Dogecoin , the king of meme coins, this particular event had nothing to do with it. The FLOKI rally was based purely on the six-second video of the Shiba Inu and not on any reference to Dogecoin. There was no Dogecoin tweet, partnership, or update from Musk in connection with this episode. The meme coin surge serves as another example of how social media can dictate short-term volatility across the meme-coin market. Particularly, the market reaction shows how quickly Elon Musk can influence the price action of some cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Dogecoin’s price was mostly stable during the FLOKI jump. Dogecoin even broke below $0.20 again, showing that the two meme coins’ movements were not correlated in this instance. At the time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.00007316 after pulling back from an intraday high of $0.00008801 in reaction to Musk’s post. Its 24-hour trading volume is currently at $536.9 million, roughly 75 percent of its market cap. However, without concrete project updates or ecosystem expansion, FLOKI could easily retrace back below $0.00007 once the enthusiasm cools down.",Crypto News|dogecoin|Elon Musk|Floki|FLOKI crash|FLOKI news|FLOKI price|FLOKIUSD|FLOKIUSDT|meme coin|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,DOGE|SHIB|TRADING|FLOKI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-22 04:00:07

According to an X post, the Kadena organization wrote , “ We regret to announce that the Kadena organization is no longer able to continue business operations and will be ceasing all business activity and active maintenance of the Kadena blockchain immediately.” Before long, traders reacted to the news, with the price of KDA plunging by more than 60% as of this writing, at $0.089 . According to data from CoinGecko, that’s down more than 99% from the all-time high price of $27.64 set in 2021. Kadena organization noted that it was grateful to everybody who had participated in this journey with them. They insisted that market conditions had pushed them out, and they were unable to continue promoting and supporting the adoption of this unique decentralized offering. KDA token crashes 60% as Kadena shuts down operations The company emphasized that the Kadena blockchain is neither owned nor operated by it. As a fully decentralized, proof-of-work smart contract network, Kadena is maintained by independent miners , while on-chain protocols and smart contracts are governed separately by their respective developers. According to the statement, the developers “will shortly provide a new binary that ensures uninterrupted operation without our involvement, and will be encouraging all node operators to upgrade as soon as possible.” The network was founded by two former JPMorgan employees, Stuart Popejoy and William Martino, who had worked on the bank’s early blockchain efforts. They eventually struck out on their own, forming a startup called Kadena after both had worked on various blockchain projects at the financial behemoth, which released its mainnet in January 2020. Leveraging on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism like those of popular cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, Kadena pitched itself as “the blockchain for business”. In 2020, its founders stated with confidence that the blockchain could be larger than Bitcoin and more reliable than Ethereum. Although the startup maintained a corporate headquarters in New York with employees, the team stated that miners were distributed worldwide, giving the project a truly decentralized nature. Kadena fails to live up to the hype In 2022, Kadena established a $100 million grant program for Web3 developers to build projects on its blockchain, joining other prominent crypto projects such as Solana and Ethereum. Unfortunately, the project did not live up to the hype, and its native coin, KDA, has a significantly smaller 24-hour trading volume than major coins and tokens, recording a modest $48 million, according to CoinGecko. The token’s figures sharply contrast with those of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have rolling daily volumes of over $95.6 billion and $42.9 billion, respectively. In 2024, in a push to regain its market position and mindshare, Kadena’s Annelise Osborn said the company was going on a “hiring spree.” Kadena raised about $15 million in funding over three rounds. On-chain metrics, such as total value locked (TVL) and KDA volume, reached an all-time high in 2021 and early 2022, with a TVL of $9 million, according to data from March 2022. It was being claimed at that time that the KDA token would have an FDV of $6.5 billion. KDA showed some renewed interest last December 2024 when the market entered a micro altseason, as that month saw KDA achieve its highest monthly trading volume since Q2 2022. Earlier this year, Kadena founder and CEO Stuart Popejoy appeared on The Defiant Podcast to discuss the chain’s Leap Grant Program . The initiative included a $50 million incentive program for ecosystem developers and projects. Still, it is unclear whether the $50 million has been distributed. The organization noted that it would engage with the Kadena community to discuss actions to take regarding locked and unmined tokens. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

53482038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=841412,1761105646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53482038.jpeg,"Bitcoin Weekly RSI Points To More Upside, But Can the Bulls Defend $107,000?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-points-to-more-upside/,"Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows promising signs of strength as the RSI continues to climb, hinting at the potential for further upside. However, the battle isn’t over yet. With price hovering near the critical $107,000 support, bulls must defend this level to prevent deeper downside pressure. RSI And Price Alignment: A Textbook Case Of Momentum Confirmation In a recent market update, EGRAG CRYPTO questioned whether the bulls and bears are even analyzing the same chart, as the current macro weekly structure of Bitcoin shows no signs of bearishness. The broader setup remains firmly bullish, suggesting that the ongoing price movements are part of a healthy uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Eyes $114,000 Retest Amid Bounce, But Analyst Suggests Caution The analyst emphasized that when Bitcoin’s price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rise simultaneously on the weekly timeframe, it serves as a confirmation of momentum rather than a warning sign. This alignment often signals strong buying interest and market conviction, supporting the argument for continued bullish pressure in the near to mid-term. EGRAG CRYPTO further highlighted that the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbon remains supportive, reinforcing the trend’s strength. In the expert’s view, the current setup is a clear indication of macro confirmation, not mere market noise. Such alignment between indicators typically precedes significant continuation phases, showing that the trend remains well-structured and sustainable. However, the expert added a note of caution, stating that traders should only be wary if the RSI climbs into overbought territory above 70, which could suggest a temporary cooldown. For now, with RSI hovering around 50, Bitcoin still has plenty of room to run. This leaves the market with a strong technical foundation and considerable potential for further upside momentum. Bitcoin Faces Rejection At $111,000: Bulls Lose Grip On Momentum According to Crypto VIP Signal’s latest analysis, Bitcoin is currently facing challenges after failing to sustain its upward momentum above $111,000. The rejection from this point suggests that selling pressure remains strong, keeping bullish momentum temporarily in check. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Slumps Below 365-Day Average – Is Momentum Losing Steam? Crypto VIP explained that Bitcoin is now retesting the $107,000 support zone, a critical area that could determine the next possible move. Holding this level is essential to prevent a deeper pullback, as it has served as a key foundation during previous consolidation phases. However, a decisive break below the $107,000 support would likely trigger additional selling pressure, potentially extending the ongoing correction. Monitoring this level closely now appears important, since a bounce from here could reignite bullish sentiment, while a breakdown might expose Bitcoin to further downside risks in the short term.

See Where You Belong,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ranking-ladder-updated-see-where-you-belong/,"Within the XRP community, informal ranking systems have emerged as a way for holders to identify their position based on token holdings. A recent post by crypto enthusiast XRP Update revisited one of these commonly shared ladders, categorizing holders from “worms” with a single token to “big whales” holding 100,000 XRP or more. While intended as a light-hearted measure of commitment within the ecosystem, the post prompted responses that reflected deeper views about what such rankings truly represent. Every time i see this RANKING ladder i realize how lucky im Big Whale = +100,000 XRP Whale = +50,000 XRP Shark = +10,000 XRP Dolphin = +5,000 XRP Fish = +1,000 XRP Octopus = +500 XRP Crab = +200 XRP Shrimp = +100 XRP Worm = +1 XRP Tag your rank! — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) October 18, 2025 Holder Tiers and Personal Milestones The ranking chart displayed various classifications tied to specific XRP amounts, assigning sea creature titles to different holding brackets. From 100 XRP for a “shrimp” to over 100,000 XRP for a “big whale,” the ladder serves as a symbolic representation of individual accumulation goals. For many, identifying with a tier has become a motivational tool, encouraging long-term holding and a sense of belonging within the wider XRP community. Sustainability of Status One user, identified as MB, pointed out that the central challenge is not reaching a particular tier, but maintaining it. They questioned whether holders have accumulated enough XRP to remain within their chosen bracket even after taking profits in a future market cycle. This perspective brought about a key distinction between short-term accumulation and strategic, sustainable positioning. It suggested that true commitment is tested during market volatility, when many are tempted to liquidate large portions of their holdings. The comment captured a common sentiment among experienced holders: ranking oneself today may differ significantly from maintaining that status through the next major price surge. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Debate Over Definition of a “Whale” Another community member, Michaela G, offered a more critical viewpoint by challenging the criteria used in these rankings. They argued that traditional definitions of a “whale” are based not merely on holdings, but on the ability to materially impact market price through large trades. In their view, assigning the title of “whale” to anyone holding 100,000 XRP risks diluting the term and turning it into an inclusive label rather than a reflection of true market influence. Community Identity Versus Market Reality The post by XRP Update underscores how cultural elements within crypto communities can evolve independently of financial definitions. For many participants, these rankings are less about literal market power and more about personal milestones and shared identity. Yet, the responses also show a divide between those who view holding thresholds as light-hearted markers and those who believe such classifications should reflect economic impact. As XRP continues to attract long-term participants, informal systems like these will likely persist, not as financial metrics, but as cultural expressions within the ecosystem. The ongoing discussion around them reveals not just the diversity of holdings but the diversity of perspectives that shape the XRP community.

The move comes as Bitcoin hovers near $108,000 and traders debate whether the recent rebound has already peaked. Onchain Lens , citing data from Hyperbot, reported that the trader transferred 3,003 BTC, worth roughly $338m, to Binance on Wednesday, signaling a potential plan to take profit or reposition his exposure. ‘Insider’ Trader Adds To Bitcoin Short As Floating Profit Reaches $5.8M The transaction followed another deposit of 200 BTC worth about $22m , which was used to expand his short position a day earlier. The #Bitcoin OG has deposit 3,003 $BTC , worth $338.15M, into #Binance . Meanwhile, he continues to hold his $BTC (10x) short position with 2,100 $BTC , valued at $227M, making a floating profit of $5.8M. https://t.co/Bg0WNcT1Mq https://t.co/AKX88gpHA2 pic.twitter.com/DlbD9zm4k3 — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) October 21, 2025 According to Hyperbot data, the whale’s position now carries a floating profit of $5.8m, reflecting a gain that remains unrealized until the trade is closed. The leveraged short, opened around $111,000 with 10x exposure, currently sits comfortably in profit as Bitcoin struggles to regain upward momentum. The trader’s recent activity fits a clear pattern of aggressive bearish positioning. Earlier this week, he moved $30m in USDC to Hyperliquid to open a $76m short . ‘Trump Insider’ Wallet Once Again Draws Attention With Well-Timed Market Shorts Just days before that, he increased his exposure when Bitcoin attempted a brief recovery from last week’s steep decline. At one point, his total short exposure reached 3,440 BTC valued at $392m. His timing has once again stirred debate in crypto circles. Many traders believe the investor is positioning for another correction, potentially expecting Bitcoin to retest the $100,000 level or lower. The wallet behind these trades first gained attention after reportedly earning $160m by shorting Bitcoin just before US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement sent global markets tumbling . That perfectly timed move earned him the “Trump insider” nickname, one that has persisted through several successful trades. Blockchain analysts have since identified the address as part of a long-standing “Bitcoin OG” cluster, active since the early Satoshi era. Records suggest the holder accumulated more than 86,000 BTC between 2010 and 2012, making him one of the oldest surviving whales in the ecosystem. Whale’s Post-Crash Activity Signals Expectation Of Further Turbulence In Crypto Markets His recent short positions emerged after the Oct. 10–11 market crash, when Bitcoin plunged from above $125,000 to near $102,000 following Trump’s surprise call for 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. That sell-off wiped out more than $19b in leveraged positions across the market and briefly pushed Bitcoin below the psychologically key $100,000 threshold. Ethereum also suffered a sharper 18% drop to around $3,370, as traders rushed to unwind risk across equities, commodities and crypto. The whale’s moves since then suggest he expects further turbulence ahead rather than a quick rebound. Critics see the timing of his positions as unusually precise, often aligning with major political or macroeconomic announcements. Supporters, however, say he may simply have unmatched skill in reading market structure and sentiment. Regardless of motive, the trader’s latest short has become one of the largest active positions on-chain. As Bitcoin’s funding rates flip negative and volatility rises, analysts say his bet could become a key indicator of broader institutional sentiment heading into the final quarter of 2025.

According to a letter dated October 17, 2025, the company asked Treasury officials to accept new approaches that use blockchain analytics, artificial intelligence, APIs, decentralized identifiers and privacy-preserving proofs. The filing is part of a public comment process tied to a Treasury notice seeking ideas on “Innovative Methods to Detect Illicit Activity Involving Digital Assets.” Coinbase Pushes Tech-Friendly Rules In the submission, which runs about 30 pages, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal proposed several practical steps. Reports have disclosed requests for safe-harbor testing zones where firms could try new monitoring tools without immediate enforcement risk.

Grewal wrote, “When bad guys innovate in financial crime, good guys need innovation to keep pace.” That line was used to underline the company’s point that traditional, form-driven reporting can miss real threats. At @coinbase , we’re constantly modernizing our defense systems to protect our customers and national security. The government’s approach to combating financial crime should be no different. That’s why policymakers should embrace innovation to modernize AML with proven digital… https://t.co/82GfJSzRDs — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) October 20, 2025 Why Coinbase Says Change Is Needed According to Coinbase , current rules under the Bank Secrecy Act generate vast amounts of suspicious activity alerts, many of them low value, and leave both firms and regulators overwhelmed. The firm argued a results-based approach would focus on outcomes — like whether illicit activity was actually detected and stopped — instead of forcing specific, often outdated methods on every actor. Reports show Coinbase also framed this as a national competitiveness issue, pointing to a white paper from its policy arm titled “The National Security Case for Crypto and Blockchain.” Privacy And Data Concerns At the same time, privacy advocates and some civil liberties groups have raised red flags. Blockchain tracing can expose transaction links that were previously harder to discover, and activists worry about overreach. Coinbase told Treasury it wants fewer blanket data grabs and more targeted, meaningful reporting — a move it says would protect privacy while improving enforcement.

Analyst Says This Breakout Could Be The Trigger,https://www.newsbtc.com/chainlink-news/chainlink-to-100-analyst-says-breakout-trigger/,"An analyst has pointed out how Chainlink could see a major bullish breakout if its price can break past the resistance barrier of this technical analysis (TA) channel. Chainlink Is Currently Trading Inside A Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a level that could trigger a major bull rally for Chainlink. The level in question is the upper line of a Triangle from TA. This pattern appears whenever an asset’s price trades between two converging trendlines. Like any other consolidation channel in TA, the upper line of a Triangle is a source of resistance and lower one that of support. Related Reading: Ethereum Death Cross That Last Preceded A 60% Drop Just Returned Triangles can be classified into different types depending on how the trendlines are oriented. The upper line being parallel to the time-axis results in what’s known as an “Ascending Triangle.” Similarly, the lower level being parallel forms a “Descending Triangle.” These two types correspond to consolidation periods in the asset where its range narrows to an upside and downside, respectively. When the range shrinks down with no bias, the resulting channel is called a “Symmetrical Triangle.” In this Triangle, the trendlines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The Triangle that Chainlink has been following for the last few years doesn’t cleanly fit into any of these classes. Instead, its channel lies somewhere between an Ascending Triangle and a Symmetrical Triangle, as the chart shared by Martinez shows. As is visible in the above graph, the 1-day price of Chainlink retested the upper level of the Triangle earlier in the year and found rejection. The coin has since been on the way down. The chart also shows that LINK is slowly approaching the end of this multi-year channel. Generally, breakouts become more likely the smaller an asset’s range gets. As the coin is clearly trading inside a narrow region now, a breakout could be coming closer. A surge above a Triangle is usually a bullish sign, while a decline under the channel can lead to bearish action. As such, the next retest from Chainlink could be worth keeping an eye on, as a breakout could set the tone for the coin’s upcoming price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $105,000, Sentiment Sinks Into Extreme Fear It only remains to be seen, however, whether LINK would next retest the upper level or the lower one. In the scenario that the coin can break past the resistance line situated around $25, the analyst thinks its price could see a bull rally. For the target, Martinez has referred to the 1.272 Fibonacci Extension level. Fibonacci Extension levels drawn up from the top (considered as the 1 level), based on ratios from the famous Fibonacci series. The 1.272 level indicated by the analyst lies around $100. LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is floating around $18, down over 2% in the last seven days.

Yet, among the assets named in his post, XRP’s position as the first on the list caught the attention of many crypto analysts, and continues to intrigue market participants who suspect a deeper connection between the president and XRP. A crypto commentator known as BD (@DiepSanh) on X, who has spent extensive time studying Trump’s digital asset statements, suggested that the placement of XRP was intentional. BD wrote that “the reason he mentioned XRP first isn’t random,” proposing that Trump’s team “was talking about XRP right before that post.” According to BD, this timing implies significance because “the brain always retrieves what’s most recent in memory.” I’ve studied Trump’s post for 3 hours a day, 6 months straight. Here’s my conclusion: The reason he mentioned XRP first isn’t random. His team was talking about XRP right before that post. The brain always retrieves what’s most recent in memory. Now the million-dollar… pic.twitter.com/qiQ2OB98wA — BD (@DiepSanh) October 20, 2025 Trump’s Directive and the Role of XRP The post in question, shared from Trump’s Truth Social account, stated that a U.S. Crypto Reserve “will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration,” adding that his executive order directed the Presidential Working Group to advance a “Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.” This announcement came just before the White House released the official executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile . Although the White House documents primarily focus on bitcoin as the core reserve asset, they also reference other digital assets held through forfeiture proceedings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The inclusion of XRP in Trump’s announcement stands out. It suggests that his administration might be considering a wider range of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially incorporating assets linked to payment infrastructure and liquidity where XRP has a defined function. Why XRP May Have Strategic Appeal BD’s interpretation centers on timing and emphasis. If discussions about XRP indeed preceded the post, it could indicate that Trump’s advisors were weighing XRP’s potential utility within a government framework. XRP’s association with efficient cross-border payment systems may align with objectives to strengthen U.S. capabilities in digital finance and settlement technologies. Although there has been no confirmation that the government has formally added XRP to its holdings, BD’s analysis suggests that it is under active consideration. The argument suggests that Trump’s reference to XRP could reflect an interest in assets with practical financial use cases , rather than merely speculative value.

The debut Vision Pro model, powered by the M2 chip and released in February 2024, was originally produced in China. While the headset volumes accounted for only a small portion of Apple’s hardware output, its relocation marks another sign of Apple’s gradual move away from China. However, iPhone production remains centered there. Apple is reportedly assembling new smart home products in Vietnam Apple has been walking a fine line, trying to maintain good relations with Beijing while contending with Trump-era tariffs and the push to diversify its manufacturing base . The tech giant has already transferred a significant portion of its iPhone output for U.S. buyers to India this year to circumvent new tariffs on Chinese imports. A significant portion of AirPods, iPads, HomePods, and Apple Watches is also being manufactured in Vietnam. Sources even stated that the firm’s next-generation smart home products — including a smart display, a home security camera, and a tabletop robot — will be built in Vietnam. The iPhone maker is reportedly collaborating with Chinese EV maker BYD to assemble the new smart home devices. The Chinese manufacturer will oversee final assembly, testing, and packaging of the firm’s new home hub and tabletop robot. Beyond India and Vietnam, Apple has expanded its Mac production network to include Thailand and Malaysia. The firm also agreed to make AirPods Max mesh parts in Indonesia under a government partnership announced earlier this year. In addition to overseas changes, Apple is also expanding its U.S. manufacturing. Together with Corning Inc., the iPhone maker will begin manufacturing cover glass for all iPhones and Apple Watches in the U.S. However, flagship devices remain out of reach for local assembly, except for the high-end Mac Pro, which is made in Texas. So far, the company hasn’t confirmed whether all Vision Pro units are manufactured in Vietnam or if some are still assembled in China. Though the company usually splits the manufacturing of its larger-scale products among several countries. Apple is struggling with the design and production of a foldable iPad On a related note, Apple’s recent efforts to refresh the iPad lineup with a large foldable display have encountered engineering snags, potentially pushing back the launch. The company had planned to launch it in 2028, but sources revealed that engineering issues with its weight and display technology have pushed back the launch timeline to 2029 or later. The device, which could carry a $3,000 price tag, has been in development for several years. Although whispers of delays have been circulating for a while, the latest reports indicate that hinge and design challenges are the primary roadblocks. People familiar with the project said Apple is working alongside Samsung Display Co. on an approximately 18-inch panel. The design will reduce the crease typically seen on foldable screens, a strategy Apple intends to adopt for its upcoming foldable iPhone. Nevertheless, the development of an 18-inch foldable screen has proven both technically challenging and costly, with estimated prices reaching nearly three times that of the 13-inch iPad Pro. The new tablet, like the current Pro model, would use OLED technology, which offers vivid visuals and thinner designs. Apple’s foldable iPhone is also facing delays. The phone, which has long been rumored and eagerly awaited, could now arrive in 2027, pushing back expectations by a year. While the development of these devices will take a bit longer, on the bright side, the extra development time might be exactly what the devices need to meet the iPhone maker’s premium standards.

Bealls to Accept Memecoins, Stablecoins Payments The national retailer will leverage Flexa Payments, which would allow Bealls to accept more than 99 cryptos, including memecoins and stablecoins, from over 300 digital wallets. The announcement aligns with the company’s 110th anniversary, the company release noted. The point-of-sale integration represents one of the largest planned deployments of in-store crypto payments acceptance so far. Matt Beall, Chairman & CEO of Bealls, said that cryptocurrencies will “reshape how the world transacts.” “Our partnership with Flexa is about more than payments; it’s about preparing for the future of commerce and continuing to innovate for the next 110 years.” Bealls Inc., a 110-year-old U.S. retail company, has announced a partnership with digital payments platform Flexa to enable cryptocurrency payments across more than 660 stores nationwide. With this integration, Bealls becomes the first national retailer to accept digital assets… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 22, 2025 16% of Americans Have Made At Least One Purchase Using Crypto: Study A recent study from Carat Global Platform revealed that 16% of Americans have reported using crypto at least once to pay for goods and services. Interestingly, over half of the respondents said that they are keen on using crypto for online payments. Meanwhile, a third of the respondents expressed interest in using crypto equally in-store. Besides, 25% of crypto users in the US cited the lack of merchant acceptance, which is limiting widespread adoption. Trevor Filter, cofounder of digital asset payments platform Flexa, called crypto payments “the most important payments technology evolution the world has ever seen.” Furthermore, around 65 million American adults, which roughly makes 25%, own cryptocurrencies as of early 2025, the company release added. Bealls joins several retailers and firms worldwide in accepting crypto payments. For instance, Shopify announced in June that its merchants can now accept USDC stablecoin payments directly through Shopify Payments.

Despite the shutdown, Kadena still said its proof-of-work blockchain would stay operational through independent miners and validators. Meanwhile, Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh escalated his feud with the Ocean Protocol Foundation by offering a $250,000 bounty for information on an alleged $80 million token misappropriation. The dispute is mainly rooted in the 2024 Artificial Superintelligence Alliance merger, and it has shaken investor confidence enough that both the FET and OCEAN tokens are facing volatility. Kadena Folds Under Pressure Kadena, the layer 1 blockchain that once hailed as a “blockchain for business,” announced that it is winding down operations and stopping all active network maintenance due to what it called “market conditions.” The news was shared on X on Tuesday, and sent its native token KDA plunging by 60+% within just 90 minutes. In the announcement, the Kadena team said it could no longer sustain business activities or promote adoption of its network, but still expressed gratitude to supporters and participants in its journey. Kadena was founded in 2016 by Stuart Popejoy and Will Martino, and its goal was to combine scalability with strong security through its unique proof-of-work architecture and smart contract capabilities. Popejoy previously led JPMorgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence, while Martino served as a tech lead for the US.Securities and Exchange Commission’s cryptocurrency steering committee. Their backgrounds brought early credibility to the project, and at its peak in November of 2021, the KDA token reached a valuation close to $4 billion. Today, that figure has fallen dramatically to around $30.9 million, according to CoinMarketCap data . KDA’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the company’s shutdown, Kadena explained that the blockchain itself will continue operating. The network is decentralized and maintained by independent miners and validators who can still process transactions and mine blocks. To ensure ongoing stability, the team said it will release a new binary designed to keep the blockchain running without its direct involvement and urged node operators to upgrade as soon as possible. Kadena also kept a small team to manage the wind-down process and will work with the community on decisions regarding the distribution of its remaining tokens. Around 83.7 million KDA tokens are set to be unlocked in November 2029, while an additional 566 million will continue to be released gradually as mining rewards through 2139. The closure of Kadena sheds some light on the challenges that smaller blockchains face when it comes to maintaining relevance and profitability in a competitive environment dominated by larger players like Ethereum and Solana. Ocean Protocol Under Fire Other crypto company founders are also finding themselves in a tight spot. The feud between Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh and the Ocean Protocol Foundation intensified after Sheikh offered a $250,000 bounty for information on the signatories of OceanDAO’s multisignature wallet and their connection to the foundation. The move was made after Sheikh’s recent allegations that a wallet linked to Ocean Protocol misappropriated approximately 286 million Fetch.ai (FET) tokens—which was worth around $80 million at the time. The dispute traces back to the 2024 merger that formed the Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance, which combined Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNet into a unified token framework. Sheikh claims that Ocean Protocol minted and transferred millions of OCEAN tokens before the merger, and later converted them into FET tokens and moved them to centralized exchanges without disclosing the transactions. The Fetch.ai CEO has since vowed to fund class-action lawsuits across multiple jurisdictions and urged major exchanges, including Binance, GSR, and ExaGroup, to investigate the matter. In the wake of the controversy, Binance announced that it will cease support for OCEAN token deposits, though it did not specifically point to the dispute as the reason. The growing tensions also impacted market performance, with the FET token dropping almost 8% in the past 24 hours to trade at around $0.25, according to CoinMarketCap data . FET’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps provided even more insight after reporting that an Ocean Protocol-linked wallet converted about 661 million OCEAN tokens into 286 million FET tokens and transferred roughly 270 million FET—valued at $120 million—to Binance and GSR Markets.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs are providing a novel way for the crypto-rich to get their coins into the traditional financial markets without selling them, it added . The exchanges are tax-neutral swaps where no cash changes hands and no taxable sales occur. Some Bitcoin whales are doing custom creations of IBIT, trading in their physical Bitcoin for shares of the ETF, for a “variety of benefits after discovering TradFi has its perks,” said ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Bitcoiners Getting Back into TradFi Once Bitcoin is held as an ETF within a brokerage account, it becomes much easier to use as collateral for loans and include in estate planning. It also provides access to higher-tier wealth management services and integration with traditional financial advisers and banks. The moves from BTC into ETFs have been driven by the regulatory approval of “in-kind creations,” which enable the digital asset to be “swapped” for shares in the ETF without generating a taxable event. BlackRock has already facilitated more than $3 billion of these conversions, according to its head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick. Bitcoin whales are “waking up to the convenience of being able to hold their exposure within their existing financial adviser or private-bank relationship,” Mitchnick told Bloomberg. “Life is just easier in TradFi land — we’ve spent a century perfecting integration, access, and security. Bitcoiners are finally realizing that,” said Wes Gray, founder and CEO of ETF firm Alpha Architect. “The great irony, of course, is that Bitcoin was born to escape traditional finance — and now its biggest holders are trying to get back in.” Bitcoin ETFs Bounce Back Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States reversed a four trading day trend of outflows on Tuesday with an aggregate inflow of $475 million. BlackRock (IBIT) led the pack as usual with an inflow of $209 million following the previous five days when the product bled $440 million as Bitcoin prices tanked and failed to recover. ARK Invest (ARKB) was the second largest inflow on Tuesday with $163 million, while there were smaller inflows for Fidelity, Bitwise, and VanEck. There are now 155 crypto exchange-traded product filings tracking 35 different digital assets, which “could easily end up seeing over 200 hit the market in the next 12 months,” observed Balchunas, who described it as a “total land rush.” The post Bitcoin Whales Getting Back Into TradFi Via ETFs Says BlackRock appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-22 05:44:10

British Columbia To Ban New Crypto Mining Grid Connections Permanently According to a statement from British Columbia’s Ministry of Energy and Climate Solutions, the government is going to implement regulatory changes in Fall 2025 related to which industries receive electricity from the Canadian province’s grid. In particular, British Columbia will limit the power available for data centers and AI, and permanently ban new BC Hydro connections for mining farms related to Bitcoin and other digital assets. BC Hydro is the region’s main electricity distributor, with its name alluding to the fact that most of the power in the province is generated using hydroelectrical stations. The ministry said the legislation is to “ensure electricity is available for sectors that produce jobs, generate public revenues, and have the greatest opportunity to decarbonize, including mining, upstream natural gas, LNG, and manufacturing. New cryptocurrency mining connections have already been suspended in British Columbia since December 2022, due to what the ministry described as the industry’s “disproportionate energy consumption and limited economic benefit.” Initially, the suspension was to last 18 months, but in 2024, the government extended the period to 36 months. The mining ban would have been lifted in December 2025, but with the latest policy, the province has decided to make it permanent instead. For other industries with limits on power, BC Hydro will have projects compete in early 2026 for “a two-year period that allocates 300 megawatts (MW) for AI, 100 MW for data centres, and amounts for hydrogen exports that will be set at a later time, as market conditions warrant.” Canada’s British Columbia isn’t the only region where Bitcoin mining has faced pushback recently. The Southeast Asian nation of Laos is looking to end cryptocurrency mining by the end of Q1 2026, as reported by Bitcoinist. Laos, which is another hub of hydroelectric power, intends to similarly redirect power away from digital-asset mining operations toward industries that produce jobs and add value to the local economy. In the case of the Asian country, the sectors its government is considering prioritizing include AI, metal refining, and electric vehicles. Meanwhile, in Brazil, cryptocurrency mining companies are negotiating contracts with local electricity providers to tap into the country’s surplus of renewable energy, according to a Reuters report . Tether , the issuer of USDT (the largest stablecoin in the world), earlier this year acquired a South American agriculture and renewable electricity producer to use its biomass-generated electricity to power a Bitcoin mining facility in Brazil.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be experiencing a slight capital rotation towards it, as evidenced by Tuesday’s price performance, which led to a recovery of the $112,000 mark. In this context, asset manager Bitwise has released a new report that outlines promising price prospects for the market’s leading cryptocurrency, despite the challenges it has faced over the past few weeks. How Gold’s Rise Fuels Bitcoin Opportunities Authored by Andre Dragosch, Max Shannon, and Aayush Tripathi from Bitwise Europe’s research and analysis department, the report highlights that crypto prices have been underperforming compared to traditional assets, largely due to a bearish market sentiment triggered by renewed weaknesses in US regional bank stocks. The report emphasizes the fluctuating relative performance of Bitcoin against gold, which tends to vary with changes in cross-asset risk appetite. A renewed risk-on environment could potentially reaffirm Bitcoin’s leadership in performance over gold. Related Reading: Bear Market Alert: Top Expert Claims Bitcoin Price Fate Hangs On $101,700 Support Level A key catalyst for Bitcoin’s recovery over the coming months could stem from this capital rotation. Gold has experienced a meteoric rise this year, driven by expectations of easier monetary policy and growing concerns regarding US fiscal debt. According to Bitwise, even a modest capital rotation of just 3% to 4% from gold to Bitcoin could significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially doubling its value, as seen in the chart below. Interestingly, a 5% shift in investments from gold to Bitcoin could increase its price by over 126%, propelling it to $242,391. This is based on a baseline price of $107,240, which is Bitcoin’s price at the time of Bitwise’s publication. Why Is $118,000 Key For BTC’s Outlook? Historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin’s performance leadership may reassert itself during a risk-on phase. This potential shift is not merely speculative; the report points out that a similar trend occurred in 2020, when Bitcoin began its ascent to new all-time highs in October, coinciding with a stall in gold’s rally that began in July. The analysts believe this performance pattern could repeat itself, particularly if gold’s rally pauses. They highlight that sustaining gold’s rally typically requires a significantly larger capital influx compared to Bitcoin, which could create headwinds for gold’s continued performance.

The report suggests that a decisive move above the upper end of this range at $118,000 could result in a new price rally.

While Republicans have traditionally taken the lead on pro-crypto positions , the participation of Senate Democrats in this conversation shows a willingness to engage more openly on market structure issues. Ripple’s involvement through Alderoty places XRP directly within this growing policy dialogue at a moment when regulatory clarity could define the next stage of growth for digital assets in the U.S. Alderoty has been a central figure in advocating for regulatory fairness in the crypto sector. His attendance at this roundtable suggests that lawmakers now view Ripple as an established participant in discussions surrounding digital finance.

The company’s ongoing success with cross-border payment solutions has given it credibility among financial institutions, and its leadership in Washington meetings like this one enhances XRP’s legitimacy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the Meeting Matters for XRP Alderoty’s involvement can also be viewed as a sign of institutional recognition. Market structure legislation affects how tokens are classified, traded, and integrated into financial systems. If policymakers move toward frameworks that provide clarity and consistent oversight, assets with strong legal and operational foundations could benefit most. Ripple has maintained that XRP is suited for global payments and liquidity solutions, and recognition from lawmakers supports that narrative. As discussions continue between crypto executives and Senate Democrats, XRP’s role as a functional bridge asset within Ripple’s payment network will gain additional visibility. A perception of greater stability and policy support often attracts institutional investors and payment partners. This could, over time, strengthen XRP’s position in the market and reinforce confidence among both retail and institutional participants.

Gold prices hovered around $4,120 per ounce on Wednesday, stabilizing after a sharp drop of over 5% in the previous session, the steepest since 2021. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.10% to below 48,900 on Wednesday, pulling back from record highs. The Japanese yen traded around 151.7 per dollar on Wednesday, after a sharp fall in the previous session following the election of Sanae Takaichi as prime minister. Japan reported a trade deficit of JPY 234.6 billion in September 2025, significantly missing market expectations, which had forecasted a JPY 22 billion surplus, with exports rising 4.2% year-on-year—the first increase since April. Concurrently, imports climbed 3.3% to an eight-month high of JPY 9,648.3 billion, driven by Tokyo’s measures to stimulate consumption. Japan’s new economics minister, Minoru Kiuchi, vowed to prop up the economy amid higher U.S. tariffs and domestic inflation. “It is undeniable that the recovery in personal consumption still lacks strength amid continued inflation,” he said Wednesday. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.07% to around 3,910 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.2% to 13,050 on Wednesday, snapping a two-day winning streak as persistent trade uncertainty weighed on sentiment, and the offshore yuan held steady around 7.12 per dollar on Wednesday, as markets remained cautious amid developments in US-China trade negotiations. China’s urban youth unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds, excluding students, declined to 17.7% in September 2025, down from August’s 18.9%, which was the highest level since December 2023, and slightly above 17.6% a year earlier. Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party’s Fourth Plenum, which runs through Thursday, is set to chart the country’s next five-year economic development plan. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.09% to 25,922 in early trade on Wednesday, reversing gains from the prior session amid broad-based losses. India ( SENSEX ) market closed. India and the U.S. are close to finalizing a long-stalled trade deal that would cut U.S. tariffs on Indian imports from 50% to 15–16%, India's Mint reported. India's infrastructure output grew by 3% yoy in September 2025, the slowest pace in three months, sharply down from a revised 15-month high of 6.5% in August. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.71% to around 9,000 in Wednesday morning trade, pulling back from a record close in the previous session, with gold stocks and heavyweight miners leading the market lower. The Australian dollar remained under pressure below $0.650, holding near two-month lows amid growing bets of a near-term rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia. In the U.S. on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended higher for a third straight session as a strong start to earnings outweighed lingering US China trade uncertainty. Investors now await Tesla’s earnings on Wednesday for further cues on the sector, and look ahead to Friday’s CPI report amid a data blackout from the ongoing US government shutdown. U.S. stock futures were steady on Wednesday as traders evaluated the latest round of corporate results: Dow +0.18% ; S&P 500 +0.19% ; Nasdaq +0.10% . Currencies: ( JPY:USD ), ( CNY:USD ), ( AUD:USD ), ( INR:USD ), ( HKD:USD ), ( NZD:USD ).

Details Here",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/gold-falls-sharply-us-traded-spot-bitcoin-etfs-see-inflows-rise-details-here/,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US returned to positive territory on Tuesday, recording net inflows of $477.2 million. This recovery, following recent volatility, signals a renewed surge in institutional investor confidence. $477 Million Inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US: Weakening Gold Demand Fuels Crypto Trends “Yesterday’s net inflows suggest that institutional investors are repositioning despite recent volatility, strengthening crypto’s portfolio diversification role amidst economic uncertainty,” said Nick Ruck, Director of LVRG Research. According to SoSoValue data, 9 of 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs reported net inflows. BlackRock's IBIT fund saw $210.9 million, Ark & 21Shares' ARKB fund saw $162.8 million, and Fidelity's FBTC fund saw $34.15 million. On the same day, spot Ethereum ETFs also saw net inflows of $141.6 million, with the highest inflow being into Fidelity’s FETH fund ($59 million). In recent weeks, over $1 billion has flowed out of spot crypto ETFs due to trade tensions between the US and China. However, on Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total trading volume of $7.41 billion, which is in line with strong trading volumes in the $5-9.7 billion range in October. Ruck stated that rising trading volumes indicate growing institutional participation, saying, “The volume increase seen in the last month represents a new momentum in institutional interest in digital assets. This, in turn, deepens liquidity and increases risk appetite.” Emphasizing that demand for gold has weakened, Ruck stated that investors may now turn to crypto assets that offer a better risk-return ratio. Indeed, the spot gold price fell 5.9 percent on Tuesday, its steepest daily loss since 2020. Analysts are predicting an “aggressive recovery rally” in Bitcoin following this decline. *This is not investment advice.

The question many traders are asking now is simple: Which Crypto Will Explode next? While legacy players like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, a new generation of projects combining AI, utility, and cross-chain innovation is quietly building momentum beneath the surface. In particular, Blazpay, TRON, HBAR, BNB, and Solana have emerged as frontrunners for those seeking asymmetric upside and low entry opportunities before liquidity returns in full force. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, from scalable infrastructure to tokenized rewards and DeFi integration, but only one offers the early-stage multiplier potential that could turn a modest portfolio into a six-figure windfall when the next market cycle ignites. Market Snapshot October 2025 Token Current Price (USD) Market Cap (USD) Description Blazpay $0.0075 (Presale) N/A AI-driven Multichain finance platform bridging user-friendly crypto payments and DeFi tools. TRON $0.3209 $27.85B Focused on decentralized internet and content-sharing infrastructure. HBAR $0.17 ~$3- 4B Enterprise-grade distributed ledger known for speed and security. BNB $1,130 $164B Binance ecosystem’s powerhouse token supporting payments and DeFi. Solana $192 $89B High-performance blockchain powering scalable decentralized apps. Blazpay: The Low-Entry Powerhouse Ready to Redefine Crypto Payments Among the top AI crypto coins, Blazpay stands out as one of the most talked-about projects in early 2025. Now in Phase 2 of its crypto presale at just $0.0075, it has already raised over $744,000 with more than 106 million tokens sold. This strong presale response shows rising confidence among early investors who see its potential for major post-listing gains. Blazpay’s mission is to transform the DeFi experience by combining AI-powered financial intelligence with multichain interoperability. Its ecosystem enables users to transact, earn, and manage digital assets seamlessly across major networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain. With its low entry price and strong fundamentals, many investors view it as the best cryptocurrency to buy before listings go live. At its core, Blazpay offers an AI SDK that lets developers integrate predictive analytics and smart financial tools into decentralized apps. This innovation supports optimized trading, automated rewards, and personalized user experiences. Combined with its gamified rewards system, over 3 million transactions, and a growing base of 800,000+ users, Blazpay already shows real-world traction, setting it apart from most new crypto coins still in early development stages. The $5,000 Scenario: From Presale to Potential Fortune If Blazpay reaches even $0.75 post-listing, a $5,000 investment at the presale price could soar past $500,000, representing a 100x ROI. Analysts tracking whale wallet activity have noticed increasing allocations toward Blazpay as part of broader positioning within the Top AI Crypto Coins sector, an area expected to outperform in the 2025- 2026 cycle. This low entry, high-leverage opportunity positions Blazpay as the definitive answer to Which Crypto Will Explode next cycle, particularly for those priced out of larger-cap plays like BNB or Solana. Blazpay Price Forecast: What Analysts Expect Post-Listing Analysts predict Blazpay could reach $0.25, $0.50, or even $1.00+ after listings, depending on market momentum and AI-driven demand. With strong presale growth, active development, and upcoming multichain expansion, it’s emerging as one of the best crypto coins to buy before the Phase 2 price rise from $0.0075 to $0.009375. How to Buy Blazpay Before the Price Increase Visit the official Blazpay Presale Page. Connect your DeFi wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Choose your preferred payment option (ETH, BNB, or USDT). Enter the amount and confirm your purchase. Secure tokens before Phase 2 ends and the next price jump occurs. TRON: Quiet Strength Amid Market Rotation Token Current Price Market Cap Description TRON $0.3209 $27.85B Focused on decentralized internet and entertainment ecosystems. TRON continues to strengthen its infrastructure as a global settlement layer, showing consistent transaction volumes despite recent consolidation. With whales beginning to reenter, TRON could quietly position itself as one of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy for medium-term recovery plays. Its ability to maintain network stability amid volatility demonstrates institutional-grade resilience. HBAR: Enterprise Stability Meets Long-Term Potential Token Current Price Market Cap Description HBAR $0.17 ~$3- 4B Distributed ledger technology supporting enterprise-grade dApps. HBAR’s focus on real-world integrations and verified enterprise use cases makes it a dependable option in the next market cycle. Liquidity concerns and developer engagement have been a challenge, but new DeFi integrations and liquidity partnerships are underway, suggesting that HBAR could see a resurgence among Top AI Crypto Coins as capital flows back into enterprise-grade projects. BNB: The Utility Giant Holding Steady Token Current Price Market Cap Description BNB $1,130 $164B Binance ecosystem token used across DeFi, trading, and payments. BNB remains one of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy due to its proven track record of ecosystem growth and consistent supply management. As Binance continues expanding its DeFi services and NFT integrations, BNB is positioned to maintain strong performance even as new Crypto Presales like Blazpay enter the market with innovative models. Solana: High-Speed Layer-1 With Room to Run Token Current Price Market Cap Description Solana $192 $89B Fast and scalable blockchain powering DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Solana remains a favorite among developers and institutions due to its unmatched transaction throughput. Despite past volatility, ecosystem growth continues to accelerate, suggesting Solana could remain a core player in the upcoming bull market. Yet, compared to new entrants like Blazpay, its upside may be more measured given its already-massive valuation. Conclusion: The Next Market Cycle Belongs to the Early Movers As the crypto market prepares for its next major breakout, investors are revisiting the core question: Which Crypto Will Explode before the 2025 bull market fully ignites? While established players like BNB and Solana remain solid performers, the real asymmetrical opportunity lies with early-stage innovators like Blazpay. With its low entry price, AI-driven utility, and cross-chain DeFi integration, Blazpay represents the type of project that often fuels the biggest 100x returns during early bull market phases. It’s not just another Crypto Presale, it’s a foundation for the next wave of growth in intelligent, scalable finance.

Crypto, DeFi ‘Woven’ Into The Payment Systems On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller affirmed that a “new era” for the federal agency had begun, signaling a shift toward the crypto industry and other emerging sectors. At the Payments Innovation Conference in Washington, DC, the Governor discussed how the Fed aims to embrace and actively participate in the “tech-driven revolution” of the payments system, led by the crypto and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sectors. In his opening remarks, Waller explained that the conference goal is to have a “vibrant discussion” on how the new technologies are entering the mainstream payment ecosystems, while addressing the Fed’s new approach toward DeFi and crypto. I wanted to send a message that this is a new era for the Federal Reserve in payments—the defi industry is not viewed with suspicion or scorn. Rather, today, you are welcomed to the conversation on the future of payments in the United States and on our home field—something that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. He explained that multiple technological advances are transforming the payment system, including stablecoins, tokenized assets, and artificial intelligence (AI), adding that the convergence of these innovations with the traditional financial ecosystem “is demanding change everywhere.” Therefore, Waller considers that public institutions, including the Federal Reserve, must acknowledge and embrace private-sector innovation that can improve the payment system while preserving its safety and stability. “This is an acknowledgement that distributed ledgers and crypto-assets are no longer on the fringes but increasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems,” he remarked. ‘Skinny’ Master Accounts For Payment Innovation The Federal Reserve Governor shared he had asked the agency’s staff to explore the creation of a “payment account” to “support those actively transforming the payment system.” As he explained, the payment account would be available to all institutions that are legally eligible and could be beneficial for those focused on payment innovations. “This payment account concept would be targeted to provide basic Federal Reserve payment services to legally eligible institutions that right now conduct payment services primarily through a third-party bank that has a full-fledged master account,” he detailed. According to Waller, the goal is to tailor the services of these new accounts to the needs of the eligible firms, like innovative banks, asset managers, retail payments firms, stablecoin issuers, technology companies, as well as crypto-native fintechs, and to “the risks they present to the Federal Reserve Banks and the payment system.” “Payment innovation moves fast, and the Federal Reserve needs to keep up,” the Governor affirmed. He explained the prototype of the “skinny master account,” which would provide limited access to the Federal Reserve payment rails while controlling for various risks. It’s worth noting that Federal Reserve Banks provide access to master accounts and financial services to legally eligible entities following the agency’s guidelines. The new limited accounts would not have daylight overdraft privileges. They would also not be eligible for discount window borrowing or have access to all Federal Reserve payment services for which the Reserve Banks cannot control the risk of daylight overdrafts, Waller added. “I want to be clear that this is just a prototype idea to provide some clarity on how things could change. The upshot is that, in my view, the payments landscape, as well as the types of providers, has evolved dramatically in recent years, and, accordingly, a new payments account could better reflect this new reality.” Ultimately, Governor Waller stated that the federal agency will engage with all interested stakeholders and crypto firms to discuss perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto firms|Fed crypto|Fed governor|Fed governor Christopher Waller|Federal Reserve|federal reserve bank|payment accounts|Stalecoin issuers,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-22 07:00:39

Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Eyes $114,000 Retest Amid Bounce, But Analyst Suggests Caution Fetch.AI Vs Ocean Protocol Feud On Tuesday, Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.AI, offered a bounty $250,000 to anyone who could “uncover the OceanDAO signatories and their connections to Ocean Foundation.” The post followed last week’s allegations that Ocean Protocol had dumped hundreds of millions of FET tokens into crypto exchanges earlier this year. For context, crypto AI projects Fetch.AI, Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and SingularityNET (AGIX) merged into the Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance in mid-2024, combining their tokens under a shared FET framework. Over a year later, Ocean Protocol Foundation announced its departure from the alliance, sharing on October 9 that it had resigned as a member of the ASI Alliance, “effective immediately.” Last week, Fetch.AI’s CEO affirmed that the Ocean Protocol Foundation had swapped 661.2 million OCEAN tokens minted in 2023 for 286.4 million FET this July, suggesting that the protocol had been moving and liquidating them for the past three months. Sheikh noted that “Ocean as stand alone project did this it would be classed as a rug pull,” later vowing to personally fund three or more class action lawsuits in different jurisdictions. “If you are or were a holder of $fet and have lost money during this Ocean action be ready with your evidence. (…) I will be setting up a channel for all to submit your claims,” he wrote. Ocean Protocol called the accusations “unfounded claims and harmful rumors,” affirming that their team was “preparing responses to the various unfounded claims and allegations while respecting the ambits of the law.” At the time of writing, the protocol’s official X account has not published a response. Did Ocean Dump $120M Worth Of FET? Data analytics platform Bubblemaps shared a timeline of the Ocean Protocol moves, highlighting that despite the merger, the protocol kept a large amount of OCEAN tokens in its wallets for alleged “community incentives” and “data farming.” According to Bubblemaps’ analysis, Ocean Protocol’s team wallet (0x4D9B) converted 661 million OCEAN into 286 million FET, worth $191 million on July 1, and later sent 90 million FET to an OTC provider, GSR Markets. On August 31, the team wallet split the remaining 196 million FET across 30 new addresses. By October 14, most of these addresses had sent the funds to Binance or the OTC provider. Bubblemaps estimated that around 160 million tokens were sent to Binance, while 109 million FET were transferred to GSR Markets. In total, approximately 270 million tokens, valued at around $120 million, were reportedly transferred and potentially liquidated. “We can’t confirm whether the $FET tokens were sold by Ocean Protocol, although such transfers are typically associated with liquidation,” the platform noted, adding that on-chain activity only shows a multisig wallet linked to the protocol swapped millions of OCEAN tokens for FET, and sent them to Binance and GSR. FET’s Price Sees Sharp Decline Analyst Cryptor pointed out that the feud has triggered uncertainty surrounding the projects. He noted that the FET’s Top PnL Leaderboard doesn’t look good, as “almost everyone over the past 30 days has fully exited their positions.” Additionally, Smart Money Flows have been declining for nearly a year, alongside the price, which has retraced over 92.6% from its $3.45 all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Pundit Outlines The Possibility Of The XRP Price Getting To $1,000 The analyst asserted that “you want segments like Top PnL traders, Smart Money, and funds to stay onboard because they set the tone for market behavior. (…) The data shows hesitation and capital leaving, which is to me a clear sign that confidence hasn’t returned. Price might hold temporarily, but without their participation, volatility rises quickly.” As of this writing, FET trades at $0.25, an 8.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

According to SBI Holdings’ formal announcement , the Japanese financial group will participate in a PIPE financing for Evernorth and commit $200 million in cash toward a transaction that is expected to raise in excess of $1 billion. SBI’s notice describes Evernorth’s stated purpose as building “one of the world’s largest public XRP treasuries,” using proceeds primarily to purchase XRP on the open market while also deploying institutional lending and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities under independent audit and governance. Core elements of Evernorth’s model Public reporting from Evernorth and coverage by multiple outlets indicate the vehicle will be an active, institutionally managed treasury rather than a passive fund. Evernorth’s stated objectives include open-market accumulation of XRP, participation in XRPL validator operations, liquidity provision, and yield generation through institutional lending and DeFi strategies. Several news organizations described the planned SPAC merger and funding round that underpins the initiative, and noted participation from established crypto firms and investors alongside SBI. Analyst commentary and the tweet Crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull weighed in on the development, emphasizing that the moves being made by major financial institutions such as SBI Holdings reflect a strategic focus on utility rather than market sentiment. He noted that SBI’s continued involvement with XRP does not stem from speculative enthusiasm but from its recognition of the asset’s role within the infrastructure of emerging financial systems. According to his perspective, XRP is positioned not as a speculative token but as a core technology enabling the future of cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market context and DeFi integration Independent reporting and industry summaries have emphasized that a material portion of Evernorth’s approach is to accelerate DeFi activity on the XRP Ledger , including integration of RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin associated with Ripple, to facilitate on-ramps into decentralized financial products. Coverage by trade outlets and industry blogs has described RLUSD integration and validator participation as central to Evernorth’s plan to expand XRPL-based financial primitives and increase institutional utility for XRP. What to watch next Key items for market participants and observers include the timing and scale of open-market XRP purchases, disclosures surrounding custody and governance, and the results of independent audits that Evernorth says it will commission. Confirmation of operational details will determine whether the initiative delivers the levels of liquidity, collateral depth, and protocol activity described in the public announcements and analyst commentary.

Bitcoin rallied to the $113K level on Tuesday but immediately reversed and is now trading below $109K on Wednesday. The whipsaw performance resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of long and short positions being liquidated from the market in the last 24 hours. More volatility is expected ahead of the CPI data release on Friday. Spot Bitcoin ETFs record a $477M inflow Bitcoin’s volatile price action comes despite spot exchange-traded funds in the US, returning to positive territory on Tuesday. Data obtained from SoSoValue revealed that nine out of 12 Bitcoin funds saw net inflows yesterday, with $477.2 million added to the funds. BlackRock’s IBIT led the way with $210.9 million in inflows with Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB reporting $162.8 million in inflows, and Fidelity’s FBTC recording $34.15 million. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $7.41 billion worth of total trade volume on Tuesday, aligning with the volume recorded this month. Trading volumes have ranged between $5 billion and $9.78 billion in October, significantly higher than the average of $2-$4 billion recorded last month. While commenting on the market conditions, Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said, Yesterday’s return to net positive flows signals a potential stabilization in institutional sentiment after recent volatility, suggesting renewed confidence in crypto as a portfolio diversifier amid economic uncertainties. The surge in monthly trading volumes over the past month marks an uptick in institutional engagement, which delivers deeper liquidity and risk appetite as traditional investors increasingly allocate to digital assets for yield and hedging opportunities. The analyst added that the demand for gold has peaked, which could see investors seek alternative risk-adjusted opportunities in crypto. As such, Ruck expects Bitcoin’s price to appreciate in the near to medium term. Bitcoin faces rejection around $114K Bitcoin failed to overcome the major resistance level at $114K on Tuesday despite recording excellent gains. It faced a rejection above $113K and has now dropped to the $108K region once again. The BTC/USD 4-hour chart remains bearish as the cryptocurrency failed to build on its recent momentum. It has found strong support around the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $106,453 and could bounce back despite the messy price action. At press time, BTC is trading at $108,163 per coin. If Bitcoin fails to build on its momentum, it could dip toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $106,453. The daily candle closing below this level could extend its bearish run toward the October 10 low of $102,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart reads 54, above the neutral level, and indicates that the bullish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also showed a bullish crossover earlier this week which remains in effect further supporting a bullish bounce. If the bulls take control of the market, Bitcoin could extend its gains toward the 50-day EMA at $113,608 over the next few hours.

Takaichi was elected as Japan’s first female prime minister on Tuesday, October 21. As her first move, she intends to create an economic relief package, but has not specified the exact size of the package or whether additional bonds would need to be issued for funding. The only thing recently reported was that the prime minister ordered a supplementary budget to support these measures. Takaichi, a fiscal dove who pledged to close the gender gap at politics’s highest echelons, has also completed arrangements for Satsuki Katayama to become Japan’s first finance minister as a woman, bringing in an establishment figure at an unpredictable time of high prices and low growth. Takaichi changes her views to fight inflation in Japan While more details of the new package of economic measures are set to be made public later, sources have highlighted that her instruction hints at including subsidies for winter electricity and gas bills, as well as local grants to help ease the burden of rising prices in the package. Additionally, analysts have pointed out that the package encourages small and medium-sized firms to raise wages and invest more. Interestingly, the order does not mention any cash payment. Regarding this discovery, reliable sources shared an analysis revealing that cash payments received little public approval during the national election campaign held in July. After being elected, Takaichi closely examined Japan’s economic status and challenges. Based on her argument, she pointed out the cost-of-living crisis as a key economic concern. This demonstrated her awareness of public worries about inflation. Moreover, her order illustrated that she preferred strategic actions over a wide spending initiative. Reports also mentioned that the prime minister has a history of advocating for strong monetary and fiscal stimulus. However, it is worth noting that Takaichi recently adjusted her perspective. Now, she promises to focus on fiscal policies that are both growth-oriented and responsible. What has triggered her shift in views is the urgency to balance improving the economy with the need to address Japan’s substantial public debt, which has led to an increase in long-term bond yields. Japan plans to invest $550 billion in the US in exchange for reduced tariffs Data shows that consumer inflation has remained at or above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target for over three years. At the same time, the central bank has gradually increased interest rates, which has consequently raised the government’s borrowing cost. In response to this, Takaichi released a statement on Tuesday this week expressing hope that inflation will be demand-driven as wages hike, rather than being caused by higher costs. She also pointed out that the upcoming package will focus on enhancing economic security and defense. According to the Prime Minister, the package involves plans to invest in critical areas, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, as well as efforts to strengthen supply chains for key products. It will also respond to the US tariffs by enacting an investment plan already announced with Washington. Therefore, as part of it, Japan plans to spend $550 billion in core areas in the US in exchange for reduced tariffs. Get seen where it counts.

The estimated annual recurring expense ratio stands at 1.99%, and the ETF is not expected to distribute dividends to investors. China Asset Management (Hong Kong), one of the city’s largest fund managers, already operates Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. Its latest Solana product marks the first time a SOL-based fund has been offered in both Asia and the US.

Solana ETF Approvals Accelerate Globally As US Regulators Clear 21Shares Product Meanwhile, Solana’s global ETF momentum has gained pace. The 21Shares Solana Spot ETF in the US received approval earlier this month following clearance of its Form 8-A filing with the SEC, allowing it to custody SOL and trade on a major American exchange. The product provides direct exposure to Solana’s spot price and would potentially include staking features, which could drive institutional demand. Forecasts suggest the token could rally toward $300 if investor interest continues to rise. Several other issuers, including VanEck, Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares, have also received approval for Solana spot ETF proposals, with listings expected to follow soon after.

In July, SpaceX conducted a similar movement, later identified by Arkham Intelligence as linked to Coinbase Prime Custody, a storage service used by institutions for cold-wallet restructuring. That earlier transfer triggered waves of concern in the market, with many assuming SpaceX was liquidating Bitcoin holdings. However, blockchain data later confirmed it was an internal movement, not a market sale. This week’s pattern looks strikingly similar. Remaining Holdings Still Substantial Despite the recent transfer, SpaceX still holds a massive 5,790 BTC, valued at around $624 million based on current prices. As of today, Bitcoin (BTC) trades near $53,870, according to CoinMarketCap, reflecting a modest uptick amid broader market stabilization. If all current holdings were to move, it could exert short-term pressure on liquidity, but the lack of further exchange deposits so far signals no immediate sell intent.

The company reportedly purchased hundreds of millions worth of BTC in 2021, around the same period Tesla announced its own exposure. These recent transactions rekindle curiosity about corporate Bitcoin strategies as institutions quietly accumulate or reorganize holdings amid market volatility. The aerospace firm’s decision to move funds right as Bitcoin consolidates could reflect custodial optimization, a security upgrade, or preparation for new asset management infrastructure. So far, neither SpaceX nor CEO Elon Musk has commented on the transfer. Broader On-Chain Trend: Long-Term Holders Distribute While SpaceX moves make headlines, another on-chain story unfolds behind the scenes. According to @glassnode, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs) have increased their selling pace over the past few weeks, contributing to growing market distribution pressure. Data shows LTH supply declined by 28,000 BTC since October 15th, meaning these older investors have spent more coins than the amount “aging” into long-term status from short-term holders. This shift signals active net distribution, not just passive maturation, a sign that even long-standing holders are trimming exposure amid uncertain price action. Long-Term Holders Continue to Distribute ""Adding to the market’s inability to sustain its euphoric phase, the persistent Long-Term Holder (LTH) distribution since July 2025 has further constrained upside momentum."" — Week On-Chain 41 Updated charts from our recent… https://t.co/i4RVxoBUbv — glassnode (@glassnode) October 21, 2025 Outflows Accelerate to Multi-Month High The 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of LTH outflows has climbed sharply. What began as an average of around 12,500 BTC/day in early July has now surged to 22,500 BTC/day, marking nearly an 80% rise in long-term selling pressure. This kind of distribution typically happens near cycle transitions, when investors take profit or rebalance portfolios after extended accumulation phases. Despite this, on-chain analysts suggest the broader structure of Bitcoin ownership remains resilient, with exchange reserves continuing to trend lower, meaning fewer coins are being kept on trading platforms. Market Reactions Stay Muted Interestingly, the market’s immediate reaction to SpaceX’s transfer was limited. The muted response may reflect how better blockchain transparency and smarter investor sentiment have evolved over time, a sharp contrast to earlier years when institutional wallet movements caused panic. Traders now distinguish between custodial reorganization and real exchange deposits, minimizing false alarms. Context: Bitcoin’s Institutional Narrative SpaceX’s continued on-chain presence reinforces how Bitcoin remains intertwined with corporate balance sheets, especially among U.S. tech giants. Though Musk has remained quiet about crypto since 2022, both Tesla and SpaceX have reportedly maintained partial exposure. These holdings reflect a broader shift in corporate treasury management, as Bitcoin matures into a macro hedge asset comparable to gold. With inflation concerns persisting and global liquidity tightening, even modest institutional allocations can drive substantial market impact. Analysts: Watch for Confirmation For now, all indicators suggest no direct selling pressure from SpaceX. Still, analysts will be watching Coinbase and other major exchanges for any subsequent inflows from the same wallets, a telltale sign of potential liquidation. If funds remain idle, it strengthens the case that this is an internal storage adjustment, not an exit. @ai_9684xtpa noted in their X post that the timing and structure of the transfer mimic July’s pattern almost exactly, adding that SpaceX may be migrating funds to “new custody architecture.” Meanwhile, the LTH behavior shift could act as a short-term dampener on price momentum. Excessive distribution from older wallets tends to increase market supply, especially during low-volume phases. However, as seen in past cycles, this type of spending can also signal early re-accumulation phases, when smart money sells into strength before repositioning at lower levels. If demand from ETFs and institutional desks persists, that new supply could be absorbed quickly. Conclusion: Quiet but Significant SpaceX’s $268 million Bitcoin movement might seem like routine bookkeeping, but its timing and scale underscore how deeply institutional adoption has embedded into crypto’s core infrastructure. At the same time, rising long-term holder activity adds a new dimension to the market, a subtle tug-of-war between old money taking profit and new capital entering through custodians and funds. For now, Bitcoin’s on-chain story continues to evolve quietly but steadily.

The issuer of the world’s largest USD-pegged stablecoin, @Tether_to, announced that its user base has officially surpassed 500 million. “USDT reached officially 500 million users,” said CEO @paoloardoino in a post on X. “Likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history.” The statement underscores a major shift in how stablecoins are shaping digital finance, moving beyond crypto trading desks and deep into the global economy. USDT Dominates Stablecoin Market According to CoinMarketCap, $USDT remains the world’s leading stablecoin by market capitalization, now nearing $182 billion in total supply. That’s more than double its closest competitor, $USDC, issued by @circle, which currently holds about $75 billion in circulation. This dominance gives Tether roughly 69% market share in the stablecoin sector, a clear reflection of its unmatched scale and liquidity. Tether USDT reached officially 500 million users! Likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history. https://t.co/jbmnMDwidi — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) October 21, 2025 Deployed Across 14 Blockchains Part of Tether’s success comes from its multi-chain strategy. The stablecoin is now deployed across 14 blockchains, including major ecosystems like Ethereum, Tron, and Solana. This multi-network expansion boosts USDT’s accessibility and trading utility. Whether in centralized exchanges or DeFi protocols, USDT functions as a universal bridge asset, offering frictionless movement of capital across blockchains. Meanwhile, USDC has taken a more regulated and compliance-driven route, appealing to institutional users but trailing Tether in raw scale and adoption. The announcement arrives as the broader crypto market shows signs of stabilization. This period of relative calm has encouraged traders and institutions to increase exposure to digital assets again. Stablecoins like USDT play a vital role in this environment, serving as a liquidity engine for both spot and derivatives markets. As market sentiment recovers, Tether’s continued expansion could inject additional liquidity into the system, helping boost trading volumes and short-term capital inflows. Institutional Demand Rises For Tether Institutional investors are increasingly turning to USDT as a secure entry point into crypto markets. From hedge funds to OTC desks, the token’s deep liquidity and global reach make it an essential component in portfolio allocation. Tether’s near-instant settlement capabilities also make it attractive for cross-border settlements and on-chain remittances. The company’s focus on real-world utility has kept USDT relevant even as new competitors emerge. But Tether’s rapid ascent hasn’t gone unnoticed by regulators. The company continues to face scrutiny over reserve transparency and auditing practices. Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are reportedly reviewing the stablecoin sector more closely as global adoption accelerates. Still, Tether’s latest disclosures have improved investor confidence. In Q2 2024, the company reported $1.3 billion in profits and $11.9 billion in net equity. Those figures strengthen its position as the most profitable entity in the digital asset space, rivaling even some traditional financial institutions. Global Inclusion at the Core While Western markets debate regulation, Tether’s real impact is unfolding in developing economies. Across Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, millions rely on USDT to bypass unstable local currencies, reduce remittance costs, and access a digital savings alternative. For many, USDT isn’t just a trading tool, it’s a financial lifeline. In Venezuela, Nigeria, and Argentina, it has become a practical hedge against inflation and an accessible digital dollar for day-to-day transactions. Tether’s grassroots strategy—empowering local fintech startups, exchanges, and payment apps—continues to cement its reputation as the most widely used stablecoin in emerging markets. Expanding Beyond Finance Tether’s ambitions now stretch beyond stablecoins. The company has invested in Bitcoin mining operations and renewable energy projects, signaling a diversified long-term strategy. These moves align with CEO Paolo Ardoino’s broader vision: to make Tether not only a global financial connector but also a tech and infrastructure powerhouse supporting blockchain adoption at scale. This diversification could insulate Tether from regulatory risks while reinforcing its ecosystem presence, spanning payments, energy, and decentralized infrastructure. Despite the achievements, analysts warn that depegging risks remain part of Tether’s long-term challenge. Past events, like the 2018 issuance surge, briefly triggered volatility in USDT’s price stability. However, current market data shows USDT trading consistently near $1, with negligible deviations across major exchanges. That stability, combined with strong liquidity and transparent reporting, continues to anchor market trust. Setting the Pace for the Industry Tether’s 500 million user milestone reflects more than corporate success, it’s a testament to how stablecoins are reshaping financial systems worldwide. The achievement hints at a new era of digital inclusion, where individuals from remote or unbanked regions can access a global financial network without needing traditional banking infrastructure. Tether’s story mirrors a broader industry trend: the steady rise of DeFi, Web3, and stable-value assets as the foundation for future digital economies. As the crypto industry matures, the line between digital and traditional finance continues to blur, and Tether stands at the center of that evolution.

According to top crypto researcher SMQKE, this move positions Ripple at the heart of discussions surrounding faster, more efficient financial transactions, a space historically dominated by traditional banking institutions. The Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force, established to explore ways to accelerate U.S. payments, brings together banks, fintech firms, and payment innovators. Ripple’s inclusion underscores its rising credibility as a solution capable of bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology. With its real-time gross settlement system, RippleNet, and the digital asset XRP, the company has long promised faster cross-border payments at lower costs, and now it has a direct line to influence policy and implementation. Therefore, Ripple’s role on the task force goes beyond symbolism. By providing expertise on blockchain integration, payment efficiencies, and regulatory compliance, it helps shape standards that could favor blockchain solutions, marking a pivotal moment for digital assets gaining legitimacy alongside traditional finance. XRP Eyes $4 Breakout XRP is back in the spotlight as top on-chain and technical analyst Steph Is Crypto signals a potential repeat of its 2024 price trajectory, pointing to a possible $4 breakout. Steph’s analysis on X, formerly Twitter, highlights a bull flag, compressed volatility, and key on-chain indicators that have historically preceded major XRP moves. Notably, Steph’s analysis overlays the current weekly structure on the 2024 setup, highlighting a sustained support trendline, tightening price action, and flag-like consolidation. If momentum pushes the breakout higher, XRP could target $4–$5, aligning with independent crypto coverage that spots $3–$4 as a key liquidity zone for further gains. A key insight in Steph’s thesis is liquidity mechanics, whereby clusters of sell and stop orders above recent highs can fuel rapid price moves. Traders anticipate that sweeping these offers, followed by strong buying, can drive momentum toward round targets like $4, explaining how the bull-flag may trigger a real breakout. Conclusion Ripple’s position on the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee is more than symbolic, it signals leadership in the evolution of digital finance. As blockchain shifts from innovation’s edge to the heart of global payments, Ripple stands poised to shape the future of money movement. Meanwhile, XRP’s current setup echoes the same technical rhythm that powered its 2024 rally, only now, the stakes are higher and market attention is sharper. According to Steph Is Crypto, the fusion of on-chain strength and classic chart structure points to one conclusion: a $4 breakout may be closer than many expect.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-22 07:21:34

Kalshi and Polymarket just posted record-shattering numbers in the third quarter of 2025, with over $3 billion in notional volume, more than five times what they saw this time last year. The mania has topped even the madness of the 2024 US presidential election, and the surge has Wall Street’s CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange pushing their way in. According to data from Bloomberg, both platforms crossed $2 billion in the week ending October 19, the most they’ve ever seen. The rally was mainly driven by a wave of sports betting, mostly through New York‑based Kalshi, which used its federal license to offer bets nationwide, ignoring state gambling regulators. Kalshi’s contract volumes surged after football season kicked off in August and September, and users flooded in, especially retail traders from Robinhood, thanks to a new partnership. On the other side, Polymarket, still closed to US traders after infamous fights with regulators, saw a similar jump in traffic as crypto degens and political bettors found new events to bet on. Kalshi leverages Robinhood crowd as football spikes trading Football bets dominated the week of October 19, pulling in $867 million on Kalshi and $415 million on Polymarket. Kalshi gained an edge by offering parlays, allowing users to bet on several low-odds events at once. In prediction markets, every contract pays either $0 or $1 when the event ends. Dune Analytics user dunedata tracked the public numbers, counting only one side of each trade to make the two exchanges comparable. Kalshi’s data came from its own filings, which spokesperson Claire McManus confirmed were accurate. Meanwhile, Polymarket’s data was gotten from its public blockchain, after Rachel Lowe, speaking on behalf of the team, called the data there “the best available publicly,” while adding that there are “always nuances to it.” The last time volumes were this high was during the 2024 presidential election, when Kalshi won a court case against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That win let Kalshi legally host contracts on the election outcome. Both Kalshi and Polymarket had bettors giving Donald Trump high odds of winning. Since his return to the White House, Trump and his circle have thrown their weight behind the industry. His son, Donald Trump Jr., now serves as an adviser to both platforms. Polymarket reclaims lead as ICE and CME pile in In August, Kalshi briefly overtook Polymarket in overall trading volume thanks to sports. But Polymarket snatched back the lead last week after doubling its sports-related volume. While Kalshi rode a regulated edge in the U.S., Polymarket stayed outside the country due to previous legal clashes. That’s changing. Polymarket just bought QCX, a CFTC‑licensed derivatives exchange, a move that sets them up for a return to the U.S. market. Wall Street wants in. ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion for a stake in Polymarket. CME Group is now planning to roll out contracts tied to sports games. These moves are coming even as DraftKings and FanDuel-owner Flutter Entertainment see their shares slide. Their platforms still depend on state-by-state gambling licenses, while Kalshi’s federal license gives it wider access, though not without heat. Several state regulators are now trying to shut Kalshi down, saying its bets violate state gaming laws. Kalshi is fighting those cases in court. As McManus put it, “We’re federally regulated. That’s what matters.” On October 18, during a rush of college football bets, users trading on Kalshi reported platform issues. McManus admitted the site faced “data loading delays due to extreme demand” but said trading continued on the backend without disruption. She added that the issue was resolved quickly.

With bullish sentiment slowly returning, XRP, Solana (SOL), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as the top crypto assets set to outperform in the next market leg. XRP continues to impress with its expanding use cases in cross-border payments, while Solana maintains momentum as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains powering next-generation dApps. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning heads among early investors. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already raised over $17.75 million, with more than 70% of phase 6 sold out at $0.035 per token. Its innovative dual-lending DeFi model, blending Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems, has analysts calling it one of the top cryptos to invest in now, a project combining utility, innovation, and early-stage upside ahead of the next bull cycle. Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: Accumulation Signals Hint at Possible Breakout Ripple (XRP) is giving clear signals of accumulation, with the majority of wallets holding over 10,000 XRP ever. Technical indicators indicate XRP is about to experience a possible breakout above the resistance level of $2.48 because weakening bearish momentum in the RSI and MACD indicates the trend reversal in the not-too-distant past. Investors tracking XRP’s accumulation are gearing up for the potential upside, and while the market waits for the confirmation of the breakout, most investors are also watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) get popular among innovative crypto traders in anticipation of the impending market cycle. XRP continues to attract attention as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for those seeking strong growth potential, positioning itself among the top crypto assets in the market. Solana (SOL) Price Forecast: Attempt at Recovery Solana (SOL) recently peaked at nearly $253 before going into a steady downtrend following a strong bullish trend. Currently trading at around $186, the market is attempting a pullback, testing buyer appetite at this price level. If there is a reversal of momentum, SOL can regain ground towards the $200 level but rejection here can push the price to the $170 support level. Technicals indicate that as long as SOL is held above key levels, the market is still ready for a potential recovery. While investors wait and observe SOL’s next direction, other investors are also looking into fresh opportunity within the DeFi sector, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is increasingly popular with the approach of the next market cycle. Many analysts now consider Mutuum Finance among the top crypto picks for the year, making it a contender for the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Mutuum Finance Hits New High in Presale Mutuum Finance is on the lists of some of the latest and most promising cryptos to invest in currently. Its presale burns day and night with more than 17,340 people involved and investing in excess of $17.75 million to date. The token is currently being sold at its lowest of $0.035 on presale stage 6. The initiative is also generating buzz with its leaderboard reward interactivity, with the investing public being given a 24/7 chance at community participation. The top investors bought $7,036 and $6,619 of MUTM tokens in the last 24 hours, reflecting high demand and increasing optimism. Daily rewards include a $500 bonus to the largest buyer of MUTM, stimulating members to buy a minimum of one lot every 24 hours to be eligible for a ticket. Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be the best cryptocurrency to invest in, attracting early adopters who want a piece of the next top crypto project. Lending and Borrowing Protocol on the Horizon Mutuum Finance will roll out its lending and borrowing protocol as a flagship DeFi project. Version 1 (V1) will be accessible on the Sepolia Testnet later this year, featuring basic functions such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. XRP, Solana, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are on top of the crypto pack before November 2025. XRP accounts with 10,000+ tokens reach new highs, showing potential to break through $2.48. Solana probes support at $186, possible upside to $200 if the steam can restore. Mutuum Finance on the other hand has reached more than $17.75 million in presale, 70% of Phase 6 sold at $0.035 per token. Early adopters are getting a $500 MUTM bonus per day, which also reflects high demand. Secure your position now by participating in the presale of Mutuum Finance and exploring its upcoming DeFi lending protocol, cementing its status as a top crypto.

Key Takeaways: MetaMask, Phantom, and other major wallets have partnered with SEAL to launch a global phishing defense network. The new system enables anyone to submit verifiable phishing reports, which are instantly validated and shared across all participating wallets. Phishing remains the leading cause of crypto losses in 2025, with over $400 million stolen in the first half of the year. In a joint initiative with the Security Alliance (SEAL) , the wallets have launched what they call a global phishing defense network, designed to build a “decentralized immune system” capable of identifying and neutralizing threats in real time. The system links major wallet providers including MetaMask, Phantom, WalletConnect, and Backpack, creating an information-sharing network that flags malicious websites and phishing attempts as they appear. SEAL Launches Verifiable Phishing Report System to Boost Crypto Wallet Security SEAL said the new setup will allow anyone from anywhere in the world to submit verifiable phishing reports, which will then be automatically validated and broadcast across all participating wallets. “This means quicker response times to new phishing threats and more funds saved,” the organization noted. The defense effort builds on SEAL’s recently announced “verifiable phishing reports” tool, which lets security researchers prove that a reported website actually hosts phishing content. By pairing this system with the new wallet network, SEAL aims to prevent future mass-draining incidents before they spread across the ecosystem. We’ve joined forces to launch a global phishing defense network that can protect more users across the entire ecosystem. Security gets stronger when we work together. https://t.co/Ah8RuiTQ6D — MetaMask.eth (@MetaMask) October 21, 2025 Phishing scams, particularly those involving crypto drainers, have become increasingly sophisticated. Attackers now rotate landing pages faster when blocklists update, migrate to offshore servers when providers intervene, and use cloaking methods to evade automated detection systems. “Drainers are a constant cat-and-mouse game,” said Ohm Shah, a security researcher at MetaMask. Partnering with SEAL, he added, allows wallet developers to move faster and “throw a wrench at the drainer’s infra.” The collaboration creates an end-to-end reporting pipeline that automatically validates user reports and circulates alerts across all connected wallets. SEAL emphasized its goal is to extend the system to as many wallets as possible to maximize coverage. According to CertiK, phishing remains the top cause of crypto-related losses in 2025, accounting for over $400 million in stolen funds during the first half of the year alone. Crypto Hacks Cause $127M in Losses in September Crypto-related hacks caused $127.06 million in losses in September 2025, marking a 22% decline from August’s $163 million, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield. The month saw nearly 20 major exploits, with incidents heavily concentrated in just a few large-scale attacks. Despite the drop, industry experts emphasized that DeFi and blockchain platforms remain highly vulnerable to security breaches. The two biggest hacks involved UXLINK and SwissBorg, accounting for a combined $85 million. UXLINK lost $44.14 million after its multisig wallet was exploited, leading to the unauthorized minting of 10 trillion tokens and a 90% crash in its token price. SwissBorg suffered a $41.5 million loss in Solana after hackers breached its API partner, Kiln. Both companies are working with exchanges, law enforcement, and white-hat hackers for damage control and user compensation. Other incidents included a $13.5 million phishing attack on a Venus Protocol user, of which $13 million was recovered, and additional smaller exploits targeting platforms like Yala, GriffAI, and Shibarium Bridge.

On October 21, XRP ($XRP) rose above $2.50, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, rebounding from an intraday low of $2.40 — a price action that reflects improving investor confidence in altcoins amid recent market volatility. Traders are closely watching for a daily close above $2.50 to confirm recovery momentum, with the next resistance range between $2.61 and $2.71 . A breakout above the resistance range could be the harbinger of a bullish phase. In another positive development, the $XRP derivatives market is also stabilizing, as the Futures Open Interest (OI) has recovered to $3.8B from $3.5B on Sunday. Rising OI indicates more investors are opening positions, yet another sign of renewed market participation. Looking back, the last OI peak occurred in mid-July, right after $XRP hit $3.66. Comparing that pattern with the current one, sustained OI increases often precede strong price rallies. While the $XRP price action looks broadly positive, its funding rate suggests a short bias. Case in point, the OI-weighted funding rate dropped from 0.0068% to 0.0038%, indicating a neutral to bullish sentiment. Moreover, technicals don’t lie — here’s what they’re flashing: $XRP is sticking close to $2.50, marking its fourth consecutive day of gains since Friday’s dip to $2.18 — signaling sustained price recovery, less likely for another sharp correction. The MACD (12,26) is at −0.13043 (the blue line crosses above the red line). A crossover often precedes upward momentum, indicating an early price recovery zone. The 200-day EMA is currently at $2.61, marking the first significant resistance, followed by $2.70. If the bulls manage to push the token above $2.70, it may validate a bullish breakout, setting the stage for a rally toward $3. As $XRP hints at a potential bullish phase for altcoins, investors are looking for the next crypto to explode to redirect their funds while the market regains momentum.

Analyst Gives Date for “Major Catch-Up Rally”,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-next-for-bitcoin-in-the-coming-days-analyst-gives-date-for-major-catch-up-rally/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Colin Talks Crypto has shared a noteworthy assessment of Bitcoin’s (BTC) current price movements. According to the analyst, while gold is closing the gap with the global money supply (Global M2), Bitcoin has not yet followed suit, but looking at past examples, it appears that BTC usually follows gold with a lag. Colin made the following statement: “There will soon be a period where gold and Global M2 overlap, suggesting that Bitcoin could make a strong catch-up move.” According to the analyst, there are four main reasons supporting this view: Gold narrowed the gap with Global M2. Bitcoin typically lags behind gold's gains. The BTC/Gold chart looks set for an upside breakout. A one-month “overlap period” is approaching, where gold and Global M2 rise simultaneously, increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin experiencing similar momentum. Related News: Solana (SOL) Makes Unexpected Early Announcement - May Upset Users Colin Talks Crypto argued that Bitcoin could outperform gold in the coming weeks, claiming that the possible rise could begin as early as the first week of November: “I think Bitcoin could start its steepest rally around November 8th. This move could last 1-2 months. Of course, timing is always the hardest part, so it's worth leaving some room.” The analyst also reminded that he does not expect Bitcoin to completely align with Global M2, as in past cycles this correlation has always been broken during peak periods. *This is not investment advice.

The recovery came with a huge asterisk though; exports to the U.S. cratered by 13.3%, dragging down momentum just as other Asian markets picked up steam. Demand from Asia rose 9.2% compared to the same month last year, with China leading the charge. Shipments to the mainland, still Japan’s biggest trade partner, jumped by 5.8%, offering some cushion for the blow from the American drop. The semiconductor industry did most of the heavy lifting. Chip exports were up 12.6% by value from a year ago, giving tech players a reason to breathe. But auto shipments, the backbone of Japan’s trade with the US, got hammered again. In September, vehicle exports to America fell by 24.2%, a hit, but slightly better than the 28.4% decline recorded in August. This freefall is largely due to the tariff war with Washington, which is still messing with the country’s most valuable export lanes. Tokyo slashes tariffs but U.S. buyers still pull back Back in July, the Japanese government reached an agreement with the White House, slashing the originally proposed 25% tariffs on exports down to 15%. That lower rate took effect on August 7, but it hasn’t helped much so far. The damage had already soaked into the system by then. The export drop to the United States , Japan’s second-largest customer, wiped out any benefit expected from cheaper goods. Imports didn’t sit still either. They reversed direction with a 3.3% gain in September after falling 5.2% in August. That beat the 0.6% growth forecast by economists polled by Reuters, with businesses restocking energy and machinery goods that had taken a hit earlier this year. Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist and research head at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, said that the numbers aren’t as great as they look. “Exports are not as strong as they appear on the surface,” Hirofumi said, pointing to the low base effect from last year. He also warned that the ongoing tensions between Washington and Beijing were making future trade unpredictable. Takaichi takes office as weak yen lifts Nikkei, clouds fiscal outlook The trade data landed one day after Sanae Takaichi took office as Japan’s first female prime minister, replacing Shigeru Ishiba after months of chaos inside the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The new leader has promised a massive fiscal spending plan paired with easy monetary policy, two things investors have already priced in. They’re calling it the “Takaichi trade.” Since she took over the LDP in September, the Nikkei 225 has been flying, reaching record highs this week. The yen has dropped below 150 to the dollar, down from 147 in the same month last year. But Hirofumi isn’t sold on FX doing much heavy lifting for exports anymore. “Even though the yen was at quite weak levels against the U.S. dollar last year, we have yet to see a significant surge in exports. Policy factors such as tariffs seem to have a larger impact than FX on exports,” he added. Investors have been watching the numbers closely after Japan’s economy did better than expected in the second quarter. GDP was revised up to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter from an earlier estimate of 0.3%, blowing past the 0.1% growth analysts expected. Eyes are now on the Bank of Japan , which most economists think will raise its key interest rate to 0.75% sometime this quarter. In the Reuters poll taken between October 14 and 20, 60% of those surveyed (45 of 75) predicted a hike either in October or December. By March, 96% of economists expect borrowing costs to reach at least 0.75%. Out of 35 economists who gave a specific month, 46% pointed to January, 31% to December, and 14% to October. The rate path is now a key question mark as Takaichi’s economic policies take shape. She’s promised to boost government spending in essential sectors like energy and national security under what she’s calling “responsible, proactive fiscal policies.” But nobody knows what that really means yet. In an extra question in the same Reuters survey, 67% of respondents, 18 of 27, said they couldn’t say if they supported or opposed her plan. Meanwhile, 17 out of 26 said they’re worried about what this means for Japan’s already fragile fiscal health.

New Bitcoin Whales Have Dived Underwater In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed about the latest trend in the profit-loss situation of the short-term holder Bitcoin whales. The “short-term holders” (STHs) broadly refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Related Reading: Chainlink To $100? Analyst Says This Breakout Could Be The Trigger The STH whales (or “new whales”) are the holders with 1,000+ BTC (equivalent to $110.8 million at the current exchange rate) who got into the market during the last five months. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the net unrealized profit/loss held by the STH whales over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH whales have seen their profit-loss balance lean heavily into the underwater territory following the recent bearish wave in the cryptocurrency’s price. This means that the members of this cohort are now carrying a heavy amount of net loss. More specifically, the STH whales are holding about $6.95 billion in unrealized loss, which is the largest for the group since October 2023, about two years ago. This indicates significant pressure among big-money investors, especially considering that the STHs control a notable chunk of the whale Realized Cap. The Realized Cap is an indicator that basically measures the total amount of capital that Bitcoin investors have put into the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap of the new whales, in particular, corresponds to the big-money capital that came into the network during the past 155 days. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the new whales today control around 45% of the total whale Realized Cap, which is a new record. Considering that the cohort as a whole is underwater, this capital is naturally being held at a net loss now. The recent growth in the Realized Cap of the STH whales has come as the long-term holders (LTHs), covering investors with a holding time greater than the STH upper limit of 155 days, have been participating in distribution. Related Reading: Ethereum Death Cross That Last Preceded A 60% Drop Just Returned As the chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn shows, 337,300 BTC has exited the wallets of the Bitcoin LTHs over the last 30 days. So far, new capital has been coming in to absorb this selloff from the HODLers, but with the STH whales now under pressure, demand for the cryptocurrency may be starting to weaken. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $111,000, down 1.7% over the last week.

The firm made its first ETH purchase since August 2025, acquiring another 19,271 ETH at an average purchase price of $3,892 per ETH. SharpLink Increases Ethereum Holdings To $3.5 Billion Minneapolis-based SharpLink Gaming today announced that it had increased its total ETH holdings by 19,271 ETH. The firm’s total ETH holdings now stand at 859,853 ETH, valued at almost $3.5 billion. The company disclosed that it raised $76.5 million in gross proceeds last week, excluding placement agent fees and other related expenses. These proceeds were used to finance the latest ETH purchase. Commenting, Joseph Chalom, co-founder of SharpLink Gaming, said: Our top priority remains creating value for shareholders through disciplined execution and a relentless focus on accretive ETH accumulation. The capital raise completed last week was executed at a premium to NAV. Shortly thereafter, we took advantage of attractive market conditions to acquire ETH at prices lower than when we raised the capital. This sequence was immediately accretive to shareholders and showcases the precision of our strategy. The Nasdaq-listed firm also shared that its total ETH staking rewards had increased to 5,671. To recall, SharpLink Gaming had started its ETH-focused corporate treasury strategy in June 2025. The company also reported a 100% increase in Etheruem Concentration. The metric surged to 4.0, up 100% since June 2025. For the uninitiated, Ethereum concentration measures how much ether SharpLink holds per 1,000 assumed diluted shares, offering insight into the company’s crypto exposure relative to its total potential equity base. It’s calculated by dividing total ETH holdings (including LsETH) by all issued and potentially issuable shares, without using the treasury stock method or accounting for vesting or conversion restrictions. Following today’s announcement, SharpLink Gaming’s stock SBET is down 2.64%, trading at $14.40 at the time of writing. The stock is up more than 440% over the past six months. ETH Taking The Limelight From Other Crypto 2025 has seen an unprecedented growth in the number of firms adopting a crypto-focused corporate treasury strategy, not just limited to leading digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), or ETH. For instance, NYSE-listed CleanCore Solutions recently announced that its Dogecoin (DOGE) treasury had topped 710 million DOGE. The firm has an aim of adding 1 billion DOGE to its balance sheet. That said, the rate of Ethereum adoption has surpassed all other digital assets – including BTC – throughout the year. Recently, Ethereum whale BitMine purchased another 203,800 ETH, effectively owning 2.7% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. At press time, ETH trades at $3,988, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|BitMine|blockchain|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum Adoption|ETHUSDT|Sharplink Gaming,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-22 08:00:39

The USDT issuer has minted an additional $1 billion USDT over the last 8 hours. The surge in stablecoin activity suggests that key players, such as Tether and Circle, are stepping in to stabilize liquidity after the October 11 (1011) crypto market crash. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by market cap, often mints large amounts of USDT to meet demand, with its latest mint suggesting a strong need for stable liquidity during periods of market distress. Increased stablecoin mint helps soften blow of market crashes Tether( @Tether_to ) just minted 1B $USDT again 6 hours ago! #Tether and #Circle have minted $7B in stablecoins after the 1011 market crash. https://t.co/bcw2rlrHIw pic.twitter.com/yb6OxxU28z — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 22, 2025 The $7 billion minted by Tether and Circle reflects growing confidence in the resilience of the crypto market. The increase in capital from stablecoins is typically used for initiatives that help mitigate the impact of market crashes, such as buying dips, hedging, or providing exchange liquidity. The large-scale stablecoin mints by Tether and Circle also indicate bullish signals, suggesting that both stablecoin issuers are preparing for increased market activity in the aftermath of the crash. The move is considered institutional preparation for high-volume trading or potential market rebounds. Konstantin Vasilenko, co-founder of Paybis, spoke with TheStreet Roundtable and said stablecoins are at the center of the shift from speculation to utility in crypto adoption. He also acknowledged that stablecoins are transforming how companies transact globally. “We all thought that Bitcoin would become digital cash back in the day. It became digital gold. So stablecoin is now digital cash, more or less.” – Konstantin Vasileko , Co-Founder of Paybis. Vasilenko said stablecoin adoption will require businesses to adopt dollar-backed digital assets, allowing retail to start using them. He also noted that stablecoin transactions are increasingly used in payments rather than trading. Vasilenko revealed that the daily volumes of stablecoins used in trading are now very close to stablecoins used by businesses in payments. He said it means stablecoins are currently being adopted as a medium of payment. Despite the increased minting of stablecoins, the International Monetary Fund warned earlier this month that the stablecoin market could become a source of systemic risk. The fund acknowledged in its latest Financial Stability Report that stablecoins have ballooned in scale and influence. However, the IMF warned that a drop in stablecoin confidence could lead to the liquidation of reserve assets, potentially causing ripples through bank deposits, government bonds, and repo markets, which might compel central banks to intervene to stabilize conditions. The Fund also believes that the adoption of stablecoins could limit central banks’ ability to control inflation or liquidity, as dollar-backed digital assets may compete with national currencies. The IMF noted that Ethena, the world’s third-largest stablecoin, had briefly lost its dollar peg during the 1011 crash. The Financial Stability Board promised to maintain tighter oversight, reiterating similar concerns from the European Central Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, which signals that stablecoins are nearing adoption in the global financial system. Standard Chartered believes stablecoins pose a risk to financial institutions Standard Chartered also revealed earlier this month that a surge in stablecoin use could drain as much as $1 trillion from emerging market banks over the next three years. Analysts Geoff Kendrick and Madhur Jhar wrote that dollar-backed digital assets are offering developing economies an alternative to local banks, thereby accelerating a post-financial crisis shift of core banking functions into the non-bank sector. StanChart revealed that stablecoin adoption has increased in countries with weak currencies and high inflation, including Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, where deposit flight risks are acute. The bank also stated that stablecoins attract users who prioritize capital preservation, even without offering yields, which is now also barred under the U.S. GENIUS Act. Standard Chartered predicts the stablecoin market could surge to $2 trillion by 2028. The bank also believes that two-thirds of the increase will come from emerging markets.

In an interview shared by crypto commentator Bale (@AltcoinBale), Garlinghouse said, “Anyone who thinks that Ripple is not 100% behind XRP is just missing. They have lost the plot. We are totally committed and will remain totally committed.” These comments come at a time when renewed attention is being placed on Ripple’s relationship with XRP and its continued expansion into the global financial ecosystem. While many projects in the digital asset space change strategies, Ripple’s leadership continues to closely tie its growth prospects to XRP’s adoption and functionality as a bridge currency . BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! CEO of @Ripple – Brad Garlinghouse says: “Anyone thinks that Ripple is not 100% behind #XRP is just missing. They have lost the plot — we are totally committed and will remain totally committed!” $10,000 PER XRP pic.twitter.com/MdL0Lz6wZp — BALE (@AltcoinBale) October 21, 2025 Bale’s Market Outlook Bale, who posted the interview clip on X, believes that Ripple’s enduring support could propel XRP toward a valuation of $10,000 . His view reflects a long-standing optimism within the community that XRP’s role in cross-border settlements and institutional finance could unlock significant value over time. Ripple has maintained this alignment even through difficult market conditions and legal challenges. The company’s prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tested XRP’s standing in the market. However, it ultimately led to regulatory clarity for the token in the U.S. Ripple’s Continued Role in Financial Integration Beyond regulatory developments, Ripple has pursued extensive partnerships aimed at embedding XRP within the global payments infrastructure. The asset has become central to Ripple’s vision of creating a faster, cheaper, and more efficient system for transferring value across borders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By integrating XRP into its payment corridors, Ripple allows institutions to settle transactions in seconds without relying on pre-funded accounts. This approach aligns with Ripple’s strategy to position XRP as a neutral bridge currency connecting different fiat systems. Such integration has also unplugged conversations with central banks exploring central bank digital currency (CBDC) solutions , where XRP could play a role in improving interoperability among sovereign digital assets. Ripple’s Vision for XRP Garlinghouse’s comments reaffirm that Ripple’s corporate trajectory remains tied to XRP’s performance and utility. The company continues to expand its international presence, with corridors operating in regions such as Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. The company’s focus on institutional adoption reflects a broader effort to move XRP beyond retail speculation toward practical financial applications. If Ripple maintains its commitment as Garlinghouse stated, and if institutional adoption continues to accelerate , the $10,000 could become a reality.

The product, issued by ChinaAMC (Hong Kong), will officially list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange next Monday. This development makes Solana the third cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, to gain ETF approval in Asia. Solana ETF Set for Launch Next Week According to details from ChinaAMC’s filings , the Solana ETF will trade under the ticker 3460 and be available in Hong Kong dollars, Chinese yuan, and U.S. dollars. The fund carries a 0.99% annual management fee. BOCI-Prudential Trustee Limited serves as its main custodian, while OSL Digital Securities acts as the sub-custodian and trading platform provider. The launch date is set for October 27, making it the first Solana ETF to be listed anywhere in Asia. Each trading lot will consist of 100 shares per currency. This milestone comes as regulators worldwide continue to embrace digital assets, with Hong Kong taking a clear lead in the region’s ETF race. Market Anticipation and Global Outlook The approval also arrives as investors await the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision on spot Solana ETFs. The SEC had delayed its ruling due to the government shutdown earlier this month. However, analysts expect the U.S. to follow Hong Kong’s lead soon after simplifying listing procedures for digital asset ETFs. JPMorgan analysts estimate that Solana ETFs could attract around $1.5 billion in inflows during their first year, about one-seventh of Ethereum ETF inflows. They attributed this projection to Solana’s smaller DeFi ecosystem relative to Ethereum. Analysts Eye Solana’s Price Consolidation Source: X Solana currently trades near $184 , reflecting a modest 0.16% rise in 24 hours but a 9.69% weekly decline. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that Solana has surged over 3,700% since December 2022 and now faces resistance between $225 and $250. He suggested that a breakout above this zone could drive prices toward $365 and beyond. Meanwhile, analyst X_Four_iv observed that Solana is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, showing reduced volatility. The key levels to watch remain $180 for support and $210 for resistance.

There’s now 155 crypto ETP filings tracking 35 different digital assets. Could easily end up seeing over 200 hit mkt in next 12mo. Total land rush. Here’s the list by coin, amazing work from @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/dKyiySxn0H — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 21, 2025 Other assets like Litecoin have 5, Avalanche 4, Dogecoin 4, and Polkadot 4. Judge counts for SEI, Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), SUI, BNB, and Cardano each stand at 3, while a long tail of tokens NEAR, Chainlink, INJ, Tron, BONK, HYPE, and Atom have between 1 and 2 filings. Balchunas asserted that the number of filings could “easily push past 200 within the next 12 months.” US prepares for ETF season, pipeline of approvals impending According to Crypto in America podcast host Eleanor Terrett, the US Securities and Exchange Commission will have a busy run in the end of 2025 “Crypto ETF season,” approving or shutting down several applications of ETPs. Some filings under the 19b-4/S-1 route show the US SEC set an initial deadline for approval is September 13, 2025, and the maximum possible review window extends to March 27 next year. Decision deadlines slated for late 2025 include a November deadline for the HBAR/Ethereum-related filing, alongside Solana and XRP filings by Franklin Templeton Investments. Several XRP filings were originally due in mid-October, including the Grayscale Investments XRP conversion, 21Shares US Core XRP, CoinShares, and Canary Capital Group XRP trust, and the Litecoin and 21Shares Ethereum staking filings. However, these have been delayed due to an ongoing US government shutdown that has lasted for three weeks now, pausing SEC review operations and pushing decisions into late 2025. According to SEC records, other filings tracking Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) have decision dates in November and December. ETP submissions for SUI, TRON, and other smaller tokens carry decision deadlines stretching into January–March 2026. As reported by Cryptopolitan in September, the regulator’s new chair, Paul Atkins, issued a notice to “fast-track” a generic listing standard under which an ETF could proceed via S-1 alone, sidestepping a full 19b-4 review. However, the maximum deadline under any route will still land in early 2026. Moreover, a group of crypto executives is set to meet with pro-crypto Senate Democrats on Wednesday to discuss digital asset market structure legislation, according to Terret. The roundtable, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, is expected to include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, Jito CLO Rebecca Rettig, and a16z crypto General Counsel Miles Jennings. Terret also mentioned that more participants “may join the meeting,” which follows a recent breakdown in bipartisan negotiations after Republican and pro-crypto policymakers saw a leaked “unfriendly” Democratic proposal to regulate DeFi. BTC and ETH spot positive flows continue after days of outflows Away from ETFs that are yet to be approved, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $477.19 million in net inflows on Tuesday, ending a four-day streak of outflows. The numbers bring total October inflows to $4.21 billion, surpassing September’s $3.53 billion. Per data from Farside Investors, BlackRock’s IBIT led the positive flows with $210.9 million, followed by ARK Invest/21 Shares’s ARKB recording $162.85 million, and the remainder $103.44 million split by Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise BITB. The final quarter of 2025 could replicate last year’s record inflows for spot BTC traded funds, when more than $16 billion flowed into the 12 listed products. The positive signals also came on the backdrop of a strong rebound in Bitcoin’s price on Tuesday, which surged to a daily high of $113,996.35 in the evening, its highest level in the last seven days, and nearly 9% above its lows of $104,778 seen last Friday. Spot Ethereum ETFs logged $141.6 million in net inflows the same day, $59.07 million to FETH (Fidelity), $42.46 million to ETHA (BlackRock), $22.58 million to Mini ETH (Grayscale), and $13.14 million to ETHE (Grayscale).

The HK Securities & Futures Commission has officially approved Chiba AMC’s Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). Whale Insider @WhaleInsider · Follow JUST IN: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong officially approves first $SOL spot ETF by ChinaAMC. 1:11 pm · 22 Oct 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The move has stirred markets as it marks the beginning of a new era of crypto investment in Asia. Meanwhile, Solana becomes the third asset to gain such approval in the city (after earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum authorisation). Cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Asia can now interact with the first non-BTC, non-ETH exchange-traded fund product. The SOL ETF approval reflects increasing institutional trust in Solana’s future and Hong Kong’s dedication to offering regulated crypto offerings. Listing scheduled for October 27 A local news website reported that the China Solana ETF will be listed next week, on Monday, October 27. Notably, there will be 100 units per lot, offering diversity that allows both retail and institutional investors to participate. Moreover, individuals need HK$780, approximately $100, for a minimum investment to enter. With that, participants of all backgrounds and financial needs can gain exposure to Solana without navigating cryptocurrency exchanges or handling digital wallets. Such exposure will likely boost Solana’s adoption within the vibrant Asia cryptocurrency community. Fund structure and associated fees The total yearly expense ratio for ChinaAMC’s SOL ETF is expected to be around 1.99%. The product’s management fee is 0.99%, while administrative and custody charges might be 1% of the sub-fund’s net asset value. While these costs appear higher compared to some traditional exchange-traded funds, they demonstrate the complexity of securing and handling cryptocurrencies without compromising regulatory standards. It is noteworthy that the Solana spot ETF will not make distributions to stakeholders. That means participants will benefit from capital surges and not income payouts. That mimics the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds’ model, which prioritises tracking price actions rather than generating shareholder dividends. SOL price action Solana is trading at $184 after a somewhat muted performance in the past 24 hours. Chart by CoinMarketCap The altcoin mirrors the current choppy broad market. Bears control Solana’s trajectory after the alt plunged from this month’s high of $237. Nevertheless, institutional interest signals a bright future for SOL. Data shows Solana has more ETF applications than all digital tokens since 2024, boasting 23 filings. Analysts trust SOL price has what it takes to rally to $300. GSR, a renowned market maker, predicted Solana rallies to $1,000 amid ETF approval.

The government shutdown has affected all sectors, and cryptocurrency is one of them. The wave of ETF approvals for altcoins like XRP and Solana (SOL) expected in October has also been delayed. At this point, it seems that the number of altcoin ETFs, whose final approval decisions have not been announced by the SEC due to the government shutdown in the US, will increase in the coming period. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted in his post that more than 200 crypto ETPs could be launched within a year. According to Eric Balchunas, there are currently 155 ETFs on the market that track 35 different cryptocurrencies. Balchunas predicted that more than 200 ETFs are likely to launch in the next 12 months. The cryptocurrencies with the most ETFs are Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC), followed by XRP and Ethereum (ETH). Popular altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC), Avalanche (AVAX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) also top the list.

While gold was plummeting, the Bitcoin price rallied unexpectedly, managing to hit $114,000 before the price fell again, wiping out all the previous gains. What’s next for Bitcoin in this current volatile market? Failed rally ends up with $BTC price back where it started Source: TradingView The unexpected spike in the $BTC price may have caught many off guard. One moment the price was bouncing gently along the $108,000 horizontal support, and the next moment it took off to the upside. In the space of an hour the price jumped $3,700, taking it above the major trendline and also the top of the channel (in blue). It then rose as far as the descending trendline from the all-time high, before sinking back to the channel top, falling back in, and ending up exactly back at the $108,000 horizontal support. All in all, the $BTC price rose a total of $5,500 (5%). According to Coinglass, more than $652 million in value was wiped from both the longs and the shorts over a 24hr period. More than 160,000 traders were liquidated. It appears that the current market will just not tolerate any leverage. Market makers may have been licking their lips with glee as traders jumped onto a Bitcoin price that had drilled through resistances with ease and that was potentially heading back to the high at a rate of knots. Once again it wasn’t to be, and Bitcoin traders staggered off licking their wounds for the umpteenth time. Bearish pattern confirms for $BTC price Source: TradingView It can be seen that the recent upside spike stopped at the 50-day SMA, while currently the 200-day SMA is providing support. Be that as it may, the glaring stand-out in the daily chart is a big head and shoulders pattern. Was Tuesday’s spike to the upside no more than a confirmation of this pattern? The price had already fallen through the neckline and now we have had the price return to confirm this bearish pattern. Head and shoulders measured move to $88,000 Source: TradingView Zooming out one can observe the measured move for the head and shoulders pattern. It would take the $BTC price all the way down to $88,000. This matches up perfectly with strong horizontal support. Could this be Bitcoin’s next move? If it is, this could potentially be the first move down into a bear market. Bull market parabola about to fail - one chance left Source: TradingView The above weekly chart is probably the most critical for the continuation of the bull market since it began back in January 2023. In the price action part of the chart things do not look good. The head and shoulders pattern has confirmed at the very worst point - right at the place where the bull market parabola can be broken. This parabola has held really well up to now, but it must be said that if the parabola fails the bull market could probably fail with it, especially if the measured move of the head and shoulders pattern plays out. The current Bitcoin bull market has one hope left, and that is the Stochastic RSI on the weekly time frame. By the beginning of next week the indicators should be right at the bottom. If they can tick back up quickly and signal upside momentum, the current downside move could end up being just a fakeout. It’s a long shot, and it would need to happen quickly. The fate of this bull market is now in the balance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

53492312,https://invezz.com/?p=2936012,1761125230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Crypto treasury companies face resistance from Asian stock exchanges,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/22/crypto-treasury-companies-face-resistance-from-asian-stock-exchanges/,"Asian stock exchanges, including the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and the Bombay Stock Exchange, have started tightening scrutiny on companies looking to adopt crypto treasury strategies. Throughout Asia, several companies that have disclosed plans to hoard cryptocurrencies have met with resistance from regulators, according to a Bloomberg report , which pointed to recent clampdowns across Hong Kong, India, and Australia. Hong Kong Unnamed sources familiar with the development told Bloomberg that the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has pushed back against at least five listed companies in recent months that sought to adopt digital asset treasury strategies as their core business model. Regarding its decision, HKEX has reportedly cited existing rules that prohibit firms from holding large liquid assets unless such holdings are directly tied to the company’s primary operations. Under these regulations, companies with asset compositions primarily made up of cash or short-term investments risk being classified as “cash companies” and may face suspension from trading. The bourse’s aim, according to the report, is to prevent shell-like entities from exploiting their listed status for speculative gains. A spokesperson for HKEX, while declining to comment on individual cases, stated that its framework is designed to ensure listed firms remain viable, sustainable, and grounded in substance. As such, the current regulatory environment effectively bars any company from becoming a pure-play Bitcoin accumulator unless it can prove that digital assets are central to its operations. India A similar situation has emerged in India, where the Bombay Stock Exchange recently rejected Jetking Infotrain’s proposal to invest proceeds from a preferential share allotment into cryptocurrencies. The exchange did not issue a detailed public statement, but filings show that Jetking’s intent to use capital for digital assets played a key role in the rejection. In India, cryptocurrencies remain within a regulatory limbo as the government and key agencies like the Reserve Bank of India have long remained cautious on crypto-related ventures. Japan Japan stands in contrast to its regional peers, as there, companies have found more regulatory breathing room to adopt crypto treasury strategies. Publicly listed firms in Japan are already known to maintain large cash reserves, and regulators have taken a more permissive stance. Japan Exchange Group CEO Hiromi Yamaji recently said that as long as listed companies make appropriate disclosures, such as notifying investors of planned Bitcoin purchases, the actions are not inherently unacceptable. As a result, Japan now has the highest number of publicly listed Bitcoin-holding firms in Asia. These include former hotelier Metaplanet Inc. , which holds over 30,000 BTC and has seen wild swings in its share price as a result. Other notable cases include Quantum Solutions and Convano, the latter of which made headlines by announcing plans to raise billions of yen to buy Bitcoin despite operating a chain of nail salons. However, even Japan is not without challenges, as leading Index provider MSCI has recently proposed excluding firms like Metaplanet from global indexes over concerns that such companies may function more like investment funds. This could restrict passive capital inflows from funds that track the indexes and also dampen valuations. Crypto treasuries continue to surface Nevertheless, crypto treasury strategies have become an increasingly popular reserve model within Asian markets, particularly among smaller firms looking to differentiate themselves or attract investor interest. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net, more than 130 firms across the continent have embraced some form of digital asset reserve strategy, collectively holding around 58,000 BTC.

Fast-forward to 2025, and while Solana remains a dominant coin in the market, analysts and investors are on the lookout for the best cryptocurrency to invest today that could replicate such explosive gains. Many are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project that’s rapidly building momentum ahead of its mainnet debut. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035, with over 70% of tokens sold in this phase. Its dual-lending model, which fuses Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract mechanisms, has positioned it as one of the most innovative entrants in decentralized finance. With its strong fundamentals and early investor excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be the breakout project that reignites the kind of bull run Solana delivered in 2021, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest today before its value potentially surges in 2025. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis: Following Fibonacci Support for Potential Reversal Solana (SOL) recently responded to Fibonacci support for wave (4) with indications of the early stages of a potential upside reversal. Experts warn, though, that it is still too soon to consider the possibility of a sustained bullish trend. Investors are keenly observing if the subsequent pullback can maintain B-wave support at $177.69–$188.04 presently as major resistance levels around the $208–$212 levels. Above these levels holding would raise the chances of continuation to higher price points. With investors eyeing SOL’s possible bounce back, smart money is looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for the next big ROI to add to their portfolios in 2025, positioning it as the best cryptocurrency to invest today and a potential top crypto of the year. Mutuum Finance’s Consistent Growth Boosts Market Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a big splash in the DeFi market, and it’s one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to keep an eye on this year. At Presale Phase 6, the token is currently at $0.035, a 16.17% upsurge from Phase 5, which is the lowest MUTM will ever achieve. Investor demand is robust, with over 17,340 members contributing over $17.75 million to date. With over 70% of Phase 6 sold, Mutuum Finance is recording historic interest, setting it as a high-growth cryptocurrency with long-term potential. Many investors now regard MUTM as a top crypto to watch closely and the best cryptocurrency to invest today for early adopters. How Mutuum Finance Works Mutuum Finance operates as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum, designed to make on-chain financial activity more transparent and efficient. In its P2C markets, users can supply popular assets like ETH and USDT into liquidity pools and earn passive yield as borrowers draw from the shared liquidity. This structure ensures flexibility in interest rates — when utilization rises, yields increase; when liquidity is plentiful, borrowing becomes cheaper. In addition to the pooled markets, the platform’s P2P system allows users to create customized lending deals with other participants. This flexibility enables lending and borrowing of tokens that are not always supported by large protocols — including memecoins such as SHIB and DOGE — giving users greater control over risk exposure and terms. Every depositor on the platform receives mtTokens, which are 1:1 representations of their deposits that accrue value as interest builds over time. These mtTokens can also be staked to earn extra MUTM rewards through the project’s buy-and-distribute model, where a portion of protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to stakers. This mechanism ties token value directly to platform usage — increasing long-term buying pressure as platform activity grows. Daily Leaderboard Highlights The Mutuum Finance leaderboard is keeping the community active with stunning rewards. The biggest buyers over the last 24 hours bought $7,036 and $6,619 worth of MUTM tokens, demonstrating high activity and investor demand. The most active one-day buyer is rewarded with a $500 MUTM reward by making a purchase within the 24-hour period. Solana (SOL) might have shocked in 2021, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking center stage as the next very promising crypto. Phase 6 presale tokens cost $0.035 with over 70% sold and over $17.75 million raised by 17,340 investors. $500 MUTM bonuses in daily leaderboard rewards mean serious investor attention and increasing confidence. Get in early on MUTM for exposure to its revolutionary dual-lending DeFi platform prior to its mainnet listing. Reserve your spot now and witness the potential of one of the most promising coins to buy for 2025, making it a top crypto and the best cryptocurrency to invest today.

SEAL stated : “We are launching a global real-time phishing defense network alongside MetaMask, WalletConnect, Backpack, and Phantom! This allows us to create a decentralized immune system for crypto security where anyone from around the world can prevent the next major phishing attack.” ~ SEAL SEAL says they’ve taken up verifiable phishing report technology Phishing attacks remain the leading cause of cryptocurrency thefts this year. SEAL and related companies argue that attackers have become more agile, enabling them to evade automated scans. They frequently switch landing pages, host their content from offshore sources, or cloak it. Latest endeavors from the company enable anyone – researchers, users, and wallet providers – to submit verified phishing reports, which are shared automatically across participating wallets and used to trigger in-the-moment alerts. MetaMask also announced : “We’ve joined forces to launch a global phishing defense network that can protect more users across the entire ecosystem.” SEAL has asserted that its system employs a verifiable phishing reporting mechanism that allows trusted users to broadcast alerts across the network in real-time, with no need for administrative privileges. The faster the alerts, the less money lost, the agency said. The group has previously cautioned that crypto-drainers are innovating fast with new methods of hiding themselves. The criminals quickly cycle through phishing sites and shift infrastructure offshore when it gets blocked, while using cloaking to hide their operations, it said. During the past two years, dismantling groups such as Inferno Drainer, Angel Drainer, Ace Drainer, and Riddance Drainer had been a priority for the agency. It admitted that as it improved its shields, hackers learned how to adapt. Ohm Shah, a Security Researcher at MetaMask, explained that dealing with drainers is a constant cat-and-mouse game, and that by working closely with SEAL, the company can adapt more quickly and better disrupt malicious infrastructure. WalletConnect’s CTO, Derek Rein, also asserted that through the WalletConnect Certified program, users receive real-time warnings about scam websites. He added that collaboration with SEAL will boost these efforts with additional domain data, calling it a positive step for industry-wide security adoption. Additionally, Armani Ferrante said that SEAL’s technology enables Backpack to provide users with a safer and more confident way to explore the crypto world. He added that the partnership reflects Backpack’s focus on improving the security of digital asset ownership. According to Phantom’s senior engineer, Kim Persson, the company’s collaboration with SEAL will also improve domain security and better protect users, reflecting its core focus on safety. Phishing resulted in the loss of over $400 million in crypto According to Certik’s analysis, phishing attacks surpassed all other security incidents in the first six months of the year, resulting in losses exceeding $400 million in cryptocurrency. There were about 132 reported cases. The firm’s report shows that wallet hacks were responsible for the largest losses, totaling $1.7 billion across 34 attacks. Ethereum , in particular, remained one of the top targets for hackers, with 70 exploits and scams reported in the second quarter, a decline from 98 in the first quarter. Certik stated that Ethereum’s prominence in decentralized finance and its vast smart contract activity are what draw attackers to the billions of dollars in assets locked on the network. At the time, the blockchain security auditor also advised users to be extra vigilant, as phishing tactics evolve, and to verify domains and store assets securely using hardware wallets.

Nevertheless, there have been some developments among major metrics that could indicate that the Shiba Inu price is getting ready to mark a bottom. These range from the open interest to the trading volume, with both reaching levels that have previously marked the bottom for the price. Open Interest Crashes Toward 2025 Lows One major metric that has suffered when it comes to Shiba Inu is the open interest. This metric which tracks the total number of open contracts for the meme coin has dropped very sharply, alongside the price, and has reached levels not seen in nine months. According to data from the Coinglass website, the Shiba Inu open interest is now sitting below $80 million. The last time that the open interest was this low was back at the start of January 2025, right before the surge. Back then, the open interest being below $80 million marked the bottom for the Shiba Inu price. What followed was a quick uptick in the Shiba Inu price as investors began to take their positions once again. The result was a sharp uptick in the open interest, rising by over 800% in the next few weeks to reach a new all-time high open interest of $542 million. If history repeats itself, then this is when the Shiba Inu price could see a retracement. Volume Paints Possible Bullish Future For Shiba Inu Price Another metric that has fallen toward 2025 lows is the daily trading volume. Coinglass shows that trading volume is currently averaging below $200 million, which is quite low for the meme coin known for being one of the most famous meme coins in the space. The daily trading failing blow $200 million has often been one of the markers of a bottom for the Shiba Inu price. This was the case back in May 2025 before the price rallied 40%, and then again in July 2025, leading to another 40% rally. If this trend also holds, then it could be the precursor to another 40% rally. Coupled with the open interest crashing to 9-month lows, the Shiba Inu price might be on the verge of another upsurge.

Bitcoin (BTC), whose price finally registered a substantial green candle, lost all the gains and briefly tumbled below $108,000. Many of the leading altcoins have charted a similar trajectory, while Zcash (ZEC) remains one of the top performers with a double-digit increase for the day. BTC Experiences Massive Volatility The leading cryptocurrency was trading in the $107,000 – $109,000 range yesterday (October 21), but that consolidation was suddenly interrupted towards the evening. At that time, the Federal Reserve held a meeting, during which it revealed it was looking into “payment accounts” that would grant crypto and fintech companies access to Fed payment rails. The crypto market took this as a positive sign, and BTC soared to $114,000 immediately after the news came out. It is important to note that the revival coincided with the price downtrend of gold, as some analysts assumed that capital had started rotating from the yellow metal towards the digital asset. As CryptoPotato reported , BTC’s price pump resulted in multi-million-dollar liquidations, with hundreds of thousands of traders getting wrecked due to opening too risky positions with high leverage. However, the bulls could not maintain their momentum, and Bitcoin’s valuation headed south just as aggressively. The asset lost all its gains and briefly tumbled below $108,000 before slightly rebounding to the current $108,200. Some X users noted that the retreat occurred after American President Donald Trump threatened China with the implementation of 155% tariffs starting on November 1. Following that turbulence, BTC’s market capitalization now stands at around $2.16 trillion, whereas its dominance against the altcoins is approximately 57.5%. Source: TradingView ZEC and These Alts Enter Green Territory Ethereum (ETH) performed quite similarly to BTC. It spiked to almost $4,100 before dipping to $3,850. The other leading altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), are also trading around their figures from yesterday. Those posting some significant losses are Aster (ASTER), Mantle (MNT), and Pump.fun (PUMP). ChainOpera AI (COAI) and Zcash (ZEC) are on the opposite corner with daily gains of 57% and 10%, respectively. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at roughly $3.75 trillion, or more or less the same level as it was 24 hours ago.

The ecosystem is majorly poised for significant strides as it carries forward the utility of Artificial Intelligence for an effective deployment across the financial market. Its native token, $OZ, is simultaneously gaining traction in the market. The main reason is that it is priced low in the presale stage and has the potential of riding the wave of credibility for upticks. The Ozak AI also features on the list of cryptocurrencies trading below $0.02 that could explode in the times to come. $OZ Presale and Other Coins Price Explosion The utility token of Ozak AI, $OZ, has an offer value of $0.012 in the 6th phase of presale . The price is up 1100% from $0.001, which was applicable in Phase 1. The $OZ price is all set to be revised to $0.014 in the next presale phase. Suffice it to say, more revisions will be done as the Ozak AI token presale moves forward. The target price is $1, and Ozak AI has sold over 966 million tokens to this point. Thereby, raising over $4 million in funding. The total supply is 10 billion, and the presale stage has been allocated 30% of the total supply. SHIB is one of the prominent memecoins, which is listed at $0.00001208 and has the potential to experience a price explosion. Similarly, PEPE is estimated to see an increase from $0.000009303. Other cryptocurrencies below $0.02 that could explode are PUMP, listed at $0.00517; BONK, at $0.00001922; FLOKI, at $0.00009410; and GALA, at $0.01564. What strengthens the case for $OZ’s explosion is its tokenomics. The total supply of 10B is further distributed among Ecosystem & Community (30%), Future Reserve (20%), Team (10%), and Liquidity & Listings (10%). Key Features of Ozak AI ($OZ) Ozak AI has built credibility around its ecosystem on the grounds of key features. Cross-chain functionality, for one, enables seamless operations across multiple blockchain ecosystems. This puts little pressure on $OZ as it gets space to grow without having to navigate complexities. DePIN design utilizes blockchain technology and IPFS nodes. It distributes data across a network of nodes to ensure that there are fewer chances of data loss and tampering. The AI-powered infrastructure boosts optimization, smart analytics, and automation. The token utility grants power to community members, allowing them to participate in governance, staking, and expansion of the ecosystem. Security and transparency are backed by frequent audits, which Certik and Sherlock conduct. They deploy advanced tools to identify and address vulnerabilities right from the starting point. Recent Partnerships of Ozak AI Ozak AI announced a partnership with Phala Network earlier this month. They have agreed to explore the implementation of secure and private AI predictions for financial markets. This is in addition to supporting cross-community initiatives and shared developer tools. Days later, Ozak AI joined hands with Meganet to work on cost savings on AI processing and undertake joint community projects. However, the major objective of this collaboration is to create a computing capability that is efficient when fetching real-time financial insights. Conclusion Ozak AI token , $OZ, may be at an offer value of $0.012, but it has a strong chance of exploding in the times to come—especially upon achieving the targeted price of $1. This can be compared to the likes of SHIB and PEPE, among others, who have bullish predicted estimates to their names. Ozak AI stands out because of its key partnerships and technicalities, like the fusion of AI tools, DePIN, and tokenized growth.

Among these, Ozak AI shines with a promising future, backed by robust features and strategic partnerships. The Promise of Ozak AI and the Appeal of Low-Valued Tokens As an AI-driven blockchain initiative, Ozak AI introduces an ecosystem that beautifully integrates advanced AI tools, decentralized personal identification (DePIN), and strategic tokenized growth. This positions the platform well beyond just a token; it's a gateway to pioneering the application of AI in financial markets. Currently, in its 6th phase of presale , the $OZ token's price has impressively surged 1100% from its initial phase, with a subsequent phase hinting at a price increase to $0.014. Such a staggering rise is not merely numerical but signifies growing investor confidence and a solid foundational market strategy. Comparative Analysis: $OZ Against Other Sub-$0.02 Cryptos While $OZ makes strides, other cryptocurrencies like SHIB, PEPE, PUMP, BONK, FLOKI, and GALA also hover below the $0.02 mark. Each holds potential, but $OZ's robust tokenomics and utility layer it with an additional edge. The strategic allocation includes 30% for Ecosystem & Community, bolstered by 20% for Future Reserve, ensuring a balanced and growth-oriented distribution. Innovative Features Fueling Growth The DePIN architecture of Ozak AI utilizes blockchain and IPFS nodes to distribute data securely and efficiently, reducing risks of tampering and loss. This technological groundwork is complemented by cross-chain functionality that ensures smooth operations across various blockchain environments, enhancing the adaptability and potential market reach of $OZ. Moreover, the platform's AI-driven infrastructure facilitates smart analytics and automation, crucial for scaling operations and enhancing user engagement through governance and staking. Strategic Partnerships Broadening Horizons Recently, Ozak AI expanded its ecosystem through notable collaborations. A significant partnership with Phala Network aims to leverage AI for secure financial predictions. Following this, an alliance with Meganet was formed to enhance AI processing efficiency and foster community-driven projects, setting a precedent for future technological integrations and community engagement. Concluding Thoughts With an aspirational target price of $1, Ozak AI's $OZ token stands not just as a promising investment but as a pioneer in the AI-blockchain interface. By continuing to forge key partnerships and pushing the envelope in AI and blockchain technology, $OZ is well-poised for a potential market breakthrough.

While short-term price action remains volatile, recent activity on both charts and on-chain data shows larger players taking positions. Breakout Structure Holds With Fibonacci Targets in Sight Chart analysis shared by ChartNerd shows XRP breaking out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle. This move has been followed by a retest of the 3-month 10 EMA, a level being held as support. The chart shows price now moving above a long-term resistance zone that had capped previous rallies. $XRP is going to melt faces..

Fibonacci extension levels plotted on the chart place potential price targets at $8, $13, and $27. The chart also outlines a structured setup with a clear entry point and risk level below ascending trend support. Furthermore, analyst Egrag Crypto responded to bearish sentiment with the statement: “There isn’t one confirmed bearish signal on the chart.” The chart he posted shows XRP holding well above a long-standing ascending channel. Key support levels remain intact, with no break below structural trend lines or moving averages. Price action continues to respect higher time frame support zones, with consolidation taking place above the center of the trend channel. No reversal signals have appeared on the chart. Source: Egrag Crypto/X Short-Term Volatility Still in Focus In a separate update, CryptoWZRD noted that XRP’s daily candle closed as an inside bar, indicating low conviction in either direction. His attention is on Bitcoin dominance, which could influence XRP’s next move. He added that “if Bitcoin moves sideways,” XRP could attempt a push to $2.75, while a more decisive move down in Bitcoin could bring the cryptocurrency toward $2.30. On the lower time frame, the $2.55 area is being monitored as a key zone. Price holding above this level may indicate momentum building, while a drop below $2.30 could signal further selling. No clear breakout or breakdown has formed yet on the intraday structure. Whale Accumulation Contrasts With Retail Behavior Recent on-chain activity reported by CryptoPotato shows that smaller holders have been selling XRP at a loss, with an increase in fear-related discussion across social platforms. In contrast, wallets holding between 100,000 and 10 million XRP added 30 million tokens in 24 hours, according to analyst Ali Charts. Separately, Evernorth—a Ripple-backed company— announced plans to list on Nasdaq via a merger with Armada Acquisition Corp II. The company has stated it will focus on building an XRP-centered platform. Meanwhile, blockchain data shows that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50 million XRP to exchanges on October 20, with an estimated value of over $120 million.

The token is now seeking a support, with some signs of whales buying near the lower range. XRP has lagged behind other tokens, becoming one of the day’s biggest losers among top 10 coins and tokens. XRP extended its slide to the $2.40 level, after ongoing data of deposits to exchanges and whale selling in the past couple of weeks.

XRP also shows price weakness as most altcoins have lost the attention of traders. Whales have been affecting the price of XRP for weeks, extending their sales after the October 11 market crash, as reported Cryptopolitan. Additionally, the selling on October 11 caused long-term damage on the price of XRP. During the sell-off, whales deposited 43M on Binance, crashing the price under $3. XRP shows trading weakness, long-term optimism XRP retains its long-term community, convinced the XRPL platform may be suitable for decentralized finance. However, the long-term outlook does not prevent XRP from stagnating. XRP open interest is just $1.31B, much smaller compared to other top 10 coins and tokens. XRP liquidity allocation remains cautious, with a short squeeze possible only up to $2.60 in a more bullish scenario. | Source: CoinGlass. Based on the liquidation heatmap, XRP has relatively small accumulation of positions. The token has relatively small liquidity for triggering a short squeeze. As of October 22, most positions for XRP were up to $2.60, signaling a short squeeze could not cause a recovery above $3. Binance, Bybit, and Gate see XRP outflows XRP currently moves through Binance, Bybit, and Gate. The three exchanges saw the most notable outflows in the past week. Binance held over 3.62B in XRP exchange reserves as of October 16, seeing the number shrink to $3.34B as of October 21. Balances remained relatively unchanged on Bitstamp and Bitfinex. However, Bybit reserves shrank from 442M to 298M XRP. Gate saw its XRP reserves diminish from 67M to 48M. The outflows from exchanges may suggest renewed interest after the recent selling round. XRP was not only sold by whales, but by retail traders after the October 11 crash. The asset dipped to a local low of $1.90, later still managing a recovery to $2.50. Recent sentiment metrics show XRP is mostly the target of negative comments on social media, the lowest level of crowd sentiment since January. The metric suggests the market may move in the opposite direction to crowd sentiment. XRP may also move in unexpected ways due to its Korean won market, taking up over 13% of trading volumes. The token also trades against Binance’s FDUSD, offering an alternative source of liquidity.

The fund, which holds physical gold stored inside Japan, soared as much as 16% above its actual asset value earlier this week before dropping. This surge came despite the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) putting out a warning on Friday to investors, telling them to monitor the premium-versus-value gap, which had been stretching for days. This comes as gold itself suffered its biggest price crash in more than a decade. On Tuesday, spot prices of the metal dropped by 6.3%, the worst single-day slump in over 12 years. Then on Wednesday, the ETF’s price tumbled 11%, reversing part of the earlier rally. Still, the premium remains, and that’s making investors nervous. This ETF now holds ¥1.25 trillion, or roughly $8.2 billion in assets, according to Bloomberg. TSE warns as premium widens beyond global norms The Japan Physical Gold ETF is now far removed from how other global funds behave. Its premium-to-NAV gap is the widest in the world, with similar ETFs like the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF, abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF, and iShares Physical Gold ETF all staying within a 4% margin for the last 10 years. Japan’s fund blew past that number, crossing 16% at its peak, showing just how hot demand has gotten, and how local behavior is decoupling from real gold prices . Most other Japanese ETFs don’t even hold real metal. The iShares Gold ETF buys into a London-listed fund, backed by foreign vaults. Meanwhile, the NF Gold Price ETF is linked to futures-based contracts, not physical bars. That makes the Japan Physical Gold ETF the only game in town for people who want local exposure to real bullion, and that’s clearly pushed it into overdrive. Even with the drop, the fund only pared its loss to 7% by Wednesday afternoon, still showing strong demand. Meanwhile, spot gold was hovering near $4,140 per ounce, trying to recover from Tuesday’s collapse. Silver was even more chaotic, briefly losing 8.7% before climbing again. Traders pointed to overheated technical indicators for both metals that had been running hot since mid-August. Traders hedge as volatility in gold surges again The crash didn’t come out of nowhere. Since August, gold had climbed close to 60% on the back of the “debasement trade,” bets that the U.S. government’s ballooning deficit and a possible rate cut by President Trump’s Federal Reserve would keep eroding trust in fiat. Investors fled into gold, dumping currencies and debt. But that rally got overheated, and the market snapped hard this week. The volatility isn’t over. Even though prices have calmed for now, traders are jumping into options contracts to guard against more swings. One-month implied volatility has jumped to levels last seen in March 2022. Despite the mess, some players still think gold has legs. Anna Wu, a cross-asset strategist at Van Eck Associates Corp. in Sydney, said the move wasn’t “massively contagious,” adding that, “Gold, despite its strong run recently, still shoulders an important haven role. Central banks have not stopped buying, nor private capital.” Meanwhile, silver is putting on a show of its own. In London , a supply squeeze last week pushed silver prices above 1980 highs, forcing traders to airlift metal into the UK just to ease the pressure. In Asia, the Shanghai Futures Exchange saw its largest one-day outflow of silver since February, and New York stockpiles dropped too. Still, the ETF story is about price disconnects. Kei Okazaki, senior manager at the TSE’s ETF Market Development Department, didn’t mince words. “The declining linkage between the ETF prices and the gold market, coupled with investors buying at expensive prices, is problematic,” he said.

Sharplink buys another 19k ETH | source: X This figure represents nearly 4.75% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. SharpLink alone accounts for about 0.69%, while BitMine owns over 2.74%. Industry data also shows that 95% of these corporate purchases occurred this quarter. Ethereum’s appeal lies not only in price speculation but also in its ability to generate staking rewards. By locking ETH into Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, companies can earn steady returns while supporting the network. SharpLink has already earned 5,671 ETH in staking rewards since June, worth about $23.25 million. That includes 326 newly minted rewards and 132 from LsETH derivatives during the latest week alone. BitMine Boosts ETH Treasury to $13 Billion BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate Ethereum holder, also took advantage of the recent dip. The firm purchased another $250 million worth of ETH on Monday, raising its total stash to around 3.24 million tokens. At current prices, that’s more than $13 billion in value. BitMine’s chairman Tom Lee, said the current “price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward.” Its holdings now make up 2.74% of the entire Ethereum supply, bringing it closer to its target of owning 5% of all ETH in circulation. SharpLink’s Treasury Strategy Pays Off SharpLink launched its Ethereum treasury strategy in June and became the first publicly traded company to centre its reserves on Ether. It began with a $425 million private investment in public equity and has since expanded its holdings through additional raises. The company’s stock has surged by over 450% in the past six months according to Yahoo Finance. Analysts attribute much of that rise to investor confidence in SharpLink’s Ethereum-based balance sheet approach. SharpLink’s stock price has risen over the last 6 months | source: Yahoo Finance SharpLink also maintains about $36.4 million in cash and equivalents, and has enough flexibility for more buys. By converting part of its treasury into staking assets, SharpLink is generating income through rewards, while strengthening its exposure to Ethereum . Institutional Interest Strengthens Despite Market Weakness While Ethereum’s price has fallen around 12% this month, large investors seem to be unfazed. Data from Bitwise shows that nearly all Ether held by public companies was bought this quarter. Many institutions are buying the dip as they expect more demand for staking and on-chain finance. Ethereum was trading at around $3,960 at press time, and is down 0.7% over 24 hours. Analysts are linking the recent drop to macroeconomic tensions, including President Donald Trump’s plan to impose 155% tariffs on Chinese goods starting November 1. The tariffs have spooked markets across equities, commodities, and digital assets. Even so, the ongoing corporate activity shows confidence in Ethereum.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-22 09:57:21

53492764,611268,1761127207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53492764.jpeg,Bitcoin Leverage Reset: Futures Open Interest Plummets 30%,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-leverage-reset-futures-open-interest-30/,"Data shows the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest has witnessed a massive plunge recently, flushing the excess of leverage in the sector. Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Has Seen A Reset As explained by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in an X post , the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest has gone through a sharp decline. This metric measures the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to the cryptocurrency that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. When the value of this indicator rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions related to the asset. Generally, the overall leverage in the sector goes up whenever this trend develops, so a rise in the Open Interest can lead to more volatility for BTC. On the other hand, the metric going down implies holders are either closing positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. Since a washout of leverage accompanies it, such a trend can result in calmer price action for the coin. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest shot up to an extreme level when the cryptocurrency’s price set its all-time high (ATH) above $126,000. As mentioned before, an increase in the indicator can make the asset more volatile. This happens because the risk of a squeeze taking place rises as leverage piles up in the market. A squeeze is an event where a sharp swing in the price triggers a mass amount of liquidations. These liquidations feed back into the move, elongating its length, and unleashing a further cascade of liquidations. Such an event followed Bitcoin’s ATH and led to a rapid decline in the Open Interest as positions were flushed out. More liquidation events have followed since as BTC has continued to be volatile, but with the metric now standing around 30% down from its peak, perhaps enough excess leverage may have been washed out. Glassnode has also pointed out that the Funding Rate , a measure of the amount of periodic fee that futures market traders are exchanging between each other, is also near neutral right now. A neutral value in this metric indicates that no side in the market, whether long or short, is dominant at the moment. Based on this and the trend in the Open Interest, the analytics firm has noted, “the market is far less vulnerable to another liquidation cascade.” It now remains to be seen whether the decline in the Open Interest will prove enough to avoid another squeeze, or if more chaos is yet to come in the derivatives market. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a sharp surge toward $114,000 earlier in the day, but the coin’s price has since witnessed a retrace again as it’s now back at $110,800.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin futures|Bitcoin Leverage|bitcoin open interest|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-22 10:00:07

Phase 6 of its presale has progressed to 70% completion. The presale has drawn $17,750,000 in funds since inception and amassing 17,340 holders. Current buyers secure tokens at $0.035. This is a 250% rise from phase one’s $0.01 entry. Yet questions linger: will MUTM, positioned as the best crypto to buy now, hold its trajectory through 2027? Analysts point to robust protocol designs and market parallels for sustained growth. Early adopters eye potential 371% returns post-launch at $0.06. This momentum tests whether MUTM emerges as the next big crypto amid DeFi expansions. Phase 6 Accelerates Toward Sellout Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has intensified presale efforts. Phase 6 unfolds rapidly now, with 70% allocated already. Buyers snap up tokens at $0.035 each. This window narrows swiftly. Soon, phase 7 activates a 14.3% hike to $0.04. Last chances persist for this entry point. Launch looms at $0.06, promising 371% uplift for phase 6 participants. Holders tally 17,340 strong. Funds reached $17,750,000. Demand surges. Investors recognize MUTM as the best crypto to buy now. Utility drives appeal. Lending protocols beckon. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized its CertiK audit successfully. The token scan achieved a 90/100 score. Confidence builds accordingly. Teams launched an official Bug Bounty Program alongside CertiK. Rewards total $50,000 USDT. Four tiers structure payouts: critical, major, minor, low. Severity dictates each allocation. Vulnerabilities face targeted incentives. Developers now probe deeper. Safety enhances. Meanwhile, a dashboard debuted with a top 50 holders leaderboard. Daily 24-hour rankings refresh at 00:00 UTC. Top spot earns $500 MUTM bonus, conditional on one transaction. Past day’s leaders bought $7,036.48 and $6,619.13 respectively. Engagement spikes. Community thrives. Lending Protocol Advances on Testnet Horizon Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced its lending and borrowing protocol buildup. Version 1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 . Core elements include Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot. Initial assets feature ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, collateral. Borrow interest rates derive from utilization metrics. Abundant capital keeps rates low, spurring loans. Scarcity elevates them, prompting repayments and deposits. Stable rates option stabilizes predictability for borrowers. Initial locks weigh current variables. Rebalancing triggers guard against drifts. Overcollateralization mandates buffer positions. Liquidations incentivize swift resolutions via bonuses. Deposit and borrow caps limit exposures. LTV ratios cap borrowings at 75% max for stables. Reserve factors accrue for defaults. Chainlink oracles ensure price accuracy. Fallbacks and aggregates fortify feeds. Volatility adjustments tailor thresholds: 80% for ETH, 65% for riskier assets. MUTM stands as the next big crypto here. Efficiency rises. Users gain. Giveaway Ignites Community Participation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) unveiled a $100,000 MUTM giveaway . Ten winners claim $10,000 each. Participation demands wallet submission, quest completion, and $50 minimum presale investment. Eligibility confirms smooth transfers. Excitement mounts. Steps simplify entry. Community bonds strengthen. Rewards celebrate presale milestones. Holders engage further. This altcoin draws crowds. Sustaining Gains Through 2027: MUTM Versus Solana’s Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) eyes 2027 with calculated projections. Experts forecast $0.45 per token by year-end, rooted in DeFi adoption and presale velocity. Utilization models balance liquidity dynamically, mirroring proven mechanisms. Overcollateralization and liquidation safeguards have preserved solvency in tests. Initial ETH-USDT pools expand yields. Stablecoin integrations deepen utility. Early holders capture 371% from $0.035 to launch. Post-listing, protocol revenues buy back MUTM for stakers. This cycle reinforces value. Compare Solana: it dipped to $0.50 lows in late 2020, then rocketed to $260 peaks by November 2021. That 12-month climb delivered 520x ROI. MUTM parallels this path, yet emphasizes audited security and tiered markets over raw speed. P2C pools ensure instant access; P2P tailors risks. Volatility controls cap exposures tighter than Solana’s early runs. Thus, MUTM tempers surges with resilience. As the best crypto to buy now, it projects steadier climbs. Analysts justify $0.45 via 30% annual DeFi growth. Momentum holds if testnets deliver flawlessly. Solana’s ascent highlighted altcoin potential. From $0.50 troughs, it scaled heights in one year. Returns hit 520x amid ecosystem booms. MUTM learns from such patterns. Yet it prioritizes safeguards over unchecked hype. Caps and oracles avert manipulations. This altcoin refines the blueprint. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has woven security and utility into its core. Presale phases underscore investor faith. As the next big crypto, MUTM recaps strengths in DeFi lending.

According to Santiment Feed, the coins have recorded the highest level of social interest within crypto circles due to several reasons, including short squeeze predictions, involvement in the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference, exchange-traded-fund netflows, governance issues, developer complaints, and comparisons to gold. GameStop short squeeze predictions ensue Per Santiment, “GME” online mentions are topping the social trends list because retailers are revisiting memories of the 2021 short squeeze that propelled the video game selling store into the financial spotlight. Top trends in crypto circles across social media charts. Source: Santiment Feed. In early 2021, GameStop’s shares skyrocketed after retail traders hyped by Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets lashed out at hedge funds heavily shorting the video game retailer. Roughly 140% of GameStop’s publicly available shares had been sold short, forcing short sellers to buy back shares as prices surged. The squeeze sent GameStop’s pre-market price to more than $500 per share on January 28, nearly thirty times its value at the start of that month. This week’s renewed focus comes against the backdrop of traders comparing GME to the recent surge in Beyond Meat (BYND) shares, which climbed 128% on Monday to close at $1.47 after falling to $0.50 just a week earlier. Bitcoin rises as trade tensions trigger gold selloff Santiment’s social metric tracker also places “BTC” as one of the most mentioned keywords on crypto-focused platforms this week, after it briefly crossed $113,000 on Tuesday, coinciding with a decline in precious metals. According to data from Trading Economics, gold fell 5% to $4,130, its biggest single-day drop in years, while silver tumbled nearly 7% before treading back upwards to change hands at $49 per ounce. The special metal market decline follows months of upward movement, supported by global central banks’ monetary easing policy and a trade scuffle between the US and China. When precious metals corrected, Bitcoin saw a temporary influx of investor attention and capital inflows that helped it rally past $110,000. But the price surge was cut short after US President Donald Trump said he “wasn’t sure” he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Cryptopolitan reported . Tether reaches 500 million users Tether’s presence in social conversations has been prominent because it has reached 500 million users, as announced by CEO Paolo Ardoino. The company, which issues the most used stablecoin in the broader crypto market, USDT, and the gold-backed Tether Gold (XAUT), reported a record $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter of 2025. Bloomberg recently reported that Tether plans to raise approximately $20 billion at a valuation of $500 billion through the sale of about 3% of its equity, which could make it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. USDT is struggling with hurdles in the European Union trade bloc, having been delisted from exchanges due to non-compliance with the region’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. In response, Tether is doubling its American roots by planning to launch a new US-compliant stablecoin called USAT by the end of 2025. Bo Hines, CEO of Tether’s US division, said the new asset will be funded through share issuance rather than external capital. Chainlink engages the Federal Reserve on payment innovation Chainlink (LINK) has had an eventful week participating in the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference held on Tuesday, where industry leaders discussed the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology. Co-founder Sergey Nazarov joined a panel of crypto and fintech KOLs including Jackie Reses, CEO of Lead Bank, Fireblocks head Michael Shaulov and Jennifer Barker, BNY’s Global Head of Treasury Services, moderated by Rebecca Rettig of Jito Labs. Speaking to attendees, Nazarov said the blockchain network powers about 70% of tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuers and stablecoin providers applications. He urged US policymakers to help domestic financial infrastructure integrate with global digital payment systems. “I would look to create clear guidance that manages risk appropriately to make sure that stablecoins and tokenized deposits on the payments side of the digital asset economy can grow successfully and can grow successfully out of the United States more than anywhere else,” Nazarov asserted.

53492748,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87221,1761127257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Cardano Nears $0.70 Breakout & Avalanche Boosts Gaming Growth; BlockDAG to Go Live on Binance for Live AMA!,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-nears-0-70-breakout-avalanche-boosts-gaming-growth/,"In a period marked by rapid market changes, three major names, Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and BlockDAG (BDAG), are drawing strong attention for their contrasting progress. Cardano’s latest price analysis indicates potential for an upward breakout, as ADA continues to compress within a tightening wedge that could push prices beyond $0.70. Meanwhile, Avalanche’s latest update points to a solid focus on blockchain gaming as a growing use case for network activity and long-term demand. Among these, BlockDAG (BDAG) has gained remarkable traction through consistent delivery. With nearly $430 million raised in presale, a functioning Awakening Testnet, partnerships such as its collaboration with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team, and an upcoming AMA on Binance, BlockDAG continues to stand out. Backed by audits and a hybrid infrastructure, BDAG shows progress that’s measurable, not speculative. In a market driven by proof and performance, it may very well be the best crypto to buy today, combining technology, trust, and verified milestones before launch. Cardano’s Tight Formation: Can ADA Finally Break $0.70? Cardano (ADA) has entered a phase of price compression after earlier declines, trading inside a descending wedge formation that often signals a shift toward higher prices. On the 4-hour chart, the narrowing highs and lows point to declining selling pressure, suggesting an impending move. If ADA manages to close above $0.70, it could confirm a short-term recovery and open a pathway toward $0.75 to $0.80. However, failure to maintain its support near $0.65 could push the price back toward $0.50. Market participants viewing this pattern see it as an opportunity for a technical rebound, supported by Cardano’s ongoing DeFi growth that strengthens its ecosystem. Still, the final outcome depends largely on overall market sentiment. A clear breakout above resistance could renew optimism in ADA’s comeback phase. Avalanche’s Push into Gaming Adds Momentum for AVAX Avalanche (AVAX) rose by 2.7% to $22.80, marking a brief rise even under selling pressure. The coin continues to trade below its 20-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages, showing that bears still hold influence. The recent $140,000 backing for BigAds, a blockchain-powered gaming ad platform, highlights Avalanche’s growing focus on the expanding gaming ecosystem. This move may boost long-term demand within the network. Yet, the price faces notable resistance around $23.50, limiting short-term momentum. While broader market optimism tied to ETF developments has improved the mood, AVAX remains in a cautious state. The coin could see gradual growth if gaming adoption expands, though traders are staying patient and selective before taking further positions. BlockDAG Proves It’s Delivering: Miners Start Shipping, Testnet Active In crypto, real delivery is what separates fleeting hype from lasting impact, and BlockDAG has already proven where it stands. It’s not just another promise-filled project; it’s a built, audited, and deployed ecosystem. With live testnets, verified smart contract audits, and global partnerships, including its collaboration with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team , BlockDAG has achieved mainstream visibility and undeniable credibility. The CODE “TGE” grants launch access by rank: top 300 get an instant airdrop, ranks 301–5000 receive it in stages from 30 minutes to 6 hours, and ranks above 5000 get it after 24 hours. BlockDAG is also making a major global move. The project is going live on Binance for an exclusive AMA this Friday, October 24. The AMA is expected to reveal insider updates and new roadmap reveals ahead of Keynote 4: The Launch Note and GENESIS DAY. While others are still talking, BlockDAG is executing. Its testnet is running, miners are actively shipping, and over 4,500+ developers are preparing 350+ EVM-compatible projects for mainnet launch. With nearly $430M raised and 27B coins sold, the Batch 31 presale price of $0.0015 offers one last window before the confirmed $0.05 listing, and buyers aren’t waiting around. This isn’t hype, it’s validation. BlockDAG’s open progress, proven performance, and thorough audits make it the most trusted presale of the decade. In a market flooded with unfulfilled promises, BDAG stands as a project that delivers with tech, transparency, and trust to back it up. For early supporters, this is one of those rare crypto moments where confidence comes not from speculation, but from evidence. When innovation meets execution, momentum turns into movement, and BlockDAG is already leading the way. The Final Takeaway While Cardano’s analysis points to a possible $0.70 breakout and Avalanche’s gaming expansion adds interest, both rely heavily on sentiment-driven movements. BlockDAG, by contrast, has moved beyond speculation. With more than $430 million raised, over 27 billion coins sold, and audits from CertiK and Halborn, its foundation is proven. Its partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team and an expanding base of 4,500+ developers make it stand out as more than another blockchain startup. With the presale’s $0.0015 special rate and live TGE code ahead of Genesis Day on November 26, the project offers a final entry point before major exchange listings. For those assessing opportunities with both short and long-term potential, BlockDAG combines credibility and growth capacity, making it the best crypto to buy today .

XRP Outperforms Major Altcoins with 3% Spike: What’s the Next 1000x Crypto? October 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Yesterday, XRP touched $2.5 again , surpassing many major altcoins and scoring a 3% spike. The hope for new XRP ETF announcements this week is a likely reason for this rally. But the easing geopolitical situation and better-than-expected US inflation data also played a role. Traders took on a more risk-on approach, which bolstered the community sentiment and XRP’s price performance – a session high of $2.56 on Monday. Even now, the 24-hour trading volume is up by 7% to $4.99B. This shows there’s still bullish potential in XRP’s market. Retail traders are once again looking to more promising opportunities and the next 1000x cryptos. Crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) show significant potential with their utility-based initiatives. $HYPER is building the next big Layer-2 for Bitcoin, bringing dApps and smart contracts to the chain, while $SNORT plans to launch the cheapest and fastest Solana trading bot. Read more about Bitcoin Hyper’s plans for 2025 and beyond. Here’s a comprehensive guide on Snorter Token. As Tether Crosses 500M Users, $BEST Emerges as the Next 1000x Crypto October 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC On October 21st, Tether’s ($USDT) CEO Paolo Ardano posted on X about the stablecoin powerhouse hitting 500M verified users. While Circle’s user base is at 87M, Tether is only 58% ahead of USDC by market cap ($182B) . The difference doesn’t add up because most $USDC holders are large institutions and corporates with average balances of $852 as opposed to USDT’s average balance of only $364 per user. With the global stablecoin market nearing $316B , banks like JPMorgan and Citibank are also launching their own dollar-pegged coins, threatening $USDT’s dominance. That said, CEO Paolo Ardoino remains confident in his recent X post, quoting ‘Programmable money is the ultimate social network ,’ hinting at Tether’s broader vision to evolve into a financial infrastructure layer merging payments, DeFi, and social utility. One presale contender mirroring USDT’s stability and structure in a highly volatile and hype-driven crypto space is Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , the native asset of Best Wallet ecosystem.

According to the analyst’s chart, XRP has fallen below the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbons on the 3-day time frame for the first time since 2024. The ribbons, which serve as a visual representation of multiple moving averages layered together, have historically acted as a dynamic area of support and resistance. The chart, captured from Bitstamp, shows XRP trading at around $2.37, positioned beneath the ribbon cluster that once provided price stability throughout much of the past year. The visual highlights two distinct points of interest — one in late 2024 , when XRP rebounded strongly after touching the lower band of the ribbons, and another in 2025, where the price has now moved decisively below it. $XRP trading below the EMA-ribbons for the first time since 2024! pic.twitter.com/zWKSN7q3Ce — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 19, 2025 Historical Comparison and Analyst Observation StephIsCrypto’s post implies that the current technical structure bears resemblance to XRP’s 2024 setup . At that time, the asset briefly consolidated below the ribbon before a notable upward shift. By referencing this comparison, the analyst appears to suggest that the current breach could be a similar prelude to renewed momentum. The EMA ribbons, spanning short to long-term moving averages, have compressed and begun to turn downward — a sign that short-term market sentiment has weakened. Such developments typically prompt traders to assess whether the movement indicates an early reversal or the beginning of a deeper correction phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Interpretation and Community Response Among the responses to the post, one market participant, Nate, referenced past price behavior and noted that similar conditions had preceded bullish expansions. This interpretation adds context to the chart’s implication that short-term weakness could transition into renewed upside, depending on how XRP performs in the weeks ahead. While the broader market has shown mixed reactions, the focus remains on whether XRP can reclaim the ribbon as support — a move that would reinforce technical confidence and possibly restore upward momentum. For now, its position below the EMA structure marks a decisive moment for traders watching for confirmation of the next major trend. StephIsCrypto’s chart emphasizes a historically rare setup that aligns with prior turning points in XRP’s price structure. Whether the current pattern develops into another upward phase will depend on the market’s ability to reestablish support above the EMA ribbons.

In a surprising turn, XRP has surged to the top of Upbit’s charts, recording an impressive $237 million in 24-hour trading volume. The token’s dominance has outpaced Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), leading South Korea’s intensified trading frenzy. Therefore, this renewed momentum signals growing investor confidence in Ripple’s XRP, as the token’s chart forms a classic inverse head-and-shoulders, a bullish setup hinting at a possible breakout. With speculation mounting around a potential surge to $4, retail enthusiasm on Korean exchanges is heating up, echoing the region’s history of driving sharp market rallies. Xaif Crypto observed that Korea’s crypto market often serves as an early indicator of global retail sentiment, and XRP’s dominance in trading volume may signal a shift away from major cryptos toward established, utility-driven assets. Meanwhile, BTC and ETH posted only modest activity, reflecting a temporary rotation of trader interest toward XRP. XRP Eyes $3.10 Target as Classic Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern Forms According to crypto trader Kamran Asghar, XRP is currently forming a classic Inverse Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern, a well-known bullish reversal structure that often signals the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a major upside move. Asghar’s analysis points to a potential rally toward the $3.10 resistance, a level that could mark a significant breakout if confirmed. Notably, this pattern, characterized by three troughs with the middle one (the “head”) being the lowest, suggests that selling pressure is weakening while buyers are regaining control. XRP has spent recent weeks consolidating after months of market indecision, trading within a tight range with its current price being $2.4. Now, the formation of an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern is sparking renewed technical optimism as Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilize. A confirmed breakout above the neckline could trigger a surge of buying momentum, signaling the start of a fresh bullish phase for XRP. Conclusion XRP’s explosive run on Upbit signals a powerful revival in investor confidence and market momentum. Fueled by surging South Korean trading volumes and bullish technical signals, XRP is reclaiming its status as one of crypto’s most dynamic assets. If this trend continues, its dominance on Upbit could ignite broader global rallies, transforming a local trading surge into the spark of a larger market breakout. On the other hand, XRP’s developing inverse head-and-shoulders pattern marks a potentially decisive turning point. A confirmed breakout above the neckline with strong volume could validate the projected $3.10 target, reigniting investor confidence and positioning XRP for a powerful resurgence in the next bullish wave.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-22 10:03:07

At this point, following the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the Solana (SOL) ETF was also approved. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has officially approved the first Solana (SOL) spot ETF issued by China Asset Management (ChinaAMC), local news agency HKET reported. The Hong Kong SFC has approved the first Solana (SOL) spot ETF, making SOL the third cryptocurrency to receive spot ETF approval after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This is the third cryptocurrency spot ETF to be approved after Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the first spot Solana ETF in Asia. According to the report, each trading unit in the SOL ETF will consist of 100 shares, with a minimum investment of approximately US$100, or approximately HK$780. The ETF will be traded on the OSL Exchange, with custody and clearing services provided by OSL Digital Securities. The fund's management fee will be set at 0.99%, while custody and administrative expenses will be limited to 1% of the fund's net asset value. The fund, managed by China Asset Management, is scheduled to list on October 27. China Asset Management, one of Hong Kong's largest fund managers, already operates Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. The company's new Solana product marks the first time a SOL-based fund has been launched in both Asia and the US. *This is not investment advice.

In a landscape where most media outlets gatekeep contributions, sponsorships, and opinion slots, a well-structured press release remains one of the few legitimate entry points left. No, it won’t guarantee a headline on CoinDesk or Bloomberg — but it can get you through the door. Understanding why some stories still need a formal vehicle to be heard helps explain the continued relevance of press releases in crypto PR. The Gatekeeping Problem Top-tier crypto and finance outlets receive hundreds of pitches daily. Most are rejected, ignored, or filtered through strict editorial policies. Even solid projects struggle to secure coverage if they lack prior relationships or proven credibility. That’s where a professional press release still carries weight: it provides a standardized, verifiable source journalists can reference safely. It’s not storytelling — it’s signaling: “this brand is organized, real, and worth checking.” This also ties back to why the structure of press releases still matters in establishing legitimacy , a concept explored in our analysis of the evolving PR toolbox. When Media Won’t Take Submissions Certain media ecosystems — Decrypt, AMBCrypto, or Benzinga — limit external contributions or charge for thought leadership slots.For startups without major budgets or agency access, a distributed press release can bridge that gap, ensuring your brand appears in otherwise inaccessible environments. Media Type Access Level Alternative Entry via Press Release Tier-1 outlets (CoinDesk, Bloomberg) Highly selective Verified releases cited by smaller aggregators that feed into them Mid-tier crypto sites Limited author access Syndicated releases picked up via wire partners Niche outlets (DeFi, GameFi) Moderate Direct submission or crypto wire placement Traditional finance media Strict editorial policy PR wires recognized as legitimate external sources Press releases don’t open every door — but they open enough to matter. Building Presence Through Distribution Networks Wire services like GlobeNewswire, AccessWire, or CoinTelegraph Accelerator aren’t just distribution tools — they’re visibility networks. Each placement builds digital breadcrumbs that journalists, aggregators, and indexers use to verify brand consistency. That network effect makes your project discoverable in ways organic content can’t match initially. The real question isn’t “Who read it on Day 1?” but “Who found you through it weeks later?”. That’s how access transforms into recognition. When a Press Release Is the Only Bridge In some cases, especially during funding rounds or exchange listings, press releases act as the bridge between earned and paid visibility.You may not secure a full interview or editorial coverage yet — but the release plants your flag in the public record. From there, journalists, bloggers, and researchers can cite your brand safely, often leading to follow-up opportunities later.It’s a strategic patience play: visibility now, relationship later. This dynamic explains how formal PR signals build the foundation for future organic exposure , a pattern we discussed when tracing how credibility compounds through consistent media presence. Avoiding the Shortcut Trap Press releases can open doors — but they can also shut them if used poorly.Low-quality or overly promotional releases damage credibility fast, especially with editors who remember names. Before distribution, always check: Is this announcement actually newsworthy? Would a journalist see value in referencing it? If not, you’re not unlocking access — you’re burning it. Checklist: Using Press Releases Strategically for Access Before publishing, make sure your release meets these conditions: The story offers a verifiable milestone or data point The tone is professional and free of hype Contact details and spokesperson info are included The release aligns with topics trending in your target media Distribution covers both crypto and general finance outlets SEO tracking links are embedded for future analytics When each box is checked, the press release becomes more than a broadcast — it becomes a passport. Conclusion Press releases aren’t shortcuts to fame; they’re keys that fit specific locks. Used strategically, they help brands enter conversations that would otherwise stay closed. Their value lies not in viral reach, but in institutional visibility — a traceable presence in the right places. And in an industry where credibility is earned through persistence, being present in the right feeds is often the first step toward being heard.",More News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-22 10:07:10

According to data from CNBC, U.S. stock futures barely moved after Tuesday’s record session, reflecting tension between rising corporate profits and growing global uncertainty. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 57 points, or 0.12%, in early futures trading. S&P 500 futures ticked up by 0.17%, and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered slightly above the flatline. Tuesday had ended with the Dow smashing through 47,000 during the session before closing just under it at a new record. That jump came after solid earnings earlier in the day, including a strong quarter from Coca-Cola. Netflix drops while Intuitive pops in after-hours shake-up The after-hours session on Tuesday wasn’t smooth. Netflix tumbled 6% after missing earnings estimates. Meanwhile, Intuitive Surgical jumped 16% as traders reacted to its much stronger revenue and profit results. These two reactions stood out, setting the tone for how different sectors were being treated by investors looking for clear earnings beats. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed slightly lower Tuesday as traders cooled on high-risk tech names. The S&P 500 stayed flat. A big reason? All eyes are now locked on Friday’s CPI report, one of the few datasets still scheduled during the U.S. government shutdown. That release is expected to guide the next moves from the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to cut the overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points at its October meeting and possibly again in December. On the political side, President Donald Trump told reporters his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping “maybe won’t happen,” which instantly revived investor fears about more tariffs and fresh semiconductor risks tied to China. SoftBank crashes as Asia trades mixed Asia-Pacific markets gave a mixed performance as investors digested new Japanese trade data and adjusted to political shifts. The Nikkei 225 in Japan ended the day nearly flat at 49,307.79, while the Topix rose 0.52% to close at a new high of 3,266.43. But the spotlight was on SoftBank , which sank over 10% before clawing back some losses to close down 5%. That came after its 8.5% rise on Monday. There was no official news tied to the selloff. South Korea was the standout. The Kospi gained 1.56% to 3,883.68, its sixth straight day of gains and a fresh closing record. The Kosdaq, known for its smaller firms, rose 0.76% to 879.15. Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.94% to close at 25,781.77. Notably, shares of Pop Mart, the toymaker behind the viral Labubu dolls, were up 2.4% after reporting a 250% surge in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday. In Mainland China, the CSI 300 ended down 0.33% at 4,592.57. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.71% to 9,030. Indian markets were shut for Diwali. Japan’s exports in September offered a rare upside surprise. They rose 4.2% year over year, breaking a four-month streak of declines. Shipments to Asia were up sharply, helping offset falling sales to the U.S. Over in Europe, the Stoxx 600 was 0.2% lower as of mid-morning in London. The DAX in Germany fell 0.3%, Italy’s FTSE MIB dropped over 0.6%, and France’s CAC 40 declined 0.7%. U.K. markets were the only ones showing any real optimism, with the FTSE 100 climbing over 0.7%. Barclays was one of the few gainers in Europe . The British bank hiked its full-year outlook and announced a £500 million ($667 million) stock buyback in its latest earnings. Its shares gained almost 4% on the day. In the U.K., September’s inflation held steady at 3.8%, beating expectations that it would climb slightly. That added more pressure to the market outlook, especially with bond yields already feeling strain. While equities continue to react to earnings and headlines, the next big trigger is Friday’s inflation report, which traders hope will give the Fed clarity. Until then, it’s a waiting game across every market from Tokyo to New York.

Featuring optimistic rollups and modular architecture, it leverages Ethereum validators to increase throughput while decreasing gas fees. The MNT token serves both as a governance and utility token, allowing users to participate in the ecosystem’s DAO and to pay transaction fees. Useless Coin (USELESS) is a Solana-based meme token that markets itself as having no practical utility — fully embracing the joke. PancakeSwap (CAKE) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on BNB Chain which is designed to allow users to swap BEP-20 tokens. The protocol is a fork of SushiSwap and uses an automated market maker (AMM) to facilitate trades while offering additional services such as initial farm offerings (IFOs), liquidity pools, lotteries and an NFT marketplace. CAKE is the native token of the DEX used to participate in the platform’s liquidity pools, earn rewards via staking, vote on decisions that affect the future direction of the protocol, participate in IFOs and mint NFTs. T-Rize (RIZE) is a next-generation platform unlocking access to real estate and infrastructure-backed digital assets through institutional-grade tokenization. $RIZE empowers retail investors with direct access to AI-rated, yield-bearing real world assets (RWAs). Already leading the market with $300M in projected total value locked (TVL) — including $23M already locked — T-RIZE is backed by a robust pipeline of over $2B in high-quality tokenizable projects. The ecosystem is built on a highly interoperable, public-permissioned blockchain connected to the world’s largest liquidity pools. With privacy-preserving AI that evaluates each asset’s risk and return profile and regulated broker-dealer distribution, $RIZE powers transaction fees, tokenization services and governance — bringing institutional precision to the hands of long-term holders.

He suggested that this resurgence may coincide with a new phase of blockchain competition, adding that Ripple Labs could be preparing to deploy substantial capital. The observation immediately refocused market attention on Ripple’s strategic positioning and the potential implications for XRP’s on-chain activity. The suggestion of large-scale financial deployment has added weight to ongoing speculation about Ripple’s next steps in expanding the utility and reach of its ecosystem. Pay attention to $XRP memes the chain wars have started and Ripple labs are deploying Billions — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) October 19, 2025 Community Response and Market Interpretation The post prompted immediate reaction from market observers and community participants. Commenting on the development, an X user, Crypthub, noted that the XRP community appears re-energized, emphasizing that Ripple’s financial strength has historically preceded phases of market and ecosystem growth. He remarked that whenever Ripple begins deploying capital, it often signals a deliberate push to advance network adoption and reinforce market positioning. His comment further implied that the resurgence of XRP-related memes may indicate the early stages of an organized promotional effort aimed at restoring broader visibility. Such interpretations align with previous patterns where Ripple’s resource deployment coincided with heightened institutional and developer engagement. Observers within the community view this as a potential precursor to more significant developments, particularly in areas related to liquidity management, payments infrastructure, and on-chain integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism and Counterpoints Despite the optimism, not all reactions were supportive. Another X user, Logan, dismissed the excitement, describing XRP as a speculative asset with limited practical value. He suggested that the renewed attention and meme activity may be driven primarily by sentiment rather than substance. This view reflects a persistent divide in market perception between those who regard XRP as a strategically positioned digital asset and those who see its market movements as largely cyclical. At this stage, there is no official confirmation of any large-scale capital deployment by Ripple Labs. However, the growing volume of discussion indicates renewed market curiosity surrounding the company’s next operational phase. Analysts and community members are expected to monitor on-chain data closely for potential indicators of movement, such as increased network activity or capital flows related to institutional operations. The exchange of views surrounding Bitlord’s post illustrates the ongoing tension between speculation and strategy that defines much of the digital asset market. While confirmation remains pending, the heightened engagement around XRP suggests that confidence in Ripple’s capacity to influence market direction persists, reinforcing the asset’s position as one of the most closely watched in the blockchain sector.

This move underscores SBI’s deepening commitment to advancing institutional adoption of the XRP digital asset on a global scale. Evernorth Holdings, founded to drive institutional adoption of XRP, is emerging as a key force in digital asset infrastructure. The company plans to list on Nasdaq under the ticker XRPN through a merger with Armada Acquisition Corp. II (SPAC). The listing and capital raise, projected to surpass $1 billion, position Evernorth among the largest and most pivotal crypto-related SPAC deals to date. According to the announcement , proceeds from the fundraising will be directed primarily toward purchasing XRP on the open market. The goal is to establish one of the world’s largest public XRP treasuries, a strategic reserve aimed at enhancing the token’s institutional utility and market stability. Beyond merely holding XRP, Evernorth plans to actively deploy its assets through institutional lending and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms to generate additional yield and value growth. Therefore, this milestone marks a pivotal shift in the crypto landscape, underscoring the growing synergy between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. SBI’s $200 million investment showcases Japan’s progressive embrace of blockchain technology and reinforces its deep partnership with Ripple, a collaboration that continues to drive the evolution of XRP-powered cross-border payments. Additionally, Evernorth has pledged to have all financial reports independently audited by a leading global firm, reinforcing transparency, strengthening institutional trust, and setting a new benchmark for accountability in the digital asset sector. Therefore, SBI Holdings is actively shaping XRP’s future through strategic investments, deep Ripple partnerships, and accelerating real-world adoption in global payments. Conclusion SBI Holdings’ $200 million investment in Evernorth, backed by Ripple’s strategic support, marks a major leap toward institutional adoption of XRP. Through one of the world’s largest public XRP treasuries, Evernorth seeks to boost liquidity, stability, and real-world utility, bridging traditional finance with decentralized innovation. With audited transparency, a forthcoming Nasdaq listing, and a defined growth roadmap, the initiative positions XRP as a foundational asset in the next era of institutional crypto finance and global financial integration.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-22 11:33:02

That said, both $BNB and $TRX have had the strength to remain in the green up to now. Will this continue, or are they about to follow the rest of crypto to lower levels? M topping pattern confirms for $BNB Source: TradingView An M pattern top has formed for the $BNB price and it looks like this has been confirmed. This would send the price down to the $841 horizontal support level should the measured move play out. While the Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom and ready to turn back up again, signalling upside price momentum, the RSI indicator has dipped below the 51.00 level where it has found good support previously. Big dip down to test support structure for $BNB? Source: TradingView The weekly view for $BNB illustrates how the price probably got ahead of itself. With no decent price structure above $750, the price perhaps needs to come back down to test this level. In fact, coming all the way down to the very strong $676 horizontal area is a pretty good bet, given that even this level has not been tested as support yet. The Stochastic RSI indicators in the weekly time frame show that they have a long way still to go in order to come back to the bottom. This would also corroborate with a big downside reversal still to come. A series of lower highs for $TRX Source: TradingView Since making a local high at $0.37 the $TRX price has been steadily turning over. A series of lower highs do not look as though they will be threatened by the bulls - at least as this current market goes. The price looks as though it might fall back under the $0.32 horizontal support level. If it does so, it can go to the $0.30 band of support which provides a critical market structure level. The Stochastic RSI indicators are also falling which would tend to agree with a dip in the price action. $TRX retests bull market parabola Source: TradingView When viewing the $TRX price in the weekly time frame it can be observed that just like $BTC, $TRX has been following a parabolic curve since the bull market began. Having been drawn back to this curve for a retest, it will be important that the price increases strongly from here or it will face the possibility of falling through it - potentially into a bear market. Much like what has happened with the $BNB price , the $TRX price has left most of its strong price structure a long way behind. Yes, it is currently sitting on a good level of support from the candle tops for the all-time high, but below this, if the $0.30 horizontal level fails, the parabola probably does as well. One bright spot on the horizon for the $BNB price is the Stochastic RSI, whose indicators have reached bottom and could turn back up on Monday. Both $BNB and $TRX are either at a very critical stage in their bull market developments, or they are preparing to descend into what could be big downside reversals, which could even turn into bear markets. Investors and traders watch these two carefully. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.4021, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6614. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.3053, beginning a bearish trend to $0.1795. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bullish as buyers strongly defended support channels. This has resulted in a strong buying pressure. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.4 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX has updated its 2025 roadmap, outlining plans to launch a Telegram trading integration as the platform faces declining earnings.

The transaction, worth some $200 million, has pushed the fund’s total holdings to 803,200 BTC, valued at approximately $86.5 billion, according to data shared by HeyApollo ETF tracker co-founder Thomas Fahrer.

The asset had been crashing prior to the inflows, dropping nearly 3% to an intraday low of $107,552 as it wiped out its weekend gains. The move came alongside a broader crypto market pullback, with total capitalization slipping over 2% to $3.67 trillion. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs outflows contributed to the correction, as BlackRock itself witnessed a $101 million redemption the day prior.

The current crypto cycle is becoming “nearly impossible to read,” according to trading expert Ted Pillows, who cited insider trading controversies and macroeconomic tensions as key culprits.

Among them, Ozak AI has managed to grab attention by raising over $3.74 million while still in its sixth presale stage. It’s not just the numbers that stand out; it’s the consistency in a market where most projects can barely hold investor confidence. Ozak AI has a clear and real structure and a story that actually makes sense. Ozak AI integrates AI and blockchain, which are the next wave of tech. Ozak AI Presale Success Signals Real Confidence in the Token’s Vision When investors pour over $3.74 million into a token that hasn’t even launched yet, something bigger is happening. The Ozak AI presale is now priced at $0.012, heading for a $0.05 listing price, with more than 945 million tokens already sold. The appetite for the project isn’t just about early profits—it’s about belief in what the system can become. Ozak AI is built on a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), allowing it to merge the dependability of blockchain with the distributed storage power of IPFS. It’s a technical mix that keeps data secure, redundant, and traceable, which gives the token a practical use beyond speculation. This approach makes Ozak AI stand out among presale projects that often have no real purpose behind the marketing. Moreover, the protocol has been featured on several PR platforms. This adds to the project’s visibility and authenticity. To further add to its credibility and visibility, Ozak AI has been listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. This is no easy feat, but Ozak AI has been able to achieve it because it offers value and purpose along with real-world utility, which is rarely found in most new projects. How Ozak AI Is Building Trust While Others Rely on Hype In a market full of exaggerated promises, Ozak AI’s strategy feels refreshingly grounded. Data sharing in its ecosystem runs through smart contracts that automatically verify and record transactions without modification. That transparency builds credibility, especially for investors who are tired of “mystery roadmaps” and hidden tokenomics. What’s interesting is how the project has kept its community close through open communication and verifiable milestones. It’s already listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, and its appearance in publications adds another layer of recognition. This visibility is helping Ozak AI attract a more diverse range of investors, from curious retail buyers to early-stage venture funds. Why Presale Tokens Like Ozak AI Are Gaining Ground in 2025 Presales are proving to be one of the few places where smaller investors can still make meaningful entries into crypto. Projects like Ozak AI are offering a more balanced path for growth, as is evident in its recent achievements, where it surpassed $3.7 million in funding. What’s driving interest isn’t just potential profit, but the structure behind it, a decentralized setup that gives participants a sense of fairness and shared ownership. That’s the quiet truth many are missing: presales like Ozak AI represent a changing tone in crypto investing. Investors are starting to prioritize transparency and practicality over hype and flash. And that shift is giving real projects a chance to shine in a crowded field of short-lived tokens.

In this evolving landscape, Ozak AI not only stands out for raising an impressive $3.74 million but also encapsulates the growing investor confidence in presale tokens. The Strategic Growth and Market Positioning of Ozak AI It's not just about the funds raised; the real story is how Ozak AI is positioning itself within the crypto marketplace. With more than 945 million tokens already sold, the project's presale price of $0.012 is on a steady climb towards a $0.05 listing price. The robust investment figures represent not just hopes for lucrative returns but also a strong belief in the project's underlying technology and its long-term vision. Integrating advanced technologies like AI and blockchain, Ozak AI is pioneering a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). This innovative approach utilizes the distributed storage capabilities of IPFS to enhance data security and redundancy, ensuring that the blockchain's reliability is maximized. This strategic blend of technology has not only facilitated the project’s unique selling proposition but also enhanced its visibility and credibility in the market. Acknowledgment by major crypto platforms like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap further solidifies its market presence. Building Investor Trust Through Transparent Practices Unlike many other presale ventures that rely heavily on marketing hype, Ozak AI has laid a foundation of trust with its investors through transparent operations and clear, achievable milestones. The implementation of smart contracts within its ecosystem ensures that all transactions are not only automated but also recorded transparently, enhancing the credibility of the project. Further adding to its appeal is Ozak AI's proactive approach to community engagement and open communication, ensuring that all stakeholders are well-informed and aligned with the project’s goals and progress. Redefining Investment Trends with Presale Tokens Presale tokens like Ozak AI are setting new standards in the crypto investment realm. They offer a blend of early investment advantages while also ensuring that these projects have a practical and utilitarian focus rather than just speculative potential. It's a shift that highlights a broader trend in the crypto market, where investors are increasingly valuing transparency and real-world utility over mere speculative gains.

Ripple’s token hasn’t been left behind either. It’s been inching upward, showing the first real signs of recovery in months. The question many traders are asking now is simple: can XRP really make another run toward the $3 mark before November? While that’s playing out, a newer name has been getting unexpected attention, Remittix (RTX). And now, it isn’t another quick pump play; analysts and crypto enthusiasts call it the next Ripple. Let’s break down everything that’s currently unfolding. XRP Outlook: Is $3 Back on the Table? Ripple’s push into institutional markets via partnerships and liquidity corridors in Europe and Asia is sparking conversations and drawing serious attention from investors. Clear movement above that the $3 price mark, which is a critical zone, could trigger a bullish sequence toward $3.40, and then perhaps beyond if momentum lasts. However, a stronger rally will need more than just hope. It will take steady institutional demand, cleaner regulations, and proof that Ripple’s global payment network is expanding again. The Rise of Payment-Focused Crypto Projects Right now, investors aren’t taking a breather as they are now more focused on tokens that combine blockchain speed with real-world utility, and that’s exactly where Remittix comes in. Remittix is gaining traction because it bridges the best aspects of crypto and traditional finance in what it calls ‘PayFi,’ a hybrid model that allows users to send crypto payments directly to any global bank account, with the recipient receiving fiat instantly. Imagine paying your family overseas in Solana or Ethereum, and they receive the exact dollar amount in their bank account; no delays, no crypto wallet required, and no hidden fees. That’s what’s fueling buzz around Remittix right now. Why Investors Are Turning To Remittix (RTX) With over 40,000 investors already onboard and RTX currently priced at $0.1166, early adopters believe they’ve found the next major disruptor in the $183 trillion banking industry. The team behind Remittix has also been making significant progress, securing listings on major platforms (including BitMart and LBank ), completing a CertiK audit, and running large community reward campaigns, including a $250,000 crypto giveaway and 15% USDT referral bonuses. Remittix’s unique approach offers several standout advantages: Flat transfer fees without any hidden FX or wire costs. It’s global as it supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies and over 30 fiat currencies. Full transparency and security as its smart contracts are verified and audited. These features position Remittix among the major payment platforms, including Stripe, Wise, and PayPal. It paves a smoother, easier path for crypto-native businesses in dire need of seamless on/off ramps between blockchain and banking. Investing in Ripple Vs. Remittix While Ripple’s path toward $3 looks probable, the broader payment revolution in crypto seems to be shifting toward utility-first projects like Remittix. The ability to move seamlessly between crypto and fiat without complexity or high fees is a breakthrough the market has long needed. As institutional confidence returns and global adoption grows, XRP might regain its shine. Still, the spotlight this time may also belong to Remittix, the PayFi innovator redefining what cross-border payments can look like in 2025 and beyond.

The surge has lifted the privacy coin back into the spotlight and forced traders to question if the gains can persist. Rally driven by Coinbase and institutional flows The immediate spark is a string of high-profile endorsements and infrastructure moves. On October 22, Coinbase’s Base announced privacy feature integration using Iron Fish’s zero-knowledge proof technology, and markets responded by treating ZEC as a proxy for institutional-grade privacy plays. That narrative gained reinforcement from a newly launched Grayscale ZEC Fund , which now holds roughly $29.89 million in assets despite a 2.50% expense ratio, drawing in institutional dollars that otherwise avoid small altcoins. Retail and futures activity have also accelerated, with futures open interest topping roughly $236 million, and 24-hour volumes exceeding $1 billion, signalling both speculative and directional interest. Technical outlook: Can Zcash price hold? Technical analysis presents a mixed picture. ZEC has cleared a critical pivot at $272.68 and shows bullish MACD and RSI divergence, prompting targets in the $284–$314 zone. There is also a classic double-top pattern forming with a peak near $297 and a neckline around $185, a formation that often precedes a steep reversal. Market analysts have flagged $188.50 as a critical support level, with $155.02 listed as the next buffer if sellers push harder. Source: CoinMarketCap Wyckoff patterns and percentage price oscillator crossovers complicate the bullish case, with market analysis showing ZEC has moved from accumulation into potential distribution. If price action reverses and breaks the $185–$189 area, further markdown toward longer-term moving averages becomes a realistic outcome. Supply squeeze and what it means Another structural driver is the growing Zcash shielded pool. Roughly 4.5–4.6 million ZEC currently sit in shielded addresses, representing about 27.5% of the circulating supply, and those coins are less likely to hit exchanges. That dynamic tightens effective liquidity and gives upward pressure when demand rises. In addition, exchange net flows recently flipped negative by about $4.06 million in 24 hours, which aligns with on-chain evidence of retail accumulation rather than wholesale sell-offs. At the same time, whale metrics have cooled, with the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) for large holders dropping significantly from earlier October highs, suggesting cautious behaviour among big players. The result is a market where smaller buyers help move the price while large holders watch from the sidelines. Regulatory uncertainty around privacy tools also remains an overhang and could change sentiment quickly. What investors should watch out for In the near term, ZEC needs to hold above the $272 pivot to keep bulls confident. A close below $247 would likely trigger profit-taking and raise pressure toward $188–$155. Traders should monitor the shielded pool trends and Base’s privacy rollout metrics closely; those adoption indicators matter more now than usual because they underpin the narrative. Traders should also watch Grayscale inflows and futures positioning for signs that institutions continue to support the rally. For now, price action balances on a knife-edge between momentum and technical risk. Over the past day, Zcash (ZEC) has surged by 7.7% with a 24-hour trading range of between $251.82 and $304.45, which shows heightened intraday volatility. While the Zcash price rally has momentum, sustaining these gains demands continued on-chain adoption and steady institutional flow.

Digitap blurring the line between crypto & cash drives bold 50X growth forecasts,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/22/eth-sol-rebound-digitap-blurring-the-line-between-crypto-cash-drives-bold-50x-growth-forecasts/,"Ethereum and Solana are testing investor patience again. Prices are holding near key levels, and traders are hoping the next breakout reignites momentum. But away from the noise of old favorites, a quiet shift is taking place. Digitap ($TAP) has something tangible to show — a live app that lets users hold, send, and spend both crypto and cash from one place. It’s private, audited, and already linked to Visa. Analysts watching the presale say this project could be what the market has been waiting for — a real product with a real chance at 50x growth. Where Ethereum and Solana stand now Ethereum and Solana still sit at the heart of the crypto world. Ethereum powers the biggest share of DeFi and NFT projects. Solana shines for its speed and affordability. Both projects have been tested over time and have proven they can last. Ethereum recently bounced back from a dip to around $3,800 and now trades near $4,000. The network’s upcoming upgrades aim to handle more transactions and cut costs, which keeps it attractive to institutions and long-term investors. Solana trades close to $196 and remains one of the stronger performers this year. Its developer base stays busy, especially in gaming and financial apps that use blockchain directly. Source: TradingView/ETH ETH and SOL price prediction: rebound or reset? Ethereum’s price action finally looks lively again. After drifting lower, it bounced back with a clear green run, which shows buyers are stepping in. Holding above $3,950–$4,000 is key. Analysts say that staying in that range could spark a short rally toward $4,100 and $4,250, with an extended target near $4,700 if momentum builds . Solana is also trying to regain ground. The token broke its short-term downtrend with stronger trading volume, lifting from about $184 to $196. The next big hurdle is $200, which serves as a psychological pivot. A break above could send SOL to $210–$220, and maybe $245–$250 later on. Source: TradingView/SOL Both tokens are forming higher lows, which usually indicates that confidence is returning. Analysts think a few more weeks of steady sentiment could turn these small rallies into something bigger. Still, for most investors, Ethereum and Solana are now slow-growth plays. Their market caps are enormous, so even solid rebounds may only bring moderate returns. That’s why traders are turning their focus to smaller, high-utility presale projects with room to multiply fast. Digitap builds the future of finance Digitap is the world’s first omni-bank, which connects crypto and traditional money in one working app. The platform is already live on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Users can register, hold funds, send money, and spend anywhere Visa is accepted. This makes Digitap unique. Most projects in the presale stages are still building. Digitap already delivers. The app allows users to manage multiple currencies and switch between crypto and cash instantly. The built-in Visa card works online and in stores. There are also virtual cards for secure digital payments and physical ones for ATMs. Privacy is central to Digitap’s design. Users can choose a no-KYC setup that protects personal information. All transfers are encrypted, and no data is shared or tracked. Funds are stored in regulated offshore accounts, which creates a strong security layer. Digitap’s audits by Solidproof and Coinsult confirm the platform’s security and transparency. These steps make the presale stand out in a market full of uncertainty. $TAP price prediction: analysts see 50x upside Digitap’s $TAP token is drawing intense interest across the market. Priced at $0.0194 in the current presale and rising to $0.0268 in the next round, this project stands out as having a working product already in use. Analysts describe $TAP as an asymmetric play — limited downside and major upside. One of the reasons lies in its design: half of all platform profits go toward buying back and burning tokens, reducing supply as activity increases. Staking rewards of up to 124% APR before launch and 100% APR afterward create steady token demand. Forecasts suggest that as Digitap’s user base expands, $TAP could climb to $1 by 2026, which would represent a 50x gain from today’s price. This projection is based on expected app growth, consistent token burns, and strong user engagement. Top crypto to buy right now? Ethereum and Solana remain strong assets, but their size limits how fast they can grow. Digitap, on the other hand, is still small but already running at full speed. It connects crypto and cash through one live platform, with a token that directly benefits from real-world use. For those looking for projects with big potential, Digitap represents that opportunity. The price is still low, the technology is live, and the ecosystem continues to expand. If forecasts hold true, $TAP could rise far beyond its current level, which would turn early believers into the biggest winners of the next bull cycle. Digitap is Live NOW.

53496753,611415,1761134443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53496753.jpeg,Challenges In Stablecoin Law Stalls Senate’s Progress On New Crypto Bill – Report,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-law-stalls-senates-progress-on-new-bill/,"According to a recent report by Roll Call, US Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for digital assets in Congress, is delaying the upcoming crypto market structure bill as the Senator is reluctant to revisit a provision from the recently passed GENIUS Act, which prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest payments. Lawmakers Split Over Crypto Interest Provisions Senator Lummis is said to be resisting pressures from both Republicans and Democrats to change the interest language in the stablecoin bill. The banking industry argues that this provision creates a loophole that allows crypto exchanges to offer rewards, effectively enabling them to pay interest. Lummis shared her perspective with reporters, stating, “I’m of the opinion that we should leave the stablecoin bill alone. We’ve got enough problems with market structure.” In response, the crypto industry has launched a campaign to maintain the existing stablecoin rewards policy. Opponents of crypto interest are advocating for the rewards issue to be addressed in the new market structure legislation currently in development. This bill aims to establish rules for the operation and oversight of digital asset markets. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee and sponsor of the stablecoin bill, acknowledged the complexity surrounding the question of crypto interest, stating, “This is something that’s going to require a lot more attention from my colleagues to address. Everything is up in the air.” Crypto And Banking Lobbies Clash Last month, Senate Banking Republicans updated a draft of the market structure bill, which Chairman Tim Scott hoped to advance by the end of September. However, this deadline was missed due to various obstacles, including the conflict between banking and crypto lobbies regarding stablecoin interest and the bill’s approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). A group of crypto-friendly Senate Democrats recently proposed amendments to the bill that were rejected by Republicans and the crypto industry. These Democrats want the legislation to uphold the intent of prohibiting interest or yield paid by stablecoin issuers, whether directly or indirectly through affiliates. Chairman Scott appears to be prioritizing the concerns of Democrats over those of Republicans regarding crypto exchange rewards . He has postponed a markup of the bill to allow Democrats more time to engage with the legislative text, as noted by his spokesperson Jeff Naft. Lawmakers are hesitant to predict when the committee might reach a consensus for a markup. “We’re trying to get a date for a markup,” Lummis remarked. When asked when that might be, she replied, “When we can agree on a date for a markup.” Adding to the complexity of advancing the bill is the looming partial government shutdown. Democrats have indicated that they prefer to finalize the base text of the bill before proceeding to a markup. Over 320,000 Letters Sent To Senate Offices Crypto advocates are pushing for swift action on market structure legislation this year. Mason Lynaugh, community director for Stand with Crypto, stated: The Senate must act quickly and deliberately to pass market structure legislation. Congress has the opportunity to position America as a global leader in the crypto industry, achievable only through effective market structure legislation. The group reported sending over 320,000 letters from more than 160,000 participants to Senate offices in recent weeks, urging lawmakers to reject a new anti-consumer initiative from the banking industry aimed at eliminating stablecoin rewards.

The Galaxy XR was co-developed with Google on the software side and with Qualcomm, which supplied the chip powering it. According to Samsung, the headset transforms the surroundings into a virtual canvas, where everything, from apps to videos, appears to float in front of users. The headset’s cameras also stream the surroundings to the built-in 4K displays, allowing the user to stay aware of obstacles as they move. Moreover, commands can be issued with hands, voice, or a mix of both. Unveiled in 2024 as Project Moohan, it’s the first headset powered by Android XR, a new platform for smart glasses and headsets built on Android and Google’s Gemini assistant from the ground up. Samsung is working on other eyewear launches with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster The Galaxy XR somewhat mirrors the look of Meta’s devices, and is now available for $1,799, approximately half the price of Apple’s Vision Pro . However, some have pointed out that the headset also bears a striking resemblance to Apple’s headset. Nonetheless, despite its similarities to Apple and Meta’s products, the company says it’s paving the way for more AI eyewear to be developed in collaboration with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. Google’s AI assistant Gemini will power both the Galaxy XR and the future glasses in development. A standout feature is the ability to auto-spatialize all video content on the platform. That means, by default, if you watch a YouTube video or even a local clip, Android XR will add depth and make it feel more immersive, and it worked fairly decently. Another addition is a new spatial multi-view feature in YouTube, which allows you to watch four sports streams simultaneously, for example. At a Samsung demo in New York, the company unveiled the Gemini controls on its XR headset. It showed Gemini can arrange apps in a virtual workspace, get answers about landmarks in Google Maps, or prompt Veo, Google’s AI video creator, similar to OpenAI’s Sora, to create a video. Though on the downside, Gemini relies on cloud processing, which means your headset data is transmitted over the internet to Google. Unlike Apple, Google lacks a private cloud for its AI systems, which means using Gemini could expose personal activity on the headset. Samsung had not decided when to release the product to the market Samsung has been debating for a while whether to release the Galaxy XR headset to the market. The firm commented, “We have been agonizing over when to bring the product to the market, and considering various factors such as technology evolution and market situation, we believe that now is the best timing.” Speaking last week, executives from Google and Samsung argued that extended reality headsets could finally find broader appeal with the integration of Google’s multimodal AI, which can interpret text, images, and video data. Anshel Sag, a principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, noted that Google’s participation was influencing the XR ecosystem. He noted that the firm’s software added significant value, estimated at around $1,000, and that it encouraged full user engagement with Gemini. So far, Meta commands about 80% of the VR headset market, far ahead of Apple’s share or Samsung’s. ChatGPT’s creator, OpenAI, has also entered the device market with a $6.5 billion purchase of Jony Ive’s io Products, aiming to create new hardware tailored for the AI age. Google hasn’t revealed a software update strategy for Android XR, unlike its phones; instead, it stated that it expects to issue regular software updates, some of which will fix bugs, while others will add features.

The integration allows shoppers to pay using digital assets from over 300 wallets across 12 blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and select memecoins. The payment infrastructure is powered by Flexa Payments, a solution that enables crypto transactions to be processed seamlessly within existing retail systems, both in physical stores and in mobile apps. The new feature extends to Bealls, Bealls Florida, and Home Centric stores. Flexa co-founder Trevor Filter praised Bealls’ move, calling it a historic moment for traditional retail and a sign of how fast the payment industry is evolving. Chairman Matt Beall described the crypto rollout as part of a long-term modernization effort designed to prepare the company for “the next 110 years of innovation.” “Digital currency will reshape how the world transacts, and Bealls is proud to be at the forefront of that transformation. Our partnership with Flexa is about more than payments; it’s about preparing for the future of commerce and continuing to innovate for the next 110 years,” said Matt Beall, Chairman & CEO, Bealls Inc. Flexa also emphasized that its system automatically updates supported assets and requires minimal technical integration, making it easier for retailers to expand crypto support over time. Other Major Retailers Are Moving Toward Crypto Payments Bealls is joining a growing list of well-known companies exploring digital assets. Some notable developments include: Starbucks and Burger King have tested Bitcoin-related reward or payment integrations Overstock and Newegg allow direct crypto payments for products PayPal and Shopify now support crypto transactions through partner systems Industry analysts believe more retailers will follow, driven by younger customers, cross-border shoppers, and lower transaction fees compared to traditional card networks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-22 12:03:46

Now, new developments in Ripple’s ecosystem are breathing life back into that theory, suggesting that the “hidden XRP price reset” may be more than just speculative fiction. The Return of the Shane Ellis Theory The Shane Ellis theory originated from a 2018 post that dissected how market mechanics could trigger a massive repricing of XRP in an instant. The premise was simple but radical: if global payment corridors powered by XRP went live and began moving trillions of dollars in value, market makers and liquidity providers would need to instantly revalue XRP to maintain liquidity. For years, this idea was dismissed as implausible, a dream too extreme for traditional finance to accommodate. But in recent months, discussions around institutional adoption, liquidity infrastructure, and Ripple’s global partnerships have made this concept newly relevant. JUST DROPPED: The Hidden $XRP Price Reset They Tried to Bury (Shane Ellis Was Right). pic.twitter.com/aj4l1RFskm — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 22, 2025 Ripple Bull Winkle Revives the Debate In a video posted on X, respected researcher and XRP advocate Ripple Bull Winkle reignited the conversation. He asserted that what was once deemed “speculative” is now aligning closely with ongoing technological and financial developments tied to Ripple’s ecosystem. “The numbers don’t lie,” Bull Winkle emphasized. “The Shane Ellis theory from a 2018 post predicted XRP’s price wouldn’t just rise gradually, but revalue overnight once global liquidity corridors went live. It is not hype. This is all about mechanics.” He elaborated further, comparing the XRP liquidity model to a toll road: “If trillions in payments start flowing through XRP, the market has to reprice it instantly so liquidity does not run dry. Think of it like a toll road, everyone. If the whole world starts driving through, the toll price is going to skyrocket overnight.” Liquidity Corridors and Institutional Integration Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network already embodies the type of mechanism Ellis envisioned, using XRP to settle payments instantly without the need for pre-funded accounts. The recent expansion of ODL corridors, particularly in regions like Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, signals that real-world liquidity routes are no longer theoretical. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Furthermore, Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin in December 2024, created a new bridge between fiat systems and crypto liquidity. Combined with Ripple’s strategic acquisitions of payments firms and its partnerships with banks and central institutions, this network infrastructure gives Ellis’s framework renewed credibility. A Liquidity-Driven Revaluation Model What makes the Ellis model particularly intriguing is that it doesn’t rely on speculation, hype, or retail demand. Instead, it’s rooted in liquidity mechanics, how markets automatically adjust prices to balance massive inflows of capital. If global settlement systems begin routing significant transaction volumes through XRP, markets would be forced to recalibrate the asset’s value to prevent liquidity shortages. In Bull Winkle’s words, “This is a liquidity-driven re-evaluation model, and now companies tied to Ripple are building the exact mechanism that Shane Ellis described back in 2018.” From Theory to Potential Reality Whether or not a dramatic overnight revaluation actually occurs, the framework that once seemed purely speculative is now intersecting with tangible progress. As Ripple’s payment corridors mature and more institutions integrate XRP for real-time settlements, the financial world edges closer to testing Ellis’s liquidity theory on a global scale. For now, Ripple Bull Winkle’s analysis stands as a stark reminder: the hidden mechanics of financial infrastructure often determine the future of value far more than speculation ever could.

Right now, one project has been turning heads in a way that feels different. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has built such strong momentum in its presale that some analysts are already talking about a potential 5000% increase from today’s price levels. Alongside Little Pepe, there are also two other tokens worth watching in 2025, CREPE and REAL. Each has its own story and upside, but the spotlight is clearly leaning toward LILPEPE. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Does More As of October 18, the LILPEPE presale is in stage 13 with each token priced at $0.0022. According to Investing.com , the presale has already raised more than $26.3 million and is over 95% sold out. This momentum shows there’s real belief in the project, not just meme hype. What makes LILPEPE different is its mix of meme culture with genuine infrastructure. It’s building a Layer 2 network designed for meme tokens, offering faster and cheaper transactions. It also has sniper bot protection, which keeps launches fair, and a zero tax buy and sell system, making it attractive for both whales and smaller investors. There’s also the community side. The $777k Giveaway already has over 469,500 entries, and the Mega Giveaway for presale stages 12 to 17 has drawn more than 80,300 entries. These aren’t small numbers; they show real people are getting involved. With whales also loading up during the presale, LILPEPE is building strength on multiple fronts. Because it launches from a zero market cap, the upside is massive. Analysts believe that with exchange listings and utility growth, a 5000% increase is possible, taking today’s $0.0022 token to around $0.11 if things line up. That kind of projection may sound bold, but in a space where meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hit billions in market cap, it’s not out of reach. Crepe (CREPE): The Wild Card Next up is CREPE, trading around $0.000045 on CoinGecko . Over the past week, it has bounced between $0.000043 and $0.000049, showing the volatility you’d expect from a microcap. Technically, CREPE has shown bursts of momentum. Its low base price means even a small inflow of capital can create huge swings upward. Momentum indicators suggest there’s still room to run before it gets overextended. It’s also highly sensitive to catalysts like new listings or community pushes. For 2025, a bold bullish scenario puts CREPE at $0.0045, which would be a 100x increase from today’s level. Even a smaller rally, say 50x, would send it toward $0.00225. These are aggressive assumptions, of course, but with such a tiny starting point, CREPE offers asymmetric risk and reward. Real (REAL): The Steady Builder Finally, there’s REAL (Real Metaverse), trading at about $0.0027 as of October 18 on CoinGecko . Its daily volume is modest, but that also means small news could create outsized price reactions. REAL has shown consistent trending bursts rather than random noise. It benefits from volatility, since even small price moves equal big % shifts. The project is tied to the metaverse and tokenized asset space, a sector that could regain traction in the coming years. A moderate 2025 outlook puts REAL between $0.0135 and $0.0270, which would be a 5x to 10x increase from its current price. That’s not the most explosive return compared to meme plays, but it gives REAL a place in a balanced speculative portfolio. Conclusion Crypto is always risky, but it’s also full of opportunities if you know where to look. CREPE might explode if momentum carries it, REAL could quietly multiply in value if the metaverse narrative returns, but Little Pepe is the one making the strongest case right now. With its zero market cap launch, whale confidence, massive giveaways, and upcoming exchange listings, the possibility of a 5000% increase is what makes it such a compelling choice.

Data from market intelligence provider Santiment posted earlier today shows these three topics leading social discussions, highlighting a market driven as much by emotion as by fundamentals. Bitcoin’s Rotation from Gold and the GME Revival According to Santiment, Bitcoin continues to dominate trading chatter after jumping from $109,000 to nearly $114,000 on October 21. The move followed remarks by the U.S. Federal Reserve about granting crypto firms access to its payment network, a development that spurred optimism across the market. Analysts on X noted that capital appears to be shifting from gold to Bitcoin, reversing the precious metal’s recent rally and hinting at growing investor confidence in digital assets. Furthermore, data from Bloomberg also revealed that large Bitcoin holders are exchanging their coins for shares in U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock’s IBIT, which has reportedly confirmed more than $3 billion worth of such swaps. The flagship cryptocurrency’s market value now stands at roughly $2.16 trillion, trading near $108,000 at the time of this writing, down 4.4% in the last seven days but still up 60% year-on-year. Meanwhile, the term “GME” has also exploded across crypto social feeds, mirroring 2021’s meme-stock craze. Santiment says traders are comparing GameStop’s short interest to that of AMC and Beyond Meat (BYND), with speculation of another short squeeze. While GME itself is not a crypto token, its connection to retail trading culture has renewed talk of cross-market sentiment, linking meme stocks and speculative crypto assets. Chainlink also entered the discussion after participating in the Federal Reserve’s Payments Innovation Conference, where it showcased its role in bridging traditional finance and DeFi. Ethereum’s Governance Drama, Tether’s Expansion, and Kadena’s Collapse Ethereum is also in the headlines following internal tensions within the Ethereum Foundation. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal recently criticized Ethereum’s “elite” governance, prompting Vitalik Buterin to respond with public praise for Polygon’s contributions. This exchange reignited questions about leadership and decentralization within the world’s second-largest blockchain. Currently, ETH is trading around $3,846, down 8% this week and almost 14% in the past fortnight per data from CoinGecko. Tether has also drawn attention after surpassing 500 million users across its stablecoin products. According to Santiment, online debate is focused on the company’s asset backing, particularly its growing BTC reserves and the diversification of Tether Gold (XAUT). Supporters say Tether’s reach gives it unmatched influence in crypto markets, while critics are questioning its transparency. Elsewhere, the recent collapse of the Kadena blockchain shook smaller-cap investors after the Layer-1 project said it was shutting down due to market conditions. The KDA token plunged nearly 60% within hours of the announcement, trading at just $0.086, its lowest in over three years. Part of the conversations around the topic are centered on speculation that insider selling may have occurred ahead of the news.

The officials said it’s a mix of import duties and slower public spending that is now apparently working to narrow the fiscal gap. During the three months ending in June, government outlays rose just 0.2% compared to last year, a huge plunge from previous quarters, when increases ranged between 7.1% and 28.5%. In the third quarter this year, spending was down 2.5% compared with a year earlier. The Treasury said that tariff revenues will bring in around $300 billion in 2025, with projections climbing to $400 billion in 2026 if monthly inflows continue. “We are going to be in much better shape than people think,” said Joe Lavorgna, economic counsellor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. “Most of the time people come in and think it’s business as usual, but there’s no question that the Trump administration has made rapid progress on tariffs.” Tariff revenue and spending slowdown drive fiscal shift Counsellor Lavorgna added that much of the deficit’s improvement started in April, right along with stronger tariff receipts and weaker federal outlays amid Elon Musk’s DOGE phase . “On the revenue side, we’re getting a lot more from tariffs. More importantly is that spending isn’t growing as quickly,” he said. The Treasury believes these trends show the government is moving toward the president’s goal of cutting the deficit without triggering an economic slowdown. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that tariffs could help reduce the deficit by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade. Still, the same CBO analysis estimates that Trump’s major spending bills will add about $4.1 trillion in new debt. The Treasury, however, argues that those projections ignore the growth effects of tax cuts and new business incentives designed to expand output. Treasury said the administration’s approach is based on a simple equation: higher tariff income and slower spending growth should translate to a smaller fiscal gap by 2028. The U.S. currently runs a deficit equal to roughly 6% of GDP, even with unemployment at near-record lows. Bessent has publicly set a target of 3% by the end of Trump’s second term. The Treasury says it is confident in that goal, pointing to reduced quarterly outlays and the steady stream of tariff collections as proof that the government’s balance sheet is already stabilizing. At press time, the 10-year yield is at 3.963%, the 2-year note has dipped slightly to 3.457%, and the 30-year bond is near 4.546%, according to data from CNBC. IMF questions progress as Treasury yields remain flat The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is less optimistic . In a report last week, it said the U.S. is unlikely to cut its deficit from current levels, calling it the widest among developed economies. The fund blamed both Biden’s and Trump’s administrations for letting the national debt pile up. The IMF’s position stands in direct contrast to the Trump team’s view that the Treasury’s fiscal tightening is beginning to deliver results. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields were steady on Wednesday, as investors waited for the next batch of inflation data during a government shutdown now stretching into its fourth week. Markets are now focused on Friday’s Consumer Price Index report, the first major data point since the shutdown began. Analysts at the CME Group say the CPI release will help investors read inflation trends ahead of the Federal Reserve’s October meeting, as all other official economic reports remain frozen.

The partnership is part of World’s push beyond identity verification into decentralized applications, and it follows a milestone of 100 million Mini App downloads. At the same time, Jupiter, the Solana-based decentralized exchange, launched its own prediction market focused on the upcoming Formula One Mexico Grand Prix. Powered by Kalshi, the initiative combines regulatory credibility and on-chain efficiency to deliver a fast, transparent, and engaging trading experience. With prediction markets hitting record volumes above $2 billion in weekly trades, driven by platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi, these integrations show how decentralized ecosystems are changing into vibrant hubs where finance, entertainment, and real-world events intersect. World App Adds Polymarket World, the digital identity project that was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is moving into prediction markets through a new integration with Polymarket. The partnership was announced on Tuesday, and it brings Polymarket’s betting functionality directly to the World App. This allows users to place wagers on global events using Circle’s USDC stablecoin or World’s native WLD token. Announcement from World According to the announcement, the Polymarket Mini App is now available in the World App in countries where the service is permitted. Users in restricted areas, including New York state, will not have access to WLD due to regulatory limitations around token distribution. The company clarified that “World Assets and World Foundation are not responsible for the availability of WLD on third-party platforms.” The move is part of World’s growing ambition to expand beyond its original digital identity vision and into broader decentralized applications. It also follows a big milestone earlier this month when the company surpassed 100 million Mini App downloads . The Mini App ecosystem was launched in October of 2024, and it enables developers to build web applications natively integrated into World App. By March 2025, World reported having over 150 Mini Apps and $8.8 million worth of WLD transacted across them. The platform now spans 160 countries, with more than 14 million verified unique human users and a total user base of over 30 million. World’s integration with Polymarket also comes as prediction markets are experiencing record-breaking activity. Data from Dune Analytics shows weekly trading volumes surpassed $2 billion for the first time in mid-October, driven largely by Polymarket, which captured over half of all trading volume. Kalshi, which is Polymarket’s main competitor, accounted for almost $950 million. Weekly prediction market volume (Source: Dune Analytics ) Institutional interest is accelerating as well. Polymarket recently secured a $2 billion investment from the Intercontinental Exchange, while Kalshi raised $300 million in a round led by Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. This surge in market activity proves how on-chain prediction platforms are quickly maturing into a new frontier of decentralized finance. Jupiter Launches F1 Prediction Market Meanwhile, decentralized exchange Jupiter launched its own prediction market, debuting with an event focused on the upcoming Formula One Mexico Grand Prix. The new platform allows users to bet on who will win the race, which takes place on Oct. 27 at 19:00 UTC and spans 71 laps. Participants can choose from leading drivers like Max Verstappen, Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, and George Russell, among others. The prediction market is powered by Kalshi, which brings liquidity and credibility to Jupiter’s initiative. This collaboration also provides users with a more secure and compliant environment to speculate on real-world outcomes. By leveraging Solana’s high-speed network, Jupiter wants to offer a fast, low-cost, and engaging way for traders and fans to participate in global events. Mexican Grand Prix of 2023 As mentioned before, prediction markets have seen a lot of growth as they merge elements of finance, entertainment, and social interaction. The fact that the leading platforms Kalshi and Polymarket together recently surpassed $2 billion in weekly trading volume is impressive enough, and it set a new record high for the industry. Now, Jupiter’s entry into this space suggests that there is increasing competition and innovation as decentralized exchanges look to diversify beyond just traditional crypto trading. In this beta phase , Jupiter implemented several safeguards to maintain market stability, including a global maximum of 100,000 contracts and a cap of 1,000 contracts per individual position. Traders can buy and sell “yes” or “no” shares tied to their chosen outcomes, with share prices determined by market demand.

Waller said Bitcoin “was going to end up being something like electronic gold,” describing the asset as a non-yielding store of value whose price is sustained by collective belief rather than cash flows. The remarks came on October 21, 2025, during a “Crypto in America” livestream, and they track with Waller’s longer-running view that bitcoin functions more like a belief-driven commodity than a payments instrument. Bitcoin Is ‘Like Electronic Gold’ “Look, I have always argued that Bitcoin was going to end up being something like electronic gold. It’s a store of value. It promises no return. It’s just, you buy it and hold it for some appreciation. That’s exactly what you do. It’s commodities like gold. That’s it. There’s nothing wrong with it. It has a positive price. It doesn’t have any fundamental value. I don’t think gold has really any fundamental value either,” Waller said, before adding that assets like gold and BTC can sustain prices through “belief equilibrium”—the expectation that someone else will pay more later. The “electronic gold” framing is not new for Waller. In prior appearances, he has argued that most crypto assets have little intrinsic worth but that bitcoin sits apart as a wealth-preservation vehicle, akin to collectibles or precious metals that persist because markets accept them as stores of value. In one such discussion, he put it plainly: “Bitcoin to me is basically electronic gold… It doesn’t have any fundamental intrinsic value, but that’s okay.” JUST IN: Fed Governor Waller says Bitcoin is “like electronic gold.” pic.twitter.com/IOY1892pKs — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 21, 2025 Waller’s latest comments land as the Fed itself convenes policy and technology circles around digital assets and payments innovation. Coverage of his October 21 remarks—delivered as part of the central bank’s opening to a payments-innovation agenda —emphasized both his characterization of BTC and his suggestion that the Fed should explore narrower access models to its rails for innovators, an implicit nod to crypto-native firms. The “digital gold” analogy has also been adopted—sometimes quite explicitly—by Waller’s boss. In December 2024, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at the New York Times DealBook Summit that people use bitcoin “as a speculative asset,” calling it “like gold—it’s just virtual and digital,” and stressing that BTC competes with gold, not the US dollar. Powell’s phrasing has since been widely cited as the clearest articulation from a sitting Fed Chair that BTC’s closest analogue is gold. Powell’s 2024 comments also echoed an even earlier stance: in testimony and public remarks dating back years, he has repeatedly described bitcoin as a speculative store of value “like gold,” a view that markets have tended to interpret as de-emphasizing bitcoin’s near-term role in payments while acknowledging its entrenchment as a bearer asset in portfolios. Together, the Waller and Powell statements further entrench a delineation that has become common among monetary officials: BTC as a non-yielding, belief-anchored store of value, distinct from both bank money and stablecoins designed for transactional use. Meanwhile, Fed governor Barr recently warned that the GENIUS Act could shield Bitcoin from the central bank’s oversight.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $13.41, with a possible maximum trading value of $14.30 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $21.45 and $23.24, with an average price of $22.35. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

The coin is currently trading at $2.40 after two days of corrections. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 1.07% of its value in the last 24 hours. This creates an unfavorable environment for long-position traders, as the altcoin is shedding value once again after a bearish tide observed since yesterday.

The coin’s price has decreased to a low of $2.40 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 1.07 percent of its value. Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts also project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling pressure took hold, bringing the price to $2.40 during the day. The RSI decreased to 39.25 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.47 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $23.24 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that Ripple CTO David Schwartz is stepping back from his daily duties at Ripple Labs after more than 13 years at the firm. He also noted that he isn’t leaving the company permanently and will join the company board. He will stay as CTO Emeritus, an honorary title. XRP price prediction October 2025 According to the Ripple price prediction, in October 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.60. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.30, considering the current XRP sentiment. Period Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) October 2025 $2.30 $2.92 $3.60 XRP price prediction 2025 The XRP price prediction for 2025 suggests that the price could reach a maximum of $5.36 by the end of the year, considering its technological utility and enhancement of cross-border payments.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October, XRP is trending near the $2.9 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-22 13:31:31

The shared material, taken from Ripple’s official company page, clearly outlines the firm’s engagement with the Federal Reserve initiative as well as its position as co-chair of the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Payments Working Group. This documentation confirms that Ripple’s role in U.S. payment system development is not speculative but is stated within its own corporate description. The section of the company’s website describes Ripple’s focus on creating global financial settlement solutions designed to establish what it calls an “Internet of Value,” enabling the efficient transfer of funds with real-time certainty. It also lists Ripple’s offices in San Francisco, New York, and Sydney. It explicitly mentions its involvement with the Federal Reserve’s payments task force, underscoring the company’s broader advocacy for payment modernization.

His statement reflects a growing sentiment among supporters that Ripple’s connections to regulatory and financial policy groups highlight its institutional credibility rather than undermine it. However, not all reactions were aligned with this view. Another user, Petr Kopecky, expressed frustration over the continued focus on Ripple’s partnerships and institutional activity while XRP’s market performance remains stagnant. He questioned why, despite such notable involvement in payment policy discussions, the asset’s price has not reflected these developments. This contrast captures a recurring divide within the community between those emphasizing fundamental progress and those primarily concerned with market movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Significance of Ripple’s Documented Role Ripple’s documented position on the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee illustrates its formal participation in shaping the direction of the U.S. payment infrastructure. While this does not imply direct decision-making power within the Federal Reserve, it does show that the company contributes to discussions surrounding the modernization of payment systems and digital settlement standards.. SMQKE’s findings add clarity to Ripple’s broader institutional ties , confirming that the company’s integration into formal payment networks extends beyond speculation. The information shared reinforces Ripple’s positioning within both the U.S. and global financial architecture as it continues to advocate for faster, more efficient cross-border transactions.

Shares Year-End Price Forecast",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/standard-chartered-says-despite-historic-crash-bitcoin-bull-run-isnt-over-shares-year-end-price-forecast/,"The cryptocurrency market experienced a major crash on October 11th, triggered by US President Donald Trump's statements regarding tariffs on China. This crash caused the largest liquidation ever seen in the crypto markets, and the debate surrounding the October 11th crash continues. The last people to speak about the collapse were Standard Chartered analysts. Standard Chartered said that despite the massive crash on October 11th and the $19 billion in forced liquidations, Bitcoin still has the potential to rise to $200,000. Despite the Crash, $200,000 in Bitcoin is Still Possible! Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, said that BTC could reach the $200,000 level by the end of the year despite US President Donald Trump's threats of large-scale tariffs. Kendrick said the $19 billion market crash could be a buying opportunity for Bitcoin once the dust settles in the coming weeks, paving the way for a $200,000 price rally. Despite the volatility, the analyst stated that he is confident that Bitcoin will recover as markets stabilize. At this point, Kendrick stated that although the size of the collapse is large, the declines are temporary and Bitcoin's rise will continue. Kendrick added that the main drivers of BTC's rise will be inflows into ETFs and Fed interest rate cuts. “This correction in Bitcoin and the market is only a temporary shock and once the market stabilizes, investors will see this as another buying opportunity. At this point, my official prediction for BTC by the end of the year is $200,000. Even if President Trump's tariff announcements cause market volatility, if the Fed cuts interest rates as the market expects, Bitcoin could reach at least $150,000 even under conservative assumptions. Stating that there is no reason for ETF flows to stop, Kendrick said that positive narratives such as the US government shutdown and the expectation of a Fed interest rate cut are reflected in the gold flow, and that it will soon be reflected in Bitcoin, and that increasing ETF flows will be the main driver of Bitcoin's rise. *This is not investment advice.

The token has strong support $184, and aims for a breakout above $192. The $54B meme coin market and Solana’s vibrant meme coin economy could send $SNORT and $SOL soaring when the mood turns positive. Solana (SOL) has quietly positioned itself for a potentially significant rally – and its ecosystem of meme coins may be the catalyst. With $SOL hovering around $184, the coin is perched just above a critical support level and eyeing a breakout trigger near $192. As $SOL sits at a crucial point, will Snorter Token and Solana meme coins provide the spark for a big move? Holder Behaviour & Sentiment On-chain data reveals that mid-term holders (those who bought 3-6 months ago) reduced their positions by approximately 1.7% in October, signaling a wave of sellers rather than long-term believers. Meanwhile, the group that invested 6–12 months isn’t showing growth, implying that coins are not being held to maturity but are being offloaded. These exits may stem more from panic or caution than from strategic profit-taking. That tension between a fundamentally well-performing token and apparent reluctance from investors highlights why some analysts see Solana at a crossroads: To break upwards and start a strong run, Solana needs a spark – something to spur investor interest and build momentum. That’s where Solana’s vibrant meme coin community comes in. Even as the broader market slips, meme coin trading volume is up over 20% from the year previous. There’s a lot of money in memes, with a current market cap of $54B, and Solana’s meme coin ecosystem is set to receive a welcome jolt with the launch of $SNORT – the best meme coin trading bot for Solana meme coins. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Trade Solana Meme Coins on Telegram to Find the Next Red-Hot Meme Meme coin traders work at a severe disadvantage. Meme coins come and go so quickly that even by crypto standards, the market is incredibly fast-moving. At the same time, the vast majority of those tokens go nowhere, and only a small percentage offer the chance for the 10x, 100x, or 1000x gains that make big names like $DOGE and $PENGU famous. The largest investors – the whales – can operate on significantly larger margins, leveraging their substantial size for greater gains. Retail investors without that advantage face fewer choices: Take chances on small-cap tokens, most of which will fail Perform careful research to find the best projects, but risk getting left behind by automated trading bots Stick to the best crypto presales , and avoid the chaos and opportunity of the open market entirely The last of those choices offers the best chance of success, and now one presale – $SNORT – solves the first two problems as well. Snorter Token ($SNORT) powers the Snorter Bot, a cutting-edge cryptocurrency trading bot native to Telegram, focusing on the Solana meme coin ecosystem. With Snorter, traders enjoy all the latest tools to make trading memes more profitable than ever. That includes automated sniping, copy trading, and fast, secure swaps on the Solana blockchain. Snorter can level the playing field for meme coin traders, giving them a chance to sort through the thousands of meme coins that go nowhere and find the low-cap gems before they reach a wider audience, maximizing the chances for the huge gains meme coins are famous for. The $SNORT token itself, currently priced at $0.1083, has the potential to reach $1.02 by the end of the year. That would deliver 871% gains for investors who get in now during the final 5 days of the presale. $SNORT also delivers the lowest fees among Solana trading bots, only 0.85% for $SNORT holders. Learn how to buy $SNORT , and don’t miss the last chance to join the $5.3M presale before it ends in mere days. Visit the Snorter Token presale page for the latest updates. As these meme assets like $SNORT gain attention, hype, and trading volume, they could drive renewed interest in Solana’s broader ecosystem. $SNORT and its peers could add fuel to SOL’s momentum if volumes stay elevated. For traders and investors, Snorter Token and the meme coin ecosystem could supply Solana’s spark.

Our latest Proof of Reserves (PoR) , attested as of September 30, 2025 , once again verifies that client assets held on our platform are backed 1:1 and beyond. The process covers major cryptoassets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT, XRP and ADA . We don’t expect blind trust. We don’t need it. We offer cryptographic evidence. New to PoR? Learn how it works in our beginner’s guide . What our September 2025 report shows Our PoR captures a complete snapshot of client assets across all services – not just spot balances. It includes margin accounts, futures holdings and staked assets , offering a full-spectrum look at customer exposure as of September 30, 2025: A quick refresher – what is Proof of Reserves? Proof of Reserves is a cryptographic process that allows clients to verify — independently and privately — that their assets are included in a third-party accountancy firm’s snapshot of the platform’s liabilities. We use a Merkle tree to combine individual balances into a single cryptographic hash. Clients receive a personalized Merkle proof , which they can use to confirm inclusion without revealing personal details. The independent accountancy firm then confirms that Kraken’s onchain holdings exceed total client balances — effectively verifying full reserves without assumptions. Why Kraken’s PoR goes further While more exchanges are now offering “PoRs” in some form, not all of them offer the same level of rigor or transparency. Here’s what sets ours apart: 1. We account for liabilities, not just assets Some platforms show what they hold — but skip what they owe. We include total client liabilities in every PoR. Anything less isn’t a full proof of reserves. 2. User-level verification Every client can verify their own inclusion using our open-source Merkle verification tool. This isn’t just about trust – it’s about verification. 3. A decade of consistency We first pioneered PoR in 2014 — and we haven’t stopped. Kraken conducts PoR regularly and methodically , not just during news cycles. PoR is vital. It’s not about promises. It’s about proof – visible, cryptographic, third-party-verified proof. Kraken’s process is built to withstand scrutiny and empower users with information. What’s next – expanding scope We’re committed to publishing PoRs quarterly , alongside our financial disclosures, to ensure users have a regular window into platform solvency. We’re also actively working to expand the coverage of our PoRs to include more supported assets , giving a broader view of the reserves across our ecosystem. Since the beginning, Kraken has stood for accountability, independence and crypto-first values . We believe transparency should be an industry norm, not an afterthought. That’s why we’ll keep raising the bar. Ready to verify your account? Visit our Proof of Reserves portal .

FRMO's strategic shift toward energy-efficient crypto mining, supported by robust liquidity, positions FRMO well for long-term growth amid rising energy demand. Recent GAAP losses were non-cash and driven by paper declines in Texas Pacific Land, while operational cash flow and levered free cash flow both more than doubled year-over-year. Valuation metrics such as EV/EBITDA and price-to-book are well below historical averages, indicating FRMO is attractively priced for patient investors. Thesis Back in January, I said FRMO Corporation ( FRMO ) was a good stock to buy. The company owns a mix of unusual investments, like shares in Horizon Kinetics and some Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining businesses through Winland and Consensus, that I thought were worth more than the market was giving them credit for. At the time, FRMO was trading at about $10 per share, and since that recommendation, FRMO’s stock has dropped about 20%, while the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) has gone up roughly 11%. That gap certainly doesn’t look great, but the situation isn’t necessarily bad news. FRMO’s worth has always depended more on the long-term results of its mix of investments than on short-term price swings. All the same, after going over FRMO’s recent earnings, I still think the stock is undervalued, even though the price has dropped since my last update. The market seems to be missing the bigger picture, that is, FRMO’s strong balance sheet and ability to fund its own growth are setting it up well for the next stage of expansion. FRMO: Earnings and Direction In the first quarter, FRMO reported a GAAP loss mainly because the value of its investment in Texas Pacific Land ( TPL ) dropped on paper, as oil and gas prices fell earlier in the year. The company didn’t sell any of its TPL shares, so the loss was just on paper, not actual cash. In fact, FRMO’s liquidity got stronger. Cash increased to around $25 million, and management emphasized that they could quickly raise even more cash if needed. However, they don’t plan to do that right now because their focus is on turning FRMO into an active operating business centered on cryptocurrency mining instead of staying a passive investment company. Overall, the macroeconomic picture actually supports FRMO’s move into crypto mining. By now, you already know that AI data centers are using a lot more power, creating a major increase in U.S. electricity demand, and, as a result, grid operators and utilities have been investing heavily to handle these massive hyperscale energy loads, and big tech companies are even starting to build their own power sources. For example, typical power usage efficiency (PUE) sits around 1.58 . That reason I bring that up is that the surge in energy demand directly affects the costs and investment strategy behind crypto mining. And for FRMO, the price and availability of power now play a significant role in deciding how quickly it can expand Winland and its other mining-related businesses without cutting into profits. Seen that way, the company’s choice to hold onto cash and depend on its own liquidity looks intentional . Growing a business that relies on heavy energy use takes careful financial management, and that’s exactly what this quarter’s numbers reflect. That said, looking at income, specifically, dividend income , it fell to about $1.1 million from $4.4 million a year earlier, mainly because Mesabi Trust’s ( MSB ) unusually large payout last year didn’t happen again, so the year-over-year comparison is looking weaker than it really is. The reported loss for the quarter also came from that paper decline in Texas Pacific Land’s value I mentioned earlier, not from any real decline in business performance. Meanwhile, FRMO’s short positions in certain path-dependent ETFs increased, with the total cost of those securities sold short now over $11 million. Management noted that this has been a long-term strategy that continues to generate meaningful cash flow and usually gains value over time as those ETF products lose value naturally. Meanwhile, the cash brought in here helped pay for the company’s crypto expansion without having to sell any of its main investments. Management didn’t share details on profit margins, operating costs, or EBITDA, but the cash flow story does seem easy to follow: there were fewer one-time dividend payments, more steady cash coming from their systematic short positions (which don’t dilute shareholders), and that money was put back into growing their crypto mining operations. Strategic Holdings Overview From a strategy standpoint, FRMO owns about 44% of Winland and is still increasing its stake. If it goes over 50%, that would require combining the two companies’ results in its financial reports, changing how the numbers are presented. On the conference call, management explained that their crypto mining architecture uses scrypt-based mining , and that lets them mine Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) using the same electricity. Basically, they sell the Dogecoin for cash, hold on to the Litecoin, and use the cash they make to buy more Bitcoin. The reasoning is that after the Bitcoin halving, it’s harder to make money with ASIC mining machines. In contrast, scrypt-based equipment doesn’t face those sharp four-year drops in rewards and is less likely to become outdated quickly. Consensus Mining, which started trading about six to eight weeks ago, is using the same approach. By the way, FRMO owns 11,950 shares of Consensus Mining, out of a total of 2.2 million shares. Moving on to other parts of the portfolio, FRMO now owns 934,884 restricted shares and 11,396 unrestricted shares of Miami International Holdings ( MIAX ). That's after a reverse stock split. The company also has a small investment in the Texas Stock Exchange through its funds, but it’s tiny compared to its overall holdings. Management said this position could grow slowly over time, following, what I take, as the same learn-first-buy-over-time strategy they used when investing in MIAX. On the accounting side, Horizon Kinetics is recorded using the equity method, which shows it at a value well below its market worth. Management said this is the right approach for an illiquid investment, meaning one that’s hard to trade. They mentioned that investors can figure out the true value on their own if they want, but the company plans to stick with a conservative GAAP accounting treatment. Meanwhile, the company's still keeping a close eye on its digital asset policy. Management said they directly hold about 259 bitcoins, with bigger exposure coming from ETFs like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), as well as through their stakes in Winland and Consensus. Ongoing attention from the IRS and U.S. Senate on how digital-asset taxes should work, including new temporary CAMT guidance about how unrealized gains might affect adjusted financial income, means that accounting rules for crypto held in treasury are still uncertain. However, most of FRMO’s crypto exposure comes through securities and investments, not through coins the company holds directly. FRMO’s Valuation I’m valuing FRMO by looking at both its earnings and cash flow compared to its own past results, and then checking that against its cash generation and balance sheet. Seeking Alpha Based on that, the stock does look cheap when measured against its five-year averages. The enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA ratio is 2.68, compared to a five-year average of 7.19. EV to EBIT is 2.69 versus 7.33. Also, the price-to-book ratio is 1.11, down from a five-year average of 2.06, and even the price-to-sales ratio is 4.16, which is about half its five-year average of 8.74. The cash flow side of things is somewhat trickier . The price-to-cash-flow ratio is 48.38, which is way lower than the five-year average of 240.35, but that still isn’t cheap. My take from this is that it means the company needs to keep growing its operating cash flow to justify the price. Even so, the good news is that cash flow is moving in the right direction: cash from operations over the last 12 months was $7.73 million, which is up 111% compared to last year. Levered free cash flow also jumped 107%. FAST Graphs Overall, with a total enterprise value (per FAST Graphs above) of about $220 million, a market cap around $374 million, and long-term debt making up only 0.18% of total capital, the company’s balance sheet looks solid enough to give it time to grow without having to issue more shares. Final Takeaway I’m sticking with FRMO as a Buy. Even though it hasn’t done great in the short term and has shown some accounting losses, the company’s finances look healthy. It’s generating more cash, and the stock price is much lower than what it’s usually been worth based on past valuations. Overall, I think the management team’s careful handling of cash and smart move into energy-efficient crypto mining could make the stock worth a lot more over time than it is right now.",BTC-USD|TPL|MSB|DOGE-USD|LTC-USD|MIAX|GBTC|FRMO,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-22 13:45:56

53500222,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=842410,1761141024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53500222.jpeg,India proposes new rules requiring labeling of AI-generated content,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/india-to-mandate-ai-content-label-deepfake/,"India’s government has tabled a draft law change that would compel artificial intelligence (AI) and social media platforms to label AI-generated content clearly. MeitY wants to amend the Information Technology Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules of 2021 to include the new definitions. According to the drafted rules announced Wednesday by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), AI and social media platforms OpenAI, Meta, X, and Google will be required to label AI-generated visuals, audio, and videos prominently. MeitY’s rules will see companies slap labels occupying at least 10% of the surface area of an image, or covering the first 10% of an audio clip’s duration, if they are AI-generated. The ministry said the policy will help regulators with metadata traceability and transparency for all public-facing AI-generated media . It has invited comments from industry stakeholders and the public by November 6, before finalizing its approval and signing the bill into law. Tech and media companies required to label AI content in India According to drafts of the proposed framework , social media users will also have to declare if any content they upload has been generated or altered using AI tools. The amendments define AI-generated information as content “artificially or algorithmically created, generated, modified or altered using a computer resource, in a manner that such information reasonably appears to be authentic or true.” Dhruv Garg, founding partner at the Indian Governance and Policy Project, said the rules are “one of the first explicit attempts globally to prescribe a quantifiable visibility standard.” If enacted, Garg surmised, it would require AI companies and content platforms to build automated labeling tools for detecting and marking synthetic content at the point of creation before it is accessed by the public. Bollywood lawsuits part of deepfake regulation calls India’s draft proposal comes on the backdrop of several lawsuits regarding deepfakes in Indian courts. Earlier this month, Bollywood actors Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan petitioned a New Delhi court to block and remove AI-generated videos that allegedly “infringed on their likeness and intellectual property.” The couple, seeking almost half a million in damages, also claimed YouTube’s AI trainers unlawfully used public content to generate AI media featuring their images. Indian policymakers cited the cases as evidence that unregulated AI technologies could harm reputations, distort elections, and erode public trust in digital information ecosystems. The IT ministry said its new draft seeks to “build transparency safeguards into AI systems before risks are beyond control.” India’s regulatory proposals follow similar laws in the European Union bloc, which finalized its AI Act requiring transparency labels for synthetic media. China also introduced mandatory watermarking standards for AI-generated visuals and text last year. AI investment surge in India The labeling proposal comes at a time when India is experiencing a surge in artificial intelligence investment. According to MeitY, the country surpassed $20 billion in cumulative and new AI investment commitments in 2025. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this year that India is his company’s second-largest market by number of users. Estimates from Spherical Insights also show private sector investments hit $11.1 billion, while public funding through government-led programs has reached $12.3 billion as of August. A major share of this growth is buoyed by Google’s $15 billion AI hub under construction in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. Announced during the Bharat AI Shakti event in October, the facility will be Google’s largest AI complex outside the United States, Cryptopolitan reported . Google mentioned that the data center will host gigawatt-scale compute power, new renewable energy infrastructure, a subsea data gateway, and domestic fiber connectivity. The government’s IndiaAI Mission, implemented by MeitY and the IndiaAI Innovation Center, has already allocated more than 38,000 GPUs for nationwide access at subsidized rates. IndiaAI had approved 30 application development projects by mid-2025, all on responsible AI and solving problems within the jurisdiction, like disaster response, urban planning, and public health.

Our results demonstrate the scalability of our multi-product platform and the resilience of our model in a fast-changing market. By pairing innovation with discipline, we continue to lay the foundation for an open, secure and globally connected financial system. Q3 financial performance Kraken achieved strong performance across multiple financial and operational metrics. Q3 2025 revenues (net of trading costs) rose to $648.0 million , increasing 50% quarter-over-quarter and setting a new all-time record for the company. Revenue growth was broad-based across nearly all products, underscoring the depth and breadth of our platform. Adjusted EBITDA reached $178.6 million , increasing 124% quarter-over-quarter, as margins increased 9 points to 27.6%, reflecting disciplined cost management while continuing to invest in growth and innovation. Total platform transaction volume climbed to $561.9 billion , increasing 23% quarter-over-quarter, while assets on platform grew 34% for the same period to $59.3 billion . Kraken’s community continues to expand with 5.2 million funded accounts as of quarter end. Following the NinjaTrader acquisition earlier this year, we continue to invest in and expand our derivatives offering. We have seen strong growth across our platform with futures daily average revenue trades (DARTs) reaching 741,000 in Q3, increasing 42% quarter-over-quarter. Last week’s acquisition of Small Exchange , a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market (DCM), provides us with direct market-access infrastructure in the U.S. and establishes a foundation to strengthen our U.S.-native derivatives product suite. Compounding innovation At Kraken, innovation doesn’t happen in isolation – it builds on itself. Every product we launch strengthens the next, creating a compounding system of growth, trust and liquidity. We continue to execute and deploy at pace, and Q3 evidenced that momentum as we unlocked new products for professional traders, institutions and consumers. Rolling out xStocks Kraken pioneered a new category of investing with the introduction of tokenized equities. In July, we launched xStocks in partnership with Backed, offering 60 tokenized representations of U.S. stocks to clients in more than 160 countries (excluding the U.S.). This innovation gives non-U.S. investors new ways to gain exposure to traditional equities through digital assets that can trade permissionlessly, around the clock and across multiple ecosystems . From the outset, xStocks was built to be blockchain-neutral and platform-agnostic , ensuring liquidity isn’t trapped in silos or walled gardens. Instead, it flows freely across numerous DeFi protocols on Solana, Ethereum and TRON . By grounding tokenized equities in regulated infrastructure while enabling seamless onchain movement, our goal is to bridge institutional-grade compliance with DeFi-native composability . The xStocks alliance has grown to include Bybit, Phantom, OKX Wallet and Wallet in Telegram , among others. To date, xStocks has surpassed $5 billion in combined CEX and DEX volume , generated over $1 billion in on-chain transactions and reached more than 37,000 unique holders . On Kraken, xStocks are available to non-U.S. investors through both the Kraken Consumer App and Kraken Pro . In September , we expanded availability to the EU , where early adoption has been very strong. Empowering professional traders Kraken continues to redefine professional trading through new products and intelligent automation: Launch of U.S. regulated derivatives : Kraken now offers CME-listed futures tied to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether and Solana , with diverse maturity dates and competitive pricing of just 0.5 basis points .This enables clients to trade a comprehensive suite of crypto futures alongside Kraken’s leading spot markets, all within a regulated and high-performance environment. Acquisition of Capitalise.ai: Brings no-code automation to Kraken Pro, enabling traders of all experience levels to design, test and automate strategies in plain language. Acquisition of Breakout : Expands our prop trading capabilities and provides skilled traders with the opportunity to earn payments for successfully deploying strategies at scale. Breakout enables qualified users to access up to $200,000 in notional capital and retain up to 90% of profits , directly within Kraken Pro. Scaling institutional products Kraken continues to significantly scale up its qualified custody offering and has become a trusted partner for institutions seeking secure, compliant access to digital assets. This quarter, Kraken was selected for custody and trading by a number of digital asset treasury companies , affirming our leadership in security and infrastructure. In a landmark move, Kraken became the first major exchange to fully adopt distributed validator technology (DVT) across its Ethereum staking infrastructure via the SSV Network protocol . This transition represents a major leap forward in decentralization and validator resilience , reinforcing our commitment to a more open, secure financial future. Expanding access for consumers From retail traders to first-time crypto users, Kraken continues to expand access to the new financial frontier: Perpetual futures for consumers : Bringing sophisticated trading instruments to a broader audience who want to align their strategies with how they believe market pricing will move in the future. New local funding rails : Added local deposit options in Argentina and Mexico , enabling smoother fiat onramps for users in two of the region’s most active crypto markets. PayPal-enabled USD deposits : Instead of typing in bank credentials, clients can fund their Kraken account instantly using the same PayPal account they use to make purchases. Kraken Launch : A new token launchpad that empowers clients to access early-stage projects. We’re building scalable infrastructure that democratizes token sales and unites communities with builders for the next generation of finance. Support for stablecoin growth: The passage of the GENIUS Act further strengthens the regulatory foundation for stablecoins – a catalyst for even more stablecoin adoption. We maintained our strong position in stablecoins, with our share of stable/fiat spot volumes well above 60% throughout the quarter. Transparency through Proof of Reserves Today, we also announced the completion of our latest Proof of Reserves for supported cryptocurrencies custodied securely by Kraken as of September 30, 2025: Every quarter, Kraken clients can confirm their assets are fully backed on-chain. They can verify that their account balance was included in the Proof of Reserves report, independently validated by Kraken’s third-party accountancy firm. Kraken pioneered the practice of regular Proof of Reserves – well before it became an industry expectation – and we remain one of the few platforms to perform this process. A look ahead Q3 2025 results underscore Kraken’s speed of execution – not just in financial performance, but in shaping the systems that we believe will define the next era of finance. We are building what legacy financial systems were not designed to achieve; we are connecting our infrastructure into a single digital network where capital moves seamlessly across asset classes, time zones and use cases. A system that allows clients to invest and trade anything, anywhere — instantly and securely, without friction or fragmentation. This is more than an evolution; it’s the foundation of a new global operating system built for openness, speed and scale. Non-GAAP metrics Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by Management internally to understand, manage, and evaluate the business and make operating decisions. We believe these measures provide additional insight into our operational performance and help facilitate comparisons for the period indicated. Revenue is derived by subtracting GAAP trading costs, net from total GAAP gross revenues and allows for greater comparability to peer exchanges. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes irregular, non-recurring, and/or discretionary expenses and is intended to provide a clearer view of the company’s core profitability.

The token, which had fallen below $1.90 just ten days ago, is now showing signs of strength and looking like it’s going to break past $2.50 anytime soon. This rebound comes amid an atmosphere of widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across the market. Despite the shaky sentiment, on-chain data suggests that this is a buy signal for XRP. XRP Rebounds Strongly After Market Capitulation Santiment’s latest data reveals that XRP’s recovery from its flash crash lows around $1.90 to $2.20, and then towards $2.50, has unfolded in tandem with one of the most intense waves of negative sentiment recorded this year. Notably, the platform’s crowd sentiment ratio reached its lowest level since January, reflecting the extreme point of pessimism among traders. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Trapped Under A Bearish Structure, What Happens If It Doesn’t Break $2.5 This extreme pessimism was a result of the XRP price crashing alongside many other cryptocurrencies. News and macroeconomic events, particularly the US tariff announcement on China, caused many XRP holders to sell at a loss under intense Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). This, in turn, caused the crowd sentiment to tank massively. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment shows that the ratio of positive versus negative comments surrounding XRP fell to 1.856, its lowest point since late January 2025. The chart from Santiment illustrates how this ratio has been deteriorating steadily since mid-September. It dropped from 1.93 on September 19 to 1.44 by October 1 before plunging to 1.01 on October 8 and staying around that level for nearly a week. This sustained period of pessimism shows shaken confidence among XRP traders during the recent price volatility. However, there are early signs of stabilization. The sentiment ratio has begun to recover slightly, rising to 1.35 at the time of writing. This means that some optimism is returning now that XRP is trying to reclaim $2.5. What This Means For XRP’s Next Move XRP’s ability to rebound under such heavy FUD suggests the asset may be entering a stronger accumulation phase. According to Santiment, the low ratio of positive to negative comments is typically a buy signal, especially for traders who have been looking to accumulate at lower prices. Santiment noted this by saying that “prices typically move opposite to retail’s expectations.” Related Reading: The XRP Price Roadmap To $8: How An Over 50% Bounce Could Materialize If XRP manages to maintain its position above $2.50, it could be interpreted as confirmation of renewed bullish momentum. From here, the next price targets would be earlier support levels at $2.72 and $2.80 in the short term. Stronger bullish momentum would see XRP extend the rally and break above $3. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.4, down by 1% in the past 24 hours.

53500142,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/ika-and-human-tech-reveal-wallet-as-a-protocol-waap-first-zero-trust-decentralized-wallet-infra,1761141672,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53500142.jpeg,Ika and Human Tech Reveal Wallet-as-a-Protocol (WaaP): First Zero-Trust Decentralized Wallet Infra,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/ika-and-human-tech-reveal-wallet-as-a-protocol-waap-first-zero-trust-decentralized-wallet-infra,"Zug, Switzerland, October 22nd, 2025, Chainwire Ika , the fastest parallel MPC network, today announced a major partnership with human.tech , introducing Wallet-as-a-Protocol (WaaP) , a new category of decentralized wallet infrastructure secured by Ika’s breakthrough 2PC-MPC cryptography. No vendor lock-ins. No more renting your wallet. Full interoperability. This marks the first time in crypto that wallet logic, key management, and access control are decentralized across a zero-trust network, providing the wallet functionality via a decentralized Sui protocol rather than a centralized service. From Wallet-as-a-Service to Wallet-as-a-Protocol So far, Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) solutions have given apps full control over their user's wallets. This has introduced custodial risks, security issues, and prevented wallets from being used on more than one app. With WaaP, human.tech and Ika replace that model entirely. A user’s key share remains local, while Ika’s decentralized network operates the co-signing share under zero-trust conditions. No single entity - including human.tech - can access or reconstruct the full private key. This transforms Human Wallet from a service provider into open, decentralized wallet infrastructure, enabling universal accounts that work seamlessly across dApps, devices, and chains - secured cryptographically. “2PC-MPC changes what a wallet can be,” said David Lachmish, Co-Founder of Ika. “It removes unilateral control, scales to real-world throughput, and for the first time, makes decentralized, flexible and secure wallets practical at the infrastructure level.” The Technology Behind WaaP Ika’s 2PC-MPC (Two-Party Computation Multi-Party Computation) protocol splits private keys into two independent cryptographic shares: User share: held and authorized locally by the user Network share: operated by Ika’s decentralized 2PC-MPC network Both shares are required for any signature, and the full key is never reconstructed. This creates a zero-trust signing environment, resistant to both local compromise and network-level collusion, while delivering sub-second signing latency at scale. In migrating its signing layer to Ika, human.tech becomes the first wallet provider to decentralize programmable security and access control, leveraging a global, zero-trust MPC network. Why It Matters This partnership establishes a new standard for wallet architecture: Decentralized Security: Removes single points of failure - no enclave, no service custody. Censorship Resistance: No single entity can block or forge user intent. Zero-Trust UX: Human-readable intent validation with secure policy enforcement at the signing layer. Protocol-Level Composability: One universal wallet across applications, without iframe custody or per-wallet fees. A New Foundation for Builders WaaP is universal and generic, can support Bitcoin, Solana and is also fully EIP-1193 compliant, allowing developers to integrate Human Wallet using the same provider interface common across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible wallets. The integration takes minutes, with copy-paste quick start examples and a developer portal . Developers gain seamless onboarding, programmable policies, gas sponsorship, and MFA - all enforced cryptographically at the wallet layer. A New Era for Secure UX The WaaP model unites user sovereignty and developer simplicity, enabling real-world-grade security and scalability. Combined with Ika’s MPC network on Sui, WaaP extends to cross-chain coordination, making decentralized security and interoperability one and the same. “Wallet-as-a-Protocol is what Wallet-as-a-Service wanted to be,” said Nanak Nihal Singh Khalsa, Co-Founder of Human Tech. “It gives users ownership, developers composability, and the ecosystem a path to eliminate trusted intermediaries - all made possible by 2PC-MPC.” About Ika Ika is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security. As the premier choice for interoperability, decentralized custody, and chain abstraction, Ika is set to revolutionize digital asset security and multi-chain DeFi.

The partnership introduces Polymarket directly into the World App ecosystem, marking a major step in the company’s strategy to merge digital identity, financial tools, and decentralized applications. World App Adds Polymarket Mini App World announced on Tuesday that its mobile wallet, World App, which already includes World’s decentralized identity tool, World ID, has integrated the Polymarket Mini App. “World App users can download and access the new Mini App today in countries where Polymarket’s services are permitted,” the company said in its statement. The feature allows users to place bets on prediction markets without leaving the World App, using Circle’s USDC stablecoin and World’s native token, WLD. However, access remains restricted in certain jurisdictions. “Eligibility for Worldcoin tokens is restricted based on geography, age and other factors,” World noted, adding that the token is not available in restricted regions, including New York state. The company further clarified that “World Assets and World Foundation are not responsible for the availability of WLD on third-party platforms, such as centralized or decentralized exchanges.” 100 Million Mini App Downloads and Growing The integration comes as World celebrates a significant milestone — surpassing 100 million Mini App downloads earlier this month. World’s Mini Apps, introduced in October 2024, are web applications built directly into the World App ecosystem. As of March 2025, the company had at least 150 Mini Apps active on its platform, with over 10 million WLD (valued at around $8.8 million) transacted. By July, the project had reached 14 million verified human users across 160 countries, and a total user base of 30 million. Prediction Markets Reach Record Volumes The timing of the Polymarket integration coincides with a global surge in prediction market activity. According to data from Dune Analytics, weekly trading volumes across prediction markets surpassed $2 billion for the first time in mid-October, setting a new record. Polymarket led the sector, accounting for 52.3% of all trading volume, while rival platform Kalshi followed closely with $950 million, or roughly 47% of total activity. The growth has attracted institutional attention. Earlier this month, Polymarket secured a $2 billion investment from the Intercontinental Exchange, while Kalshi raised $300 million in a round led by Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. As prediction markets continue to expand, World’s integration with Polymarket positions the company at the intersection of digital identity, decentralized finance, and global prediction ecosystems.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|WLD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-22 14:02:52

According to on-chain data shared by analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin’s trader profit/loss margin currently sits around -5%. Historical patterns show that when this margin drops below -12%, the cryptocurrency tends to rebound strongly, signaling the end of major downtrends. Martinez’s data , retrieved from CryptoQuant on October 22, shows deep negative margins, indicating widespread unrealized losses among short-term holders, which have historically aligned with cyclical bottoms in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin profit/loss margin. Source: CryptoQuant Each instance, including those in 2019, 2020, and 2022, preceded significant recovery phases. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s realized price, the average price at which all coins were last moved on-chain, remains below the spot price, meaning the majority of investors are still in profit. This suggests the market has not yet reached the level of widespread capitulation seen in previous bear market lows. The reassuring data comes as Bitcoin lost the $110,000 level in the past 24 hours, with broader markets suffering losses amid profit-taking. In the short term, however, technical indicators suggest BTC is not yet out of the woods. Bitcoin under threat of dropping to $100,000 For instance, pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst BitBull noted in an X post on October 22 that Bitcoin has fallen below its weekly bull market support band, around $110,000, a technical zone that has recently acted as a crucial indicator of trend strength. $BTC has lost its weekly bull market support band. This isn't a good sign, as it has historically resulted in 10%-20% correction. Do you think Bitcoin is going below $100,000? pic.twitter.com/0SzzdGRHgb — BitBull (@AkaBull_) October 22, 2025 In past cycles, similar breaks have often triggered 10% to 20% corrections, as traders reassess momentum and short-term sentiment turns cautious. If history repeats, a pullback of that magnitude could see Bitcoin revisiting levels around or even below $100,000, a psychologically important threshold. However, the analyst emphasized that temporary dips below the support band do not always signal a full trend reversal, especially if BTC quickly reclaims the zone in subsequent weeks.

Excitement can spread across social media in minutes, but when institutional capital is involved, the mechanics of deployment are slow, costly, and complex. This is precisely what’s playing out with Evernorth’s major XRP-related announcement , a development that has fueled optimism but not yet translated into visible price movement. Software developer Vincent Van Code offered a compelling explanation that shines a light on the structural barriers keeping XRP’s price grounded despite growing institutional interest. Institutional Hurdles: Custody, Compliance, and Cost Unlike retail investors who can set up a wallet within minutes, large corporations and financial institutions operate in a world defined by compliance, auditability, and governance. These entities cannot simply install Xaman or create a Ledger wallet and deposit millions of dollars’ worth of XRP. Every move must pass through layers of internal controls, risk assessments, and external audits. What I am realizing with the bew @evernorthxrp announcement and stagnant XRP price is that it might be harder than we think for institutions to buy and hold XRP. Large companies aren't going to simply setup a Ledger or Xaman wallet and drop $100M in there. They want custody,… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 21, 2025 Institutional crypto custody providers such as Anchorage Digital, BitGo, and Fireblocks offer secure solutions, but at a steep price. Maintaining enterprise-level custody with insurance, audit coverage, and compliance checks can easily exceed $300,000 per year, making direct on-chain exposure an expensive and administratively heavy option. These costs and procedures slow down the flow of large-scale institutional purchases, even when the underlying asset, in this case, XRP, has strong utility and network demand. The Evernorth Announcement and Market Reaction Evernorth, a Ripple-affiliated entity focused on structured digital asset investment, recently made waves with its announcement to build large-scale XRP exposure, potentially running into the billions of dollars. The move sparked intense excitement across the XRP community, with many expecting an immediate surge in price. However, the market remained relatively flat, reflecting a familiar dynamic: institutional announcements often precede months of groundwork before tangible capital flows materialize. Evernorth’s plan, while bullish in intent, is designed for gradual accumulation under tight regulatory oversight, not rapid market buying. This deliberate approach signals confidence in XRP’s long-term role in cross-border liquidity, but it doesn’t create the short-term speculative frenzy that drives sudden rallies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the XRP Price Hasn’t Moved Yet XRP’s stagnant price despite bullish headlines isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s a reflection of the process. Institutional investors cannot simply “ape in.” They must ensure their holdings meet regulatory reporting standards, pass audit requirements, and satisfy fiduciary obligations to shareholders. Until full-scale, compliant investment vehicles become widespread, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or publicly traded companies holding XRP, the bulk of institutional demand will remain on the sidelines. The approval of such vehicles could dramatically ease capital inflow, turning what’s now a trickle into a flood. The Bigger Picture: ETF Hope and Strategic Patience Vincent Van Code concluded that the most practical route for institutions today is indirect exposure — either through ETFs, investment firms, or corporate stocks with XRP holdings. This structured approach solves the problems of custody, audit, and compliance without requiring companies to handle digital assets directly. In essence, Evernorth’s announcement represents a foundational shift rather than an immediate price catalyst. The plumbing for large-scale institutional participation is still being built, and when it’s complete, XRP could finally see the kind of revaluation that long-term holders anticipate. For now, as Vincent Van Code noted, the slow pace isn’t a disappointment; it’s a signal that the institutional era for XRP is approaching, one compliance approval at a time.

As technology advances, it provides tools and platforms that allow sophisticated and engaging gaming experiences. Conversely, the demands of the gaming industry often spur technological breakthroughs accelerating innovations in software, hardware, and even connectivity. This mutually beneficial relationship has resulted in groundbreaking achievements, one of which is the application and adoption of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in the gaming industry. As gaming platforms consistently embrace these innovations, it ushered in a new era of gaming. Below, let us explore more about Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology and how these types of innovations improved payment safety in gaming platforms and in the industry. Getting to Know Bitcoin Adoption of bitcoin within the gaming industry has been inevitable. Considering that the gaming industry has always been at the forefront of adopting new technologies , the integration of Bitcoin has been the natural progression offering opportunity and innovation. Before we delve in deeper, let us briefly introduce what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a digital currency and a type of cryptocurrency that uses a decentralized network to ensure efficient and secure transactions independent of a central governing authority. This cryptocurrency is characterized by decentralization, transparency, and security. Bitcoin is characterized by decentralization as this digital currency operates on a peer-to-peer network. This decentralized structure not only enhances security but also empowers users by distributing control and reducing risk of a single point of failure. When applied to gaming, this means that gamers can have greater confidence in the integrity and fairness of the games they play, knowing no central organization can manipulate or alter the outcomes. This decentralization is what made Bitcoin-powered gaming platforms popular among gamers who value transparency and trust in their gameplay experiences. Accordingly, this decentralized nature is also the reason why casino gamers are in search of only the best expert-approved bitcoin gambling sites , considering these types of platforms often deal with real money. In Canada, where casino gaming is quite popular among gamers, Bitcoin-powered platforms are rapidly gaining traction as gamers are assured safe deposits, making their gaming experience more enjoyable. Bitcoin is characterized by transparency as it is on an open ledger system, ensuring no single entity can alter transaction details without consensus from the network. This transparency fosters trust as every transaction is documented and can be verified. With this, gaming platforms that adopt Bitcoin get to build a more trustworthy and accountable gaming community. As a result, it empowers gamers to become active participants in the game’s economy, especially those who are into in-game purchases and trading assets. Lastly, Bitcoin is characterized by security. Bitcoin employs advanced cryptographic techniques to secure data. This robust security framework is particularly advantageous for those who value a higher level of privacy, knowing that their sensitive data is shielded from unauthorized access. Bitcoin, Blockchain Technology, and Safety within the Gaming Industry With how Bitcoin has been characterized by decentralization, transparency, and security, it has been expected that it will find an essential role within the gaming industry. By integrating Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in general, gaming platforms have witnessed significant improvements in their processes, most especially in efficiency and payment safety. Here’s how: Enhancing Payment Safety As gaming platforms increasingly feature in-game items and even involve real money to increase the stakes and heighten the gaming experience, payment safety has become an important thing to consider. With blockchain, transactions are secured through cryptographic protocols, making the platform resistant to tampering and fraud. Additionally, blockchain also helps gamers conduct transactions anonymously, reducing the risk of identity theft. Improving Payment Efficiency Efficiency has long been a feature in electronic transactions. As such, they are often featured in gaming platforms to ensure that gamers have all their attention on the games instead of getting distracted by complicated payment processes. Gaming platforms often offer a variety of payment options to cater to differing preferences among gamers at least when it comes to payment channels. However, as the risks of cyber threats increase, gaming platforms do their part and improved payment security. Accordingly, they now offer bitcoin and other cryptocurrency payment options as they offer faster transactions and reduced costs. Offering cryptocurrency payments allows gamers to access funds quickly, enjoy lower fees, and benefit from the enhanced security of blockchain technology. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in general has brought about a paradigm shift in the gaming industry. With its ability to provide secure, transparent, and cost-effective payment transactions within gaming platforms, it makes an attractive option for gaming platforms looking to innovate and improve user experiences. As technology continues to mature, there is no doubt Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in general will continue to improve and no doubt will unlock new possibilities and set new standards, at least in the payment transactions in the gaming world.

These technologies have revolutionized payment systems within the gaming industry, introducing a new level of safety and efficiency. The introduction of Bitcoin , a decentralized digital currency, alongside blockchain technology, has provided a robust platform for secure, transparent, and efficient transactions. This shift is particularly significant in an industry where financial transactions form a core aspect of the user experience. Why Bitcoin Appeals to the Gaming Community Bitcoin's inherent qualities such as decentralization, transparency, and security align well with the needs of the gaming community. Its adoption within gaming platforms enhances not only payment safety but also the overall integrity of the gaming environment. Gamers often seek platforms that assure not only entertainment but also security, especially when real money is at stake. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means that no single entity can control or manipulate the currency, which is a reassuring factor for gamers worried about fairness and transparency. This has made expert-approved bitcoin gambling sites especially popular in regions like Canada, where online casino gaming thrives. Strengthening Payment Security One of the primary benefits of blockchain technology in gaming is the enhancement of payment security. Blockchain's cryptographic protocols significantly mitigate the risks associated with fraud and tampering. Furthermore, the anonymity provided by blockchain allows gamers to conduct transactions without fear of identity theft, a common concern in online spaces. Streamlining Transaction Processes Efficiency in transactions is crucial for a seamless gaming experience. Blockchain facilitates swift and cost-effective transfers, enabling gamers to focus more on their gaming strategies rather than on the mechanics of funding their accounts. With the rise in cyberthreats linked to online transactions, gaming platforms are increasingly adopting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to offer not only speed but also reduced transaction costs. Conclusion: The Future of Gaming with Blockchain The integration of Bitcoin and blockchain into gaming platforms is not just a trend but a substantial advancement that addresses many challenges faced by the gaming industry today. As these technologies mature, their potential to further revolutionize the gaming industry remains vast, likely paving the way for more innovative and secure gaming experiences.

Specifically, traders have priced in a 21% probability of XRP hitting $4 before January 2026, reflecting moderate optimism, according to data retrieved by Finbold on October 22. The $4 target has gained traction recently, rising 4% in probability over the past few sessions. However, higher thresholds appear less convincing, only 6% expect XRP to reach $6, while 25% see a chance of it touching $3.50. The most likely scenario, with 38% odds, places XRP around $3.20 before the deadline. XRP price prediction. Source: Polymarket Trading volumes behind these probabilities exceed $220,000, signaling growing market engagement in long-term XRP outcomes. Notably, several factors explain why XRP’s chances of reaching $4 have recently diminished. The token has shown high volatility but failed to break key resistance levels, facing repeated rejections near $3 and $3.50 amid weak trading volume. The asset has also been weighed down by broader market sentiment, limiting upward momentum. However, approval of spot crypto ETFs in the United States could be a game changer. As seen with Bitcoin ( BTC ), such approvals can trigger massive institutional inflows and reignite risk appetite, a development that could significantly raise the odds of XRP hitting $4. XRP price analysis At the time of reporting, XRP was trading at $2.39, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and over 3% on the week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, XRP is trading below both its 50-day SMA ($2.82) and 200-day SMA ($2.62), indicating a bearish trend and weak momentum across both short- and long-term timeframes. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 39.93 signals a neutral to slightly bearish outlook, not yet oversold but showing fading buying strength. Combined, the SMA and RSI readings suggest XRP could face continued pressure unless it reclaims support above its key moving averages.

ETHA exhibits high volatility, over 60% IV, making it riskier than its Bitcoin peer IBIT and suitable as a high-beta play for growth diversification. Ethereum's deflationary mechanism and expanding ecosystem support its long-term potential, but regulatory and technological risks remain. I rate ETHA as a Hold, with moderate bullishness for the next 12 months, and will consider increasing my position if volatility stabilizes. Introduction Many investors may believe that the year 2025 could be a pivotal year for Ethereum, which may experience significant growth thanks to the key adoption by the big financial institutions. The iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) is the largest spot ETF tracking Ethereum cryptocurrency, with an AUM of over $15 billion in about one year since inception. I have a conservative Hold rating on the fund and believe it can serve as a different growth exposure from the growth equity, like mega technology companies. ETHA could be more buyable if the current extreme volatility in its fund price could be subsided in the near future. ETHA ETF Overview ETHA is an ETF managed by iShares as a spot fund, which holds actual Ethereum tokens, with each share representing a portion of the underlying Ethereum native cryptocurrency. The ETF portfolio is very straightforward, as shown below. The 100% ETHER is classified as an alternative asset class representing the digital assets. ETHA Portfolio Holdings (iShares) ETHA was incepted in July 2024 and has quickly become the largest spot Ethereum ETF with AUM of $15.5 B, driven by a spike in investor interest in the cryptocurrency in the past year or so. The following shows a comparison of 4 Ethereum ETFs with almost identical price performance over all the time spans listed. The one-year performance (the last line) is slightly above 53% for all four funds. Comparing Ethereum ETFs (Author using SA data) The ETHA AUM is the largest fund with the highest expense ratio of 0.25% in the peer group, which may explain why ETHA has the worst 1-year performance (53.15%) despite the small differences in the performance numbers. These ETFs are still new, so they will need more time to check and validate the quality of the fund management. On the other hand, the relatively simple structure and simple strategy will be the main factor to dictate the long-term performance patterns. I suspect the ETF with the lower expense ratio, such as the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF ( ETH ), may have an edge in the long run. Both ETHA and ETH have very active daily volumes in the order of multimillion trades (66 million and 7.6 million, respectively), indicating the popularity of the funds in the market. The flipping Recently, there has been a hot topic of Ethereum flipping in the investing communities. Some people believe that ""Ethereum could eventually flip Bitcoin’s market cap"". I've found such a debate in the crypto world interesting. Market prediction aside, I think that Ethereum blockchain technology capabilities are the main reason why the adoption of Ethereum is gaining more momentum. Ethereum has a higher rate of developer activity and a wider range of uses through its smart contract capabilities. The following summarizes some key recent developments pointing to fast growth potentials in the foreseeable future: A much broader range of uses expands significantly the versatility and usability of the Ethereum network that supports smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Better performance, scalability, and efficiency: Ethereum has significantly reduced its energy consumption and improved scalability compared to Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work. Ethereum has been attracting more new developers than Bitcoin, thanks to its growing ecosystem and the fast-emerging technological innovation. Tokenization potential: Ethereum's platform for tokenized assets has a lot of room to develop, hence driving up its long-term value. For example, Robinhood now has more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks available to its European customers. On the other hand, Bitcoin currently has a significantly larger market capitalization, which is more than 4x that of Ethereum at the moment. Bitcoin is expected to shine in value as a store of value and the status of ""digital gold"" as it provides the advantage of being the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. I am not a big fan of the flipping narrative and predicting when Ethereum will take over Bitcoin. But I do expect Ethereum to grow faster than Bitcoin in market capitalization in the next few years. As a result, I expect the ETHA ETF to grow at a double-digit rate that may lead to outperforming the broader stock market. The deflationary advantage One of the lesser-known effects of the Ethereum network is that a portion of the transaction fees is permanently removed from the circulation process. This kind of ""burning"" can make Ethereum deflationary when the Ethereum blockchain becomes very popular and there are a lot of periods crowded with high network activities. Such a property will be important to support the Ethereum price and maintain its value. It is also the key reason why some investors view cryptocurrencies as a viable hedging option against inflation. The ETHA ETF could become a multi-purpose holding in one's investment portfolio. Keep in mind, this deflation feature is largely dependent on the heavy network usage, which may align well with the bullish Ethereum outlook. On the other hand, the idleness of the network in the bearish scenario would make the deflationary effect disappear if the future were to show the other outcome in reality. The super volatile growth play in the market The price of Ethereum is highly volatile because the value proposition is not considered as solid and is different from the traditional approach based on financial values like earnings and profit, etc. Many investors still view Ethereum as a speculative play. Sharp price swings can be quite prevalent in the market for ETHA. The following is the (IV) volatility chart of ETHA for the past 12 months. ETHA IV Volatility Chart (MarketChameleon) As we can see the average volatility is above 60%, which is more than 3x times the S&P 500 index. At this point, I think that the high volatility is a signal for low market confidence. Considering that iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) has an IV of around 44, ETHA is regarded as a much riskier investment than IBIT. I have a Buy rating for IBIT and am starting a Hold rating for ETHA. I generally view ETHA as the high-beta version of the growth play. The US stock market is at a high valuation point, as the S&P 500's PE ratio is over 31. I have opened a moderate position on ETHA as part of the growth exposures, playing the role of growth diversification. I am observing the volatility closely and plan to add more shares if the ETF's price can be stabilized with lower volatility in 2025, which would show an increased confidence from the market towards Ethereum's future prosperity. It may take a longer time for more adoption to happen. The high volatility could persist for some time and test investors' patience. Additional Risk Analysis The extreme volatility is the number one risk for investing in ETHA. The ETF is perceived as a speculative bet. There are also other risks involved with regulatory uncertainties because the whole regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. New laws could restrict and impact the market for crypto investments and related ETFs. From a technology perspective, the fast-advancing computing power may introduce new technology that could be disruptive to the Ethereum blockchain before it becomes a true universal platform for digital transactions. The Ethereum market would be hugely impacted under such a scenario. This risk may not be factored into the current price volatility. Closing Thoughts The Ethereum platform has seen a high momentum in adoption within the big financial institutions due to its higher and wider usability potentials compared to Bitcoin, including the use cases, such as tokenized equities, which may open doors to a much bigger market. ETHA is the largest Ethereum ETF, which is actively traded in the stock market as well as the options market. Growth-oriented investors who are looking for long-term growth plays may find ETHA an interesting diversifying candidate in the growth portfolio. I have a neutral rating Hold for ETHA and am moderately bullish for the ETF in the next 12 months.",ETH-USD|ETHA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-22 15:28:35

After weeks of indecisive movement, short-term price action remains choppy, leaving both bulls and bears without conviction. According to new insights from CryptoQuant, a comprehensive analysis combining Price Action, Volume Profile, and Liquidation Heatmap data from Binance reveals that Bitcoin has been locked in a well-defined trading range for the past 120 days. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Futures Indicator Signals Whales Are Going Long – Details The report highlights that this range is centered between $107,500 and $119,300, with the Point of Control (POC) — the level where the most trading volume has occurred — sitting near $117,500. Despite several attempts to break higher, BTC has repeatedly failed to sustain momentum, falling back into this range each time. Analysts suggest this pattern reflects a market in balance, waiting for a catalyst to break decisively in either direction. Within these boundaries, Bitcoin traders are closely monitoring liquidity clusters and key volume zones to anticipate the next big move. Whether BTC reclaims higher ground or tests lower supports, the breakout from this 120-day range could define the next major phase of the cycle. Bitcoin Faces a Crucial Test at the Point of Control (POC) According to CryptoOnchain’s latest analysis on CryptoQuannt, Bitcoin’s recent breakout attempt above its 120-day trading range has failed to gain traction, forming what analysts call a classic “Look Above and Fail” pattern. The move initially triggered a short squeeze that liquidated many sellers on Binance, briefly pushing the price higher. However, the rally quickly lost strength due to insufficient follow-through buying, leading BTC to fall back into its established range — a sign of underlying market weakness. At present, Bitcoin is hovering just below the critical Point of Control (POC) near $117,500 — the price level where the largest trading volume has occurred. This level now acts as the key battleground for the next major move. In the bullish scenario, a confirmed breakout above the POC could turn this zone into support and pave the way for a retest of the Value Area High (VAH) around $119,300. Such a move could also trigger short liquidations, driving BTC toward the buy-side liquidity zone sitting above $120,000. In the bearish scenario, continued rejection from the POC would point toward renewed selling pressure, targeting the Value Area Low (VAL) near $107,500 — where significant stop-losses and long liquidations remain clustered. Related Reading: XRP Whales Flood Binance With Massive Deposits – Selling Pressure Mounts Bitcoin Bears Defend the $110K Zone Bitcoin is once again struggling to reclaim momentum after failing to break through resistance near $111,000. The chart shows that BTC remains trapped below key moving averages, with the 50-day SMA acting as a dynamic ceiling around $112,000 and the 100-day SMA near $114,000 reinforcing bearish pressure. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA, currently positioned around $107,000, is providing short-term support — a critical line that bulls must defend to avoid deeper losses. The market structure indicates that BTC continues to trade within a defined range between approximately $107,000 and $117,500. Recent price action has been characterized by failed breakout attempts and sharp pullbacks, highlighting indecision and low conviction among both bulls and bears.

However, a breakdown below $107,000 would likely accelerate selling pressure toward the $103,000 area — the flash-crash low from earlier this month. For now, Bitcoin remains in consolidation, with market participants awaiting a decisive breakout to confirm whether the next major move will be a bullish reversal or a continuation of the current downtrend.

This “altcoin rotation” marks the stage when investors, having booked profits from Bitcoin’s rally, start seeking higher returns in tokens with fresh narratives and tangible utility. Capital Flow Shifts to Quality Altcoins Historically, altcoin rotations emerge when Bitcoin’s momentum pauses. While BTC trades sideways, liquidity trickles into high-potential projects — especially those backed by real use cases and active ecosystems. In the current environment, GameFi tokens and real-world utility projects are drawing significant attention. One of the most anticipated launches in this category is the $TRUE token from TRUE LABS, scheduled for listing in Q4 2025. TRUE LABS: A Proven Force in Gaming Founded in 2019, TRUE LABS is far from a newcomer. The award-winning gaming studio has released over 60 polished titles, maintains licenses across multiple jurisdictions, and partners with 1,700+ gaming platforms and operators. With a user base of more than 4.5 million paying players, TRUE LABS has long been recognized for its creativity, fairness, and refined game design. Now, the company is leveraging that foundation with plans to list the $TRUE token that will power TRUE World, a next-generation GameFi loyalty layer enabling players to earn and engage. TRUE World: Where Progress Equals Ownership TRUE World transforms gameplay into a system of progression and ownership. Players complete missions, join tournaments, and earn reward points. Every action — from achievements to upgrades — contributes to lasting, tokenized value within the ecosystem. Unlike most “metaverse” projects that exist only on whitepapers, TRUE World is already live, integrated into TRUE LABS’ games. The $TRUE token will serve as the backbone of this interconnected ecosystem, linking in-game progress, collectibles, and real-world rewards. Why $TRUE Could Lead the Next Altcoin Wave The upcoming $TRUE listing arrives at a time when the market is actively searching for tokens with utility beyond speculation. With its large user base, strong brand, and functional integration across live games, TRUE LABS offers what many GameFi startups lack — a working product with proven engagement. As capital rotates from Bitcoin and major altcoins into emerging sectors, $TRUE is positioned to attract attention from both players and investors looking for real adoption stories. If the altcoin rotation continues through the year, TRUE LABS’ combination of scale, credibility, and built-in utility could make $TRUE one of the standout listings of late 2025.

The bank’s upcoming virtual asset ETF offering is part of Hong Kong’s ongoing efforts to combine traditional finance with digital innovation. Standard Chartered Hong Kong is preparing to launch virtual asset exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading services next month as demand for digital asset investments grows rapidly. The bank interviewed over 500 high-end clients, each holding at least HK$1 million (about $137,000) in liquid assets, as part of its Hong Kong High-end Customer Digital Asset Research 2025, which was conducted under the Digital Hong Kong Dollar + project by the Financial Administration Bureau. Standard Chartered reacts to demand for digital assets The survey reported by local media revealed that three-quarters of respondents are interested in digital assets, and nearly 80% plan to invest in the sector over the next 12 months. About 30% already hold digital assets, and wealthier participants in the survey expressed that they have confidence in using digital assets to diversify their portfolios. Respondents said they typically start with small allocations, dedicating only a modest portion of their overall portfolios to cryptocurrencies or related products. On average, investors who already engage with digital assets use about 2.5 different investment platforms. However, the survey also found that price volatility, platform security, and limited knowledge prevent more investors from participating. Mac Weilin, Head of Customer and Data at Standard Chartered Hong Kong Digital Bank, said over 70% of respondents trust digital assets backed by local banks, showing rising confidence in regulated platforms. “The data show a strong appetite for new digital investment opportunities, particularly when offered within a secure and regulated environment,” Mac said. He Wenjun, the Head of Wealth Planning at Standard Chartered Hong Kong, confirmed that the bank would meet the demand for institution-backed trading with the launch in November. “Clients are increasingly eager to participate in digital finance,” he said. Wenjun went on to say that integrating virtual asset ETFs into the bank’s platform would help provide more diversified asset and financial management options. ETFs are considered a safer, more regulated way to trade digital assets than direct cryptocurrency trading. Hong Kong’s digital finance strategy evolves At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) Finance Ministers’ Meeting in Incheon, South Korea, Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po stated that the country is committed to supporting innovation in financial technology. Chan highlighted how blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming financial services by improving efficiency, reducing costs, and promoting inclusive finance. He stated that for sustainable fintech growth, financial innovation must serve the real economy, innovation must be supported through regulatory flexibility, and responsible and sustainable development in digital finance should be promoted. Chan cited several local initiatives as examples to support his point, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s ( HKMA ) “Commercial Data Interchange” platform. The system allows small and medium-sized enterprises to share verified business data to improve access to financing, facilitating over 60,000 loan applications and more than HK$6.5 billion, approximately $845 million, loans to date. During his visit, Chan met with South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister of Economy and Minister of Planning and Finance, Gu Yoon-cheol, to discuss enhanced cooperation in economic, trade, and financial innovation.

Native integration into Solana’s Layer 1 gives the upcoming perpetual exchange a structural advantage over Aster and other application-layer rivals. Solana is preparing to launch a new decentralized perpetual exchange protocol that could upend the competitive landscape for on-chain derivatives. The upcoming platform, called Percolator, is being developed directly on Solana’s Layer 1 and represents the network’s most ambitious attempt yet to integrate a high-performance trading system at the base protocol level. In a rapidly evolving landscape where focus and narratives constantly shift, timely interventions and sustained visibility are paramount. This is why data-driven agencies like Outset PR go beyond merely tracking token prices; they also monitor the wider media environment. Outset Data Pulse delivers current intelligence on crypto media performance, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of PR campaigns. Blueprint for On-Chain Perpetuals Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko outlined the plan for Percolator in a GitHub proposal . The protocol will consist of two main on-chain programs: the Router, which manages collateral, portfolio margins, and cross-slab routing; and the Slab, a perpetuals engine operated by liquidity providers that performs matching and settlement autonomously. Unlike existing decentralized exchanges built on secondary layers or rollups, Percolator will run natively within Solana’s infrastructure, taking advantage of the blockchain’s 65,000 transactions per second throughput and $0.0001 average transaction fees. In effect, Percolator will function as a sharded, high-speed perpetual futures exchange, enabling traders to speculate on crypto prices without expiration dates. If successful, it could make Solana the first Layer 1 blockchain to host a fully integrated derivatives venue at scale. Structural Advantage Pressures Aster The timing poses a direct challenge to Aster, one of the leading decentralized perpetuals platforms. Aster’s model — once differentiated by its first-mover advantage — now appears increasingly constrained by architecture and liquidity fragmentation. Early market signals suggest traders are repositioning ahead of Percolator’s debut. Aster’s daily active users fell 22% this week, while key indicators of platform health have deteriorated sharply: Total value locked declined from $1.805 billion to $1.479 billion, an 18% drop over seven days, according to DeFiLlama. Trading volume collapsed from $805 million to $78 million, a 90% decline. Open interest dropped from $3.2 billion to $1.37 billion, down 57%, reflecting reduced trader conviction and liquidity depth. Source: defillama Competitive Dynamics Shift Toward Base Layer Efficiency Percolator’s integration at the base layer could give Solana a lasting competitive edge. By embedding core trading functions directly into the network, Solana removes latency, composability, and settlement constraints faced by DeFi platforms built on external scaling solutions. That efficiency could make Solana-based derivatives markets attractive for high-frequency and institutional traders seeking low-cost, deterministic execution. It also reinforces Solana’s broader positioning as a performance-first blockchain, capable of absorbing liquidity from higher-fee ecosystems. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Outlook: A Redefinition of On-Chain Derivatives The launch of Percolator marks a potential inflection point in the decentralized derivatives market. It signals a shift away from application-layer innovation toward protocol-layer financial infrastructure. For Aster, the implications are significant. Without meaningful product differentiation — such as cross-chain compatibility or new margin mechanisms — its market share could erode quickly as traders migrate to faster, cheaper venues.

OnChainLens tracked the distribution, identifying 4,999 BTC worth $539.76 million each to two addresses, 3,424 BTC worth $369.7 million, and 2,535 BTC worth $274.36 million. The transfers follow an October 15 movement of 11,886 BTC , worth $1.3 billion, that occurred just 24 hours after the U.S. Department of Justice announced one of the largest crypto forfeiture cases targeting Prince Holding Group.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading around $108,000 after reversing a 3.5% pump from $114,000. Largest Bitcoin Theft Ever Surfaces After Four-Year Dormancy Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence revealed in August that 127,426 BTC, valued at $3.5 billion at the time and nearly $14.5 billion today, was stolen from LuBian in December 2020. The theft exploited vulnerabilities in LuBian’s private key generation system through potential brute-force attacks. The pool had risen quickly in early 2020, becoming the sixth-largest mining pool while promoting itself as “ the safest high-yielding mining pool in the world. “ Attackers drained over 90% of LuBian’s BTC on December 28, 2020, followed by an additional $6 million in BTC and USDT the next day. By February 2021, LuBian had disappeared without explanation, fueling speculation of a regulatory shutdown. A massive Bitcoin theft from 2020 has surfaced nearly four years later, and it's now being called the largest crypto heist ever uncovered. #Bitcoin #Hack https://t.co/5Qq5HqbUMn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 3, 2025 Arkham’s investigation revealed the dramatic hack as the actual cause. LuBian attempted to communicate with the attacker using Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN feature, writing “ To the whitehat who is saving our asset, you can contact us… to discuss the return of asset and your reward. “ Most stolen coins remained dormant until July 2024, with 11,886 BTC worth roughly $1.35 billion still untouched in LuBian’s wallet. UK-China Tensions Over $7.2B Bitcoin Seizure In a separate but related seizure, the UK government proposed a compensation scheme for victims of Chinese investment fraud while seeking to retain the majority of a £5 billion ($7.2 billion) Bitcoin fortune seized from perpetrators. The announcement was made during a High Court hearing in London on Wednesday, regarding 61,000 Bitcoin seized by police in 2018 from devices found at a mansion in Hampstead, now representing one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in UK history. UK proposes compensation for fraud victims while keeping most of £5B ($7.2B) Bitcoin seized in 2018 from 61,000 BTC as 130,000 victims contest government benefit. #Bitcoin #UK https://t.co/jXXgfWZagW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 15, 2025 The case pits British authorities against approximately 130,000 Chinese investors who lost money in fraud orchestrated by Zhimin Qian between 2014 and 2017. Bitcoin’s value has surged dramatically since the 2018 seizure, climbing from approximately $1.8 billion to its current $7.2 billion valuation. Authorities also recently obtained access to additional cryptocurrency assets worth about £67 million from Qian. Qian and Malaysian associate Seng Hok Ling pleaded guilty to money laundering charges last month and are scheduled to face sentencing in November. Dump on BTC: How Would the Market React? With hackers and the government potentially looking to sell, it is uncertain what the aftermath will look like for BTC. On the technical level, Bitcoin currently faces technical pressure after reversing Monday’s 3.5% pump, dropping from $114,000 back to the $107,000-$108,000 support zone. Source: TradingView The pullback has left traders watching the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index data on October 24 for directional cues. Consensus expectations sit at 3.1%, but after six consecutive months of rising inflation readings, investors fear another upside surprise could unsettle risk markets. Bitcoin’s chart shows the asset testing support near $112,000, with the projected trajectory suggesting a potential rebound toward $117,000 if support holds.

Metaverses. Memecoins. NFTs. Decentralized IDs. In the case of non-fungible tokens, the perihelion was undoubtedly the sale, in March 2021, of the Everydays art collage for $69.3 million at Christie’s. Four and a half years on, the august auction house has quietly closed its specialist digital art division, a reflection of diminished interest in the collectibles. Today, there are a few contenders for the ‘hottest narrative in crypto’, one of them being IP-based protocols – the sort that enables intellectual property to be tokenized and tracked to drive fan engagement. The sports world is making the early running here, with a number of IP-based protocols finding favor among fans of soccer, basketball, and cricket. Blockchain and Sports: A Perfect Match? If you’ve watched a Premier League football match lately, you’ve probably noticed a hoarding advertising a crypto company – blockchain.com, Kraken, Tezos. In fact, multiple clubs boast an official crypto trading partner, with names like OKX and BingX adorning players’ shirt sleeves. All of which is to say that partnerships and sponsorship deals between global sports brands and leading Web3 companies, are nothing new. Hell, the LA Lakers – arguably the world’s best-known basketball team – play at the Crypto.com Arena. Those deals are about brand recognition, of course, proving that trading platforms aren’t shy about flexing in a bid to win over mainstream users. But as far as the actual synergies between blockchain and sports are concerned, they are plentiful. And IP-based protocols are doing wonders for fan engagement through things like fan tokens and dApps. A perfect example is Sweet , a Web3 platform that has licensing agreements with both the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS), both of whom deploy “innovative gamified blockchain collectible experiences on Sweet to drive new revenue streams and fan engagement.” The ultimate ambition of Sweet is to improve the way leagues and athletes interact with fans and vice versa. The platform has already rolled out fun, skill-based sports mini games, with players issued a SCOR-ID to ensure a verifiable ‘footprint’ of their activities. In this way, leagues and teams can identify their most committed fans. Recently, Sweet joined forces with TON Foundation to release sports-themed sticker packs inside Telegram’s FUSE Sticker store, with the inaugural release focused on cricket’s greatest spin bowlers. While that isn’t headline-making news on its own, the kicker is that these digital collectibles have in-game utility, triggering power-ups and enhancing gameplay in the aforementioned mini games. Thus, the sticker packs are perfectly situated at the intersection of blockchain, gaming, and sports fandom. Sweet’s vision goes beyond digital ownership, creating a means by which engagement can be recorded and hardcore supporters compensated. With interactions documented on users’ SCOR-ID, the prospect of earning meaningful rewards like signed memorabilia, tickets, and exclusive experiences becomes very real. Sweet has integrated the $SCOR token, issued by the SCOR Foundation, into its Fan Engagement Ecosystem, where it powers key interactions such as fan rewards and in-game upgrades. Built on the EVM-compatible Base network, $SCOR also bridges to ecosystems like TON and is set to become the future native token of the SCOR protocol. The Future of Fandom The Web3 tech stack is vying to be the technological engine of fandom’s future, with a combination of blockchain and NFTs empowering supporters to load up on digital characters and playable assets tied to real sports action. It’s an intriguing proposition, and it’s telling that the big sports leagues have already given their seal of approval. Whether you’re a gamer, collector, or just a sports fan looking to show support, now’s a good time to plug in and see what all the fuss is about.

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has accused Justin Sun-linked cryptocurrency exchange HTX of violating financial regulations and illegally promoting crypto asset services to UK consumers, Bloomberg reported. The FCA stated that the exchange had breached the country's financial rules. At this point, the FCA initiated legal action against HTX in London's High Court. HTX is alleged to have illegally promoted crypto asset services to consumers in the UK in violation of the country's financial promotions regime. The FCA's website states that HTX is not authorised to operate in the UK. Regulatory body FCA had previously warned UK consumers not to use HTX. An FCA spokesperson said: “This action against HTX is part of our commitment to protecting consumers and preserving the integrity of the UK financial markets.” It is not yet clear whether Sun has been added as a defendant in the lawsuit.

According to their report, the company’s gross revenue was $29.2 billion and a net income of $505 million, a whopping 1,546% increase from Q2. As a result, institutions have reiterated their overweight rating on the company shares. Galaxy Digital reported gross revenue surpassed both Jefferies’ estimate of $22.8 billion and the Street consensus of $17.2 billion. In addition, it has also surpassed ATB Capital Markets analyst Martin Toner’s expectations of a total revenue of $21.2 billion. Management credited a sharp increase in digital asset volumes, up 140% from Q2, as a key factor in the profit jump. The Global Markets segment posted a record adjusted gross profit of $295 million, driven by robust spot and derivatives trading, as well as the execution of a $9 billion Bitcoin sale, comprising approximately 80,000 BTC, on behalf of a client. Brokers and analysts hike Galaxy’s stock price target to nearly $60 Broker Cantor reiterated its overweight rating on Galaxy shares and raised its price target to $53 from $45. It has attributed the revision primarily to a higher valuation for the company’s data center business. Cantor also cited strong performance across its digital asset operations and growing institutional adoption as key tailwinds. The broker noted that Galaxy’s digital asset business is “operating on all cylinders” and stands to benefit as more traditional players enter the crypto ecosystem. Additionally, Canaccord Genuity increased its Galaxy price target to $50 from $34 and maintained its buy rating on the stock. According to analysts led by Joseph Vafi, the company is a solid and diversified play across two of the most exciting growth sectors: crypto-related financial services and data centers. It also boasts one of the best-evolving portfolios focused on AI hosting. Wall Street broker Benchmark also raised its price target on Galaxy to $57 from $40, and reaffirmed its buy rating. Analyst Mark Palmer stated that the higher target reflects the firm’s updated sum-of-the-parts analysis, which now factors in Galaxy’s AI data center operations, along with its trading, lending, staking, asset management, and crypto holdings. $GLXY Weekly All these weekly candle wicks right above the 2021 cycle high to really mess with people's heads to a degree where they even sell after an incredible earnings report.

Other analysts have maintained a buy rating and predicted a price of up to $80. Galaxy Digital Q3 performance Galaxy reported that the total platform assets reached $17 billion at the quarter’s end, with $8.8 billion in assets under management and $6.6 billion under stake. The company held $1,137M in cash and cash equivalents and $773M in stablecoins as of September 30, 2025. This is a 62% increase from Q2. Galaxy Digital Q3 and Q2 metrics. Source: PR Newswire Capital for operations was supported by a $460 million equity investment from a leading global asset manager. $325 million in net proceeds was earmarked for Helios campus expansion and corporate objectives. Additionally, new multi-year digital asset mandates from treasury clients added $4.5 billion in assets, supporting annual recurring fee revenue exceeding $40 million. Galaxy’s recent launch of the GalaxyOne platform in October now provides individual US investors with access to high-yield cash, crypto, and equity trading. Galaxy Digital is met by the volatility challenge With the report of its Q3 results, the shares of Galaxy Digital were actively traded. In 24 hours, its shares increased by more than 8%, with a trading volume exceeding 16 million shares. Galaxy Digital is experiencing a strong performance in 2025, with an 82.55% year-to-date increase. However, with a beta of 3.85, investors should note that the stock’s volatility is higher than that of the broader market. Market fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices can result in significant changes in trading revenue and asset values. This increases the risk for investors looking for consistent returns. Galaxy Digital now faces pressure to show that its business expansion will lead to long-term profits. Meanwhile, the stock is trading at $36.81, a decline from the pre-market price of over $40.

Armstrong is just one of several key players in the digital asset sector joining the crypto policy roundtable . Spearheaded by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the October 22 roundtable is set to feature crypto leaders, including Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz, Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov, Kraken CEO David Ripley, and Solana Policy Institute President Kristin Smith, amongst others. Crypto Proposal By Senate Democrats Gets Pushback The meeting comes shortly after Senate Democrats unveiled their own crypto market structure proposal earlier this month. If approved, the proposal would effectively impose Know Your Customer rules on the frontends of crypto apps, remove developer protections, and enact a “restricted list” of high-risk DeFi protocols. In an October 9 statement, Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger claimed the proposal would “drive responsible development overseas.” “The disappointing proposal outlined by Senate Democrats would effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development, and other applications in the United States—an outcome that’s neither workable nor consistent with American innovation,” Mersinger said. “We urge our policymakers to stay at the table, continue to engage each other across the aisle, and ensure this critical piece of legislation supports—rather than hinders—our nation’s leadership in financial technology,” she added. However, it is still unclear whether the Senate Democrats’ meeting with executives in the crypto space will prove fruitful when it comes to digital asset policy.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.4323 Market Cap $769.38M Trading Volume $159.03M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.4657 24-hour Low $0.4265 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 19.76% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.6959 14-Day RSI 31.23 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.7364 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP trades around $0.43, showing weak momentum and limited buying volume. The daily indicators suggest oversold conditions, indicating that short-term stabilization is likely. OP’s resistance remains heavy near $0.45–$0.55. Optimism 1-day price chart As seen on the 1-day chart for October 22, OP is trading around $0.432, down 0.32%, holding in a tight consolidation range following a sharp decline earlier this week. The Bollinger Bands remain wide, showing elevated volatility, with the mid-band near $0.55 acting as strong resistance and the lower band at $0.285 providing key support. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative, although the histogram bars have started to shorten, implying a weakening of bearish momentum. The RSI sits near 31, close to oversold territory, suggesting that OP may be due for a mild technical rebound if $0.43 continues to hold as a floor. However, volume remains weak, indicating limited conviction from buyers. A daily close above $0.45 could mark the start of a corrective bounce toward $0.50–$0.55, while a decisive breakdown below $0.42 risks further decline toward $0.38–$0.36. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP hovers at $0.432, barely positive with a +0.02% move. The Alligator indicator lines are converging, reflecting compressed price action and a pause in momentum. This tight alignment typically precedes a breakout in volatility. However, the overall alignment still favors the bears as the price trades just below these lines. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The PVT (Price Volume Trend) stands at 71.28M, showing minor accumulation, while the Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.03 highlights neutrality, meaning there’s no strong control by bulls or bears in the short term. If OP can sustain above $0.435, a short-lived bounce toward $0.445–$0.45 could occur, but if rejected, price may revisit $0.425 or even $0.41. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5351 SELL SMA 5 $0.4943 SELL SMA 10 $0.4938 SELL SMA 21 $0.5907 SELL SMA 50 $0.6695 SELL SMA 100 $0.6996 SELL SMA 200 $0.7364 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5797 SELL EMA 5 $0.6247 SELL EMA 10 $0.6680 SELL EMA 21 $0.6971 SELL EMA 50 $0.7026 SELL EMA 100 $0.7150 SELL EMA 200 $0.8519 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP appears to be stabilizing at $0.43 after its decline, but with minimal volume and momentum. Unless $0.45 is reclaimed convincingly, the token remains vulnerable to minor downside extensions. Traders can anticipate a sideways-to-slightly bearish movement between $0.42–$0.45 in the short term. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

While BTC’s stability offers confidence, many traders are turning to high-potential altcoins for outsized returns and early-stage opportunities. One such standout is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a next-generation DeFi token currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token. With over 70% of phase sold out and more than $17.75 million raised, Mutuum Finance is a top choice for investors wondering what crypto to buy now, offering both strong fundamentals and high growth potential ahead of 2025’s market cycle. Bitcoin Maintains Macro Bull Structure Amid Short-Term Pullback Bitcoin (BTC) is going for approximately $109,000 following its recent flash crash, with support that comes in to stop further decline but which has yet to burst out higher than $110,000. Bitcoin’s macro bull structure is intact regardless of short-term volatility, the Gaussian Channel analysis confirms, according to veteran analyst Titan of Crypto. The weekly candle chart shows green areas for bull runs and red areas for bearish pullbacks, illustrating that BTC’s recent pullback from the October 6 all-time high at $126,000 is merely a temporary reprieve in an overall bull market. With the upper band of the Gaussian Channel trending around $101,300, Bitcoin trading above the channel illustrates long-term strength and resilience. As traders balance BTC’s overall bullish framework and near-term volatility, though, many are also looking into Mutuum Finance which is set to expand in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale 70% Full in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains the best crypto to buy in the DeFi market. The project is growing more popular among serious investors and is increasingly being considered as investors ask what crypto to buy now for 2025. In the sixth presale phase, MUTM has increased 16.17% from Stage 5 to be at $0.035, the lowest price it will ever be offered. Not getting in during Phase 6 means entering at Stage 7 at a higher $0.04 price, a difference of 14.28%. Investor interest is still high, with more than 17,340 investors putting in more than $17.75 million in the presale. As 70% of Phase 6 is already sold, the momentum keeps growing as international investors rush for exposure to this high-potential DeFi protocol, establishing MUTM as one of the best crypto to buy right now. Launch of Lending & Borrowing Protocol One of the highlights on Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is the release of its lending and borrowing protocol that will revolutionize the DeFi ecosystem. Version 1 (V1) will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will feature prominent decentralized finance staples like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the Liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported from day one for lending, borrowing, and collateralization, with a secure, scalable, and user-friendly experience for retail and institutional users. This upcoming release makes MUTM a prime answer to what crypto to buy now for investors seeking early adoption. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Investors The Mutuum Finance leaderboard is still juicing the community with its crowd-based reward system. The leading buyers have bought $7,036 and $6,619 worth of MUTM tokens in the last 24 hours alone. The top buyer of the day is rewarded with $500 worth of MUTM, which encourages repeat participation and long-term dedication, further cementing MUTM as the crypto to buy now. With Bitcoin still holding its bullish structure intact, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best crypto to buy for disproportional growth potential. Phase 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, with more than 70% of the phase sold out and $17.75 million raised from 17,340 investors. The daily leaderboard, which pays $500 MUTM, is indicative of strong community support and early adoption. With its double-lending DeFi model and upcoming V1 lending protocol release on Sepolia Testnet, MUTM has innovation, utility, and early-stage upside in its favor. Investors wishing for high-potential altcoins alongside BTC stability should lock in their tokens before Phase 7 pushes the price to $0.04.

How fast can a project break into the top 30 and keep its place? Looking back, Toncoin gained traction with Telegram, Shiba Inu relied on memes, and Avalanche grew through developer adoption. Each followed a unique path shaped by timing and traction. Now, BlockDAG (BDAG) steps into this race with unmatched strength. With $430 million raised across 31 batches, priced at $0.0015, more than 27 billion coins sold, and 3 million active miners, it already looks different. Its live infrastructure and mining-ready community place it ahead of typical launches. The key question: can BlockDAG climb faster than any coin before it? Let’s compare history and today’s momentum. How Quickly Did Other Coins Reach the Top 30? To understand what BlockDAG is aiming for, we need to study past winners. Toncoin (TON) reached the Top 30 in about 3.5 months after its 2022 public launch. Its success came mainly from ecosystem backing and Telegram integration. Sui (SUI) entered the Top 100 in only 48 hours due to heavy CEX support, but it needed two months to approach the Top 30 consistently. Sei Network (SEI) drew hype at launch but took over 10 weeks before maintaining any Top 50 rank. Then came Shiba Inu (SHIB), which soared into the Top 30 in less than 90 days purely through meme-driven buzz, even without strong utility. Avalanche (AVAX) followed a slower but steady rise, supported by developers and ecosystem traction. If BlockDAG wants to do better, it must show massive daily volume, rapid listings, and proof of active usage. Unlike others, it already comes with 3 million miners, working hardware, EVM and WASM support, and a strong base for developers. Why BlockDAG’s Strength Before Launch is Different Most new chains start empty, but BlockDAG is the opposite. Its X1 mobile app already has 3 million daily users mining coins, meaning the system is active even before launch. This changes everything. Instead of beginning with unused blocks, it will open with wallets, mined coins, and a synchronised network of mobile and hardware miners. BlockDAG’s hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work setup can handle up to 15,000 transactions per second. By replacing the traditional UTXO model, it also lays the foundation for Smart Accounts (EIP-4337). That means smoother and faster performance from the start. But it’s not only about the tech. With more than 312,000 holders, a wide global referral system, and a partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team , BlockDAG is reaching far outside typical crypto groups. With everyone watching, BlockDAG will step into the Binance spotlight this Friday, October 24 at 3 PM UTC, for an AMA revealing roadmap updates, internal progress, and clues about what’s coming at Keynote 4 and GENESIS DAY. This mix of social and technical readiness sets it up to compete with meme-level hype while backed by working infrastructure. Can BlockDAG Be the Fastest Top 30 Climber? Now the timeline depends on market activity. Let’s assume BlockDAG launches with exchange support and liquidity. At a trading price of $0.03 with 25 billion coins circulating after vesting, its market cap could be around $750 million. That places it near today’s Top 40 coins immediately. Volume then becomes the deciding factor. Shiba Inu hit $1.5 billion in daily trading during its breakout. SUI and SEI saw $300–600 million in their first weeks thanks to CEX pushes. If BlockDAG can generate even $500 million in launch-week volume, with its Formula 1® branding and 3 million miners fueling activity, its ranking could break into the Top 30 in just 30 to 45 days. Moreover, BlockDAG has introduced a new limited-time TGE code. It allows early access at launch, depending on your rank: 1– 300 Rank: Instant Airdrop 301 – 600 Rank: Airdrop after 30 min 601 – 1000 Rank: Airdrop after 60 min 1001 – 1500 Rank: Airdrop after 2 h 1501 – 2000 Rank: Airdrop after 4 h 2001 – 5000 Rank: Airdrop after 6 h 5001 Rank: Airdrop after 24 h The edge lies in its ready-made community and live infrastructure. It is not waiting for adoption; it already has it. With $430 million raised, priced at $0.0015 in Batch 31, and over 27 billion coins sold, the system is primed. Compared to AVAX, SHIB, and TON, BlockDAG could become the fastest crypto to climb into the top 30 in 2025. Wrap Up History shows that coins reach the top 30 through hype, listings, or ecosystem power. Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche each proved that. But BlockDAG is built differently. It already has miners, infrastructure, and holders in place before launch. With $430 million raised, 27 billion coins sold, and millions engaged, it isn’t starting from zero. If launch-week volume hits strong numbers, BlockDAG could break into the Top 30 within weeks, not months. Unlike coins that rely only on hype, it combines real usage with viral momentum. Among crypto climbers of 2025, BlockDAG could be the name that forces the industry to rethink speed and performance.

Now, Bitcoin Price Prediction models are being reassessed by analysts, debating whether this surge is an indicator of an imminent rally or potentially a plateau leading to further consolidation. The increase in network activity has also caused apprehension about efficiency of mining and short-term confidence. While an increase in the hash rate typically suggests a healthier network and miners regaining confidence, there are experts who feel that it could be an indicator of overextension in the short term. Meanwhile, investor interest is spreading beyond Bitcoin as more attention is placed on a utility-oriented crypto project growing in popularity for its payment network innovation and recent audit confirmation reflecting the market’s shift toward viable, functional blockchain ecosystems. Growing Hash Rate Enhances Network Security As of the writing of this article, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $108,494.53, down 2.07% in the last day, and with total market capitalization at $2.2 trillion. Trading volume actually grew by 4.21% to $61.34 billion despite the dip, indicating continued engagement in the market even during short-term corrections. Historically, sharp increases in hash rate have been precursors to a big change in trend. Long-term increases in mining activity historically tracked closely with phases of accumulation in earlier cycles, suggesting miners and institutional investors could be positioning themselves for the next step higher. Others expect a mid-term Bitcoin Price Forecast of $120,000 to $125,000, assuming institutional inflows continue to increase once liquidity worldwide improves. Others warn, however, that even as hash rate strength adds strength to network resilience, price direction continues to depend on broader macro forces such as dollar liquidity and profitability of miners. Such caution reflects the changing analytical context surrounding Bitcoin, where fundamentals and extrinsic factors are increasingly balanced against one another. New Rising Crypto Gains Industry Recognition Alongside Bitcoin’s network growth, attention continues to shift toward emerging blockchain projects with strong audit credentials and real-world functionality. Among these, Remittix (RTX) has quickly distinguished itself as a leading PayFi solution. The project’s token currently trades at $0.1166 and has secured over $27.5 million through private investment rounds, with more than 679.8 million tokens distributed to early participants. Remittix’s team verification by CertiK marks a major achievement, earning the project the #1 global ranking for Pre-Launch Tokens on CertiK Skynet. This milestone has strengthened investor confidence, particularly as future exchange listings on BitMart and LBank approach. The project has also launched a wallet beta and a referral rewards program, offering users 15% in USDT bonuses for verified referrals, an initiative that continues to expand its global user base. As analysts anticipate continued momentum, many view Remittix as a strong reflection of the same institutional interest supporting bullish Bitcoin Price Prediction models for 2025.

53503685,https://finbold.com/?p=255953,1761149135,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"Bitcoin crash to below $100k ‘inevitable’ by this weekend, warns banking giant",https://finbold.com/bitcoin-crash-to-below-100k-inevitable-by-this-weekend-warns-banking-giant/,"Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ongoing price volatility may extend into the weekend and could culminate in the asset dropping below the crucial $100,000 mark, according to an outlook by Standard Chartered . The bank’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, said this drop seems inevitable but may prove temporary and could set the stage for Bitcoin’s next major rally. “The question now is how far does Bitcoin need to fall before finding a base. A dip below $100,000 seems inevitable, although the dump may be short-lived,” he said. Standard Chartered’s warning follows Bitcoin’s sharp reversal from an all-time high above $126,000 earlier this month. The cryptocurrency’s rally stalled on October 10 after renewed U.S.–China trade tensions sparked a $19 billion market liquidation, its largest in 2025. The correction pushed prices to a four-month low near $104,000 before stabilizing. Despite the near-term weakness, Kendrick remains optimistic that Bitcoin’s decline will form a base for another leg higher. He noted that tightening liquidity conditions and shifts between gold and Bitcoin remain key indicators for market stabilization. A brief rebound earlier this week coincided with a selloff in gold, suggesting a growing “sell gold, buy Bitcoin” flow that could signal a bottom forming. Currently, Standard Chartered expects Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows and favorable macroeconomic conditions, including potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, to support a recovery. Bitcoin’s next record high Kendrick’s base case remains bullish for the months ahead, projecting that Bitcoin could climb to $200,000 by year-end and extend its longer-term target to $500,000 by 2028. “As the dust settles after the massive liquidation event, investors may see it as a buying opportunity. My official forecast is $200,000 by the end of the year,” he added. Notably, Standard Chartered’s outlook holds weight, given its accurate call for Bitcoin to hit $100,000 by the end of 2024. Kendrick had consistently backed this view, pointing to catalysts like the U.S. presidential election, rising institutional ETF inflows, and the Bitcoin halving. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading near $108,474, down roughly 5% over the past 24 hours.

Traders who lean on price structure and moving-average behavior are watching with bated breath, and for good reason: a recognizable pattern that preceded past rallies is appearing again, and a widely followed analyst on X just flagged it. The Signal Unfolding On X, the signal was flagged by STEPH IS CRYPTO, who pulled up daily charts of XRP and deployed the EMA-ribbon tool to make a case for a tactical buying window . After noting the mechanics of the ribbon, a series of exponential moving averages layered to capture momentum and trend, he pointed out that when price drops below the ribbon and the ribbon itself fans and over-extends, it has in the past acted as a launchpad for meaningful upside. As he said, “Whenever we see the bearish flip, that is usually, believe it or not, a very good buying opportunity.” IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/CKNSugPPxO — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 21, 2025 But the kicker: Steph argues that on or around October 13, XRP underwent just such a ribbon flip, trading below the EMA cluster and becoming over-extended to the downside, suggesting we may be at the very moment that historically preceded the next leg higher. Historical Context and Technical Backing EMA ribbons are not a novelty; they have served as a barometer for trend shifts in cryptocurrency markets. In Steph’s chart review, he highlighted prior instances when XRP dropped below the ribbon, stayed there for multiple weeks, and then reversed into sizable rallies. He made the sober point that moving averages are “lagging indicators,” meaning that by the time the ribbon shows the shift, significant momentum is often already building. He also emphasized the psychological component: “Right now same thing we are at peak fear level,” he noted, adding that the absence of retail interest or broad enthusiasm often precedes the breakthrough moves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Taken together, the setup combines traditional chart structure (ribbon flip and over-extension) with market sentiment (fear, inertia, worn-out buyers), increasing the appeal to disciplined traders with a multi-week horizon. What It Means for Holders If you hold XRP and are prepared for a medium-term ride, Steph’s message is clear: this could qualify as one of those rare tactical windows where holding, despite discomfort, might yield significant reward. His thesis: if XRP clears or holds above the ribbon cluster and begins to build momentum, the prior “pain zone” may morph into the launching pad for a broader move. However, this is not a guarantee. Steph himself cautions: “Maybe XRP is not going to five dollars, maybe we’re going to stop at four dollars or $4.50. It’s important that you have an exit strategy and that you secure profits on the way up.” Risk management remains crucial. Outlook and Next Moves For confirmation of the setup, Steph points to daily closes above the ribbon zone, increasing volume, and a reclaim of key support levels. If those triggers materialize, the prior pattern suggests the next leg of upside could be underway. If they don’t, patience and caution are warranted. In sum: Steph’s message is not an iron-clad guarantee, but a disciplined, chart-based observation that the market is flashing a historically favorable accumulation pattern. If you hold, and hold with conviction and risk controls in place, this may be the moment that separates passive ownership from strategic positioning.

The bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 18, 2025 ; the GENIUS Act marks the United States’ first federal framework dedicated to regulating payment stablecoins. Weekly Crypto Regulation Roundup: Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law — the first major U.S. crypto bill to clear Congress. #CryptoRegulation #GeniusAct https://t.co/fSH8DZnCIo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 The White House hailed the legislation as a “historic moment for crypto and the U.S. dollar,” emphasizing that it would position the nation as a leader in digital assets. The law introduces strict rules on who can issue stablecoins, how reserves must be backed, and the disclosures required to ensure transparency. It creates a licensing pathway under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for both banks and qualified non-banks, while excluding algorithmic or DeFi-native tokens for further study. Supporters have described it as a long-awaited move to bring legal clarity to a market that had operated in a regulatory gray zone for years. Crypto Leaders Call GENIUS Act “Beginning of a New Regulatory Era” Executives from leading digital asset firms have largely praised the law. Ian De Bode, chief strategy officer at Ondo Finance, called it “the beginning of a new regulatory era,” citing bipartisan cooperation that he believes will boost institutional participation in crypto markets. He also noted that Patrick McHenry, former chair of the House Financial Services Committee and current vice chair of Ondo Finance, played a key role in advancing the bill. Similarly, Bitpanda deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad described the law as a “breakthrough” that has renewed market optimism, pointing to a recent rally in Bitcoin and altcoins. Tae Oh, CEO of Gluwa, emphasized that the framework “signals a strong commitment to responsible innovation, consumer protection, and long-term industry growth.” SEC Chair Paul Atkins praised the GENIUS Act on Tuesday, with the federal regulator calling it a ""seminal"" step. #SEC #PaulAtkins https://t.co/kCmIQMHMVd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 19, 2025 Federal regulators have echoed these sentiments. SEC Chair Paul Atkins called the GENIUS Act a “seminal step” for U.S. financial regulation , acknowledging that while many challenges remain, the law provides much-needed clarity. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went further, describing it as “essential” for maintaining American leadership in digital finance, predicting that stablecoins will expand dollar access globally and increase demand for U.S. Treasuries. However, the praise has not been unanimous. In recent weeks, major banking associations and lawmakers have voiced growing concerns about potential loopholes and systemic risks within the new law. Warren vs. Trump’s Treasury: Stablecoin Law Sparks $6.6 Trillion Banking Panic On August 13, a coalition of leading U.S. banking trade groups, including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, and Financial Services Forum, urged Congress to tighten the rules . They warned that the GENIUS Act’s language could allow stablecoin issuers or affiliated entities to indirectly pay yield to holders, even though the law explicitly bans issuers from doing so. US banks have warned that a gap in the GENIUS Act could allow stablecoin issuers to skirt restrictions on paying yield to holders. #Stablecoin #Crypto https://t.co/N7lSngpPof — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 Such an arrangement, they cautioned, could divert up to $6.6 trillion in deposits from traditional banks into stablecoins, potentially driving up borrowing costs for households and businesses. The most forceful criticism, however, has come from Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Bessent, Warren accused the administration of overlooking corruption and conflicts of interest tied to Trump-linked allies involved in shaping the legislation. Source: U.S. Senate She argued that Treasury must insulate its proposed rules from these influences and strengthen oversight to prevent “rogue states, drug cartels, terrorists, and criminals” from exploiting stablecoins to move illicit funds. Warren Blasts GENIUS Act as “Dangerous and Deregulatory,” Says Treasury Ignoring Risks to Everyday Americans Warren also warned that the GENIUS Act fails to provide adequate consumer protections, leaving users vulnerable to scams and losses in stablecoin transactions. Unlike traditional banking apps such as Venmo, she said, the law lacks provisions ensuring that consumers receive the same safeguards or that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) retains enforcement power. She further criticized the bill’s failure to prevent Big Tech and large conglomerates from issuing private currencies, saying it risks allowing corporations to “take control over the money supply.” Warren added that the absence of stronger financial stability guardrails could make “destructive runs and demands for bailouts” more likely, urging Treasury to issue clear guidance barring the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) or any Federal Reserve 13(3) emergency facility to rescue the stablecoin industry. Source: U.S. Senate In addition, the senator called for the Treasury to reject any reciprocity agreement with El Salvador that would allow Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, to bypass U.S. compliance obligations under the GENIUS Act. “The Treasury has an opportunity to address these risks through bipartisan negotiations over broader crypto legislation,” Warren wrote, urging the department to act swiftly to close regulatory gaps and strengthen enforcement. She also warned back in August that the current crypto framework could ‘blow up’ the U.S. economy while blasting GENIUS Act and Trump’s cryptocurrency business ventures as corruption risks. Despite these divisions, the GENIUS Act remains a milestone in U.S. digital asset regulation. Supporters view it as a foundation for mainstream adoption, while critics argue it leaves key vulnerabilities unaddressed. Former White House Crypto Council executive Bo Hines, who helped craft the legislation before joining Tether as a strategic advisor , described the GENIUS Act as the “first piece of the puzzle” in modernizing America’s financial system . He credited the White House’s rapid pace in passing the bill, saying it was designed to make U.S. payment rails “fair and robust.” The post Stablecoin Bill Divides Lawmakers as Senator Warren Warns of Trump-Linked Conflicts of Interest appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|News|Elizabeth Warren|GENIUS Act|Trump,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ONDO|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-22 16:16:21

According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, there are now over 155 crypto ETP filings covering 35 different digital assets. He expects this number could exceed 200 within the next year, signaling what he described as a “total land rush.” Regulatory Optimism Sparks ETF Boom Last month, the SEC introduced Generic Listing Standards providing clear guidelines for crypto ETF submissions. If an application meets these criteria, it can bypass the traditionally lengthy 19b-4 approval process. This streamlined framework has encouraged asset managers to submit a record number of filings this year. Besides Bitcoin and Ethereum, the big winner among altcoins appears to be Solana (SOL) . The token has seen 23 ETF applications matching Bitcoin in volume and surpassing other major cryptocurrencies like XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin. According to The Future Of Money data, pending SEC approvals could soon include altcoin ETFs for LTC, SOL, XRP, ADA, DOGE, and HBAR, with review deadlines between October 2 and 26. These developments reflect a growing appetite among institutional investors to gain exposure to a diversified crypto portfolio. Solana Price Outlook and Market Catalysts Despite the regulatory excitement, Solana’s price has struggled in recent days. SOL trades at $184.65 , down 4.64% in 24 hours and over 8% in the past week. However, traders believe a rebound may be imminent. Matthew Dixon, a market analyst, noted that SOL recently bounced from a local low of $172, showing the start of an impulsive upward move. Source: X According to his analysis, the correction phase appears complete, and bullish momentum could soon resume. Key resistance levels stand at $196.7, $203, and $211.5, with a potential target near $235 if momentum accelerates.

In 2027, it will range between $157.24 and $186.72, with an average price of $171.98. In 2031, it will range between $353.78 and $383.26, with an average price of $368.52. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

From a broader perspective, the HYPE price increased to $36.38, gaining 3.06% in its total value today. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2025 once again, as it did in September. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $137.58. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $383.26, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $383.26 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached a high price of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it discovered the $50.99 level with changing market dynamics. On September 18, HYPE achieved its ATH at $59.30, and in October, it is trending near $50.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZEC|ZRX|USDC|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-22 17:00:00

BlockDAG’s GENESIS DAY countdown has sparked growing anticipation across its expanding community, with the presale surpassing $430 million and heading toward the $600 million goal. Meanwhile, XRP’s price has softened after heavy sell-offs, while Stellar (XLM) shows renewed strength as it gains traction across fintech and payment sectors. Together, these three names represent distinct phases in blockchain growth: BlockDAG (BDAG) gearing up for launch, XRP seeking renewed strength, and Stellar building lasting real-world adoption. As GENESIS DAY approaches, the balance between progress, adoption, and sentiment could reshape the list of top crypto performers leading into 2025. Stellar Builds Strength Through Real Utility While XRP faces selling pressure, Stellar continues to gain traction through practical blockchain applications. The network has become a preferred platform for digital payroll and cross-border payments, especially within Asia’s growing fintech sector. Its architecture allows instant and low-cost transfers that comply with regulatory standards, attracting enterprise adoption across small and mid-sized businesses. Recent updates introduced enhanced smart-contract automation for payroll and vendor payments, further improving efficiency and transparency. These features highlight Stellar’s focus on usability rather than speculation. Stablecoin integration and reduced fees continue to draw attention, helping XLM strengthen its foothold as a trusted payments infrastructure. If current adoption momentum persists, Stellar could cement its role as a core layer for digital payment systems and B2B transactions by 2026. XRP Faces Pressure as Sellers Dominate XRP’s recent activity reflects short-term exhaustion following a large volume of sell-offs. Over $950 million worth of XRP, nearly 320 million units, were moved to exchanges within a week, suggesting widespread profit-taking. Data from Age Consumed metrics revealed that long-held assets were being liquidated, a clear signal that even experienced participants are reducing exposure. Currently, XRP trades near $2.96, slightly above its $2.94 support. Sustained selling could push prices to $2.85–$2.75, while a move above $3.02–$3.12 would indicate renewed strength. Exchange reserves remain elevated, implying more volatility ahead. Despite this short-term pressure, XRP continues to hold relevance in global remittance systems and institutional settlements, with potential ETF approvals still keeping it under close market observation. A confirmed rebound in accumulation could help reestablish stability in the coming months. BlockDAG Prepares for GENESIS DAY Launch BlockDAG is entering its final stage before the long-awaited GENESIS DAY, its full mainnet activation and exchange rollout. The project has already raised over $430 million at $0.0015 per BDAG in Batch 31, selling over 27 billion coins to over 312,000 holders worldwide. With more than 20,000 hardware miners shipped and 3.5 million+ X1 app miners live, it now hosts one of the largest mining communities in the Layer-1 space. The roadmap emphasizes four major goals before launch: completing mainnet infrastructure, finalizing global miner deliveries, achieving the $600 million presale milestone, and debuting across 20 confirmed exchanges. These milestones align with Keynote 4: Launch Note, which will unveil the full-scale deployment of the network. GENESIS DAY is described as a defining transition where the presale community officially hands control to the live blockchain ecosystem. It marks the activation of real-time transactions, exchange liquidity, and open participation. The TGE Code remains the final gateway for participants to secure Genesis bonuses before the network goes live. This Friday, BlockDAG is set to go LIVE on Binance for an exclusive AMA on October 24 at 3PM UTC, marking one of its biggest global appearances yet. The session will feature insider updates, new roadmap reveals, and major insights ahead of Keynote 4: The Launch Note and GENESIS DAY. Summary As the final quarter of 2025 unfolds, BlockDAG’s GENESIS DAY countdown dominates attention across the digital asset landscape. With over $430 million raised and a limited-time $0.0015 entry, the project is closing in on its $600 million presale goal. XRP remains under short-term selling pressure but retains long-term potential through institutional adoption, while Stellar gains steady momentum through real-world financial integration. Together, these developments highlight how distinct strategies, scalable infrastructure, payment integration, and ecosystem expansion are defining the next stage of blockchain maturity. For many, BlockDAG’s GENESIS DAY stands as one of 2025’s most closely watched milestones, signaling the shift from presale anticipation to live network realization.

53505262,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87231,1761152431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"BlockDAG Eyes Top 30 After Presale Nears $430M Ahead of Live AMA on Binance, Challenging Toncoin’s Market Position",https://timestabloid.com/blockdag-eyes-top-30-after-presale-nears-430m-ahead-of-live/,"In 2025, Toncoin became one of the most talked-about coins in the market. Its direct link with Telegram pushed it beyond $7, with millions of active wallets and a spot in the global Top 10 rankings. However, new attention is now on BlockDAG, which has entered the post-launch stage with powerful traction. Unlike most projects that take years to build user bases, BlockDAG already has over 3.5 million miners and has secured nearly $430 million in funding before its full launch and the upcoming AMA session going live on Binance. With over 27 billion coins sold and Batch 31 now priced at $0.0015 for a short time, many are asking if BlockDAG (BDAG) can match or even outperform Toncoin. The answer depends on its infrastructure, adoption, and growth potential. Toncoin Growth Fueled by Telegram’s Integration Toncoin’s performance this year has drawn attention for good reason. Its price surged past $7 after integrating with Telegram’s wallet and bot systems, creating a spike in user activity. Daily transactions passed 2.5 million, and the number of active wallets rose sharply. At its highest point, Toncoin broke into the Top 10 coins by market cap. This growth was not built on promises alone but came from real utility and high throughput. The key driver was its direct connection to Telegram, one of the world’s largest social platforms. This integration meant Toncoin had immediate access to a global user base and strong usage incentives. Market confidence pushed prices upward, supported by both retail demand and larger financial players. Any new project hoping to follow this kind of momentum must deliver more than temporary hype. It requires actual usage, robust infrastructure, and consistent user engagement from day one. Without these, sustaining long-term adoption would be nearly impossible. BlockDAG Launches With Real Infrastructure and Utility Unlike many new launches, BlockDAG comes prepared with active users and strong technical delivery. More than 3.5 million people are already mining coins through the X1 app, while over 20,000 hardware miners have already been sold. This network uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work plus DAG design, scaling from 1,000 to 15,000 transactions per second. This matches or even exceeds Toncoin’s current performance. As of Batch 31, BlockDAG has raised nearly $430 million in presale and sold 27 billion coins. For a limited period, users can secure coins at just $0.0015 with the TGE code. This code also provides early access and special rank-based airdrops. 1– 300 Rank: Instant Airdrop 301 – 600 Rank: Airdrop after 30 min 601 – 1000 Rank: Airdrop after 60 min 1001 – 1500 Rank: Airdrop after 2 hours 1501 – 2000 Rank: Airdrop after 4 hours 2001 – 5000 Rank: Airdrop after 6 hours 5001 Rank: Airdrop after 24 hours Beyond mining, the system supports both EVM and WASM, making it easier for developers to bring in apps from Ethereum and other platforms. With Smart Account groundwork (EIP-4337), a Stratum Protocol for syncing miners, and a UTXO-free structure, BlockDAG offers speed and efficiency. Its blockchain explorer, live Dashboard V4, and features like Buyer Battles and Referral Leaderboards show a working ecosystem, not just future plans. BlockDAG is also about to take the global stage with a Binance AMA on October 24, at 3 PM UTC, unveiling insider updates and roadmap announcements leading to Keynote 4: The Launch Note and GENESIS DAY. Could BlockDAG Reach the Top 30 by Market Cap? Toncoin’s rise to the Top 10 came from Telegram’s strong support. BlockDAG, however, builds from the ground up. Its focus is not on riding one major app but on creating an independent, active ecosystem. The X1 app ensures millions of participants mine coins daily, while its smart wallet features add direct user incentives. Already, more than 312,000+ holders are engaged before full exchange listings. Analysts note that if BlockDAG reaches a $5 billion market cap after launch, it would sit within the top 30 rankings. Toncoin peaked between $20 and $25 billion, but BlockDAG has something Toncoin lacked at the start: deeper funding. With nearly $430 million already raised, BlockDAG enters the market with strong liquidity and early strength. Future growth could be accelerated by CEX listings, which have not yet been officially announced but are widely expected. These would likely boost daily trading volumes, pushing BlockDAG higher in CoinMarketCap rankings. Importantly, BlockDAG isn’t trying to copy Toncoin: live miners, airdrop rewards, and working infrastructure power its growth. If momentum continues across mobile mining, smart accounts, and exchange partnerships, a Top 30 position is highly possible. Its 2,940% ROI from Batch 1 to Batch 31 proves demand is already strong. Summing Up BlockDAG and Toncoin both highlight how different paths can lead to major growth. Toncoin’s success was built on its Telegram connection, which delivered instant global reach and daily activity. BlockDAG, by contrast, focuses on infrastructure and user ownership. With over 3.5 million miners, presale nearing $430M, and over 27 billion coins sold, its foundation is strong before full-scale launch. The special Batch 31 price of $0.0015 further increases attention. While Toncoin reached the Top 10, analysts suggest BlockDAG could realistically enter the Top 30 if adoption and exchange listings continue. Its community-driven model and working systems make it more than just a presale project. BlockDAG may not chase Toncoin’s exact path, but it is clearly building momentum for its own powerful rise.

53505228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=841850,1761152432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53505228.jpeg,Dogecoin Faces Final Boss At 0.886 Fib As Bulls Eye $0.25 Reclaim,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-final-boss/,"Dogecoin is back pressing a long-standing resistance cluster as two prominent traders map the next pivotal steps. Cantonese Cat highlights a stubborn monthly Fibonacci ceiling at the 0.886 retracement—marked on his chart at $0.26633—while top trader Kaleo (who is leading the Synthetix trading challenge) points to a thin-liquidity pocket on lower time frames that he believes could enable a “swift reclaim” of $0.25. Long-Term Perspective On Dogecoin On the monthly grid shared by Cantonese Cat, the key levels are unambiguous. DOGE’s primary resistance remains the 0.886 retracement at $0.26633, just below the cycle reference at 1.000, labeled $0.73905. Support beneath price lines up with the 0.786 retracement at $0.10879, followed by 0.707 at $0.05363 and 0.618 at $0.02417. The current monthly candle sits near $0.19–$0.20 with roughly ten days left on the bar, holding within a consolidation corridor bounded by $0.10879–$0.26633 after an aggressive spike that wicked into 0.786—what the analyst called a “scam wick.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Slams Into $2.22 Billion Wall At $0.21 But Targets Above Are Explosive His read: DOGE “is having a hard time breaking above 0.886 for good,” because a clean breach would be “incredibly bullish,” and he expects another challenge of that level in Q4 2025. The levels on the chart contextualize DOGE’s multi-quarter structure. Since the 2021 blow-off, price has respected the Fibonacci ladder, repeatedly orbiting between the 0.707 and 0.886 bands. The failed pushes toward $0.26633 and the quick rejection wicks underscore how supply continues to reload at that shelf, while the sharp but short-lived pierce to the $0.10879 region confirms dip demand at the 0.786 handle without establishing acceptance below it. With the candle bodies clustered mid-range and the tails testing both extremes, the pair has carved a high-time-frame equilibrium that will likely resolve on a monthly close through either $0.26633 or a breakdown back toward $0.10879. What Needs To Happen Short-Term? Kaleo’s intraday view isolates the path that could force that higher-time-frame decision. His 4-hour chart plots a descending trendline from the local high through successive lower highs, currently intersecting near the $0.20–$0.21 zone where DOGE is trading around $0.203–$0.204. A visible range volume profile shows a prominent node around $0.20–$0.21 and a conspicuous low-volume pocket above, running through the low-$0.20s toward a green supply band capped near $0.25. He describes “A LOT of thin air to fill from the market nuke a couple weeks back,” referencing the vertical liquidation that drove DOGE from the mid-$0.20s to sub-$0.12 in a single cascade before rebounding. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021 Technically, that setup is straightforward: reclaim the descending trendline and hold above the point-of-control zone around $0.20–$0.21, and price enters the low-resistance void toward the prior distribution near $0.24–$0.25. Fail the reclaim, and the red horizontal basing area around ~$0.19 becomes the immediate pivot, with the extreme downside reference from the “nuke” still visible near the mid-$0.15s before the monthly 0.786 at $0.10879 re-enters view. The interplay between these charts is the crux. On the high time frame, $0.26633 is the “final boss” that has repeatedly turned price; on the low time frame, the route to re-test that wall starts with a squeeze through a low-volume corridor into $0.25. A decisive monthly close above $0.26633 would flip the market’s most consequential resistance into support and shift the conversation toward the 1.000 reference at $0.73905, but—per Cantonese Cat’s caution—that outcome isn’t confirmed by the current structure. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.191.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-investors-your-accumulation-time-is-over-heres-why/,"A viral post on X has shaken the XRP community, sparking a heated debate about whether the golden era of accumulation has finally come to an end. The message, while short, cuts deep, urging retail investors to confront a new economic reality in which acquiring meaningful amounts of XRP may soon be out of reach. The question dominating discussions is simple yet profound: has XRP’s price evolution officially priced out the average investor? KINGVALEX Sounds the Alarm Crypto commentator KINGVALEX took to X with a blunt statement that quickly gained traction. He wrote, “XRP will cost you 2,000 dollars just to get 917 XRP. Normal working retail people are finished. Your accumulation time is over.” His words resonated with many, reflecting a broader sentiment that the window for cheap XRP accumulation, once taken for granted, may now be closing rapidly . KINGVALEX’s post highlights an emerging divide between institutional power and retail accessibility, as price dynamics shift in favor of large-scale buyers. $XRP will cost you $2,000 dollars just to get 917 XRP. Normal working retail people are finished. Your accumulation time IS OVER. pic.twitter.com/AmP8yMLnM4 — KINGVALEX (@VALELORDX) October 21, 2025 XRP Price Context and the Cost of Accumulation As of report time, XRP trades around $2.40, marking one of its strongest performances in years. That valuation means a bundle of 917 XRP costs roughly $2,200, slightly above KINGVALEX’s quoted figure. Still, his message stands: the affordability barrier is real. Just a few years ago, the same amount of XRP could be purchased for under $400. This exponential rise underscores how price appreciation, while bullish for holders, simultaneously challenges new entrants. For many everyday investors, allocating thousands of dollars to a single digital asset now demands careful consideration and strategic entry points. Institutional Liquidity and Market Dynamics Recent trading data shows heightened institutional participation and rising liquidity at higher price bands. Daily transaction volumes have surged, suggesting that large-wallet players are increasingly active in the market. This behavior tightens liquidity zones and drives micro-volatility, making it harder for smaller retail participants to buy substantial amounts without a significant cost impact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These institutional inflows, coupled with renewed optimism around Ripple’s business developments and broader crypto market recovery, have reinforced bullish sentiment. Yet, they have also tilted the balance of accessibility, pushing XRP closer to what some call a “professionalized” market phase. What This Means for the Average Investor The implications of this price surge extend beyond sticker shock. For retail investors, it means smaller orders now translate to fewer tokens, and market order slippage can erode value faster than expected. Moreover, as posts like KINGVALEX’s circulate widely, they can create psychological urgency, prompting impulsive buying that further accelerates short-term price spikes. Affordability in crypto is not just about raw token price; it’s about positioning, timing, and strategic execution. Retail investors who once relied on dollar-cost averaging may now need to reassess their approach, factoring in exchange fees, volatility, and macro liquidity flows. Adapting to the New Market Reality While KINGVALEX’s tone may sound conclusive, his message serves as a critical reminder: markets evolve, and so must investors. XRP’s multi-dollar valuation signals maturity, not exclusion. Prudent investors can still build exposure, but through disciplined planning, verified exchange data, and controlled entry strategies such as scheduled buys or price-based limits. In conclusion, KINGVALEX’s post captures a growing truth — the era of easy XRP accumulation is likely behind us. The asset’s climb into multi-dollar territory redefines what “retail-friendly” means in 2025’s maturing crypto landscape. Yet, for those who adapt intelligently rather than panic, opportunities still exist. The accumulation phase may be over, but the strategy phase has only just begun.

""He Wasn't Wrong the Last Three Times!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-historical-bottom-signal-may-have-arrived-according-to-cryptoquant-he-wasnt-wrong-the-last-three-times/,"Bitcoin continues to experience fluctuations after the major crash on October 11. While BTC, which is moving within a certain range, continues to search for direction, CryptoQuant analyst analyzed that a local bottom may have arrived. At this point, the CryptoQuant analyst noted that the Bitcoin MVRV ratio had fallen below its 365-day average, signaling a local bottom that historically precedes major price increases. The BTC Market Value/Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a measure of whether Bitcoin is overvalued, recently fell below its 365-day moving average, according to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets. The analyst stated that this situation in the MVRV ratio indicates that BTC may be at a local bottom. “The MVRV ratio is currently trading near 1.9, slightly below its 365-day moving average. Historically, every time the rate has fallen below the 365 SMA it has created a buying opportunity and a local bottom signal.” The analyst noted that the MVRV ratio fell below the 365-day SMA in mid-2021, June 2022, and early 2024, followed by increases of 135%, 100%, and 196%, respectively. The analyst stated that this situation was considered a buying opportunity and a local bottom signal at the time, reminding that the model is consistent and that it gives the same signal now. “If this metric starts to turn upwards from current levels, it could confirm that the recent sell-off was a cyclical bottom formation, which could support a renewed bullish period in the fourth quarter,” the analyst concluded. According to the analyst's Bitcoin MVRV analysis, if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price may enter a period of recovery and rise. *This is not investment advice.

A recent report showed transaction reordering was still happening, and up to 6% of proposed blocks by validators contained sandwiched attacks. Jito, one of the main block-building and liquid staking services, has banned another 15 validators from receiving JitoSOL. The ban happened after a recent report that validators still performed sandwich attacks, front-running Solana traders. Jito responded to a recent report on various types of sandwich attacks, which led to another wave of validator bans. In response to the recent @0xGhostLogs sandwiching report, the JitoSOL Blacklist Committee has banned 15 additional validators from receiving JitoSOL stake. Where you stake matters. 🛡️ — Jito (@jito_sol) October 22, 2025 Previously, Jito has also fought against dishonest validators that relied on dishonest block building and front-running trades. The latest problem with dishonest block proposals was uncovered by on-chain researchers from 0xGhostLogs. They discovered anomalous transactions in 23 validators, which relied on staking pools from Marinade and Jito. Six of those validators also received subsidies from the Solana Foundation. When proposing a new block as a leader, over 6% of leader slots contained sandwich attacks, targeting retail trades. Some validators had a larger share of wide sandwich attacks, with most of the traffic targeting specific apps and small-scale meme token trades. | Source: Sandwiched Some validators had up to 12.3% of proposed blocks containing wide sandwich attacks. Wide sandwich attacks continue on Solana, with an estimated 222,272 victims . Block builders use more sophisticated MEV attacks Validators have switched to more sophisticated front-running attacks. Previously, attacks happened in single leader slots and were readily detected. Validators then switched to multi-slot attacks, also known as wide sandwich attacks. Researchers noted 93% of attacks were coming from a so-called ‘wide sandwich’, where the front-running and back-running transactions were not in the same proposed block. 1) Ghost explains: Wide Sandwich Attacks (with updated website at the end) We looked at a full year of Solana trades and found that wide (multi-slot) sandwiches extracted 529,000 SOL. Wide sandwiches now account for 93% of all sandwiches pic.twitter.com/XWbVWYyAqE — Ghost (@0xGhostLogs) October 15, 2025 This type of attack extracted 30K to 60K SOL per month, with a record 87,000 SOL in January 2025. In this type of attack, a slot leader that proposes blocks can reorder transactions and avoid detection. With increased DEX activity, sandwich attacks are undermining confidence in using Solana as a retail trade platform. Attackers also wait for high-value transactions, which can be visible in private mempools. Then, they can inject trades of their own, which causes loss for the original trader. Axiom, Bloom, and Photon users were most affected The main source of attack was private mempools and lists of upcoming transactions, which were shared among validators. Any entity can apply to propose Solana blocks and become a validator, with limited governance tools to avoid dishonest behavior. The validators apparently colluded in some cases, targeting specific Solana apps. Around 70% of extracted SOL came from users on the Axiom trading platform, followed by Bloom and Photon. The bulk of sandwich attacks make less than $1, but some lead to as much as $10K in losses. Overall, some attackers pay up to 10 SOL in daily fees for priority transactions and bribes. Meme coin traders were the most affected, further adding to the volatility of newly launched assets and low-cap memes. Users of aggregators and wallets were relatively unaffected, due to a different order flow and routing.

The lease term also covers 200 MW (megawatts) of purpose-built critical IT load and HPC infrastructure. Applied Digital clarified in an October 22 press release that the lease represents $5 billion in total contracted revenue over an estimated 15-year lease term. The company also disclosed that the Hyperscale holds a first right of refusal for an additional 800 MW of critical IT load, highlighting Polaris Forge 2 Campus’s full expansion potential of 1 GW (gigawatt). Applied Digital has now leased 600 MW across its Polaris Forge 1 and Polaris Forge 2 Campuses in North Dakota to two Hyperscalers. The company claimed that the latest lease deal reinforces its position as a fast-scaling U.S.-based AI infrastructure builder. Polaris Forge 2 spans over 900 acres and is designed to deliver a projected PUE of 1.18, with near-zero water usage. Cummins says fast delivery sets his company apart Wes Cummins, the Chairman and CEO of Applied Digital, boasted that fast delivery, not just the size of its pipeline, sets the company apart from its competitors. He cautioned that the real constraint in the industry is execution. Cummins claimed that Applied Digital’s team proves that large-scale, next-generation data centers can be designed, financed, and activated faster and more efficiently. He believes Polaris Forge 2 builds on this momentum, reflecting the company’s strong partnerships and its rapid reshaping of the AI infrastructure landscape. “Our AI Factories are redefining how and where hyperscale infrastructure gets built…We’re demonstrating that the next chapter of AI computing can be powered from the heartland – built responsibly, delivered quickly and designed for the Intelligence Era.” – Wes Cummins , Chairman and CEO of Applied Digital The executive explained that the initial 200 MW is phased within two buildings at the Polaris Forge 2 site. It is expected to go online in 2026 and reach a total of 200 MW in 2027. Cummins also emphasized that the campus leverages the company’s Different by Design philosophy. Applied Digital’s proprietary design is built for liquid cooling, power density, and sustainable performance. APLD stock surges after lease announcement Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) stock surged more than 7% on Wednesday following news of the lease deal. The stock reversed last week’s gains when it plunged nearly 8% on Tuesday, while its price dropped 18% in just days to hover around $33, down from over $40. The stock price volatility has reportedly sparked a selloff due to skepticism that the company’s valuation and expansion narrative may be unrealistic. CEO Cummins sold 400,000 shares for $6 million, and Applied Digital’s CFO, Muhammad LaVanway, sold 75,000 shares worth $1.1 million. The timing triggered speculation that the company’s management believes the stock has peaked, sparking a renewed wave of selling pressure. Adding to investor unease, rumors of insider trading circulated to reignite fears of a peaking stock market. The company’s competitive moat is reportedly thinning despite $11 billion in committed revenue and new billion-dollar leasing contracts. Investors are starting to question whether APLD has any more room left for growth. Applied Digital’s valuation also appears somewhat stretched, despite strong top-line growth. Fears of an AI industry pullback have also amplified investor jitters. The sharp fall of APLD stock serves as a reality check for investors chasing the AI boom. The combination of competitive threats, insider selling, and stretched valuation paints a cautionary picture despite the company boasting ambitious expansions, strong revenue growth, and high-profile partnerships. APLD’s narrative could reportedly shift from breakout success to a cautionary tale of overextension in the AI rush. The company’s management must restore confidence and deliver sustainable profitability to regain investor trust.

Now in Phase 6 of presale at $0.035 per token and having already sold more than 70% with more than $17.75 million raised, this emerging new crypto coin is attracting serious interest for three primary reasons. These include its innovative dual-lending DeFi framework combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract mechanisms for optimal capital efficiency, its strong presale traction that indicates intense investor optimism and its aggressive roadmap, for instance, launching V1 platform on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with liquidity pools, mtTokens, and ETH/USDT collateralization. With this blend of innovation, growth, and daily practicality, Mutuum Finance is already set to become a number one buy and hold in 2025, and the top cryptocurrency to invest in this cycle. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Uptrend Indicators Point Towards 333% Increase Cardano (ADA) now has very solid indications of a turn around, always sitting in the green well above good support with massive break-out strength. Technical charts reveal that the bullish momentum is building with prices in readiness for a massive bigger move higher that would leave ADA far beyond 333% to the $2.96789 mark. This forecast signals ADA’s strength and rising adoption by the blockchain community since the token is something short-term investors and long-term investors are eagerly watching. While ADA charts offer the premise for humongous profits, there are also plenty of investors closely watching for upcoming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with significant growth rates, like new DeFi protocols that are gaining early-market attention. Mutuum Finance Draws attention in Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most promising cryptos to keep an eye on in 2025. Its current presale is only continuing to create higher levels of investor interest worldwide, and already more than 17,340 have gathered to raise a figure over $17.75 million. At Level 6 with the token price of $0.035, the lowest MUTM will ever fall to, the project is offering investors a great chance to hop aboard before the expected growth to $0.04 in the next level. Over 70% of Phase 6 tokens have been sold and with demand still increasing, showing strong belief in long-term potential for growth in the project. Leaderboard Awards and Community Engagement Mutuum Finance has introduced a leaderboard that gamifies the presale for increased community participation and rewards top investors. Top buyers in the last 24 hours have purchased $7,036 and $6,619 of MUTM tokens, reflecting increasing demand and bottom-up pressure. The MUTM token reward is $500 to the leading investor of the day. Members must have invested at least once in the last 24 hours to become eligible. This innovation reward has driven presale momentum, locked in liquidity, and motivated a competitive yet unified community ecosystem, further solidifying MUTM as one of the strongest cryptos to invest in today for active and long-term investors and traders. Apart from its presale achievement, Mutuum Finance will introduce the market to a revolutionary decentralized lending and borrowing protocol , which is the next milestone in its roadmap. Version 1 (V1) is scheduled to come out on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and introduce innovative DeFi features such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and Liquidator bot. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be among the top cryptos that will do well to invest in this cycle. Phase 6 presale tokens cost $0.035, over 70% of which have already been sold and $17.75 million from 17,340 investors raised. Ongoing leaderboard activity with $500 MUTM rewards shows extremely active community and increasing investor confidence. Two-way lending DeFi model and V1 lending protocol to be deployed on Sepolia Testnet soon, MUTM blends innovation, real-world use case, and early-stage potential.

While the forthcoming Percolator perpetual DEX is widely viewed as a long-term bullish development, it has triggered concerns about near-term displacement of capital across existing Solana protocols. Liquidity Rotations Pressure DeFi Valuations Data from DeFiLlama show Aster’s total value locked (TVL) fell $326 million (–15%) over the past week as users anticipate a migration to Percolator once it launches. The decline has amplified worries that Solana’s internal competition could cannibalize existing DeFi activity, rather than attract fresh liquidity. That shift coincides with broader market weakness, adding pressure to Solana’s native token. Technical Breakdown Accelerates Source: coinmarketcap Solana’s price action has turned decisively bearish. SOL broke below its 7-day simple moving average at $187.37 and its 30-day SMA at $207.19, signaling a loss of short-term momentum. The MACD line (–8.65) continues to trend below its signal line (–6.86), reinforcing bearish divergence, while the 14-day RSI at 40.96 sits in neutral-bearish territory, leaving room for additional downside. The breakdown below $187 triggered stop-loss cascades and algorithmic selling, pushing intraday volume up 38% to $8.43 billion. The move transformed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $222.27 — once a mid-range support — into an immediate resistance level. SOL Key Level: 200-Day SMA at $175 The 200-day simple moving average at $175.32 now marks a critical inflection point for Solana’s trend structure. A sustained close below this level could extend losses by another 8–10%, targeting the $160–$165 zone, which aligns with the previous consolidation range from early September. For traders, that threshold represents the dividing line between a routine retracement and a more meaningful trend reversal. Structural Bullish Case Intact, But Near-Term Risks Persist Despite the short-term weakness, Solana’s long-term outlook remains supported by core network innovation and rising developer activity. The upcoming integration of Percolator into the base layer could, over time, expand trading volumes and reinforce Solana’s positioning as a high-performance DeFi hub. However, the transition period may prove volatile, as liquidity rotates and speculative capital reacts to uncertainty around timing and implementation. In the immediate term, technical indicators point to continued caution until SOL can reclaim the $187–$190 region and establish support above the 30-day SMA. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Bottom Line Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, but short-term market structure has weakened amid fears that Percolator could fragment liquidity before stabilizing it. A decisive move below $175 would likely invite deeper selling, while recovery above $190 could restore short-term confidence. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At this point, the wallet belonging to LuBian Mining, one of the largest mining pools of its time, moved for the first time in 3 years last week and moved 1.1 billion worth of Bitcoins to new wallets. Related News: The Company Whose $14 Billion in Bitcoin Was Seized by the US Transferred a Billion Dollars of BTC Just One Day Later! Here Are the Details... After a week-long hiatus, the LuBian-linked wallet transferred $1.8 billion worth of BTC to new addresses. According to a post by OnchainLens, an address linked to Bitcoin mining pool LuBian transferred 15,959 BTC worth approximately $1.83 billion to four new addresses. 4,999K BTC worth $539.76 million transferred to bc1qs8 wallet 4,999K BTC worth $539.76 million transferred to 3JX2dH wallet 3,424K BTC worth $369.7 million transferred to 1cpnxU wallet 2.535K BTC worth $274.36 million was transferred to the 1G9FZS wallet.

One of the LuBian wallets (39DUz) moved all 9,757 BTC worth $1.1 billion after 3 years of inactivity. The Bitcoins were transferred to two new addresses. This transfer comes just one day after news broke that the US government seized LuBian’s stolen assets of 127,271 BTC, worth $14.4 billion. Lubian Mining emerged suddenly in early 2020 and quickly became one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools in the market. While its entry and growth did not go unnoticed, Lubian was soon hacked in December 2020, resulting in the theft of 127,000 BTC. However, the perpetrators were never identified. One of Lubian's wallets, which mysteriously disappeared suddenly in early 2021, was seized by the US just one day after being found. This seizure was the largest Bitcoin seizure in the US to date. *This is not investment advice.

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) confirmed on its website that the ChinaAMC Solana ETF, under ticker 3460, received authorization on October 17. This is the first instance of a Solana spot ETF gaining regulatory approval in the region. Hong Kong’s First Spot Solana ETF According to ChinaAMC, the fund will be officially listed on October 27, with a management fee of 0.99% per year. Custody arrangements include BOCI-Prudential Trustee Limited as the primary custodian, while OSL Digital Securities acts as the sub-custodian and also provides the virtual asset trading platform for the much-anticipated ETF. Investors will be able to trade the product in Hong Kong dollars, Chinese yuan, and US dollars on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with a board lot size of 100 shares in each currency. ChinaAMC already manages spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, which were among Asia’s first crypto ETFs. The approval of the Solana ETF comes at a time when market participants anticipate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may soon authorize its first batch of spot Solana and other altcoin ETFs. While initial approval was expected around October 10, delays likely stemmed from the extended US government shutdown. Last month, the securities regulator streamlined the process by adopting generic listing standards and eliminating the need for token-specific filings. This regulatory change has triggered a wave of new crypto ETF applications, amidst growing institutional interest in diversified digital asset products. MemeStrategy’s $377K Investment on Solana The recent approval of the spot Solana ETF in the region builds on momentum set earlier this year when MemeStrategy became Asia’s first publicly listed company to invest in Solana. Back in June, MemeStrategy acquired 2,440 SOL tokens, spending approximately $377,000 at an average price of $155 per token. The company had then cited the crypto asset’s long-term potential in blockchain, decentralized platforms, and AI-driven Web3 applications. The transaction was facilitated through OSL Group, a fully licensed Hong Kong digital asset platform.

Therefore, this transformation signals a major shift in how financial institutions may leverage blockchain technology to streamline liquidity and payments. At the heart of this evolution is Ripple’s GTreasury Management software. Already deployed in over 13,000 banks worldwide, GTreasury has established a proven track record in simplifying treasury operations, reducing settlement times, and enhancing liquidity management. The software’s widespread adoption has drawn attention from institutional players seeking reliable, scalable blockchain solutions. Ripple’s $1B recent GTreasury acquisition accelerates its expansion, enhancing banks’ ability to manage digital assets while seamlessly connecting with traditional financial systems. As a result, the German analyst highlights XRP’s emerging role as a bridge between legacy banking and blockchain, promising faster, cheaper cross-border transactions. The Fed’s Bold Move: Payment Accounts for Fintech and Crypto — A Game-Changer for $XRP According to renowned market analyst X Finance Bull, the Federal Reserve is exploring the creation of “payment accounts” for fintech and cryptocurrency firms. Therefore, this announcement is a seismic shift in the U.S. financial landscape, signaling that digital assets are no longer on the fringes, they are moving closer to the heart of the banking system. Notably, the potential impact on XRP is huge. As Ripple’s native asset and a proven bridge between traditional finance and blockchain, XRP stands to play a pivotal role if the Fed integrates fintech and crypto into U.S. payments. As a result, X Finance Bull views this as a key inflection point, XRP could evolve from a high-speed settlement token into a central pillar of the U.S. banking system. Furthermore, the analyst calls this “super bullish for $XRP.” As XRP bridges traditional banking and crypto networks, digital assets are shifting from speculative investments to essential financial tools. Ripple stands to gain institutional demand, stronger liquidity, and greater regulatory influence, key drivers of market momentum. Conclusion With widespread adoption in thousands of banks, strategic acquisitions, and a strong focus on regulatory compliance, XRP is set to become the essential bridge linking traditional finance with blockchain’s speed, efficiency, and transparency. On the other hand, the Fed’s exploration of payment accounts for fintech and crypto firms signals a historic shift in U.S. finance. For XRP, this isn’t just bullish, it positions the token as a key bridge linking traditional banking with the digital economy.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-22 17:41:03

Po tej znaczącej wyprzedaży założyciel Ethereum wysłał sygnał alarmowy dla rynku. Tak ogromna wyprzedaż zwykle rodzi liczne pytania, typu jaki był motyw takiego ruchu i jakie są możliwe konsekwencje dla dalszego kursu ETH? W obliczu ogólnej zmienności rynku i chwiejnej postawy inwestorów, moment wydaje się szczególnie newralgiczny dla czołowej sieci. Czy ruch ten odzwierciedla strategiczne zarządzanie portfelem, ostrożność rynkową czy może sygnał zmieniającego się sentymentu w kręgu liderów Ethereum? Na razie nie ma jednoznacznej odpowiedzi, natomiast wyprzedaż dodaje nową warstwę niepewności w dynamice rynkowej ETH. Rezerwy strategiczne Ethereum spadają Zaobserwowano również konsekwentny spadek strategicznych rezerw ETH należących do Ethereum Foundation. To sygnał, że organizacja może zmieniać sposób zarządzania aktywami i strategią skarbu. We wtorek dane on-chain wykazały, że fundacja sprzedała 2 400 ETH o wartości około 9,3 mln USD, co stanowiło około 0,18% całkowitej podaży altcoina. W ciągu ostatnich pięciu miesięcy sprzedano aż 45 000 ETH, czyli wartość około 175 mln USD. W maju tego roku rezerwa wynosiła 265 400 ETH, a dziś spadła do 220 350 ETH czyli likwidacja ponad 45 000 jednostek. W chwili pisania artykułu cena ETH oscylowała wokół 3 867 USD Pomimo negatywnego ruchu cenowego, inwestorzy wykazywali pozytywny sentyment wobec ETH – wolumen obrotu wzrósł w tym czasie o ponad 31%. Co to oznacza dla rynku i dla Twojego portfela? Gdy jeden z założycieli sieci decyduje się na tak dużą sprzedaż, pojawiają się dwie skrajne interpretacje: z jednej strony może to być rutynowe zarządzanie aktywami (np. sprzedaż części kapitału w celu dywersyfikacji) z drugiej – może to być sygnał, że w grze dzieją się zmiany, które inwestorzy powinni brać pod uwagę. Nie oznacza to automatycznie, że teoria długoterminowa dla Ethereum upada, jednak sygnał ostrzegawczy jest wyraźny. Choć Ethereum wciąż może być jednym z najlepszych krypto do inwestycji to obecna sytuacja pokazuje, że nawet największe projekty nie są odporne na nagłe zmiany sentymentu i aktywności dużych graczy. Jak w tym kontekście wypadają nowe kryptowaluty i gdzie warto szukać przewagi? W obliczu takiego wstrząsu na rynku ETH, uwagę wielu inwestorów przyciągają projekty z niższej kapitałizacji, często określane jako nowe kryptowaluty . Właśnie w tym segmencie może kryć się potencjał, jednak z równie wysokim poziomem ryzyka. Warto przyjrzeć się projektowi, który może stanowić taką właśnie alternatywę. Jednym z nich jest Snorter Token, stworzony z myślą o detalicznych traderach i memecoinach. Snorter Token: trading bez wychodzenia z czatu Snorter Token oraz aplikacja Snorter Bot tworzą środowisko tradingowe osadzone w komunikatorze Telegram. Założenie jest proste. Projekt ma umożliwić użytkownikom szybkie, tanie i intuicyjne poruszanie się w świecie memecoinów bez konieczności korzystania z przełączania między aplikacjami czy przeglądarkami. Dla tych, którzy poszukują ścieżki poza głównym nurtem ETH, Snorter może stanowić ciekawy komponent portfela. Co oferuje Snorter Token? Integracja z Telegramem – bot działa w czacie, bez potrzeby instalowania dodatkowych aplikacji; łączysz się szybko i wygodnie. Ekspresowe płatności i sniping – bot realizuje transakcje w czasie poniżej jednej sekundy, korzystając ze swojej infrastruktury odpornej na MEV i oszustwa typu honeypot. Najniższe prowizje na rynku – dla posiadaczy tokena SNORT opłata wynosi tylko 0,85%, standardowo 1,5%. Zaawansowane funkcje – kopiowanie ruchów topowych portfeli, dynamiczne zlecenia stop-loss, limitowane zlecenia, a także możliwość podglądu pozycji i zysków za pomocą komendy /portfolio. Obsługa wielu blockchainów – start na Solanie, a w planach Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon i Base. Systemy bezpieczeństwa – bot automatycznie wykrywa honeypoty i rugpulle z ponad 85% skutecznością. Token SNORT – wielołańcuchowy token użytkowy (SPL na Solanie i ERC-20 na Ethereum) z ograniczoną podażą (500 mln tokenów), odblokowujący funkcje premium, staking i przyszłe głosowania DAO. Dlaczego warto go rozważyć? W momencie gdy rynek ETH się chwiejny, projekty takie jak Snorter mogą oferować alternatywę, szczególnie jeśli uważasz, że ETH może być dziś obarczony większym ryzykiem niż zwykle. Trzeba brać jednak pod uwagę, że token SNORT nie jest instrumentem inwestycyjnym ani udziałem w spółce. To narzędzie stworzone dla traderów, którzy chcą wykorzystać przewagę technologiczną w świecie memecoinów.",Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|MATIC|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-22 17:48:22

Two tranches of 4,999 BTC worth $539.8 million each were sent to two different addresses. These were followed by 3,424 BTC, worth $369.7 million, and 2,535 BTC, worth $274.4 million, to two other different wallets. Bitcoin movements connect Chen Zhi to LuBian’s hack According to Arkhama intelligence, the Bitcoin wallet, which had been dormant for more than three years, was awakened last week. As per on-chain data, it transferred nearly $1.3 billion worth of BTC. Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence, two blockchain analytics companies, followed the transfer of 9,757 BTC, or about $1.1 billion, to many new addresses. The entire amount reached 11,886 BTC, which is currently valued at over $1.3 billion, after an extra 2,129 BTC, worth about $238 million, was deposited a few hours later. This happened just 24 hours after the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced one of the largest crypto forfeiture cases in history, to which the firm was allegedly linked. This sparked curiosity about whether the move was a precautionary reaction to the DOJ’s crackdown or a long-planned reallocation. The DOJ’s complaint seeks to forfeit around $14.4 billion in Bitcoin, allegedly tied to schemes run by the group’s founder, Chen Zhi. As reported by Cryptopolitan. Court filings revealed that Zhi and his associates laundered illegal proceeds through large-scale mining operations, including Warp Data in Laos, its Texas-based subsidiary, and LuBian in China, which ranked as the sixth-largest Bitcoin mining pool in 2020. Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence had already stated that LuBian had been hacked for 127,426 BTC in 2020, which was valued at roughly $3.5 billion at the time. Arkham’s report from September said that 11,886 BTC had been shifted to recovery wallets. This is the same amount that became active last week. Standard Chartered expects Bitcoin to slide below $100k With hackers and the government potentially looking to sell, it is uncertain what the aftermath will look like for BTC. Following Monday’s 3.5% pump, Bitcoin is now facing technical pressure, having fallen from $114,000 to the $107,000-$108,000 support zone. As a result of the reversal, investors are waiting for direction clues in the US Consumer Price Index data due out on October 24. The consensus is that inflation will climb by 3.1%, but investors are worried that another upside surprise could shake up risk markets after six months of rising inflation readings. The Bitcoin chart reveals that the asset is testing support around $112,000. If support holds, the predicted path suggests that it might bounce back to $117,000. Meanwhile, the kingcoin is trading at $108.390. It has seen a 4% decline in the last 24 hours. According to Standard Chartered, Bitcoin’s slide below $100,000 “seems inevitable” by this weekend. Geoffrey Kendrick stated that the decline could be short-lived and present a buying opportunity.

The milestone marks Tether’s and USDT’s growing influence in the digital finance space. Tether has attributed USDT’s growth to strong global demand and increased adoption in emerging markets, primarily for remittances and everyday financial transactions. USDT Hits 500 Million Users Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed that USDT now serves 500 million users worldwide. Ardoino attributed this growth to global demand and widespread adoption in emerging economies. Tether has been making efforts to expand its presence in emerging markets where USDT is used in remittances and payments. It has also expanded its efforts to promote grassroots adoption of USDT, engaging with communities to integrate the stablecoin into everyday life. Such efforts significantly boosted USDT circulation, cementing its importance in underdeveloped and underserved regions of the world. Ardoino believes direct engagement with local communities has helped ensure USDT adoption beyond centralized exchanges and apps. USDT’s presence has grown in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Its use in retail payments and peer-to-peer transfers has also maintained steady growth. A New Dollar-Backed Stablecoin Tether is also planning to launch a new dollar-backed stablecoin for the US market. Bo Hines, CEO of Tether’s US arm, confirmed the company will not be raising any external funds for the project. Hines stated that the company will issue new equity instead, and existing investors will retain their shares. Tether is also planning to raise $20 billion at a $500 billion valuation, representing 3% of the company. The raise would make Tether one of the world’s most valuable firms alongside SpaceX and OpenAI. Tether has reported a record Q2 profit of $4.9 billion, significantly higher than its previous record of $4.54 billion. The company is also one of the largest holders of US government debt. Meanwhile, on-chain data reveals the USDT supply at around $182 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at $75 billion. Ardoino stated, “Programmable money is the ultimate social network. A peer-to-peer construct that transports both information and value.” GENIUS Act Expands USDT Presence Tether’s latest milestone comes following decisive steps by the US government to establish stablecoin regulation through the GENIUS Act. Ardoino was one of the crypto executives present when President Donald Trump signed the stablecoin legislation, creating a federal regulatory framework for fiat-pegged tokens. The GENIUS Act requires stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or similarly liquid assets. It also mandates an annual audit for stablecoin issuers with a market capitalization of over $50 billion. The new legislation has led several banks to contemplate launching their own stablecoin. Several financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, could launch their own stablecoin and threaten Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin market. However, while Ardoino conceded that new competitors may surpass Tether in the short term, it has better technology and a better understanding of the stablecoin market than its competitors. “Tether has better technology and understands the market deeply.” Regulatory Pressures As mentioned earlier, the GENIUS Act requires stablecoins with a market capitalization of over $50 billion to undergo regular audits. However, Tether still lacks a full audit from PwC or Deloitte. Ardoino has said that a full audit from one of the Big 4 remains a key priority. However, for now, Tether relies on quarterly attestations by BDO Italia. Tether also faces several challenges in Europe following the EU's passing of the MiCA regulations for digital assets. The new regulation instructed exchanges across Europe to stop offering stablecoins that do not comply with the new rules by April 2025. The new rules impacted USDT since it did not meet MiCA’s regulatory requirements. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This came as crypto pundit ProfRippl highlighted the link between both firms through the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Ripple Reportedly Working With Stellar In an X post , ProfRippl revealed that Ripple and Stellar are working together. This came as the crypto pundit highlighted the IRC’s links to both crypto firms, indicating that this was what led to the partnership between Ripple and Stellar. Notably, Ripple and IRC had partnered to explore using the crypto firm’s payment services for humanitarian donations. Meanwhile, Stellar had once mentioned how IRC distributed cash assistance to Ukraine through its ‘aid assist’. ProfRippl then raised the possibility of other IRC’s partners adopting Ripple and Stellar’s payment services for cross-border transactions. IRC has partnered with organizations such as the Bloomberg Foundation, Google, and the Citi Foundation, among others. Meanwhile, ProfRippl also tried to draw a connection between Ripple and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, who reportedly has close ties with IRC’s CEO David Miliband. Based on this, the crypto pundit suggested that Ripple’s technology could easily be adopted as countries move to integrate cryptocurrencies into their payment infrastructure. Meanwhile, in another X post , the crypto pundit highlighted how Ripple and Stellar complement each other rather than being direct competitors. ProfRippl noted that Ripple’s XRP Ledger ensures high-assurance cross-ledger settlement while Stellar enables multi-currency routing and inclusive tokenization. ProfRipple further referenced articles that described Ripple and Stellar as layered architectures that serve different but complementary functions. It is worth noting that Stellar’s Jed McCaleb was one of those who created the XRP Ledger alongside Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz and Arthur Britto. Like Ripple, Stellar also provides cross-border payment services using its native token XLM. Meanwhile, Ripple uses XRP to power its payment services, with the altcoin serving as a bridge currency between the sender and receiver. Fed’s Waller Provides Major Boost For Ripple In another recent development, Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller provided a major boost for Ripple, stating that the Fed staff were exploring a ‘payment account’ to support payments innovation. The payment account will give stablecoin issuers like Ripple access to the Fed’s payment rails, making their operations more efficient. Notably, Ripple has already filed for a Fed master account, though there is no timeline for approval. However, Waller revealed that the payment account will have a streamlined review timeline, meaning Ripple may not need to wait for approval of the Fed master account before accessing the Fed’s payment rails. This comes as the crypto firm continues to expand its services, including its relationship partnership with South Africa’s Absa to provide digital asset custody services.",XRP|Altcoin|Arthur Britto|Chris Waller|David Miliband|David Schwartz|Fed|Federal Reserve|International Rescue Committee|IRC|ProfRippl|ripple|stellar|Tony Blair|XLM|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|XLM|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-22 18:00:59

In total, the firm holds 4.5% of the company shares, with another 4.5% of the stake owned directly by CEO Ken Griffin. Citadel is among the top holders of DeFi Dev Corp. The fund, through its CEO Ken Griffin, holds 4.5% of the outstanding DFDV shares. Additional ownership includes several Citadel subsidiaries. The ownership shows a DAT company is among the selections of one of the world’s leading hedge funds. Citadel Advisors LLC, Citadel Advisors Holdings LP, and Citadel GP LLC hold 2.7% of shares outstanding. Citadel Securities LLC holds another 1.4%, Citadel Securities Group LP, and Citadel Securities GP LLC together own 1.8% of the shares outstanding. The shares were announced in a recent report, showing additional exposure to crypto through the treasury company. The participation of Citadel shows support for DAT companies, even at a relatively late stage of the market. Griffin and Citadel may also be eligible for the upcoming round of warrants with a $22.50 exercise price. DeFi Dev Corp. expands SOL per share DeFi Dev Corp. expanded its SOL per share by 375% since the start of its buying. As of October 22, DFDV holds 0.076 SOL per share, in the middle of the range for DAT companies. The leader is still Forward Industries with 3.9 SOL per share. Currently, DeFi Dev Corp holds nearly 2.2M SOL, locked as a validator stake. Currently, DFDV shares trade at $14.14, trading in the middle of the range for the past year. DFDV maxed out at $34.25 during the peak of DAT companies. The mNAV metric for DeFi Dev Corp. is exactly 1.0, bringing the value of owned SOL on par with the stock’s market capitalization. For most DAT companies, mNAV metrics have fallen significantly, as the markets lost enthusiasm for the overpriced shares. SOL also took a step back to $183.71, despite the robust on-chain activity. SOL has lost some of its momentum as new ETF approvals were delayed by the US government shutdown. Solana treasuries expand above 20M SOL Solana treasuries already hold 20.31M SOL. Despite the slower acquisitions, treasuries are boosting Solana’s ecosystem. Reserves rose by over 12% since October 15, as some treasury companies bought the dip. SOL acquisitions are not as methodical as those of BTC, but offer additional advantages for activities within the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Around 9M of that SOL is staked in various forms, creating more validators. The DAT companies have achieved an average passive yield of 7.7% from their staking activities.

Transfers that should settle in seconds often take days. Costs accumulate through intermediaries, transparency is limited, and compliance procedures add further friction. Against this backdrop, growing attention is turning toward Ripple , a company whose technology may represent the bridge between legacy banking systems and the next era of global payments. A recent document shared by researcher SMQKE makes a bold case: Ripple provides the very solution that the U.S. Federal Reserve has long sought. The Broken Architecture of International Payments Today’s cross-border payment infrastructure is built on a web of correspondent banking relationships that are both costly and inefficient. Every international transaction typically passes through multiple financial institutions, each taking fees and adding delays. According to global financial studies, these outdated systems cost banks billions annually in reconciliation, liquidity management, and compliance overhead. Central banks and regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve, have acknowledged these inefficiencies for years. Their shared challenge has been to find a system that enables speed, security, transparency, and interoperability, all while remaining compliant with regulatory frameworks. RIPPLE PROVIDES THE SOLUTION THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE NEEDS This is documented. https://t.co/fiz3ocUEAS pic.twitter.com/hvdYs1FuPj — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 21, 2025 Ripple’s Distinctive Approach Ripple’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) offers a strikingly different model. Rather than replacing the existing financial infrastructure, Ripple integrates with it, providing a liquidity and settlement layer that dramatically improves efficiency. The system uses its native digital asset, XRP, to facilitate instant currency conversion and settlement across borders, eliminating the need for pre-funded nostro accounts. The document highlighted by SMQKE notes that Ripple’s architecture could save banks up to $20 billion per year in infrastructure costs tied to cross-border payments, securities trading, and compliance. These savings stem from reduced operational redundancy and faster settlement cycles. Importantly, Ripple does not define the legal relationships between users; instead, it functions as a neutral rail, governing how transactions are executed securely and transparently. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Considerations and the Federal Reserve’s Position The Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators have been actively exploring digital settlement systems that could complement domestic payment networks like FedNow. Ripple’s model fits well within this vision, a decentralized, yet auditable network that provides speed and traceability without compromising oversight. Ripple’s pursuit of deeper regulatory integration, including its efforts to establish a U.S. national bank charter and access a Federal Reserve master account, reinforces the notion that it seeks to operate alongside, not outside, the traditional banking ecosystem. This hybrid stance gives Ripple an edge over purely decentralized cryptocurrencies, positioning it as a compliant innovation partner rather than a disruptor. Why Ripple Aligns with the Fed’s Future If the Federal Reserve’s goal is to modernize the global payments landscape while maintaining control and compliance, Ripple’s technology represents a ready-made blueprint. Its ability to connect banks, fintechs, and central institutions through a unified protocol creates the transparency and efficiency that regulators have demanded for years. As SMQKE’s sourced document emphasizes, Ripple’s system does not replace banks; it enhances their operations by serving as the infrastructure on which payments move securely and in real time. In an era where digital transformation defines competitiveness, Ripple appears to offer the very rails upon which the Federal Reserve’s vision of faster, cheaper, and safer international payments can finally run. In essence, Ripple has engineered what the Federal Reserve has been seeking all along: a bridge between regulation and innovation, legacy finance and blockchain, and, ultimately, between borders and the instant future of money.

53507244,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/10101art-when-luxury-meets-legacy-how-web3-brings-masterpieces-back-to-the-people,1761156570,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53507244.jpeg,10101.art: When Luxury Meets Legacy — How Web3 Brings Masterpieces Back to the People,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/10101art-when-luxury-meets-legacy-how-web3-brings-masterpieces-back-to-the-people,"Between Rolex, Cartier, and Tiffany & Co., a new name now stands among the icons of luxury — 10101.art . In the heart of Dubai Mall, the world’s most visited retail destination, a collection of unseen masterpieces by Picasso, Dalí, Warhol, Banksy, and Gus Van Sant is unveiled to the public for the first time. For one month only, from October 1–31, 2025, visitors can experience these rare works in Dubai Mall’s Grand Atrium — an exhibition that not only celebrates great art, but also redefines what it means to own it. A Cultural Milestone in the Language of Luxury Once hidden behind closed doors of private collections, these seven blue-chip artworks now step into the public eye, reclaiming their original purpose: to inspire, provoke, and connect. For Dubai — a city synonymous with innovation, opulence, and cultural ambition — this is more than an exhibition. It’s a statement. The setting is deliberate. Surrounded by the world’s most recognizable symbols of prestige, 10101.art places fine art within the same realm as high jewelry — but with a twist. Here, luxury is not only about ownership; it’s about access, participation, and meaning. The Future of Collecting At the heart of this transformation lies fractional ownership, powered by blockchain technology. Through 10101.art, collectors can co-own iconic artworks in a transparent, secure, and legally recognized way — participating not just as buyers, but as cultural stewards. This is the new face of luxury: owning not just an object, but a piece of history; not merely displaying wealth, but sharing cultural capital. It’s art collecting democratized — without losing its aura of exclusivity. “We’re witnessing the birth of a new kind of collector,” says the curatorial team behind 10101.art. “People who value heritage and impact as much as aesthetics and prestige.” Luxury, Elevated by Meaning In Dubai — the crossroads of innovation, art, and ambition — 10101.art stands as a bridge between eras. It reimagines what “luxury” means in the 21st century: not just something you own, but something you belong to. Owning a piece of Picasso or Warhol through 10101.art is more than a status symbol. It’s a declaration of values — of curiosity, taste, and participation in the ongoing story of art. This is where blockchain becomes beautiful: a technology that curates, preserves, and shares culture. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $114,082 on Tuesday before settling at $108,362. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin whale, known as the “Trump insider,” has doubled down on their short position, raising it to 2,100 BTC , worth $227 million. Bitcoin Chart Echoing 1970 Soybean Bubble: Peter Brandt Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes Bitcoin’s price chart is showing similarities to the soybean market from the 1970s. The soybean market saw prices top before dropping 50% as supply began to outweigh demand. However, Bitcoin analysts are confident of further upside. Brandt stated during an interview, “Bitcoin is forming a rare broadening top on the charts. This pattern is famous for tops. In the 1970s, Soybeans formed such a top, then declined 50% in value.” Brandt warned that if Bitcoin follows a similar pattern, it could leave several companies, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy, underwater. Strategy’s stock is down over 10% over the past 30 days as corporate Bitcoin treasuries face growing pressure thanks to a drop in net asset values. Brandt also warned that the big Bitcoin rally that traders are waiting for may never come. Instead, the trader warned of a drop that could take prices as low as $60,000. However, most analysts agree that Bitcoin has one major rally left in this bear cycle, which could take it to $250,000. Sentiment At Extreme Fear “Uptober” has failed to improve market sentiment. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index posted a score of 25, putting it firmly in “extreme fear” territory. Bitcoin trading account AlphaBTC stated in a post on X, “Bitcoin really needs to hold here, keeping the recent higher lows in tack and have another attempt at the monthly open where it was rejected yesterday.” However, not all analysts are bearish. David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, believes Bitcoin’s “opportunity window” may open up again if the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data shows signs of relief. Analysts predict a 3.1% year-over-year increase for September. Markets are already expecting a 25 bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve following the FOMC meeting next week. Rate cuts are typically beneficial for assets like BTC . Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded fresh inflows on Tuesday as BTC briefly crossed $114,000. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $477 million in net inflows on October 21, breaking a four-day outflow streak that registered over $1 billion in outflows. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock’s IBIT registered the most inflows with $210 million, followed by ARK 21Shares ARKB with $162.85 million. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also registered healthy inflows, bringing in a combined $104.33 million. Despite over $1 billion in outflows last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered over $4.21 billion in net inflows so far in October, surpassing September’s $3.53 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) reached an intraday high of $114,082 on Tuesday as market sentiment picked up. However, President Trump’s comments derailed investor optimism. As a result, the price fell 1.99% and settled at $108,362. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $108,120. Bitcoin’s decline comes as the notorious Bitcoin whale accused of price manipulation doubled down on their short position. The whale pocketed over $200 million after shorting Bitcoin during the market crash on October 10. The “Trump insider” whale and the “10B Hyperunit Whale” have made several bearish bets. The “Trump insider” whale’s $234 million short position on Hyperliquid is already sitting on $6.7 million in unrealized profits. One analyst called the whale’s actions “pure manipulation” and suggested the trader may intentionally dump their Bitcoin holdings to make prices drop towards the short position targets. Investors are also waiting for the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Friday. Analysts predict a 3.1% year-over-year increase for September. Markets are already expecting a 25 bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve following the FOMC meeting next week. Rate cuts are typically beneficial for assets like BTC . BTC stopped short of “filling” the latest gap in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market. These gaps result from futures closing at one price point and opening at another, and are generally created over the weekend. The markets tend to “fill” these gaps by returning to the space between the open and closing levels. Trader Daan Crypto Trades stated in a post on X, “ BTC opened with a small CME gap below this week. Price did come down to close some of it, but there’s still a bit left. So good to keep that in mind if the price were to trade close to it. Besides that, we did close the big gap at $110K last week. This was a gap that was left behind at the end of September before BTC rallied to new all-time highs.” BTC and the broader crypto market crashed last Friday (October 10), after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposing restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday as BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945. It recovered from this level to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,068, ultimately dropping 1.91%. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 2% to $110,804. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. The price plunged to $103,516 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $106,463, ultimately dropping 1.60%. BTC rose on Saturday, rising 0.70% to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,208. Buyers retained control on Sunday as the price rose over 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,676. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC’s recovery continued. As a result, the price rose nearly 2% to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,568. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,082 on Tuesday. However, market sentiment soured and buyers lost momentum. As a result, the price fell 1.99% to $108,362. BTC is down 0.50% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,912. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The sale will begin at an initial valuation of $1 million (FDV) and will be capped at $999 million. 5% of the total MEGA offering will be offered through an English-style auction. MegaETH has raised $30 million in funding to date from investors including prominent figures such as Dragonfly and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Related News: Solana (SOL) Makes Unexpected Early Announcement - May Upset Users The project team stated that the sale will be held with the motto “Built for you, priced by you.” Last year, in the first sale, organized in partnership with Cobie's platform Echo, more than 3,000 investors participated in the project under the same conditions. In the new round, users will be able to pledge a maximum of $186,282. If the sale is oversubscribed, priority will be given to existing MegaETH community members and participants who have demonstrated long-term commitment (through social activity, on-chain behavior, and lock-in preferences). The company aims to ensure broad token distribution through this allocation process while prioritizing backers who make significant contributions. MegaETH plans to offer an initial allocation of $2,650 per person to at least 5,000 participants in this sale. *This is not investment advice.

One such moment arrived when Time Traveler shared a thought-provoking clip on X, depicting what appears to be a man overwhelmed with excitement after converting 3 XRP tokens into 300,000 RLUSD. While the video is not a record of an actual event, it has become a symbolic representation of what many XRP believers see as an inevitable future — a time when the token’s value skyrockets to unprecedented heights of $100,000 per token. The Viral Clip That Sparked Debate In the short video shared by Time Traveler , a man can be seen struggling to contain his joy after executing an exchange between XRP and RLUSD. His voice, barely steady with emotion, reflects sheer disbelief at what he claims to have witnessed, the conversion of just three XRP tokens into an immense 300,000 RLUSD. The post quickly went viral, not because it documented a confirmed transaction, but because of what it represented: a bold vision of XRP’s future revaluation. The emotional tone of the clip resonated deeply with long-term XRP supporters who have maintained faith in the digital asset’s long-term potential despite years of price stagnation and skepticism from mainstream financial analysts. That first conversion of 3 XRP Tokens into $300,000 RLUSD. We can't even believe its real, but it is. And we have to keep our voice down to not alert anyone to this. Do you realize how hard it is to hold back excitement on this level? pic.twitter.com/0E7J5VghPh — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) October 21, 2025 The Idea Behind the Vision Time Traveler’s post builds on a growing narrative within the XRP community — that Ripple’s digital asset will one day play a central role in global liquidity systems. The futuristic scenario in the clip reflects this conviction: a world where XRP serves as the backbone of international settlements, moving trillions of dollars through tokenized liquidity corridors at lightning speed. While speculative, this belief draws strength from Ripple’s continuous push for real-world adoption, including partnerships with financial institutions and the rollout of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin launched in December 2024. RLUSD is built for institutional-grade payments and on-chain liquidity, operating across both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum network to enable cross-chain financial interoperability. The symbolic conversion in Time Traveler’s clip, therefore, represents more than a hypothetical price prediction; it embodies the vision of an integrated digital economy where XRP becomes a key settlement asset alongside stablecoins like RLUSD. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Reaction Across the XRP Community The reaction to Time Traveler’s post has been a mix of intrigue, excitement, and cautious analysis. For many XRP holders, the clip is a rallying point, a reminder of why they continue to “hodl” despite years of volatility. However, industry observers and analysts have been quick to contextualize the video as illustrative rather than factual. The video serves as a visual metaphor for XRP’s long-term potential, inviting discussion rather than documentation. The clip also reignited conversations around the speculative mechanics of value revaluation — a concept tied to theories that XRP could undergo a drastic upward price adjustment once global liquidity corridors are fully operational. A Symbol of Hope and Conviction Time Traveler’s viral post has succeeded in doing what numbers alone cannot, inspiring renewed belief in XRP’s future. It is less about arithmetic and more about aspiration. By framing the hypothetical conversion of 3 XRP into 300,000 RLUSD, the post projects an image of what XRP enthusiasts have long envisioned: a moment when the token finally achieves its full potential in a tokenized global economy. A Vision of What Could Be The clip shared by Time Traveler is not evidence of a transaction but an illustrative expression of belief, a futuristic depiction of XRP’s possible destiny in a redefined financial landscape. It has reignited conversation across the crypto world, not because of proof, but because of possibility. Whether that vision ever materializes remains uncertain, but its impact is undeniable. Time Traveler’s post serves as a reminder that in crypto, as in innovation itself, progress often begins not with confirmation, but with imagination.

In the past 30 days alone, Real-World Asset (RWA) transfers have jumped 84% , while stablecoin transactions have climbed 83%, signaling renewed institutional interest in the network. Notably, the surge follows GTreasury and Evernorth’s $1B XRP treasury announcements, signaling rising confidence in XRP as a liquidity and settlement solution. These moves highlight its growing role beyond speculation, bridging traditional finance and blockchain innovation. X Finance Bull highlights that the surge in RWA and stablecoin transfers signals growing market adoption of the XRP Ledger. Tokenized Real-World Assets enable faster, more transparent settlements, while stablecoins drive digital liquidity for seamless cross-border transactions. Their simultaneous growth underscores rising interest from enterprises and financial institutions in leveraging XRP Ledger for operational efficiency. X Finance Bull added that institutional participation signals network strength and long-term value. With GTreasury and Evernorth anchoring their treasuries in XRP, the network’s corporate finance utility is validated, potentially driving wider adoption as other corporates, fintechs, and financial institutions take notice. Therefore, the surge in XRP transaction volume strengthens liquidity and market dynamics, attracting more validators and participants to enhance network security. It also showcases XRP’s ability to handle large-scale transfers efficiently, proving its value as a reliable solution for enterprise blockchain applications. Why is this development worth a keen eye? Well, XRP Ledger’s surge in stablecoin and real-world asset transfers, combined with major treasury commitments, marks a turning point, positioning XRP as a practical, enterprise-ready infrastructure beyond speculation. Conclusion The XRP Ledger’s record transfer surge, driven by GTreasury and Evernorth’s $1B treasury moves, highlights its rising role in institutional finance. With RWAs and stablecoins booming, XRP is proving itself not just as a digital asset, but as scalable, secure infrastructure for modern financial operations, paving the way for a convergence of traditional and digital finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,WALLET|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-22 19:10:57

According to sources who attended the meeting, the meeting began with approximately 30 minutes of introductory speeches from industry leaders, who presented their expectations for the bill. However, tensions rose as the meeting progressed. Senators sternly warned crypto representatives not to act as “an extension” of the Republican Party. Democrats said that “trust has been damaged” by the leak of the DeFi regulation draft in recent weeks, and that aggressive public statements would “set back” the legislative process.

Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego reportedly told crypto executives, “I'm really angry about what happened last week. Don't be an arm of the Republican Party. They used you and your megaphones to hurt us.” Democratic senators rejected claims that negotiations were slow and expressed their determination to finalize a bill. Republican senators also reportedly had some reservations about the current bill.

The company confirmed that while Nexperia doesn’t sell directly to them, some car parts from their suppliers include Nexperia chips. That means Volkswagen’s entire production chain is now exposed to fallout from this dispute, even if indirectly. In a statement to CNBC, a Volkswagen spokesperson allegedly said, “We are in close contact with all relevant stakeholders in light of the current situation to identify potential risks at an early stage and to be able to make decisions regarding any necessary measures.” For now, no shutdowns have occurred, but the company admitted that “short-term effects on production cannot be ruled out.” This warning came hours before Volkswagen’s stock dropped 2.2% by 2 p.m. in London (9 a.m. ET), making investors sweat. At press time, it has slumped by exactly 2.8%, per data from TradingView. Beijing blocks exports after the Dutch seize Nexperia As Cryptopolitan previously reported , this whole mess started last month when the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chip manufacturer based in the Netherlands. The company makes a huge number of automotive and consumer electronics chips, and its tech is used widely across Europe’s industrial sectors. The seizure was justified by Dutch officials who claimed that Nexperia’s technology might be needed in a national emergency and couldn’t be allowed to fall into the wrong hands. China fired back quickly, banning the export of Nexperia’s finished goods. That move sent shockwaves through Europe’s car industry, especially in Germany, where firms like Volkswagen rely on tight, uninterrupted chip flows. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) released a sharp warning, saying the China–Netherlands clash over Nexperia could trigger “significant production restrictions in the near future” unless the chip supply is restored soon. The ripple effects of this semiconductor drama have now landed squarely in Germany’s political backyard. A spokesperson for Germany’s Economy Ministry told Reuters that the government is “concerned about chip supply chain difficulties.” And considering how thin supply chains already are, any further disruptions could tip the industry into chaos. So far, Volkswagen has not shut any plants, but they’ve made it clear they’re watching the situation closely. If the export freeze drags on, things could get worse fast. The auto sector’s overdependence on a few critical suppliers is now on full display, and Volkswagen is already preparing for impact. Get seen where it counts.

Joshua Paul Armbrust, 45, was sentenced Tuesday to three years’ probation by US District Judge Jerry Blackwell, following his April guilty plea to a felony computer fraud charge. Armbrust’s Covert Mining Scheme Exposed According to court filings, Armbrust continued exploiting Digital River’s resources for over a year after leaving the Minnetonka-based e-commerce and payment processing firm in February 2020. He mined Ethereum using the company Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials, which fetched him an earnings of $5,895 while incurring $45,270 in costs to Digital River. The activity was uncovered during an internal investigation by Digital River, which shut down operations in January. Reviewers noticed unusual AWS fees and traced the activity to Armbrust’s IP address. This revealed that he had consistently run mining scripts on company servers between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m., long after his departure. Assistant US Attorney Jordan Endicott said that it was “not a momentary lapse in judgment” but a “calculated and covert misuse of enterprise-level computing resources for private enrichment.” “The defendant’s conduct strikes at the core of digital trust and security in the modern economy. Companies rely on former employees to act ethically, even after separation, and to respect corporate systems and data. Unauthorized access to corporate cloud infrastructure not only creates financial harm, as in this case, but also exposes sensitive systems to potential compromise and opens the door to more severe cyber threats.” Desperate or Calculated? Defense attorney William Mauzy described Armbrust’s conduct as driven by desperation rather than greed. Mauzy said Armbrust faced severe financial pressure while caring for his terminally ill mother, who has since passed. He added that Armbrust did not attempt to damage systems, hide his actions, and accepted responsibility for losses. At the time of his indictment in November 2024, Armbrust was living in Orr, Minnesota. He has since moved to St. Paul, where he now works in the insurance sector. Both the prosecution and defense recommended a probation sentence under the plea deal, citing his clean record and cooperation with authorities. Judge Blackwell remarked that Armbrust’s technical talents could have been applied lawfully, pointing to the wasted potential. The outcome underscores the need for companies to secure access to computing resources and prevent long-term misuse by former employees. Cryptojacking, also called malicious cryptomining, still remains a critical threat vector. It’s a cyber threat where hackers secretly use a computer or mobile device to mine cryptocurrency. Before its shutdown in March 2019, Coinhive was a widely used cryptojacking tool and was estimated to be involved in more than two-thirds of all such attacks.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $1,466.81 by the end of 2028. By 2031, Monero’s price may surge to $3,363.29.

This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security.

After oscillating between the $320 and $340 level the price crashed to the $266.35 level before climbing back above the $320 level. However, the bulls could not maintain the level and the price fell to $300 where it trades at press time. XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView The indicators reflect the mixed price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show falling selling pressure as trading volume declines.

The recent drop to the $265 level was followed by swift recovery back to the $330 level but the bulls were rejected at the level falling back to $300.

XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView Monero price analysis shows that XMR experienced strong as the price rapidly rose to the $340 mark. However, the price faced strong bearish pressure at the level causing a decline to the $265 level. The recent recovery to $320 XMR was followed by sharp decline to $300 where price is expected to consolidate. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to consolidate at the current level as the trend corrects. The price should be expected to trade below the $320 mark but is not expected to fall below $300. On the other hand, a bearish breakout would mean a drop below the $285 level back to the $265 mark. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a swift recovery from $266 lows to the $330 price level before falling back to $300 where it trades at press time. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-22 19:23:22

53509682,611479,1761161437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53509682.jpeg,Cardano Institutional Wave: Big Money Pours Into ADA Amid Surging Blockchain Adoption,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-institutional-wave/,"Despite the ongoing wave of bearish price action for Cardano (ADA), the token appears to be attracting a notable amount of adoption and attention. Large capital is currently being moved in the leading network and altcoin, particularly from institutional players. Are Institutions Betting Big On Cardano? Lately, Cardano is experiencing a fresh influx of capital as the market continues to fluctuate. These massive capital inflows, which are coming from institutional investors, mark one of the most crucial turning points in its market dynamics and trajectory. Specifically, the growing institutional activity is confirmed in the average transaction size being executed on the blockchain. Mintern, the Chief Meme Officer (CMO) of Minswap and market expert, highlighted that the network’s average transaction amount has increased to over $100,000 in the past 30 days. According to the meme officer, the large transaction size points to aggressive accumulation from institutional investors or whales. As big investors move more money to ADA, the blockchain ‘s reputation as a safe, scalable, and regulatory-friendly network is being further validated. What this development implies is that confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential is growing. Meanwhile, such a surge in institutional participation underscores the network’s position as a leading contender in the broader and ever-evolving blockchain landscape. Historically, whales’ movements have played a crucial role in price upswings, raising questions about whether smart money investors are positioning ahead of a breakout . ADA has displayed notable bullish performance this cycle when compared to other major crypto assets. In another X post, Mintern has shared a chart showing that ADA is now more bullish than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Cardano is one of the top-ranked assets in the CoinDesk 20 Index, surpassing the three crypto giants following its 6.8% price increase in the last 3 days. Should the altcoin maintain its current momentum, it is likely to trigger its next breakout moment to previous highs. Lark Davis foresees a potential 60% surge, as ADA is about to print a daily MACD golden cross below zero. His prediction hinges on a past scenario when this signal spurred a 60% upward increase. While it gears up for the spike, Davis noted that ADA must break past a resistance zone around $0.74 to $0.77. Furthermore, the altcoin must break above a downward resistance line that began in August. The Blockchain Dominates In Terms Of Community Support Cardano’s position as the leading blockchain in the crypto sector is also reflected by its strong user base and community support. After its research, TapTools disclosed that the network has moved to the second spot in community support globally, a clear sign of its fast-growing active user base . Currently, the network is ahead of Bitcoin in this metric. Fueled by developers, stakers, and enthusiasts who are committed to driving innovation within the ecosystem, Cardano’s bullish votes are positioned at 88%. With this high positive support, the blockchain is backed by one of the strongest and most confident communities in the landscape.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|bitcoin|Cardano news|Cardano Price|CoinDesk 20 Index|Ethereum|Lark Davis|MACD Golden Cross|Minswap|Mintern|solana,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-22 19:30:37

According to the company's statement, the majority of the $5 million investment will be used to purchase XRP from the open market. Evernorth is a startup aiming to drive enterprise-wide XRP adoption. The company plans to merge with a SPAC called Armada Acquisition Corp. II, trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “XRPN,” and raise more than $1 billion in total funding. GUMI's investment announcement stated that the funds raised will be used to create one of the world's largest public XRP treasuries. This treasury will not only hold XRP but also aim to increase asset value through institutional lending and DeFi (decentralized finance) activities. It also claimed that all financial reports will be reviewed by an independent auditing firm, ensuring high transparency and governance standards. Related News: BREAKING: A Rumor Circulating That Could Have a Significant Impact on the US Trade War Against China GUMI made the following statement: “XRP is one of the few digital assets whose regulatory framework is beginning to be clarified in the US and whose usability in global payments has been proven. Investing in Evernorth offers a simple, high-liquidity investment opportunity in XRP within the framework of a regulated and audited public company.” Furthermore, Evernorth’s activities will not be limited to market transactions only; it will also act as a validator to contribute to the growth of the XRP Ledger ecosystem.” *This is not investment advice.

It all started in January, when SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son stood beside Sam and President Donald Trump to announce what is billed as the biggest AI infrastructure project in history. And thousands of miles away, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang was wrapping up Lunar New Year celebrations in Asia, furious that the man whose company had fueled OpenAI’s rise was now watching someone else share the stage with its CEO. Now for nearly a decade, Jensen supplied OpenAI with the chips that made ChatGPT possible. But this time, he wanted to be more than a supplier. Silicon Valley’s golden boy wanted a seat at the table. It was time. And so within weeks, Nvidia privately proposed its own plan to Sam: cut SoftBank out, raise capital together, and build the largest computing network ever attempted. The result was a $100 billion agreement, finalized at Nvidia’s Santa Clara headquarters. “This is the largest computing project in history,” Jensen reportedly said at the announcement. But oh, Sam’s public appearance had since triggered full-blown FOMO among Silicon Valley’s elite. Sam fuels the trillion-dollar AI race Right after managing to kick Elon Musk out of OpenAI, Sam began brokering deals faster than anyone could track, pitting tech giants against one another as they scrambled for relevance in the AI ecosystem. That scramble linked America’s biggest chipmakers and cloud providers directly to a company that still isn’t profitable. Yet Wall Street didn’t care. Over four separate trading days in two months, shares of Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom surged by a combined $630 billion, each spike fueled by new OpenAI partnerships that lifted the entire U.S. stock market to record highs. In a 2019 blog post titled “How To Be Successful,” Sam wrote, “The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.” That belief is now underwriting his empire. Since ChatGPT’s viral launch, he’s promised that AI will cure cancer, teach every student on earth, and mint infinite profits. Internally, he told employees that OpenAI plans to reach 250 gigawatts of compute by 2033, a buildout worth $10 trillion, enough to power Germany. OpenAI expects $13 billion in revenue this year but has already committed to $650 billion in computing bills across its deals with Nvidia and Oracle alone. When factoring AMD, Broadcom, and Microsoft, the total is nearly $1 trillion. Critics say the commitments look like a bubble. Sam dismisses that. He says shortages in computing power are delaying product rollouts, but insists revenue will scale with access. OpenAI’s new video app, Sora, topping the App Store this month, is his proof. At a February event in Tokyo with Son, Sam allegedly said, “You just have to trust the exponential.” How Sam turned rivals into partners The 40‑year‑old CEO has always chased risk. He dropped out of Stanford, used poker winnings to pay tuition, and poured millions into crypto and nuclear fusion. His biggest gamble, Project Stargate, began in 2024 when he asked Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to invest $100 billion into new data centers for OpenAI. Nadella refused. So did TSMC’s C.C. Wei, calling him “too aggressive for me to believe.” That’s when Son stepped in. Over breakfast at Son’s Versailles‑style estate near Tokyo, Sam pitched a joint venture that would see SoftBank finance a nationwide network of data centers for OpenAI.Son agreed, announcing the $500 billion Stargate project alongside Sam and Trump in Washington. SoftBank’s shares jumped 11%, as did those of other tech firms tied to the venture. But the alliance later hit turbulence as the two sides argued over site locations. Only two sites have been announced so far, which is pretty tiny compared to OpenAI’s broader capacity deals. At Davos that same month, Nadella joked on TV about the Stargate hype: “Look, all I know is, I’m good for my $80 billion.” Days later, a TD Cowen report revealed Microsoft had canceled several U.S. data‑center leases related to OpenAI. The company then allowed Sam to source computing power from elsewhere. Oracle swooped in next with a $300 billion contract, sending its stock up 40% and briefly making Larry Ellison the world’s richest man. A week later, Nadella retaliated, unveiling what he called “the world’s most powerful AI data center” in Wisconsin, partly for OpenAI training. By mid‑year, another rumor set off alarms via The Information, which reported that OpenAI had begun renting Google’s TPU chips. Jensen apparently called Sam directly. Nvidia soon signed a $350 billion leasing deal for 5 million GPUs and secured the right to invest another $100 billion to help finance it. Nvidia also agreed to guarantee some of OpenAI’s data‑center loans, a risk that could leave the company on the hook for billions if OpenAI defaults. The momentum carried to AMD, whose CEO, Lisa Su, invited Sam to her “Advancing AI” event in San Jose. “Can I call you an AI icon?” she asked. AMD offered OpenAI a massive deal: 6 gigawatts of compute in exchange for up to 10% of AMD’s future stock. Its shares surged by 24% after the announcement. Jensen mocked the decision on TV but quickly matched it. Soon after, Broadcom confirmed a new joint chip project with OpenAI, adding another 10 gigawatts of computing capacity to the tally.

Futures for the yellow metal dropped $43.70, or 1.06%, on Wednesday to close at $4,065.40 per ounce, after a brutal 5.74% plunge on Tuesday. The back-to-back declines have erased nearly 8% of gold’s value since Monday, when it briefly touched an all-time intraday high of $4,398 per ounce, according to UBS. Gold’s two-day selloff also hit miners. Shares of big players like Barrick were down more than 1%, extending losses as traders rushed to lock in profits after weeks of steady gains. The downturn makes this gold’s worst performance since 2013, breaking what had been the strongest rally of the decade. Traders cash out as volatility spikes UBS analysts led by Wayne Gordon told clients the drop wasn’t about fundamentals but pure market mechanics, as a natural round of selloff hit the precious metal. “If we look at adjustments to non-commercial positioning, we believe the decline was largely technical,” Wayne said. “With slowing price momentum and rising option volatility, more speculative investors decided to take profit.” Despite the retreat, gold’s long-term gains remain staggering. Prices are still up more than 50% in 2025 and nearly 5% for October alone. UBS believes the core forces behind the year’s rally remain intact; inflation, tariffs, political uncertainty in the U.S., and the ongoing debate over Federal Reserve independence under President Donald Trump. “We believe it is premature to turn negative on gold despite the pause in the rally,” Wayne added. Even after the pullback, gold’s performance this year has crushed nearly every other asset class. Futures have surged 54% year-to-date, far surpassing the S&P 500’s modest 14% advance. The metal even outpaced some of the biggest AI-related names like Nvidia and Meta Platforms, which had fueled Wall Street’s tech rally earlier in the year. But the sudden collapse has sparked talk that the so-called “debasement trade,” where investors ditch the dollar for hard assets, might be running out of energy. The U.S. dollar index has gained almost 2% over the past month, outperforming the S&P 500 and signaling that money could be flowing back into cash. In the last week alone, the dollar climbed 0.3%, while gold dropped 3%, tightening the pressure on traders who had been betting on further declines in the greenback. Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities, said the shift raises questions about whether this is the start of a bigger turn or just a quick technical correction. “It begs the question as to whether this is starting a new trend or just a quick corrective move,” Andrew wrote. “But Central Banks are pretty well stocked with gold.” Adding to the unease, Goldman Sachs traders noted that spot gold’s realized volatility relative to the S&P 500 hit its highest level since 2020, suggesting that price swings could become even wilder in the coming weeks. “Still, from a fundamental standpoint, the key narratives that have driven gold inflows, easing monetary policy, persistent inflation risks, and political uncertainties, persist, like the U.S. government shutdown and the recent spike in tariff-related risks,” Wayne wrote.

He also provided a timeline for when the foremost meme coin could reach this price target, which will mark a new all-time high (ATH). When The Dogecoin Price Will reach $3.25 In an X post, Anthony stated that the Dogecoin price will reach $3.25 in the next three months. However, the analyst didn’t mention what would serve as the catalyst for this parabolic rally for the foremost meme coin. A potential rally to $3.25 would represent a 1,500% increase from DOGE’s current price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Adoption: Food Chain With Over 4,000 Locations Announces DOGE Payments Meanwhile, this would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the Dogecoin price, with its current ATH at $0.73. In another X post, Anthony stated that Elon Musk’s Tesla is about to start accepting DOGE and that the meme coin will see a 20x increase from its current price. This indicates that the analyst is banking on this potential move as one of the catalysts for a new ATH for DOGE. However, there has been no indication from Elon Musk that Tesla will soon accept DOGE for payments. The world’s richest man has been quiet about the meme coin and hasn’t shilled it since leaving the DOGE agency. Meanwhile, there is also no update on whether Musk’s X payments will enable DOGE payments, which could also be bullish for the Dogecoin price. Meanwhile, the potential launch of the Dogecoin ETFs is another catalyst that could spark a significant rally for the Dogecoin price. The SEC is expected to approve these ETFs once the U.S. government shutdown ends. The funds could drive new inflows from institutional investors into the DOGE ecosystem. DOGE Preparing For Major Rally Crypto analyst Ether stated that the Dogecoin price is gathering strength on the uptrend, as it is holding the 25MA support and has successfully completed a falling channel breakout and retest. The analyst added that this pattern remains the same as in the previous two cycles, with DOGE expected to experience an accumulation phase before it records a parabolic rally. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could rally to $1.9 during this parabolic phase. In the short term, crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo is expecting the DOGE price to reclaim $0.25. He noted that there is a lot of thin air to fill from the market crash a couple of weeks back. DOGE had crashed from $0.2 back then when Trump first announced the 100% tariffs on China, which sparked a crypto market crash.

The deal positions the merged entity as a key player in bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) using Cube’s hybrid digital asset exchange platform. An official release from Mercer Park valued Cube at $300 million, and a core pre-closing condition requires the combined entity to acquire $500 million worth of Solana (SOL) tokens using stock as consideration, thereby establishing a substantial crypto treasury for Cube Exchange Inc. The primary objective of the SOL token treasury will be to generate yield via staking, with annual returns expected to range between 7-9%. This strategy follows the same logic as other Solana digital asset treasuries to generate sustainable revenues. Merged entity will pursue dual listing on Nasdaq and TSX After the merger , the combined entity’s services will expand to cover spot trading, custody solutions, perpetuals, derivatives, hybrid banking, asset management, as well as corporate treasury solutions. The transaction has been structured as a qualifying transaction under Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) rules, with Mercer Park expected to issue shares to Cube’s equity holders. Post-closing, the company will also pursue a dual listing on the Nasdaq. The deal is expected to close in Q1 2026, though that will depend greatly on several factors, including TSX approval, a prospectus clearance with Canadian securities regulators, and Cube’s audit completion. Solana gets a new $500M treasury The treasury that will be inadvertently created as part of the merger will not only optimize corporate finance through SOL staking for passive income but also boost on-chain liquidity and trading volume on Cube’s platform. Already, several companies have actively integrated crypto into their balance sheets with notable examples including SOL Strategies Inc.’s $500 million convertible note facility for acquiring and staking SOL, with interest tied to staking yield and Forward Industries ’ $1.65 billion private investment in public equity (PIPE) to create a Solana-focused treasury. As for why some companies are choosing to establish a SOL treasury instead of a BTC reserve similar to Strategy’s, look no further than the perks. SOL treasuries offer active yield generation via staking, with an average staking yield of 6.86% presenting the SOL ecosystem as an alternative to passive store-of-value strategies. Wall Street has also praised the chain’s high-performance capabilities and minimal fees. Overall, regulatory developments, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) 2025 adoption of fair-value accounting for digital assets, have removed reporting barriers. This has made it more straightforward for firms to hold crypto without double tax burdens, enhancing transparency and investor confidence in corporate treasury initiatives.

While many market participants still view XRP as another digital coin, there is mounting evidence that its ecosystem is intersecting with major asset-manager infrastructure in ways that might redefine how tokenized funds and stablecoins operate. The Emerging Rail: RLUSD’s Institutional Entry In September 2025, Ripple announced a collaboration with Securitize to enable smart-contract functionality, allowing investors in BlackRock’s BUIDL fund and VanEck’s VBILL fund to redeem their tokenized shares for Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. That technical integration means qualified shareholders can now convert their fund tokens on-chain into RLUSD, 24/7, offering an instant liquidity pathway that marries traditional fund exposure with blockchain-based settlement rails. RIPPLE #XRP 'S SECRET CONNECTION TO BLACKROCK pic.twitter.com/stuvJGIzyE — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 22, 2025 Prominent XRP commentator Ripple Bull Winkle highlighted this very development in a post on X: “Securitize, backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley? They’re tokenizing money market funds using Ripple’s RLUSD for on-chain redemptions! The world’s largest asset managers are quietly moving liquidity through Ripple’s ecosystem, while the public still thinks XRP is just another coin.” While Bull Winkle’s framing emphasizes the size and stealth of this shift, the confirmed partnership between Ripple, Securitize, BlackRock, and VanEck shows a credible infrastructure move, not simply speculation. Why This Matters for XRP & Institutional Finance The ripple effect (no pun intended) is threefold. First, RLUSD, by virtue of this integration, moves from theoretical to operational: as a stablecoin backed 1:1 by liquid assets (with the backing charter of the New York Department of Financial Services), it is designed for enterprise usage. Second, the integration bridges tokenized short-duration funds (treasury bills, money-market instruments) with on-chain settlement liquidity, potentially reducing friction in how institutions move capital. Third, and perhaps most consequentially, t his ties the XRP ecosystem into traditional asset-manager flows in a way that most retail participants may be entirely unaware of. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism & The Road Ahead This is not without caveats. Tokenized funds remain a niche, and real-world asset (RWA) bridges often face regulatory, liquidity, and infrastructure constraints. Academic research indicates that despite billions in tokenized assets, very few enjoy vibrant secondary markets or high turnover on-chain. The question going forward is how much adoption this off-ramp will see, how quickly supporting infrastructure, custody, regulatory audit trails, on-chain identity, etc., scale, and whether RLUSD gains wider usage beyond these initial fund vehicles. Final Thoughts What began as an observation by Ripple Bull, Winkle seems to bear real substance: institutional rails tied to Ripple’s stablecoin and ecosystem are operational and live. As Bull Winkle observed: “This isn’t theory, everyone, it’s transformational!” If this is indeed the early stage of institutional settlement infrastructure converging with crypto rails, then the implications for XRP and its related ecosystem could be far more significant than most assume. That said, this is not a guarantee of meteoric price movements—it is a structural narrative, and one to watch closely.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token. Overview Cryptocurrency Jito Ticker JTO Price $1.05 (-6%) Market cap $666.71 Million Trading volume (24-hour) $17.34 Million Circulating supply 332.43 Million JTO All-time high $5.61; Dec 7, 2023 All-time low $0.5362; Dec 7, 2023 Jito technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $1.05 Price Prediction $ 1.24 (+25.07%) Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.29% Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA $ 1.80 200-Day SMA $ 2.02 14-Day RSI 45.96 JTO price analysis Resistance for JITO is at $1.262 Support for JTO/USD is at $0.885 The JTO price analysis for October 22 confirms that Jito struggles around $1. Currently, the price is aiming for a move below immediate Fib channels. JITO price analysis 1-day chart: JTO price faces bearish pressure around $1 Analyzing the daily price chart of JTO tokens, JITO is struggling to hold momentum as it declined below $1. Currently, sellers are now aiming for a hold below immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged to $3.97 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. JITO’s price is currently trading at $1.05, which has dropped by over 6% in the last 24 hours. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 32-level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. JITO/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers prepare for a big move above EMA levels The 4-hour JITO price chart suggests that JTO experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, sellers aim for a strong hold below the EMA20 trend line. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.56, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening selling positions. Jito price predictions: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 1.75 SELL SMA 5 $ 1.74 SELL SMA 10 $ 1.65 SELL SMA 21 $ 1.70 SELL SMA 50 $ 1.80 SELL SMA 100 $ 1.86 SELL SMA 200 $ 2.02 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.72 SELL EMA 5 $ 1.77 SELL EMA 10 $ 1.83 SELL EMA 21 $ 1.84 SELL EMA 50 $ 1.86 SELL EMA 100 $ 1.92 SELL EMA 200 $ 2.06 SELL What to expect from JITO price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $1.262, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $1.695. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.885, resulting in a correction to $0.319. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a downward correction. This created a drop toward $1. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $1.5 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news Jito Foundation has announced four major updates to its $JTO tokenomics, including the completion of a $1M token buyback, the passage of JIP-24 doubling DAO block engine fees, and the launch of an Economic Hub page.

If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout October.
