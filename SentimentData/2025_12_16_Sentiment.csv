For cryptocurrency investors watching monetary policy closely, this development signals potential turbulence ahead for traditional markets that often ripple through digital asset valuations. Why Are Fed Chair Odds Suddenly Changing? According to CNBC reports, Kevin Hassett is no longer the clear frontrunner to lead the Federal Reserve. The White House National Economic Council director previously enjoyed overwhelming support, but concerns about the Fed’s independence have changed the calculus. Multiple sources indicate that presidential aides worry about Hassett’s close relationship with Donald Trump potentially compromising the central bank’s autonomy. This matters because the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates directly influence market liquidity, inflation expectations, and investment flows across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. When traders lose confidence in central bank independence, volatility typically increases. How Could This Affect Financial Markets? The bond market reaction represents the most immediate concern. Analysts project potential long-term negative responses if markets perceive the next Fed chair as overly political. Specifically: Interest rate uncertainty: Markets might anticipate more aggressive rate hikes depending on the nominee’s approach to inflation Dollar volatility: Currency fluctuations could impact cryptocurrency valuations Risk asset re-pricing: Traditional safe havens and alternative assets like Bitcoin often see increased interest during periods of central bank uncertainty Hassett addressed these concerns directly during a recent CBS interview, stating that while the president has clear positions, the Fed makes policy decisions based on data and FOMC consensus, not political views. What Do Prediction Markets Reveal About Fed Chair Odds? The numbers tell a compelling story. Data from decentralized prediction market Kalshi shows Hassett’s nomination probability has plummeted from over 80% earlier this month to just 31%. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh has seen his odds surge to 52%. Prediction markets often provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polls because participants risk real money on their convictions. This dramatic shift suggests informed traders see genuine obstacles to Hassett’s nomination. Why Does Federal Reserve Independence Matter? The Federal Reserve’s credibility depends on its perceived independence from political pressure. When markets believe the central bank will make decisions based on economic data rather than political considerations, several benefits emerge: Stable inflation expectations: Businesses and consumers can plan with confidence Predictable monetary policy: Investors can assess risk more accurately International confidence: Global markets trust the dollar as a reserve currency Cryptocurrency advocates often point to central bank politicization as a key reason for Bitcoin’s existence as an alternative, decentralized monetary system. What Happens Next With Fed Chair Selection? The selection process now enters a more uncertain phase. Several factors will influence the final decision: Market reactions to potential nominees Congressional support for different candidates Economic conditions at the time of nomination Political considerations within the administration For cryptocurrency traders, monitoring these Fed chair odds provides valuable insight into potential monetary policy directions. The Fed’s approach to inflation, interest rates, and quantitative easing all significantly impact digital asset valuations. Key Takeaways for Investors The shifting Fed chair odds highlight several important considerations: Central bank independence remains crucial for market stability Political relationships can significantly impact appointment probabilities Prediction markets offer real-time insights into likely outcomes Monetary policy uncertainty often increases interest in alternative assets As the selection process continues, watch for further developments in Fed chair odds and corresponding market reactions. The ultimate nominee will shape monetary policy for years, affecting everything from mortgage rates to cryptocurrency valuations. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Kevin Hassett’s Fed chair odds drop so suddenly? Concerns emerged among presidential aides that Hassett’s close relationship with Donald Trump could compromise Federal Reserve independence. This political consideration changed the nomination calculus dramatically. How do prediction markets calculate Fed chair odds? Platforms like Kalshi allow users to trade contracts based on event outcomes. Prices reflect the market’s collective probability assessment, with participants risking real money on their predictions. Why does Federal Reserve independence matter for cryptocurrencies? When traditional central banks face credibility issues, some investors seek alternatives like cryptocurrencies. Perceived politicization of monetary policy can increase interest in decentralized digital assets. Who is currently favored in Fed chair odds? Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh now leads with 52% probability according to Kalshi data, while Kevin Hassett has fallen to 31%. How quickly could a new Fed chair be appointed? The nomination and confirmation process typically takes several months, but timing depends on political factors and congressional schedules. What should cryptocurrency investors watch regarding Fed chair odds? Monitor market reactions to different candidates, particularly regarding their views on inflation, digital currencies, and financial innovation. These positions could significantly impact crypto regulation and adoption. Found this analysis of shifting Fed chair odds helpful?

Bitcoin price prediction now points to a potential sweep of the $80,000 lows before a bullish reversal toward $100,000. On-Chain Data Shows $81K as Critical Support Data from Glassnode reveals Bitcoin’s True Market Mean, the average on-chain purchase price held by active market participants, stands near $81,000, serving as strong support during today’s 3.6% decline that sent prices below $86,000. Bitcoin's True Market Mean—the average on-chain purchase price of Bitcoin held by active participants—stood near $81K as strong support during the last drawdown. Bitcoin first broke above it in October 2023 and hasn't traded below since. pic.twitter.com/2Wz1EWPzIi — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) December 15, 2025 Crypto analyst Darkfost observed that inflows to Binance from “wholecoiners” (transactions exceeding 1 BTC) are collapsing compared to previous years. The yearly average now sits around 6,500 BTC, a level not seen since 2018. “What is particularly interesting is the trend these inflows have followed during this cycle compared to past ones. Instead of increasing as they did previously, wholecoiner inflows to Binance have steadily declined, even as Bitcoin continued pushing higher,” Darkfost explained. BTC demand on spot orderbooks currently sits at elevated levels, from $85,000 down to $80,000, suggesting continued downward pressure on the asset. However, analyst Ted Pillows reveals that defending the $81,000 support could enable Bitcoin to target the next major resistance zone around $92,000-$94,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Bearish Momentum Cooling Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays clear momentum deterioration after failing to maintain above the $100,000 psychological resistance, which now represents the key threshold required to resume a sustained uptrend. Price has since reversed and trades in the mid-$80,000 region, with sellers driving it toward a critical support band around $81,000. The RSI has dropped into the mid-30s, indicating growing bearish pressure, but approaches levels where downside momentum typically begins slowing. Source: TradingView If the $81,000 support maintains, the chart favors a short-term relief rally toward the $90,000–$95,000 region, with a larger move back toward $100,000 only probable if buyers reclaim that level on strong volume. However, a decisive weekly close below $81,000 would bring the final bull-market structure support near $76,000 into focus, and losing that level would significantly increase the risk of a deeper corrective phase. Pepenode Offers Investors 553% APY Ahead of 2026 Bull Run If Bitcoin finally breaks the $100,000 level and starts climbing again, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see another explosive rally.

Over 1 trillion SHIB tokens , worth more than $8 million , were moved to exchanges in just 24 hours last week, raising questions about what’s coming next for the Shiba Inu price prediction . Data from Santiment shows large holders are positioning for a possible sell-off, a move that often signals rising selling pressure. Shiba Inu has seen the highest amount of whale transfers since June 6th today, happening in tandem with a +1.06T net change to the amount of $SHIB on exchanges. The #24 market cap in crypto is likely to see high volatility in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/64slL6tGVw — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 9, 2025 While not always the start of a crash, these kinds of inflows tend to confirm the current trend, which, in SHIB’s case, is still heading lower. Over the past 30 days, SHIB has dropped 9.4% , and since the beginning of the year, it has lost 61% , as traders continue to rotate out of meme coins. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Despite Bearish News, SHIB Looks Bullish Shiba Inu recently bounced from support at $0.0000077 , but selling pressure returned quickly as it approached the $0.0000095 resistance zone. A descending price channel has been in play for months, and SHIB now looks set to retest the $0.0000077 level again, pointing to a possible 6% downside in the short term. Still, a potential reversal is on the table. If SHIB forms a double bottom at this level, it could spark a bounce toward the top of the channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also flashing a bullish divergence , showing rising momentum even as price trends lower, a classic sign that a local bottom may be forming. As meme coins begin showing early signs of strength, one new presale is standing out. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is capturing the spirit of Dogecoin’s early days and turning it into a fresh new meme coin where holders can share early opportunities and trading setups.

Still, historical patterns support a bullish XRP price prediction , and here’s why. Popular trader Steph is Crypto recently shared a chart showing a clear similarity to XRP’s 2017 accumulation phase, when the token was trading at just $0.25 . What followed was a massive rally that sent XRP to its all-time high within a year, and some believe the setup today could lead to something similar. $XRP is about to explode, just like it did in 2017. Buckle up! pic.twitter.com/hTISvgpa0q — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 14, 2025 Steph identified a similar accumulation pattern forming this year, right after XRP broke above the $1.70 level. Back in January 2018, XRP reached $3.84 , delivering a massive 1,440% gain for those who bought during the last major accumulation phase. XRP Price Prediction: Move Above $2.20 Could Set Things in Motion Looking at the daily chart, XRP has formed a falling wedge over the past few months, resulting from the sharp decline over the past few months. Source: TradingView The price has now compressed around the $2 mark, making this a key level to watch closely in the coming days. A breakout above $2.20 could flip the script entirely, invalidating the current bearish structure and potentially kicking off XRP’s next major move. If that happens, the first target in this time frame would be the 200-day EMA at $2.44 , offering a quick 20% upside , with a larger move toward $3 likely to follow. Should momentum continue building, the bold prediction shared by Steph is Crypto could start to play out in the months ahead, especially as crypto adoption continues to accelerate. Just like XRP, early-stage presales are starting to gain attention, and few stand out more than Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) .

This follows the wallet’s ongoing transition into a true multichain platform, after previously adding support for other blockchains, including Solana and various EVM networks. The update generates native Bitcoin addresses for users, supports SegWit transactions, and will add Taproot compatibility in a future release. Users can purchase Bitcoin via credit card, Apple Pay, PayPal , or bank transfers, and swap BTC with other supported assets directly in the wallet. MetaMask expands beyond Ethereum with native Bitcoin support and incentives MetaMask’s transition from an Ethereum-only wallet to a multichain platform occurred nearly a year after the wallet first announced it would introduce support for Bitcoin, marking the beginning of its expansion beyond Ethereum. The Bitcoin integration enables users to hold and transact the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, eliminating the need for wrapped tokens or third-party wallets. “We’re excited to announce that Bitcoin is now supported on MetaMask. This means you can trade and manage BTC alongside Ethereum, Solana, Monad, and Sei assets, all inside your MetaMask wallet,” a statement from the company reads. The network expansion comes amid a flurry of recent feature enhancements, as it seeks to stay near the top of a competitive wallet landscape. Just a few months ago, the wallet launched its own stablecoin, mUSD, on Ethereum and the layer-2 scaling network, Linea. Then, in October, it unveiled native support for swaps on Hyperliquid, allowing traders to easily place long or short bets on the popular Perps DEX. Earlier this month, MetaMask rolled out a native Polymarket integration, enabling users to place predictions on sports, crypto, and politics directly within the wallet. Users can now also trade Bitcoin after updating to the latest version of MetaMask. Those who swap into BTC will earn MetaMask reward points as part of a $30 million community rewards program, designed to support long-term engagement ahead of the wallet’s native token launch. Following the rollout of Bitcoin, MetaMask plans to add more networks in 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $86,332.54. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has fallen 3.2% over the last 24 hours. It’s 32% off its record high of more than $126,000 reached in early October. Major cryptocurrencies fell during U.S. morning hours Monday, continuing a now crystal-clear pattern of relatively poor performance while American stocks trade. Bitcoin’s underperformance during U.S. trading hours initially suggests weak demand from American investors, although the structure of spot Bitcoin ETFs, launched in January 2024, may also be influencing activity. “Since the iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT began trading, had you only owned it after hours (buy the close, sell the next open), it’s up 222%,” Bespoke Investment said in an X post. “Had you only owned intraday (buy the open, sell the close), it’s down 40.5%.” Crypto stocks also began the week significantly lower, with both Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRCL) down about 7%. Coinbase (COIN) dropped by more than 5%, while trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and eToro (ETOR) experienced smaller declines of approximately 2%. Brokerage Gemini (GEMI), which soared late last week on approval for adding prediction markets to its offerings, pulled back 10% Monday. MetaMask’s Bitcoin integration drives on-chain growth Industry observers view the integration as a significant convenience boost, expected to generate higher on-chain activity and extend MetaMask’s reach into additional market segments, including both institutional and retail users. The competition could apply pressure to offer multichain offerings to match MetaMask’s rising ecosystem. Although Bitcoin offers a different level of investment benefit, some experts argue that multichain wallets introduce increased security and operational complexities; they emphasize the importance of keeping wallets updated and safeguarding private keys and recovery phrases. Now, as Bitcoin is native to MetaMask, the wallet presents itself as a central hub for a range of digital assets for users online, as well as within the Web3 ecosystem, while also pushing the boundaries of cross-chain interoperability.

However, the price remains firmly capped by a descending trendline and structural resistance around the $3,400 level. While buyers defend the vital $2,905 low, the trend remains sideways until ETH can achieve a decisive close above the descending resistance to initiate the next major rally. ETH Attempts To Stabilize After The Selloff According to a daily update from CyrilXBT, Ethereum is attempting to form a base following its recent selloff, but the price remains capped below the 50-day EMA around $3,281. This level continues to act as a key barrier, keeping ETH from confirming a stronger recovery for now. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Drifts Lower—Is $3,000 About to Be the Battleground? At the time of the update, ETH was trading near $3,131. On the downside, initial support sits around $3,050, while a broader demand zone between $2,750 and $2,900 remains the more significant area where buyers are expected to step in if selling pressure returns. On the upside, resistance is concentrated between $3,280 and $3,300, aligning closely with the 50-day EMA, which represents a clear “prove-it” level. Looking ahead, a clean break and sustained hold above $3,300 could open the door for a move back toward the $3,500 area and beyond. However, failure to reclaim this resistance would likely lead to choppy price action, with a possible retest of the $3,000 level and even a revisit of the $2,800 zone. Ethereum Trades Below Descending Trendline Resistance Crypto analyst Kamile Uray revealed that ETH is currently confined, moving persistently under a blue descending trendline. This trendline is acting as a significant diagonal resistance barrier, limiting the extent of ETH’s bullish bounces and keeping the short-term pressure tilted downward. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Cooling Off: Healthy Consolidation or Momentum Fading? Despite this overhead resistance, the analyst identified a critical support structure. Uray noted that the possibility of the upward movement continuing remains valid as long as the price stays above the rising black trendline and above the low established at $2,905. This confluence of support is crucial for maintaining the market’s current bullish bias. If the blue descending trendline resistance is decisively broken, the subsequent rally is expected to target a series of higher resistance levels: $3,661, then $3,878, and finally $4,292. Kamile Uray synthesized the condition for the breakout, stating that the descending trendline will approximately be broken if ETH manages to achieve a daily close above the $3,400 level. Meanwhile, the key condition for expecting a continued upward movement is a close above $3,400 combined with the price successfully avoiding a close below the critical $2,905 low.

55847604,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92415,1765843236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Michael Saylor’s 2045 Bitcoin Projection: What It Means for XRP Price,https://timestabloid.com/michael-saylors-2045-bitcoin-projection-what-it-means-for-xrp-price/,"As digital asset markets remain under pressure from macroeconomic influence, investor attention is increasingly shifting toward long-term valuation scenarios. One discussion gaining traction is how alternative cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP, could perform if Bitcoin achieves the ambitious long-range forecast put forward by Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor. Market expectations earlier in the cycle leaned heavily toward a near-term surge across crypto assets. However, tightening financial conditions and reduced risk appetite have redirected focus toward multi-year growth models rather than short-term price fluctuations. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Thesis Michael Saylor has consistently maintained a highly optimistic view of Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. His confidence is reflected in Strategy’s accumulation strategy, which has made the company the largest known corporate holder of Bitcoin, with over 660,000 BTC. In July 2024, when Bitcoin was trading near $65,000, Saylor presented a long-term bull-case scenario projecting Bitcoin at $49 million per coin by 2045. Since then, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $126,000 in October 2025 before retreating due to macroeconomic pressures. Imagine if Michael Saylor is 100% correct… pic.twitter.com/4bSsyTpZDG — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) September 25, 2025 At current prices near $90,000, Bitcoin would still require an increase of more than 54,000% to reach Saylor’s long-term target. What This Could Mean for XRP Although Saylor’s projection focuses exclusively on Bitcoin, its implications extend to the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s dominance means sustained appreciation often influences capital flows into other major digital assets. XRP has historically shown strong directional alignment with Bitcoin, particularly during periods of market expansion. Over recent months, XRP’s declines have exceeded those of Bitcoin, reinforcing its sensitivity to broader market movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If Bitcoin were to follow a trajectory consistent with Saylor’s forecast, a proportional expansion model suggests XRP could experience substantial long-term appreciation. Based on such assumptions, XRP’s price could theoretically rise from approximately $2 to levels above $1,000 over the coming decades. Supportive and Critical Perspectives Some long-range forecasting platforms align with this view. Changelly, for instance, has projected XRP approaching the $1,100 range by the early 2040s, assuming sustained adoption and expanding use cases. However, this outlook remains highly contested . Critics argue that XRP’s large circulating supply creates significant valuation constraints. At four-digit price levels, XRP’s implied market capitalization would exceed $100 trillion, a figure many analysts consider unrealistic within existing global financial structures. While Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin forecast provides a framework for examining long-term possibilities, XRP’s potential path depends on its own adoption, regulatory clarity, and market structure. High-end projections remain speculative and should be weighed against structural limitations and broader economic realities.

Reports note that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55182, was published by the React team on December 3 and carries a maximum severity rating. Cybersecurity firm Security Alliance (SEAL) has confirmed that multiple crypto websites are actively being targeted, and they urge operators to review all React Server Components immediately to prevent wallet-draining attacks. Security teams say the bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to run code on affected servers, which has been turned into wallet-draining campaigns across several sites. A Wide Risk To Sites Using Server Components SEAL said the flaw affects React Server Components packages in versions 19.0 through 19.2.0, and patched releases such as 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1 were issued after disclosure. Crypto Drainers using React CVE-2025-55182 We are observing a big uptick in drainers uploaded to legitimate (crypto) websites through exploitation of the recent React CVE. All websites should review front-end code for any suspicious assets NOW. — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) December 13, 2025 The vulnerability works by exploiting unsafe deserialization in the Flight protocol, letting a single crafted HTTP request execute arbitrary code with the web server’s privileges. Security teams have warned that many sites using default configurations are at risk until they apply the updates. Attackers Inject Wallet-Draining Scripts Into Compromised Pages According to industry posts, threat actors are using the exploit to plant scripts that prompt users to connect Web3 wallets and then hijack or redirect transactions. In some cases the injected code alters the user interface or swaps addresses, so a user believes they are sending funds to one account while the transaction actually pays an attacker. This method can hit users who trust familiar crypto sites and connect wallets without checking every approval. Scanners And Proof-Of-Concepts Flooded Underground Forums Security researchers report a rush of scanning tools, fake proof-of-concept code, and exploit kits shared in underground forums shortly after the vulnerability was disclosed. Cloud and threat-intelligence teams have observed multiple groups scanning for vulnerable servers and testing payloads, which has accelerated active exploitation. Some defenders say that the speed and volume of scanning have made it hard to stop all attempts before patches are applied. More Than 50 Organizations Reported Compromise Attempts Based on reports from incident responders, post-exploitation crypto activity has been observed at more than 50 organizations across finance, media, government, and tech. In several investigations, attackers established footholds and then used those to deliver further malware or to seed front-end code that targets wallet users. SEAL has emphasized that organizations failing to patch or monitor their servers could experience further attacks, and ongoing monitoring is essential until all systems are verified safe.

Take a deep breath. According to a major new report from asset manager Grayscale, these quantum computing fears are vastly overblown for the immediate future. Their 2026 Digital Asset Market Outlook delivers a crucial dose of clarity, separating long-term research from short-term market reality. Why Are Quantum Computing Fears Surfacing Now? It’s a legitimate question. Quantum computers use principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems traditional computers cannot. In theory, a powerful enough quantum machine could break the cryptographic encryption that secures Bitcoin and other blockchains. This potential has sparked concern among some investors. However, Grayscale’s analysis acts as a reality check, urging the market to focus on tangible, near-term factors instead of distant hypotheticals. What Did Grayscale’s Report Actually Say? The core message is straightforward. While quantum computing poses a recognized long-term challenge, it is unlikely to directly impact crypto price volatility next year . The report highlights two key reasons for this calm assessment: Timeline: A quantum computer capable of threatening Bitcoin’s SHA-256 encryption is not expected before 2030 at the very earliest. Preparation: The cryptographic community is already actively researching and developing “post-quantum” cryptography—new encryption methods that would be secure against quantum attacks. Therefore, the immediate quantum computing fears influencing trader sentiment are misplaced. The market has more pressing concerns, like regulatory developments and adoption rates. Should Investors Ignore Quantum Threats Completely? Absolutely not. The report doesn’t advise ignorance; it advises perspective. Think of it like preparing for a storm forecasted for a decade from now. You acknowledge it, you support the scientists building better shelters (post-quantum crypto), but you don’t sell your house today. The blockchain industry’s proactive stance is a reason for confidence, not panic. This measured view helps stabilize irrational quantum computing fears . What Are the Real Market Drivers for 2025? If quantum isn’t a short-term driver, what should investors watch? Grayscale’s outlook implies focus should remain on: Institutional Adoption: Continued entry of traditional finance firms. Regulatory Clarity: Evolving frameworks from governments worldwide. Technological Upgrades: Scalability and utility improvements on major networks. Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates and global liquidity. These factors will have a far greater influence on your portfolio in the next 12 months than any quantum computing fears . The Bottom Line: A Call for Informed Calm Grayscale’s report serves as an authoritative voice cutting through the noise. It validates the technical concern while decisively placing it on a distant horizon irrelevant to current trading strategies. The key takeaway is reassurance . The crypto ecosystem is aware of the challenge and is not standing still. For the foreseeable future, Bitcoin’s security remains robust, allowing investors and developers to concentrate on building and adopting the technology today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can a quantum computer break Bitcoin tomorrow? A: No. Grayscale and most experts agree a machine powerful enough is likely more than five years away, with 2030 being a common estimate. Q: What is being done to protect Bitcoin from quantum computers? A> Researchers are developing “post-quantum cryptography”—new encryption algorithms. Bitcoin and other blockchains can theoretically adopt these upgrades through community consensus when necessary. Q: Should I sell my crypto because of quantum computing? A> Grayscale’s analysis suggests no. The threat is long-term, and the ecosystem is preparing. Short-term price movements are driven by other factors. Q: Are other assets besides Bitcoin at risk? A> Yes, any digital system relying on current public-key cryptography (like traditional banking infrastructure) could be vulnerable, making this a universal tech challenge, not just a crypto one. Q: Where can I read Grayscale’s full report? A> The “2026 Digital Asset Market Outlook” is typically available on Grayscale’s official website and investor research pages.

The latest data reveals the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to a mere 11, a stark indicator that investor sentiment has entered the “extreme fear” zone. This critical metric, a vital pulse check for the market, suggests traders are navigating one of the most pessimistic environments in recent memory. But what does this extreme reading truly mean for your portfolio? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional thermometer. Created by Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective psychology of cryptocurrency investors on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents paralyzing fear, while 100 signals euphoric greed. The current reading of 11 is alarmingly close to the bottom, indicating widespread panic and risk aversion. This index matters because extreme emotions often precede major market turning points. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes multiple market factors to gauge sentiment objectively. Here’s the breakdown of its components: Market Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trades and volume relative to recent averages. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of crypto discussions online. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Monitors Google search volume for cryptocurrency topics. This multi-source approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view, not just a reaction to price alone. What Does an “Extreme Fear” Reading of 11 Signal for Traders? An index level of 11 is a powerful contrarian signal. Historically, periods of “extreme fear” have often presented buying opportunities for patient, long-term investors. When fear dominates, assets can become undervalued as selling pressure overwhelms the market. However, it can also signal further downside if the fundamental market conditions are weak. Therefore, this is not a simple “buy” signal, but a critical alert to pay close attention. Actionable Insights: Navigating a Market in Extreme Fear Navigating this environment requires a cool head and a clear strategy. First, avoid making impulsive decisions driven by the prevailing panic. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) as a method to build positions gradually, reducing the risk of buying at a single peak. Third, use this time for rigorous research on projects with strong fundamentals. Finally, always ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your personal risk tolerance. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Conclusion: Fear as a Precursor to Opportunity The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 11 is a definitive snapshot of a fearful market. While unsettling, understanding this sentiment gauge empowers you to look beyond the panic. Extreme fear has frequently marked cyclical bottoms, offering strategic entry points. By focusing on data, maintaining discipline, and using tools like this index for perspective, you can make informed decisions even when the market’s emotional temperature is running cold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A> It is not a direct price predictor. It measures sentiment, which is a key market driver. Extreme readings often indicate potential trend reversals, but timing is uncertain. Q: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows “Extreme Fear”? A> It can be a good time to research and consider strategic entries, but it should not be your sole reason for investing. Always conduct your own analysis and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A> The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time view of market sentiment. Q: Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? A> While its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin due to its market dominance, the resulting sentiment reading generally reflects the broader cryptocurrency market. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A> You can view the live index on websites like Alternative.me, which is the primary source for this data.

55848590,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=878962,1765844970,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55848590.jpeg,Ford just abandoned its flagship electric vehicle to lose $19.5 billion,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ford-abandoned-flagship-electric-vehicle/,"Ford is expecting to take a hit of $19.5 billion after scrapping the flagship electric pick-up truck, F-150, along with a range of other larger EVs, to focus on hybrid models. The policy change comes after the Trump administration eliminated federal subsidies for electric car buyers, throwing the industry into uncertainty. Ford executives said they will now put money into manufacturing more conventional trucks and vans, lower-priced electric options, and a new power storage operation aimed at business clients like utility companies. Andrew Frick from Ford said, “Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas.” Ford has its own reasons for the decision. The company said the financial justification for building certain large electric models “has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.” “When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Jim Farley, CEO of Ford, told Reuters. The government pulled the $7,500 tax break for new electric vehicle purchases at the end of September. That move created a rush of buyers in September, but sales dropped 49 percent the following month, according to numbers from Cox Automotive. Other automakers pull back on electric vehicles Ford is not alone in backing away from electric vehicle commitments. General Motors said in October it would take a $1.6 billion hit while cutting back production of battery-powered cars. GM also announced plans to reintroduce the Chevy Bolt with batteries from Chinese manufacturer CATL, despite heavy import taxes on Chinese goods. The financial hit to Ford breaks down as follows: $12.5 billion will be recorded in the final three months of this year as the company reorganizes its electric vehicle operations. This includes $3 billion to close down a battery-making partnership with SK On, a South Korean firm. The remaining charges will be spread out through 2027. Frick said the company is responding to current market realities rather than predictions made years ago. He noted that American buyers are sending a clear message about what they want. While customers appreciate electric vehicle advantages, “they demand affordability, range confidence” and vehicles that work for their daily needs and jobs, he said. Despite the massive writedown, Ford actually improved its financial outlook for the year. The company now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax of $7 billion, higher than the $6 billion to $6.5 billion it projected in October. The Michigan-based manufacturer said that by 2030, roughly half its worldwide sales will come from hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles , and fully electric models. That compares to 25 percent in 2025. Farley had promoted the electric F-150 truck, called the F-150 Lightning, as the “truck of the future” when he unveiled it in 2021. However, the vehicle struggled with rising production costs and poor consumer acceptance. Sales fell 72 percent when comparing November 2025 to the same month in 2024. Ford’s electric vehicle unit, known as Ford e, lost $5.1 billion in 2024 and another $3.6 billion during the first nine months of 2025. The company said its new approach should make the electric division profitable by 2029. With Trump moving to reduce fuel economy requirements for American vehicles, Ford faces less pressure to electrify its lineup to meet government consumption standards. New focus on smaller and cheaper model The next version of the F-150 Lightning will be an extended-range electric vehicle, which means it will have a small gasoline engine that charges the battery pack. Frick said a “new low-cost universal electric vehicle platform” will form the basis for a “new family of smaller, more affordable and cost-efficient vehicles.” A new mid-size pickup truck is scheduled for 2027. The pivot toward smaller electric vehicles follows an announcement last week that Ford will work with French carmaker Renault to build compact electric cars and vans. The partnership aims to cut costs and speed up development to compete with Chinese manufacturers in Europe.

During this time, they discussed issues regarding financial monitoring and user privacy. This meeting illustrates part of the federal agency’s long-standing goal of enhancing the regulatory framework set up for digital assets. During the roundtable discussion, Hester Peirce, a Commissioner at the SEC widely known as the “ Crypto Mom ” for her strong support of the digital asset industry, along with Paul Atkins, the chair of the SEC, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda, took the initiative to elaborate on effective ways in which regulators can safeguard investors while also taking privacy concerns into account. This discussion took place as the SEC noted the significant rise of blockchain-based financial activities. Atkins noted that cryptocurrency could end up as a strong tool for financial surveillance Considering the heightened adoption of cryptocurrencies among firms, Atkins argued that cryptocurrency could position itself as the most powerful financial surveillance system that has ever existed globally. To achieve this accomplishment, the SEC chair declared that the situation will rely on how the US government chooses to regulate it. He also pointed out that the federal agency used to view every digital wallet as a broker in the past. This meant that they demanded more transaction reports from these digital wallets. After several considerations, Peirce agreed with Atkins. As the head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, she proposed that regulators should carefully reconsider the most effective time and method for monitoring financial transactions as the crypto market continues to expand. “Our country’s decline in financial privacy and its related rules need an update, and cryptocurrency is pushing for this change,” Peirce said. According to her argument, cryptocurrency is an essential aspect of the country’s financial system, as it establishes new methods for effective transactions that do not rely on financial intermediaries, which are a critical component of their current financial surveillance system. However, she pointed out that, as previously mentioned, public blockchains where multiple crypto transactions occur are visible to everyone. This finding has raised the need for tools that safeguard privacy. The individuals who attended the surveillance and privacy roundtable included representatives from the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash , the Blockchain Association, and the Crypto Council for Innovation. This event marked the sixth occasion organized by the task force to discuss various parts of digital asset regulation and policy since the “Crypto Mom” began heading the team in January. Considering the intense nature of the situation, several analysts decided to weigh in on the situation. They claimed that many people in the crypto industry have raised concerns regarding privacy practices. These concerns have been raised at a time when the market is surging swiftly while regulators, lawmakers, and courts attempt to tackle this challenge. US senators face a limited time to create laws for the digital asset market During this roundtable discussion, it was discovered that as Caroline Crenshaw, a Commissioner at the SEC, prepared to exit the agency in less than a month, Senators in the United States faced limited time to develop laws that would establish a comprehensive framework for the digital asset market before 2026. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the early versions of a proposed bill might grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more power over digital assets while shifting the SEC’s focus. On the other hand, it was confirmed that these senators have been actively negotiating to bring the CLARITY Act to a vote before the end of this year. This decision followed the bill’s passage in July through the House of Representatives. Still, sources argued that there is a high likelihood that Republican leaders might not achieve this goal as of Monday this week.

The new mode offers leverage of up to 1,001 times on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) pairs with instant execution and zero slippage while keeping orders off public order books. Also, as part of a promotional launch running until December 31, the platform has waived all gas costs and trading fees, though trades executed in Shield Mode will not count toward Aster’s airdrop rewards program. In June 2025, the platform introduced Hidden Orders, making it the first perpetual decentralized exchange to offer integrated hidden order functionality that conceals both price and size from other market participants. Traders have complained about the transparency problem One of blockchain technology’s fundamental characteristics is transparency; however, despite its best intentions, it has created an unexpected vulnerability for traders. This visibility enables maximal extractable value (MEV) attacks, a practice where bots and validators profit by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions. Common MEV strategies include frontrunning, where traders observe pending large orders and execute their own trades first. Then, there are sandwich attacks, which place orders immediately before and after a target transaction to profit from the resulting price movement. The problem has become serious in the DeFi space, where transparency allows strategic actors to profit from information asymmetries. Unlike traditional finance, where dark pools and private execution venues have long existed to protect large orders, most DEX trading activity can be viewed by the general public. Aster DEX sees privacy as path to competitive advantage In its announcement on X , Aster wrote, “Shield Mode is for traders who want performance without broadcasting their next move—a protected execution mode today and an early building block for the privacy features we’re exploring with Aster Chain.” One perk of the Shield Mode is “isolated margin for precise risk control,” allowing traders to limit potential losses to their position size while maintaining high leverage ratios. The feature includes one-tap long and short execution with zero slippage guaranteed on supported trading pairs during launch. This latest announcement comes as Aster is trying to establish itself as a major player in the perpetual trading market. The platform briefly overtook Hyperliquid as the largest decentralized perpetuals exchange protocol in September 2025. Currently, it leads Hyperliquid in terms of perps volume, seeing over $4.95 billion in the last 24 hours, compared to Hyperliquid’s $3.17 billion. The 30-day perp volume transaction on Hyperliquid is over $204.35 billion, while Aster saw $219.85 billion in perp volume. Hyperliquid still leads the platform in terms of DEX volume, raking in over $6.59 billion in the past 30 days, while Aster has seen over $2.72 billion. Where does privacy stand in the future of crypto? Aster has positioned Shield Mode as an early component of privacy features planned for its DEX. It also stated that it will be introducing a Flexible Fee Model soon, and this model will have a fixed percentage per trade in its commission mode and a profit-and-loss (PnL) mode, which allows users to pay only when they profit. These offers will definitely increase the platform’s users and also impact its position in the decentralized perps market. Aster’s approach to privacy reflects a growing recognition within DeFi that pure transparency may conflict with practical trading needs, and this concern has helped to boost privacy solutions like Zcash, which experienced a major revival this year.

This crypto market correction has seen Bitcoin and major altcoins fall in unison, driven by a potent mix of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment. Let’s break down the key forces behind this sudden downturn and what they mean for your portfolio. What’s Driving the Current Crypto Market Correction? The recent price drop isn’t happening in a vacuum. Analysts point to two primary catalysts shaking investor confidence. First, uncertainty surrounds the next U.S. Federal Reserve Chair. Second, growing fears of an AI-driven debt bubble are prompting a flight from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Together, these factors have created a perfect storm for a crypto market correction . How Does Fed Chair Uncertainty Rock the Crypto Boat? Reports suggest President Trump’s team may favor a more independent candidate over Kevin Hassett, who was seen as supportive of interest rate cuts. The potential nomination of someone like Kevin Warsh, known for a stricter stance, has altered market expectations. Interest Rate Expectations: The prospect of fewer or delayed rate cuts can strengthen the US Dollar, often putting downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Market Stability: While a “hawkish” Fed chair might ease long-term dollar concerns, the immediate uncertainty triggers volatility. Leverage Liquidation: This uncertainty amplified a sell-off, leading to the liquidation of roughly $527 million in long positions in 24 hours as over-leveraged traders were forced to exit. Therefore, the simple equation is: Fed uncertainty leads to market volatility, which then triggers a cascading crypto market correction through leveraged positions. Are AI Bubble Fears Fueling the Sell-Off? Beyond the Fed, a broader caution is gripping markets. The explosive growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) investment has led some experts to warn of a potential debt bubble. When investors grow nervous about one high-risk sector, they often pull money from others. Cryptocurrencies, still viewed as a risk-on asset class by many institutions, are often among the first to see outflows in such environments. This risk-averse shift is a significant contributor to the current crypto market correction , as capital seeks safer havens. What Can Traders Do During a Market Correction? While corrections can be unsettling, they are a normal part of market cycles. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Portfolio: Review your holdings and risk exposure. Ensure you are not over-leveraged. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For long-term believers, a crypto market correction can present strategic buying opportunities at lower price points. Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond the price chart. Has the fundamental value proposition of your assets changed? Stay Informed: Monitor macroeconomic news, especially Fed announcements and inflation data, as they are key drivers. The Bottom Line on This Market Move This crypto market correction is a stark reminder that digital assets do not trade in isolation. They are deeply interconnected with traditional finance and global macroeconomic sentiment. The dual pressures of Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and fears of an AI investment bubble have created a risk-off mood. For savvy investors, understanding these linkages is crucial. Corrections can shake out weak leverage and reset the market for healthier future growth, but navigating them requires patience, discipline, and a clear focus on long-term fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a crypto market correction? A: A crypto market correction is a decline of 10% or more from a recent peak in the overall value of cryptocurrency markets. It is a common and healthy pullback within a longer-term trend. Q2: How long do crypto corrections typically last? A: There’s no set timeframe. Corrections can last from a few days to several months, depending on the underlying causes and market sentiment. Q3: Should I sell my crypto during a correction? A: Panic selling is rarely a good strategy. Corrections are often where long-term investors look for buying opportunities. Assess your financial goals and risk tolerance before making any decision. Q4: Is the AI bubble the main reason for this drop? A: It’s a contributing factor, not the sole reason. The primary driver appears to be macroeconomic uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy. AI bubble fears have amplified the general move away from risk assets. Q5: Will Bitcoin recover from this correction? A: Historically, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have recovered from corrections and gone on to new highs. However, past performance does not guarantee future results. Recovery depends on broader economic conditions and market adoption. Q6: What’s the best strategy now: buy, hold, or sell? A: This depends entirely on your individual investment strategy. A common approach for long-term holders is to “hold” or strategically “buy” more through dollar-cost averaging. Short-term traders might adopt a different tactic based on technical analysis. Found this analysis of the crypto market correction helpful?

Yet, three years into this technological tsunami, a surprising pattern has emerged: while businesses are eagerly adopting AI solutions, consumer AI startups are struggling to find their footing. Why do most specialized consumer AI applications fail to resonate, and what will it take for the next Uber or Airbnb of AI to emerge? We spoke with leading venture capitalists who reveal the uncomfortable truths about today’s consumer AI landscape. Why Consumer AI Startups Struggle to Find Traction Despite the explosive popularity of general-purpose tools like ChatGPT, most consumer AI startups are failing to build sustainable businesses. According to Chi-Hua Chien, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital, many early AI applications around video, audio, and photo editing were “super cool” but ultimately ephemeral. “But then Sora and Nano Banana came out, and the Chinese open-sourced their video models. And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared,” Chien explained at a recent StrictlyVC event. Chien draws a compelling comparison to the early days of smartphones: “A lot of those applications were like the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.” This pattern suggests that many standalone consumer AI applications are vulnerable to being absorbed into larger platforms. The Generative AI Platform Stabilization Problem Both Chien and Elizabeth Weil, founder and partner at Scribble Ventures, believe we’re in a transitional phase for AI platforms. Chien argues that just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish. “I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period gave birth to massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb. We might be seeing early signs of this stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT. Weil describes the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground” – no longer simple novelties but not yet mature, indispensable products. Is the Smartphone Holding Back AI Consumer Products? One of the most provocative insights from the VCs concerns the limitations of our current devices. “It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien argued. Weil agreed that smartphones may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products, largely because they’re not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone during the presentation. The race for the next personal AI device is already underway: OpenAI and Apple’s former design chief Jonny Ive are reportedly working on a “screenless,” pocket-sized device Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures Multiple startups are attempting to introduce AI pins, pendants, or rings with mixed success What Successful AI Consumer Products Might Look Like Not every breakthrough AI consumer product will require new hardware. Chien suggested that a personal AI financial adviser customized to individual needs could be transformative. Similarly, Weil anticipates that personalized, “always-on” tutors will become ubiquitous, delivered directly from smartphones. However, both VCs expressed skepticism about AI-powered social networks where thousands of AI bots interact with user content. “It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” Chien said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.” Key Challenges Facing Consumer AI Startups Challenge Description Potential Solution Platform Dependency Standalone apps risk being absorbed into larger platforms Build defensible moats through network effects or unique data Device Limitations Smartphones may not be optimal for ambient AI experiences Wait for new hardware or build for emerging form factors User Expectations Consumers expect AI to be either free or incredibly valuable Focus on solving genuine pain points with clear value propositions Technical Maturity AI platforms are still evolving rapidly Build for flexibility and anticipate platform changes Actionable Insights for AI Entrepreneurs Based on the VC insights, here are key considerations for anyone building in the consumer AI space: Timing is everything : We’re likely 1-2 years away from the platform stabilization needed for breakout consumer AI successes Think beyond the smartphone : Consider how your product would work on emerging form factors like glasses, pins, or ambient devices Avoid the “flashlight trap” : Don’t build features that larger platforms can easily absorb – focus on creating unique value Solve real problems : Personal finance and education show promise because they address genuine consumer needs Preserve human connection : Be cautious about replacing human interaction with AI in social contexts The Future of Consumer AI Startups The current struggles of consumer AI startups shouldn’t be interpreted as a failure of the technology, but rather as growing pains in a rapidly evolving landscape. The VCs’ insights suggest we’re approaching an inflection point similar to the 2009-2010 mobile era, when the platform stabilized enough for transformative applications to emerge. The most successful consumer AI products will likely: Leverage AI’s unique capabilities rather than simply automating existing tasks Work across multiple device types, including emerging form factors Create genuine, measurable value for users Build defensible advantages that can’t be easily replicated by larger platforms The generative AI revolution is far from over for consumers – it may just be getting started. The current period of experimentation and failure is laying the groundwork for the truly transformative applications that will define how we interact with AI in our daily lives. The breakthrough moment for consumer AI isn’t a matter of if, but when – and the VCs watching this space most closely suggest that moment is closer than many realize.

The measures cover everything from listing rules to stopping people from trading on inside information. The Financial Conduct Authority released its plans just one day after lawmakers introduced draft laws targeting crypto businesses. The move attempts to strike a balance between making Britain an attractive place for digital money operations while keeping investors safe in a market known for big risks. The watchdog backed away from some of its tougher ideas that came out earlier this year. Crypto trading sites will now be allowed to list their own digital tokens on their platforms and buy and sell assets directly with customers—two activities the regulator had initially wanted to stop. Tuesday’s announcement came in three separate documents that spell out how the regulator plans to take its current rulebook for regular financial markets and reshape it to fit the unusual characteristics and dangers of digital currencies like Bitcoin. People and companies have until February 12 to send in their thoughts on the proposals. The final version of Britain’s crypto rules should be ready sometime next year before they officially start in 2027. Officials push back against critics David Geale, who runs payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the watchdog wants to do this correctly. “ Regulation is coming — and we want to get it right,” Geale explained. “Our goal is to have a regime that protects consumers, supports innovation and promotes trust.” Some people in the industry say Britain has been too careful about welcoming cryptocurrency, especially compared to how Donald Trump’s government in the United States plans to take a hands-off approach. The FCA, however, said it wants a crypto market “where innovation can thrive, but where people understand the risks.” The regulator made clear it cannot and should not eliminate every danger. “Instead, it should make sure anyone investing in crypto does so with their eyes open,” the watchdog said. Companies dealing in digital assets will have to follow the money rules that already exist for Mifid investment businesses, plus a brand-new set of requirements made just for crypto. They must also keep enough cash and liquid holdings on hand so they can shut down operations without causing serious damage if needed. The FCA warned that regulation cannot protect against every possible problem in the crypto space. “Anyone who buys cryptoassets should be aware of the risks involved — including that they might lose all the money they invest and the significant volatility of the cryptoassets’ value,” the regulator stated. Framework targets market abuse and staking The new framework covers rules for crypto middlemen and brokers, steps to prevent insider dealing and price manipulation, and oversight of companies running staking programs where people lock up their digital coins to earn rewards. The regulator said certain best-execution standards that regular stock exchanges must follow will not apply to crypto trading platforms. The watchdog also tackled the tricky issue of overseeing distributed finance technology, where deals happen directly between two parties without a middleman. The FCA wants “the same rules that apply in traditional finance should also apply” to this newer system. Some questions remain unanswered. The regulator plans to ask for input during the first three months of 2026 about whether crypto firms should fall under consumer duty requirements that force companies to ensure good results for clients, and whether customers can take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

Priced at $0.035, a price that is making it a very attractive new cryptocurrency, with over 18,480 distinct accounts already on board, which is a very noticeable sign of the immense adoption that is taking place. Unlike other altcoins with the potential of only making massive short-term gains for existing traders, Mutuum Finance is hard at work putting together a full DeFi platform, including a solution that is decentralized, with a lending, borrowing, yield-incentivized reward system, as well as interest-bearing tokens. This is now being reinforced by a real-world event, with the V1 Sepolia Testnet soon to be released in Q4, 2025, which is a huge development that has now cemented the development path of the project, with real implications on development, use, and relevance. This has now cemented MUTM as the best crypto to buy now, with researchers identifying that it has high adoption, a sound price, a sound level of adoption, as well as a sound development path for the future. This is now giving potential buyers a signal that not only is it a sound development but that it is on the verge of taking over the existing, burgeoning crypto environment. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Nears Sell-out Mutuum Finance is quickly making a name for itself as a prominent DeFi project on the horizon for 2026. The presale has garnered over 18,480 participants, bringing in over $19.5 million. The cost of tokens in Phase 6 is set at $0.035, but in Phase 7, the price rises 20% to $0.04, marking the final stages of presale participation to acquire this new crypto coin, MUTM, prior to listing on exchanges. Unlike most altcoins, which find value within speculation, Mutuum Finance focuses on utility, making the use of the MUTM token highly valuable. Mutuum Finance is gearing up for the launch of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet, which is set to take place toward the latter part of 2025. This launch release is going to provide support for major assets such as ETH and USDT, making it possible for individuals to interact with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the automated liquidator bot. It’s going to serve a useful purpose of educating people on how the entire process works. Innovative Dual Lending System One of the reasons why people are embracing MUTM is because of the two-lending models that it has. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) mechanism pools a significant amount of stable assets such as USDT and ETH, which are all audited within smart contracts, with the rate of interest fluctuating with regard to how the pools are used. In the case of assets with high volatility, such as meme coins, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network facilitates direct agreements between users, which helps volatile assets enter the system without disrupting the main pools. The P2C layer combined with the P2P layer thus provides a solid and dynamic environment for lending, making MUTM the best crypto to buy now with real utility. The Buying-and-Redistribute Mechanism Increases Value Mutuum Finance enhances the experience even further with what is known as the buy-and-redistribute mechanism. The transaction fees generated from the process of lending and borrowing are used to buy back tokens, which are later on redistributed to users who are staking mtTokens. This basically helps form a mutually catalytic growth loop where the more the use of the platform, the more buy-backs occur, leading to increased rewards, thus encouraging even more use. This basically helps make MUTM a DeFi crypto with greater value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is close to a price increase of 20% with the nearing completion of presale stage 6. Over 18,480 individuals have chipped in a sum of $19.5 million, with tokens currently at $0.035, set to rise to $0.04 with the onset of presale stage 7. Early birds still have a chance to acquire MUTM tokens, which come with a DeFi platform that has real-world use cases and tremendous potential for growth, making it the best crypto to buy now and a compelling new crypto coin for investors.

This movement suggests we might be witnessing the early stages of changing market dynamics that could impact your portfolio strategy. What Does the Rising Altcoin Season Index Mean for Investors? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market thermometer. Created by CoinMarketCap, this metric measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The recent rise to 22 indicates growing momentum for alternative cryptocurrencies, though we remain far from the threshold that signals a full altcoin season.

For weeks, the Senate Republicans and Democrats have been debating on what rules to implement in the incoming crypto legislation. The negotiations are being held up due to certain ethics provisions that the democrats are pushing for. Senate Banking Committee postpones voting on crypto bill to 2026 After weeks of intense negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats over important details in the bill, Chairman Tim Scott confirmed on Monday that his committee will not hold a markup hearing this week as previously hoped. Senator Mark Warner noted that there are still wide areas of disagreement between both sides, saying lawmakers don’t even have agreed-upon language for some sections. Jeff Naft, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Republican, said in a statement that the panel is continuing to negotiate and looks forward to a markup in early 2026. Scott emphasized that the overall priority is creating bipartisan legislation and making America the Crypto capital of the world. The legislation would also provide clarity for the digital asset industry. The market structure bill aims to define how the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission can oversee crypto markets . It would appoint the CFTC as a primary spot market regulator for cryptocurrency and more clearly define how securities laws apply to the sector. The House of Representatives passed its version of crypto market structure legislation in July called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. It received strong bipartisan support with a 294-134 vote, including 216 Republicans and 78 Democrats. What is holding up the crypto bill negotiations? Democrats have been pushing for rules that would prevent public officials from profiting from cryptocurrency ventures while in office. This issue largely targets President Donald Trump and his family’s various crypto-related businesses, including World Liberty Financial. Senator Cynthia Lummis revealed that the White House has already rejected these ethics provisions. Democrats sent a counteroffer to Republicans earlier this month, expressing concerns about interest or yield payments on stablecoin balances. The Democratic Working Group warned that such yields could trigger bank runs if customers withdraw a lot at once and also threaten financial stability if stablecoins lose their value. Democrats want the SEC to conduct initial reviews to quickly classify new digital assets. They also want crypto projects to keep providing regular updates and disclosures when founders or managers are still actively running the project. They have also pushed for stronger anti-money laundering measures and tools to combat illicit finance, particularly to isolate digital asset services used by North Korean bad actors from the U.S. financial system. Additionally, Democrats are calling for bipartisan representation on both the SEC and CFTC to ensure fair and effective regulation. Both the SEC and CFTC have begun taking steps to become friendlier regulators, regardless of legislation. The SEC has published staff statements and held multiple roundtables discussing how securities laws could apply to crypto. The CFTC has started allowing institutions it licenses to engage in spot crypto trading and recently granted no-action relief to prediction market operators.

Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven According to multiple macro-focused voices, the move could sap global liquidity and put fresh downward pressure on risk assets, with some traders already bracing for a sharp pullback. Japan’s policy shift matters because higher rates tend to strengthen the yen and raise the cost of borrowing. When that happens, traders who previously borrowed cheaply in yen to invest elsewhere are often forced to unwind those positions. That process can pull money out of global markets in a short period of time, and Bitcoin has often felt that impact as investors cut exposure during risk-off stretches. BOJ Tightening Drains Global Liquidity According to AndrewBTC, every BOJ hike since 2024 has coincided with Bitcoin drawdowns of more than 20%.

Traders are positioning before a busy slate of US data and central bank events that could sway flows. Analyst EX bluntly warned BTC will collapse “below $70,000” under the stated macro conditions, a stark forecast that highlights how crowded bets can amplify moves when liquidity is pulled. EVERY TIME JAPAN HIKES RATES, BITCOIN DUMPS 20–25% NEXT WEEK, THEY WILL HIKE RATES TO 75 BPS AGAIN. IF THE PATTERN HOLDS, $BTC WILL DUMP BELOW $70,000 ON DECEMBER 19.

That dynamic helps explain why past BOJ moves lined up with 20-30% declines in Bitcoin. Still, markets often try to price events ahead of time; a hike that’s already built into prices may have a smaller effect than one that comes as a surprise.

Brandt, who has traded financial markets for more than fifty years, argued that XRP backers display a level of conviction he associates with what he describes as poorly informed “perma bulls.” His remarks quickly reignited a familiar debate between traditional market technicians and XRP supporters who prioritize broader adoption narratives. Brandt explained that his assessment is rooted in decades of experience across commodities, equities, futures, and cryptocurrencies. According to him, some investor groups remain consistently optimistic regardless of prolonged drawdowns, shifting macroeconomic conditions, or repeated technical breakdowns. He grouped XRP supporters alongside long-term silver investors, suggesting that both communities maintain unwavering confidence even during extended periods of underperformance. For 50 years I have traded many thousands of contracts of every commodity, stock indexes and as many cryptos as you can think of The perma bulls who I find most uneducated and biased are those who trumpet Silver and XRP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 12, 2025 Responses From the XRP Community Unsurprisingly, Brandt’s comments were met with immediate pushback. Zach Rector , a prominent XRP-focused analyst, pointed to what he described as evolving sentiment among former critics. Rector highlighted a recent statement from YoungHoon Kim, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist, who announced on December 12 that he had begun accumulating XRP. Kim’s decision drew attention because of his previously firm stance against alternative crypto assets. Other responses emphasized analytical differences rather than confrontation. Market commentator X Finance Bull acknowledged Brandt’s extensive trading background but questioned whether conventional chart-based models fully reflect XRP’s current positioning. He argued that XRP’s valuation may increasingly depend on regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and its role within cross-border payment infrastructure rather than short-term price formations alone. Similarly, Altcoin Buzz suggested that many XRP holders are less focused on near-term market fluctuations and more concerned with long-range utility. In that view, Brandt’s critique reflects a divergence in investment philosophy rather than an objective judgment on XRP’s long-term viability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Context of the Dispute Brandt’s skepticism toward XRP is not new. Over the years, he has repeatedly questioned the asset’s valuation and has, at times, projected continued weakness against Bitcoin. XRP supporters frequently respond by pointing out instances where such forecasts did not materialize as expected. That said, Brandt’s outlook has not always been negative. Earlier this year, he identified a bullish technical setup on XRP that ultimately resulted in a price advance before broader market pressure led to a reversal. This mixed history underscores that his criticism is largely tied to investor behavior rather than an outright dismissal of XRP as a tradable asset. The exchange highlights an ongoing divide within the crypto market. While traders like Brandt rely heavily on historical price action and classical technical analysis, many XRP investors emphasize legal progress, institutional interest, and evolving financial infrastructure. This contrast continues to shape debate around XRP’s future and reflects broader tensions between traditional trading frameworks and adoption-driven investment theses.

Key macroeconomic data, policy signals, and sector-specific developments are set to test market sentiment and influence volatility across major digital assets. Traders and investors are closely watching how these events unfold, as shifting expectations around inflation and liquidity could determine whether the market recovers or extends its downside pressure . Events Set To Move Bitcoin And Crypto Market This Week Bitcoin and the broader crypto market face a pivotal week, with several high-impact economic events lining up just days before Christmas. With year-end liquidity thinning and the recent market downturn, price reactions to macro developments could be more volatile than usual. The period from December 16 to 19 features key US economic data releases alongside global policy decisions that directly influence risk sentiment. Cryptocurrencies remain highly sensitive to shifts in interest rate expectations and dollar liquidity, making this week decisive for Bitcoin’s near-term direction. On December 16, October retail sales data and the November US Jobs Report are scheduled for release. These data provide insight into consumer strength and labor market conditions, both of which influence the extent to which monetary policy may remain restrictive. Usually, stronger retail spending or job growth could reinforce expectations that interest rates stay higher for longer. This risk scenario often pressures Bitcoin and other crypto assets as tighter financial conditions tend to reduce speculative capital flows. Next are the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data and the December Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, due on December 18. Notably, inflation remains one of the most influential drivers for crypto markets . If inflation comes in stronger than expected, the US dollar could strengthen, weighing on Bitcoin prices. Conversely, softer inflation data may support risk assets by improving the outlook for Quantitative Easing (QE). December 19 will see the release of several key economic reports, including the National Core CPI year over year, November existing home sales, the revised UoM consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. National Core CPI is especially important as it is the primary measure of underlying inflation and often triggers market volatility. US FED And Japan Monetary Policy Events At the December 18-19 monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to announce its interest rate decision, which could affect global liquidity conditions. In a recent speech, Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the BOJ was weighing the advantages and drawbacks of raising interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75%. If a spike occurs, it could affect risk markets, including cryptocurrency. In addition, five US Federal Reserve speaker events are scheduled this week. Their comments and insights could quickly reshape crypto market expectations. Last week, the FED cut rates by 25 basis points at its final 2025 FOMC meeting , bringing the new US interest rate to 3.50-3.75%. This rate cut triggered a surprising sell off , underscoring significant impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-16 01:00:50
55849471,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245672,1765847111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Partnership: How Pocket Network RPC Services Power GetBlock’s Decentralized Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pocket-network-rpc-services-getblock/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Partnership: How Pocket Network RPC Services Power GetBlock’s Decentralized Future In a significant move for decentralized web3 infrastructure, Pocket Network has announced a strategic partnership with node provider GetBlock. This collaboration centers on providing wholesale Pocket Network RPC services , a development that could reshape how developers access blockchain data. For anyone invested in the future of decentralized applications, this partnership signals a major step toward more resilient and cost-effective infrastructure. What Does This Pocket Network RPC Services Deal Mean? The core of the agreement is straightforward yet powerful. GetBlock will now receive Pocket Network RPC services at wholesale prices for all supported blockchain networks. Consequently, GetBlock can operate nodes for various chains at a significantly lower cost. This arrangement directly translates to potential savings and improved service for the countless developers and projects that rely on GetBlock’s platform. Payments within this ecosystem will be made exclusively in POKT tokens, based on actual RPC usage. Therefore, as GetBlock’s demand for these services grows, so does the demand for the POKT token. Pocket Network expects this mechanism to not only increase token utility but also create a deflationary effect on its supply. Why Is This Partnership a Game-Changer? This deal addresses two critical pain points in the blockchain space: centralization risk and high infrastructure costs. By leveraging Pocket Network’s decentralized node network, GetBlock enhances its service reliability. If one node fails, hundreds of others can seamlessly handle the requests. This creates a robust Pocket Network RPC services layer that is resistant to outages and censorship. For end-users, the benefits are clear: Lower Costs: Wholesale pricing allows GetBlock to offer competitive rates. Enhanced Reliability: Decentralization reduces single points of failure. Greater Access: Developers get reliable access to a wide array of chains. How Does the POKT Token Benefit? The tokenomics of this partnership are particularly compelling. The POKT token is the lifeblood of the Pocket Network ecosystem. Every RPC request served by a node operator requires a payment in POKT. With a major client like GetBlock now consuming these services at scale, the network’s usage is poised for a substantial uptick. This usage-based model means value accrues directly to the token. More importantly, the protocol employs a unique burn mechanism. A portion of the POKT used for payments is permanently removed from circulation. As a result, increased demand from partnerships like this can lead to a deflationary pressure on the token’s total supply, potentially benefiting long-term holders. What Are the Challenges and Future Outlook? While the partnership is promising, success hinges on execution. GetBlock must successfully integrate and scale its use of the Pocket Network RPC services . Furthermore, the broader market must continue to value decentralization over the convenience of centralized providers like Infura or Alchemy. However, the trend is encouraging. The web3 industry is increasingly prioritizing censorship-resistant and reliable infrastructure. Partnerships like this validate the economic model of decentralized service networks. If successful, it could pave the way for similar integrations, solidifying Pocket Network’s position as a leading provider of Pocket Network RPC services . In summary, the Pocket Network and GetBlock partnership is more than a simple business deal. It is a strategic alignment that strengthens the decentralized backbone of web3. By making RPC access more affordable and robust, it empowers developers to build better applications. Simultaneously, it creates a powerful demand engine for the POKT token, aligning economic incentives with network growth and security. This collaboration exemplifies how thoughtful partnerships can accelerate the entire ecosystem’s move toward a truly decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are RPC services in blockchain? RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services are the interface that allows applications, like a crypto wallet or dApp, to communicate with a blockchain. They let you query data (like your balance) or send transactions. How does Pocket Network’s model differ from traditional providers? Traditional providers (e.g., Infura) run centralized server clusters. Pocket Network is decentralized, distributing requests across thousands of independent node operators, which improves uptime and reduces censorship risk. What is the deflationary effect mentioned for the POKT token? The protocol burns a portion of the POKT tokens used to pay for RPC services. As usage increases (like from the GetBlock deal), more tokens are burned, reducing the total supply over time, which can be positive for the token’s value if demand holds. Will this partnership make GetBlock’s services cheaper for developers? Potentially, yes. By accessing Pocket Network RPC services at wholesale prices, GetBlock lowers its own infrastructure costs. These savings can be passed on to its customers, offering more competitive pricing plans. Which blockchains are supported through this partnership? GetBlock will have access to all blockchain networks supported by Pocket Network. This includes major chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and many others, providing wide coverage for developers. How does this improve reliability for end-users? Decentralization means there is no single point of failure. If one node goes offline, the network automatically routes requests to other available nodes, ensuring consistent service availability. Found this deep dive into the pivotal Pocket Network and GetBlock partnership insightful? This kind of infrastructure development is crucial for web3’s growth.

PayPal seeks bank status to expand lending and join fintech boom PayPal’s recent plan aims to increase the company’s small-business lending capacity and decrease its reliance on third-party financial partners , the company said in a press release on Monday. If approved by regulators, PayPal Bank would open the door for the payments juggernaut to offer deposits insured by the FDIC, streamline lending for loans, and potentially roll out interest-bearing savings products as part of its broader consumer finance portfolio. Strengthening PayPal’s balance-sheet capabilities will help combat the lingering capital challenges faced by small businesses nationwide, PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said. This application comes amid a notable surge in banking charter activity among both fintech and cryptocurrency‑linked firms. Just a few days ago, in the wake of this situation, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted conditional preliminary approvals to a handful of crypto and digital asset companies, including Circle Internet Group, Ripple Labs , BitGo, Paxos, and Fidelity Digital Assets, to establish or convert into federally chartered national trust banks. These are critical moves in integrating crypto companies into the mainstream banking industry, but final permitting and full functionality will depend on a plethora of regulatory prerequisites. Unlike some of these crypto firms, which are pursuing national trust bank charters under federal oversight to provide custody, payments, and asset management services, PayPal’s charter bid is focused on expanding lending and deposit services within its existing ecosystem. And yet, the move is part of a larger pattern in the U.S. regulatory landscape today, which is much more amenable to innovation and the entry of non-traditional players into banking. Regulatory shifts spur bank charter rush The new momentum around bank charters for digital finance companies stems from policy changes and regulatory signals this year that have relaxed barriers for non-bank entrants. The regulatory clarity offered by a federal charter provides crypto firms with more access and a deeper connection to banks in such a national market, even as some trade groups, as well as traditional banks themselves, question risk standards and definitions of banking authority. Beyond the now-approved crypto firms, Nissan Motor Co.’s financing arm applied for the same charter that PayPal pursued earlier this year, and Japan’s Sony Group Corp. has also applied to become a bank. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, interest in becoming a bank has jumped compared to the Biden administration’s term, when very few applications were submitted, let alone considered, based on an understanding that approval would be challenging. If PayPal’s application is approved, Mara McNeill, a former CEO of Toyota Motor Corp.’s financing arm, is expected to oversee the new bank, guiding PayPal’s next step in integrating conventional banking capabilities with its global payments network.

SBI Holdings, one of the country’s largest financial groups, has announced plans to launch a groundbreaking yen stablecoin in the second quarter of 2026. This move represents a significant step toward bridging traditional finance with the emerging world of digital assets. What Makes This Yen Stablecoin So Important? Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, a yen stablecoin is a digital currency pegged 1:1 to the Japanese yen. This means it maintains stable value while offering the benefits of blockchain technology. SBI’s announcement comes through a strategic partnership with Startale, a Web3 joint venture between tech giant Sony and the Astar Foundation. This collaboration brings together traditional financial expertise with cutting-edge blockchain innovation. The timing is crucial as Japan positions itself as a leader in regulated digital asset adoption. The planned 2026 launch gives regulators and institutions time to prepare for this new financial instrument. Why Should You Care About a Yen Stablecoin? This development matters for several reasons. First, it represents institutional validation of stablecoin technology. When a major player like SBI enters the space, it signals serious commitment to blockchain’s future. Second, this yen stablecoin could transform how people and businesses handle digital transactions. Consider these potential benefits: Faster cross-border payments without traditional banking delays Reduced transaction costs compared to conventional methods 24/7 availability unlike traditional banking hours Programmable money for automated business processes However, challenges remain. Regulatory compliance, security concerns, and public adoption will determine the project’s success. The partnership with Startale suggests SBI is addressing these issues head-on. How Will This Yen Stablecoin Impact Japan’s Economy? The introduction of a regulated yen stablecoin could accelerate Japan’s digital transformation. Financial services, e-commerce, and international trade could all benefit from more efficient digital payment systems. Moreover, this move positions Japan competitively in the global race for central bank digital currency (CBDC) innovation. While the Bank of Japan explores a digital yen, private sector initiatives like SBI’s yen stablecoin could complement official efforts. The Web3 expertise from Startale, backed by Sony’s technological prowess and Astar’s blockchain experience, creates a powerful foundation. This partnership demonstrates how traditional corporations can successfully navigate the Web3 space through strategic collaborations. What Does This Mean for Global Stablecoin Adoption? SBI’s announcement signals growing institutional interest in stablecoins beyond the US dollar. As more countries develop their own national stablecoins, we might see a more diversified global digital currency landscape. This Japanese yen stablecoin could serve as a model for other nations considering similar initiatives. The careful planning with a 2026 timeline shows responsible development rather than rushed implementation. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this represents another step toward mainstream adoption. When major financial institutions embrace blockchain technology, it validates the entire sector’s potential. Conclusion: A New Era for Japanese Finance SBI Holdings’ planned yen stablecoin launch in 2026 represents a watershed moment for Japanese finance. By combining traditional financial strength with innovative blockchain technology through the Startale partnership, SBI is positioning Japan at the forefront of digital currency innovation. This development promises to make digital transactions more efficient, accessible, and integrated with global financial systems. As we approach 2026, watch how this project evolves and potentially transforms Japan’s financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What is a yen stablecoin?

Valued at approximately $505 million, this single transaction represents a seismic shift of capital that has analysts and traders scrambling to decipher its meaning. What does such a colossal BTC transfer signal for the market’s future? What Does This Massive BTC Transfer Actually Mean? When a BTC transfer of this magnitude occurs, it’s rarely a simple retail transaction. This movement of nearly 6,000 Bitcoin out of a custodial exchange like Coinbase and into a private wallet is a classic ‘whale’ behavior. Typically, this action suggests the entity behind the move is planning for long-term holding, often referred to as ‘cold storage.’ Therefore, this could be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, as the coins are being withdrawn from the immediate selling pressure of an exchange. Who Could Be Behind the Mystery Wallet? The ‘unknown’ nature of the receiving wallet is what fuels intense speculation. While the identity is hidden, the possibilities are fascinating. It could point to several key players: A Major Institution: A hedge fund, corporation, or pension fund establishing a new treasury reserve. A Crypto Whale Consolidating: An individual or entity moving assets from an exchange to a more secure, self-custodied wallet. Preparation for an ETF or Financial Product: An entity possibly preparing coins for use in a regulated product. The sheer size makes an institutional player the most likely candidate, highlighting the growing institutional footprint in the crypto space. How Do Large BTC Transfers Impact Market Sentiment? Large BTC transfers are more than just on-chain data; they are powerful psychological signals. The immediate market reaction often involves a mix of curiosity and caution. On one hand, moving coins off an exchange reduces readily available supply, which can be a bullish indicator. On the other hand, the mystery creates uncertainty. Traders watch closely to see if this is an isolated event or the start of a trend. Historically, accumulation by whales during price consolidation phases has often preceded significant upward movements. What Should Everyday Investors Take Away? For the average investor, this event is a masterclass in on-chain analytics. It underscores the importance of watching whale wallets and exchange flows. While you shouldn’t make impulsive trades based on one BTC transfer , it’s a crucial data point. It reinforces key principles: Transparency: The Bitcoin network makes all large movements public. Holder Sentiment: Large-scale withdrawal suggests a ‘HODL’ mindset among big players. Market Maturity: Half-billion dollar movements are becoming more common, signaling deeper liquidity. The Final Verdict on This $505 Million Move This colossal BTC transfer from Coinbase is a definitive show of strength. It demonstrates that high-net-worth players are actively managing Bitcoin positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars with long-term conviction. Rather than signaling an imminent sell-off, the move to an unknown wallet suggests these coins are being taken off the market for safekeeping. This action aligns with a broader narrative of Bitcoin as a digital gold for the modern era, where secure, long-term storage is paramount for major holders. The mystery adds intrigue, but the underlying message is one of steadfast accumulation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a BTC transfer from an exchange to a private wallet bullish? A: Generally, yes. It reduces the immediate selling supply on exchanges and indicates the holder intends to store the asset long-term, which is seen as a confident move. Q: Why is the wallet ‘unknown’? A: Bitcoin wallets are pseudonymous. While the transaction and balance are public on the blockchain, the identity of the owner is not, unless they choose to reveal it. Q: Could this be a sign of selling pressure? A: It’s unlikely. If the entity planned to sell soon, they would typically keep the coins on the exchange for faster execution. Transferring to a private wallet usually precedes holding. Q: How can I track large BTC transfers myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or dedicated alert services like Whale Alert, which monitor and tweet about large transactions in real-time. Q: What’s the difference between this and a BTC transfer to another exchange? A: A transfer to another exchange often signals intent to trade or sell across different markets. A transfer to a new, private wallet strongly suggests withdrawal for custody. Q: Has this affected Bitcoin’s price? A: Single transactions rarely cause immediate, direct price spikes. However, they significantly influence market sentiment and trader psychology, which can affect price trends over time.

The Wyoming-based digital asset bank is not accepting defeat after a federal court sided with the Federal Reserve. Instead, it has formally requested a rehearing, arguing the court got the law wrong. This fight centers on one crucial asset: a Federal Reserve master account . The outcome will determine if innovative financial institutions can fully integrate into the core of the U.S. payment system. Why is a Custodia Bank master account such a big deal? Think of a Federal Reserve master account as a direct line to the heart of the U.S. financial system. It’s not just another bank account. For qualified institutions, it allows them to move money, settle transactions, and access essential services directly with the Fed. This eliminates the need for an intermediary bank, which can reduce costs, increase speed, and provide greater control. For a crypto-native bank like Custodia, securing this master account is the holy grail of legitimacy and operational efficiency. It’s the key to bridging the traditional financial world with the digital asset ecosystem. What happened in the courtroom? The battle hit a major hurdle in October when the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s decision to deny Custodia’s application. The court ruled the Fed had broad discretion in these matters. However, Custodia’s legal team is now striking back. They contend the appellate panel misinterpreted the law, specifically the provisions granting special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs) like Custodia the right to access Fed services. Their rehearing petition argues this misinterpretation creates a dangerous precedent, effectively allowing the Fed to arbitrarily block state-chartered banks from the payments system. What are the core arguments in the rehearing request? Custodia’s filing is a detailed rebuttal. Let’s break down their main points: Legal Misinterpretation: The bank argues the court incorrectly applied the law, failing to recognize the statutory rights granted to it as a Wyoming SPDI. Precedent Risk: They warn that letting the ruling stand gives the Federal Reserve unchecked power to deny access to any state-chartered bank, stifling competition and innovation. Regulatory Clarity: A final decision will provide much-needed clarity for other crypto and fintech firms seeking to operate within a regulated banking framework. How does this impact the future of crypto banking? This is far more than just one company’s legal struggle. The quest for a Custodia Bank master account is a landmark test case. A successful rehearing and eventual victory for Custodia would tear down a significant barrier. It would signal that compliant crypto banks can achieve parity with traditional banks, potentially unleashing a wave of regulated innovation in digital asset custody and payments. Conversely, if the denial is finalized, it could cement a two-tiered system, pushing crypto services further to the fringes of finance and relying on less transparent intermediaries. What’s the potential ripple effect? The implications extend beyond Wyoming or crypto. This case challenges the boundaries of the Federal Reserve’s authority and the states’ rights to charter innovative banks. It asks a fundamental question: who gets to participate in the core of American finance? The answer will influence: State Innovation: Wyoming’s pioneering SPDI charter model. Banking Competition: The entry of new, technology-driven players. Consumer Access: To safer, regulated crypto banking services. The final verdict is still pending Custodia Bank’s fight for a Federal Reserve master account is entering a crucial new phase with this rehearing request. The legal maneuvering highlights the intense growing pains as digital assets seek a permanent home within the established financial order. While the court deliberates, the entire fintech and crypto industry watches closely. The decision will either open the door for a new era of integrated, regulated digital finance or reinforce the walls guarding the traditional system. One thing is certain: the battle for the Custodia Bank master account is a defining conflict for the future of money. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Federal Reserve master account? A master account is an account held directly with a Federal Reserve Bank. It allows eligible institutions, like banks and credit unions, to conduct transactions (e.g., wire transfers, check clearing) directly with the Fed without going through another commercial bank. Why was Custodia Bank’s master account application denied? The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City denied the application, citing concerns over Custodia’s business model and risk profile as a crypto-focused bank. The 10th Circuit Court later upheld the Fed’s broad authority to make such denials, a decision Custodia is now challenging. What is a Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI)? An SPDI is a novel type of bank charter created by the state of Wyoming. It is designed to cater to businesses dealing in digital assets, providing them with banking services while requiring them to hold 100% reserves of their clients’ fiat deposits. What happens if Custodia wins the rehearing? If the court grants a rehearing and eventually rules in Custodia’s favor, it could force the Federal Reserve to reconsider the application under a different legal standard. It would be a major victory for the crypto banking sector and state banking innovation. How long could this legal process take? Legal proceedings, especially appeals and rehearings, can be lengthy. The court must first decide whether to grant the rehearing petition. If granted, new briefs and arguments will follow. A final resolution could take many more months or even years. Does this affect other crypto companies? Absolutely. This case sets a critical precedent. A win for Custodia would pave a clearer regulatory path for other crypto firms seeking banking partnerships or charters. A loss would likely mean continued difficulties in accessing core banking infrastructure. Found this deep dive into the Custodia Bank legal battle insightful?

A recent on-chain revelation underscores this volatility with a stark example. A prominent early Bitcoin investor, often called a ‘Bitcoin OG,’ is currently facing an unrealized loss of approximately $54 million on a series of massive crypto long positions . This situation offers a powerful lesson in market risk and portfolio management for every trader. Who Is the Bitcoin OG Facing Massive Losses? On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens identified the investor by a wallet address starting with ‘1011short·oxb317d’. This entity is not a small-time trader. The scale of their activity reveals them as a major player, or ‘whale,’ in the crypto space. Their total exposure across three major cryptocurrencies was over $600 million, demonstrating significant conviction in their bullish outlook. However, the market’s recent movements have turned that conviction into a costly waiting game. How Did These Crypto Long Positions Unravel? The investor’s strategy was a straightforward bet on the continued rise of top assets. They opened large crypto long positions , meaning they bought assets expecting their value to increase. Let’s break down the specifics of these positions that have now slipped into the red: Ethereum (ETH): A position of 190,935 ETH, valued at $563 million, with an average entry price of $3,167. Bitcoin (BTC): A position of 1,000 BTC, worth $85.93 million, entered at an average price of $91,506. Solana (SOL): A position of 250,000 SOL, amounting to $31.53 million, with an average entry price of $137.53. When current market prices fell below these entry points, the paper losses began to accumulate, culminating in the reported $54 million deficit. This scenario highlights a critical truth: even well-capitalized veterans are not immune to market downturns. What Can Traders Learn From This $54M Lesson? This event is more than just a headline; it’s a case study in risk. First, it shows the danger of over-concentration, even in blue-chip assets. Second, it emphasizes that ‘unrealized loss’ is a key term. The investor has not sold, meaning this is a paper loss that could reverse if prices recover. However, holding through such drawdowns requires immense capital and psychological fortitude. For everyday investors, the takeaway is clear. Managing crypto long positions requires a disciplined strategy. This includes: Diversification: Spreading risk across different assets and strategies. Risk Management: Using stop-loss orders or position sizing to limit potential downside. Emotional Discipline: Avoiding panic selling during downturns or reckless doubling down. Is This a Sign of Broader Market Trouble? While one whale’s crypto long positions turning sour is significant, it does not necessarily predict a market collapse. Large investors often employ complex strategies, including hedging on other platforms. This single data point reflects individual risk, not a systemic failure. However, it does serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility in crypto markets and the importance of conducting thorough research before committing capital. Conclusion: Navigating the High Seas of Crypto Investment The story of the Bitcoin OG’s $54 million paper loss is a sobering reminder of the risks inherent in cryptocurrency trading. It demonstrates that crypto long positions , while a common bullish strategy, carry substantial risk if not managed with extreme care. The market does not discriminate based on tenure or portfolio size. For all traders, the fundamentals of prudent investing—research, diversification, and risk management—remain the most reliable compass in these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘unrealized loss’ mean in this context? A1: An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an asset that an investor still holds. The loss is ‘on paper’ because the asset has not been sold. If the investor sells at the lower price, the loss becomes realized. Q2: What is a ‘Bitcoin OG’ or ‘crypto whale’? A2: A ‘Bitcoin OG’ (Original Gangster) typically refers to an early adopter who has held Bitcoin since its early days. A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices. Q3: Could this investor recover from this loss? A3: Yes, absolutely. Since the loss is unrealized, if the market prices for BTC, ETH, and SOL rise back above their average entry prices, the loss will decrease and eventually turn into a profit. The key question is their ability to hold the position until that happens. Q4: Should I be worried about my own crypto investments? A4: This event highlights the importance of your personal risk management. Evaluate your own portfolio’s concentration, ensure you haven’t invested more than you can afford to lose, and consider if your strategy aligns with your risk tolerance. Do not base decisions solely on one investor’s situation. Q5: What are ‘long positions’? A5: A long position is the buying of an asset with the expectation that its value will increase over time. It is the most common investment strategy. In contrast, a ‘short position’ is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. Found this deep dive into high-stakes crypto trading insightful?

According to a report, individuals close to Trump have privately expressed concerns about Hassett’s candidacy , arguing his deep alignment with the president could undermine perceptions of the Fed’s independence and unsettle financial markets. . Some advisers reportedly fear that nominating a loyalist could further politicize the central bank. Surprisingly, this connection had earlier made Hassett a top candidate to assume Jerome Powell’s current position. Meanwhile, after this news leaked, reports mentioned that this opposition may clarify why interviews with candidates in early December were called off and later rescheduled for Kevin Warsh last week. Uncertainties surrounding the fate of the next Fed chair spark concerns Trump declared that he has already settled on who to serve as the chair of the Federal Reserve. This statement caught many by surprise after the president publicly claimed that Kevin Warsh, the former Fed Governor who is currently serving as the acting economic advisor to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a member of the board of directors at UPS, rose as the leading contender alongside Hassett. Trump’s remarks significantly affected Hassett’s odds, causing them to drastically drop on Kalshi prediction markets. Seeing how things turned out, the president argued, “I think the two Kevins are great.” Nonetheless, Monday reports noted that Hassett is still in the lead on Kalshi, with his odds showing a 51% chance. However, this percentage illustrates a decrease from more than 80% odds raised earlier this month. Warsh, on the other hand, experienced a substantial increase in odds, rising to a 44% chance from around 11% at the beginning of December. Analysts researched the situation and discovered that the current opposition appeared to be concentrated more on backing Warsh instead of criticizing Hassett. It also seems that apart from Trump, Jamie Dimon, the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase , preferred the former Fed governor. However, he positively talked about both Hassett and Warsh. In the meantime, a reliable source highlighted that Hassett outperformed his competitors in the race by taking Powell’s position at the end of November. Notably, Powell’s term is scheduled to conclude in May next year. Still, several sources emphasized that Hassett encountered some opposition as December progressed. Following this assertion, individuals raised concerns that the bond market might respond negatively if it perceived him as being too closely connected to the US president. This perception could produce a contrary result from what Trump expects, potentially leading to a surge in long-term yields due to escalating fears that Hassett will not adopt strong measures to address inflation in the event of its increase. Hassett embraced a stronger stance despite facing criticism Responding to this criticism, Hassett embraced a stronger stance on the issue of Federal Reserve independence. He made this move during an interview held this past weekend. In an appearance on “Face the Nation,” Hassett shared a transcript stating that, ‘Trump has strong and well-reasoned ideas about what we should do. However, the Federal Reserve’s role is to remain independent and collaborate with the Board of Governors and the FOMC to reach a consensus on interest rates.” This statement drew the attention of several reports, prompting them to reach out to Hassett for comment on the topic of discussion. When asked whether Trump’s opinion held the same essence as that of a central bank member voting, Hassett stated that it did not. He further explained that the president had no influence and his opinion only counted if it was rooted in solid data.

According to the analyst, XRP is undergoing a standard consolidation period following a strong upward move, with conditions still favoring a continuation of the broader bullish trend over the coming months. XRP recently slipped below the $2 level after spending several weeks trading within a narrow range. This price movement has coincided with a broader market slowdown that has weighed on most major digital assets, pushing the total cryptocurrency market valuation down to approximately $3.13 trillion. Despite this backdrop, some analysts maintain that XRP’s technical structure remains constructive. Bullish Outlook Remains Intact Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto reiterated his positive stance on XRP in a recent public update, stating that the probability of a bullish continuation remains high . He emphasized that the ongoing pullback does not represent exhaustion at the top of the market but instead reflects a temporary cooling-off period after a strong rally. #XRP – 3 to 6 Month Outlook Ignoring the percentages on the formation and focusing purely on market structure, the higher-probability scenario is UP, not down. Here’s why 1⃣Regime Shift Already Happened: #XRP broke out of a multi-year base and printed an impulsive leg.… pic.twitter.com/XN2JwZpO7h — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 13, 2025 According to EGRAG, XRP’s most recent upward move began when the asset broke out from a long-standing base that had constrained its price action for several years. This breakout occurred around the $0.50 region in late 2024, after which XRP advanced sharply to a high of approximately $3.39 in January. The price later extended further, recording another peak near $3.67 in July. Following this advance, XRP entered a phase characterized by reduced momentum and sideways movement. EGRAG explained that this transition is typical after a strong impulsive move, as markets often pause to absorb gains before determining the next directional move. In his assessment, this behavior supports the argument that the broader trend has not yet concluded. Key Technical Levels Support the Trend One of the central points in EGRAG’s analysis is XRP’s position relative to long-term moving averages. He highlighted that XRP continues to trade above its 21-month exponential moving average, which currently sits near the $1.90 level. Remaining above this indicator is often interpreted as a sign that longer-term bullish conditions are still in place. At the same time, XRP has fallen below the 9-month exponential moving average, positioned around $2.29, which reflects short-term weakness. However, EGRAG noted that temporary moves below shorter-term indicators are not unusual during consolidation phases and do not automatically invalidate the broader trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that previous XRP cycles have involved extended periods of sideways or downward movement before resuming an upward trajectory. As a result, the current decline does not represent a new development for long-term holders. According to his analysis, the bullish outlook would only be challenged if XRP were to record sustained monthly closes below the $1.80 to $1.60 range. Three to Six Month Price Expectations Looking ahead, EGRAG shared his expectations for XRP over the next three to six months. He stated that, based on the current market structure, the asset is more likely to resume upward movement than to experience a prolonged decline. His outlook assumes that XRP will continue to hold above the 21-month exponential moving average and gradually rebuild momentum. Under this scenario, EGRAG’s technical projections suggest that XRP could eventually move toward a new all-time high. His chart analysis suggests a potential target near $9.50, although he emphasized that increased volatility should be expected along the way. From current price levels, such a move would represent a substantial percentage gain. This target aligns with price levels EGRAG has referenced in previous analyses. In earlier commentary, he outlined scenarios where XRP could advance toward the $9.60 area, with longer-term projections extending significantly higher if broader market conditions and adoption trends remain favorable. While acknowledging that market conditions can change, the analyst concluded that XRP’s current structure supports patience rather than panic, particularly for investors focused on the medium-term outlook.

55851131,645196,1765850412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55851131.jpeg,Wall Street Keeps Buying XRP: US Spot ETFs Post 19-Day Inflow Streak,https://bitcoinist.com/wall-street-xrp-us-spot-etfs-19-day-inflow-streak/,"US-listed spot XRP ETFs just put together a streak that’s hard to ignore: 19 straight trading days of net inflows, with zero outflow sessions over the run, according to daily flow data compiled by Sosovalue. The numbers add up quickly. By Dec. 12, cumulative net inflows sat at $974.50 million, while total net assets across the products were shown at roughly $1.18 billion. XRP ETFs Log 19 Straight Trading Days Of Inflows The early days did most of the heavy lifting . Sosovalue’s table shows $243.05 million of net inflow on Nov. 14, then another surge on Nov. 24 ($164.04 million). There were also chunky adds on Nov. 20 ($118.15 million) and Dec. 1 ($89.65 million). Even as the pace cooled, inflows didn’t flip—Dec. 8 posted $38.04 million, and Dec. 12 added another $20.17 million. On X, Bitmern Mining founder and CEO Giannis Andreou framed it bluntly today: “19 consecutive trading days of inflows. Zero outflow days. Nearly $1B in net capital added.” He called it “sustained institutional positioning,” not retail froth. That “institutional bid” angle is also showing up in the asset rankings. In a Dec. 13 post, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg pointed to a separate snapshot of the US crypto ETP landscape showing XRP products now edging out Solana by total assets under management. Bloomberg Intelligence data in the chart puts XRP ETP assets at about $1.638 billion, just ahead of Solana at $1.566 billion, in a market where Bitcoin still towers over everything at $125.425 billion and Ethereum sits at $22.019 billion. McClurg’s explanation for the flip was less about Solana underperforming and more about where each asset “fits” in the wrapper trade. “SOL ETFs launched before XRP, but XRP ETFs have now passed SOL in total AUM. I expected this ,” McClurg wrote, adding “SOL is much more efficient to hold on-chain and to stake directly for retail audiences, whereas XRP has more institutional demand and no staking. As with everything, there will be an audience that prefers direct ownership, and an audience that prefers the ease of financial instruments. Some will do both.” Notably, from Dec. 8 to Dec. 12, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $287 million for the week, while Ethereum spot ETFs saw weekly net inflows of $209 million. SOL spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $33.6 million. At press time, XRP once again fell below the $2 mark. The token traded at $1.98 and thus at the key support zone. A drop below the red support band could strengthen the bear case for a deeper crash to the 100-week or even 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). XRP visited the latter during the October 10 crash.",XRP|Spot XRP ETFs|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-16 02:00:12

Cardano SuperTrend Has Flipped Bearish In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has appeared in the SuperTrend of Cardano. The “SuperTrend” refers to a TA indicator that’s generally used for determining whether a given asset is following a bearish or bullish trend. It’s built using the Average True Range (ATR), another TA indicator that measures the degree of volatility being experienced by the price. Related Reading: XRP Mildly Undervalued On MVRV: What About Bitcoin, Ethereum? The SuperTrend is represented by a single trendline that acts as both support and resistance, depending on which side the asset is trading. When the price is above this line, the indicator signals that the asset is in a bullish trend. On the other hand, being under the line implies the dominance of a bearish trajectory. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the SuperTrend of Cardano over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the weekly Cardano price broke above the SuperTrend line during 2023 and stayed over it throughout 2024 and much of 2025. Recently, however, the price has finally seen a reversal of trend, with the indicator now giving a bearish signal instead. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time that this pattern developed in ADA’s 1-week price. It would appear that the flip to a bearish trend led to a decline of more than 80% for the cryptocurrency in 2022. It now remains to be seen whether the SuperTrend giving a sell signal is foreshadowing something similar this time, or if Cardano will see the renewal of bullish momentum despite the pattern. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Forms Signal That Last Led To 95% Price Rally Cardano isn’t the only coin in the sector that has seen a flip in the SuperTrend recently. As the analyst has highlighted in another X post, the number one cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has also seen a change in its SuperTrend. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the weekly price of Bitcoin is now trading under the SuperTrend line, a sign that a bearish trend is taking over. Like for Cardano, the last time this flip happened was in the last bear market. Back then, BTC dropped by over 60%. ADA Price Cardano saw brief recovery above $0.48 last week, but the cryptocurrency has since witnessed a retrace as its price is now back at $0.40.

This pivotal deal merges social media marketing expertise with established Dogecoin and Litecoin mining operations, creating a new entity called Datacentrex. The transaction signals a significant evolution in how public companies approach cryptocurrency integration and revenue diversification. What Does the Thumzup Acquisition Mean for Investors? The completed Thumzup acquisition represents more than a simple corporate purchase. It marks a fundamental shift in business strategy. Thumzup, previously focused on social media marketing, now gains direct exposure to cryptocurrency mining revenue streams through Dogehash’s established operations. This vertical integration creates a unique hybrid model in the public markets. Investors should note the immediate practical outcome: the company begins trading on Nasdaq under the new ticker DTCX on December 16. The rebrand to Datacentrex reflects this expanded operational focus beyond its original marketing roots. Understanding the New Datacentrex Business Model Following the Thumzup acquisition, the newly formed Datacentrex operates on a clear two-part model. First, it continues the core Dogecoin and Litecoin mining operations acquired from Dogehash. Second, it implements a novel treasury strategy by reinvesting a portion of mining profits directly back into cryptocurrencies. The company has announced it will strategically allocate mining revenue into three major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC) as a long-term store of value Dogecoin (DOGE) to support its existing mining infrastructure Litecoin (LTC) to maintain operational continuity This approach creates a self-reinforcing cycle where mining operations fund further crypto asset accumulation. Why This Thumzup Acquisition Matters for Crypto Markets This transaction carries substantial symbolic weight for cryptocurrency adoption. A Nasdaq-listed company is not just investing in crypto, but actively acquiring and operating mining infrastructure. This move provides several key benefits: Enhanced Legitimacy: Brings cryptocurrency mining further into the regulated public market sphere Revenue Diversification: Creates hybrid revenue streams from both traditional marketing and crypto mining Strategic Positioning: Positions Datacentrex at the intersection of digital marketing and blockchain infrastructure However, challenges remain, including cryptocurrency volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and the technical demands of maintaining mining operations. The Future Roadmap for Datacentrex Post-Acquisition With the Thumzup acquisition complete, attention turns to execution. The success of Datacentrex will depend on several factors. Efficient mining operations must generate sufficient revenue to justify the acquisition cost. The treasury management strategy requires disciplined execution amid market fluctuations. Furthermore, the company must effectively communicate its dual identity to investors accustomed to its previous marketing focus. The December 16 Nasdaq relisting under DTCX provides the first major test of market reception. Investor response will indicate whether the market values this unique combination of digital marketing and cryptocurrency mining. Actionable Insights from This Corporate Evolution This Thumzup acquisition offers valuable lessons for both crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors. It demonstrates how established companies can pivot toward blockchain technologies through strategic acquisitions. The deal highlights the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency operations within conventional corporate structures. Moreover, it showcases a practical model for recycling crypto mining profits into further digital asset accumulation. For investors monitoring this space, key metrics to watch include: Mining efficiency and cost metrics post-acquisition Quarterly revenue breakdown between marketing and mining segments Execution of the stated cryptocurrency investment strategy Market valuation relative to pure-play mining companies Conclusion: A Transformative Moment in Crypto Integration The completed Thumzup acquisition of Dogehash represents a watershed moment in cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream financial integration. By transforming into Datacentrex, the company creates a novel blueprint for how public firms can bridge traditional business and blockchain operations. The strategic decision to reinvest mining revenue directly into cryptocurrency assets demonstrates sophisticated treasury management thinking. As Datacentrex begins trading as DTCX, it carries the potential to inspire similar hybrid models, accelerating institutional crypto adoption through practical, revenue-generating operations rather than speculative investment alone. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Thumzup acquire? Thumzup acquired Dogehash Technologies, a company operating Dogecoin and Litecoin mining infrastructure, in a complete acquisition that includes all mining assets and operations. When will Datacentrex start trading on Nasdaq? The company is scheduled to begin trading under the new ticker symbol DTCX on December 16, following the completion of the acquisition and rebranding process. What cryptocurrencies will Datacentrex invest in? The company plans to strategically invest its mining revenue into three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). Why is this acquisition significant? It represents a Nasdaq-listed company moving beyond cryptocurrency investment to actively owning and operating mining infrastructure, signaling deeper institutional adoption. What happens to Thumzup’s original marketing business? While the company rebrands to Datacentrex, it will likely continue its social media marketing operations alongside the new mining business, creating a diversified revenue model. What are the main risks for the new Datacentrex? Key risks include cryptocurrency price volatility affecting mining profitability, regulatory changes impacting crypto operations, and execution challenges in integrating two different business models.

The Chairman of Fundstrat and Bitmine recently took to social media to reinforce his bullish stance, suggesting that recent price adjustments in high-potential assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are moments for investors to pay close attention. But what’s the reasoning behind this confident call? Why Is This a Prime Buying Opportunity? Tom Lee points to a key market dynamic. He notes that assets with significant long-term growth potential, including artificial intelligence (AI), Bitcoin, and Ethereum, are currently hypersensitive to shifts in overall risk perception. When macroeconomic fears or negative headlines surface, these assets often experience exaggerated price drops. However, Lee argues this creates a disconnect. The short-term volatility masks their strong underlying fundamentals and future prospects. Therefore, a price dip is not a signal to sell, but a chance to acquire assets at a more attractive entry point before their long-term narrative resumes. Putting Money Where the Mouth Is: The Bitmine Example Lee’s view isn’t just theoretical talk. His associated company, Bitmine, recently demonstrated this conviction with a massive, real-world move. Reports confirmed that Bitmine purchased a staggering $321 million worth of Ethereum last week. This substantial investment during a period of market uncertainty serves as a powerful example of institutional faith. It shows that major players are actively treating downturns as a strategic buying opportunity to build positions, backing their optimistic outlook with significant capital. How Should Investors Approach This Opportunity? Understanding the theory is one thing, but acting on it requires a clear strategy. For individual investors, Lee’s perspective offers a crucial framework for navigating crypto volatility. Look Beyond the Headline Fear: Separate short-term market noise from long-term technological trends. Ask yourself if the core value proposition of Bitcoin or Ethereum has changed. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the absolute bottom, consider spreading purchases over time. This method reduces risk and systematically builds a position, turning every dip into a partial buying opportunity . Focus on Fundamentals: Evaluate the health of the network, developer activity, and adoption metrics, not just the price chart. Strong fundamentals often support recovery and growth. What Are the Risks and Challenges? While the potential is compelling, it’s vital to acknowledge the challenges. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and prices can fall further after any dip. Furthermore, the “risk-on” nature Lee describes means these assets could remain under pressure if broader economic conditions worsen. Therefore, any decision to buy must be part of a personalized plan. Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Maintain a well-diversified portfolio beyond crypto. Prepare for potential further short-term volatility even after buying. Conclusion: A Lesson in Conviction Tom Lee’s analysis cuts through the typical fear surrounding market dips. He reframes them as necessary phases that create valuable entry windows for forward-thinking investors. The key takeaway is to assess whether an asset’s long-term story remains intact. For Bitcoin and Ethereum, many believe the narrative of digital scarcity and programmable blockchain utility is stronger than ever. When viewed through this lens, a market correction transforms from a threat into a strategic buying opportunity . The recent action by Bitmine underscores that this isn’t just optimistic commentary—it’s a strategy being executed at the highest levels. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who is Tom Lee and why should I listen to him? A: Tom Lee is the Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors and Chairman of Bitmine. He is a well-known Wall Street strategist who has been analyzing markets for decades and is a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency space, often cited for his data-driven approaches. Q: Does this mean the price of BTC and ETH will go up immediately? A: Not necessarily. Calling a dip a buying opportunity is a strategic, long-term perspective. It suggests the price is attractive relative to future potential, but it does not guarantee short-term gains. Markets can remain volatile. Q: What does “risk perception” mean in this context? A> It refers to the overall appetite for risk among investors. When news about inflation, interest rates, or geopolitics makes investors fearful, they often sell riskier assets (like tech stocks and crypto) first, causing prices to drop more sharply than less volatile assets. Q: Is Bitmine’s $321M ETH purchase a guarantee of success? A> No single trade is a guarantee. However, it is a strong signal of institutional conviction. It shows that a major entity with significant resources is willing to back its belief in Ethereum’s future with substantial capital, even during uncertain times. Q: Should I invest all my savings based on this advice? A> Absolutely not. This perspective should inform your research, not replace it. Always practice sound risk management, diversify your investments, and never commit funds you cannot afford to lose. Consider it one data point in your broader strategy.

The platform officially designated the Myro token for investment caution , raising serious questions about this meme-inspired cryptocurrency’s future. If you’re holding MYRO or considering it, you need to understand exactly what this warning means and why it matters for your portfolio. Why Did Coinone Issue This MYRO Investment Caution? Coinone didn’t make this decision lightly. The exchange provided specific reasons for flagging MYRO, and understanding them is crucial for any investor. According to their announcement, the primary concern revolves around insufficient community activity. However, that’s just the surface issue. The exchange also expressed deeper worries about the project’s long-term viability and operational sustainability. This investment caution designation serves as a formal warning to users. Coinone essentially states that continuing to trade or hold MYRO might expose investors to unnecessary risk. The exchange cited “potential for harm to users” as a key factor in their decision-making process. What Does ‘Investment Caution’ Really Mean for MYRO? When an exchange like Coinone designates a token for investment caution , it’s not a trading halt or delisting—yet. However, it represents a significant red flag that often precedes more severe actions. Here’s what this designation typically involves: Increased scrutiny: The token receives closer monitoring from exchange compliance teams Warning labels: Trading pages display caution notices to inform users Potential restrictions: Future trading limitations or withdrawal constraints could follow Market impact: Other exchanges often take note and may conduct their own reviews For MYRO specifically, this designation comes at a critical time. The token, inspired by Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s dog, gained popularity during the recent meme coin surge. However, Coinone’s action suggests underlying issues that go beyond typical market volatility. How Serious Are the Community Activity Concerns? Coinone specifically mentioned “insufficient community activity” as a primary reason for their MYRO investment caution designation. But what does this actually mean for a cryptocurrency project? A vibrant community typically indicates several positive factors: Sustained developer engagement and project updates Active social media discussions and problem-solving Regular community events, AMAs, or governance participation Organic growth through word-of-mouth and genuine interest When these elements decline, it often signals deeper problems. A fading community can mean reduced liquidity, slower development, and ultimately, decreased token utility. For MYRO, this warning suggests the initial hype may not have translated into lasting engagement. Should You Be Worried About Your MYRO Holdings? If you’re holding MYRO, Coinone’s investment caution designation warrants immediate attention. However, panic selling isn’t necessarily the right response. Instead, consider these practical steps: Review the project’s recent developments: Check if the team has addressed Coinone’s concerns Monitor community channels: Assess whether engagement is genuinely declining or just shifting platforms Evaluate your risk tolerance: Determine if holding aligns with your investment strategy Watch for exchange responses: See if other platforms follow Coinone’s lead Remember, exchange warnings don’t automatically mean a project will fail. However, they do indicate that professional risk assessors have identified significant concerns that retail investors might overlook. The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Meme Coins Coinone’s action against MYRO reflects a growing trend in cryptocurrency regulation and exchange responsibility. As the market matures, exchanges face increasing pressure to protect users from potentially harmful assets. This MYRO investment caution decision demonstrates how platforms are implementing more sophisticated risk assessment frameworks. For the broader meme coin sector, this serves as a wake-up call. Projects cannot rely solely on initial hype and social media buzz. Sustainable growth requires genuine utility, active development, and—as Coinone emphasized—a truly engaged community. Exchanges are now watching these factors more closely than ever before. Final Verdict: Navigating the MYRO Situation Coinone’s investment caution designation for MYRO represents a significant development that investors cannot ignore. While the token remains tradable, the warning signals legitimate concerns about community engagement and project sustainability. Whether you’re currently holding MYRO or considering it, this situation highlights the importance of thorough due diligence beyond price charts and social media trends. The cryptocurrency market continues evolving toward greater accountability. Exchange warnings like this one help separate serious projects from fleeting trends. For MYRO specifically, the coming weeks will reveal whether the project can address Coinone’s concerns or if this caution will escalate to more severe restrictions. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘investment caution’ mean on Coinone? Investment caution is a warning designation that Coinone applies to tokens showing potential risks to investors. It indicates the exchange has identified concerns about the project’s sustainability, community activity, or other factors that might harm users. Can I still trade MYRO on Coinone after this warning? Yes, the investment caution designation doesn’t automatically stop trading. However, Coinone may add warning notices to the trading interface, and future restrictions could follow if concerns aren’t addressed. Will other exchanges also flag MYRO for caution? There’s no guarantee, but major exchanges often monitor each other’s risk assessments. Coinone’s action might prompt reviews on other platforms, especially if similar concerns exist. How long do projects typically remain under investment caution? There’s no fixed timeline. The designation remains until the exchange determines risks have been adequately addressed or escalates to more severe actions like trading suspensions. Should I sell my MYRO because of this warning? That depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. The warning suggests increased risk, but doesn’t guarantee the project will fail. Conduct your own research and consider your personal financial situation. Can a project recover from an investment caution designation? Yes, if the project addresses the exchange’s concerns—such as revitalizing community engagement or demonstrating improved sustainability—the designation can be removed. Found this analysis helpful?

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.4559 Market cap $486.82M Trading volume (24-hour) $15.92M Circulating supply 1.068B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.4899 24-hour low $0.4545 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.07% (Medium) 50-day SMA $0.5365 14-Day RSI 38.32 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.6909 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is trading below key moving averages, confirming bearish control. Momentum indicators show no bullish divergence yet, limiting bounce potential. If XTZ falls below $0.455, we might see further dips toward $0.43 before buyers reappear. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for December 16, $XTZ has decisively slipped below its mid-range support and is now pressing the lower Bollinger Band around $0.458–$0.455, signaling expanding downside volatility rather than a controlled pullback. The price is firmly below the 20-day SMA, currently near $0.488, which has flipped into dynamic resistance and confirms that the prior consolidation phase has resolved to the downside. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The latest daily candles show consecutive lower closes with weak intraday rebounds, indicating sellers are in control and buyers are failing to defend higher lows. The RSI sits near 36, hovering just above oversold territory, which suggests bearish momentum remains dominant with room for further downside before any technical relief bounce becomes statistically compelling. The MACD is marginally negative and flattening, but not yet curling up, implying downside pressure is slowing slightly rather than reversing. As long as $0.455 fails to reclaim quickly, the daily structure opens risk toward the $0.43–$0.44 zone, while any bounce into $0.488–$0.50 is likely to be sold. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart reinforces the bearish daily narrative, with price trading cleanly below the Alligator averages, which are now fully fanned downward, confirming a trending bearish phase rather than a range. Successive lower highs have capped price beneath $0.48, while the breakdown from $0.47 accelerated sell-side momentum into the $0.455 region. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD is deeply negative with widening red histogram bars, signaling strengthening downside momentum on the intraday level, not divergence. Likewise, the OBV continues to trend lower, confirming that this move is supported by distribution rather than thin liquidity noise. The absence of meaningful bullish divergence on either the MACD or OBV suggests that any short-term bounce would likely be corrective unless the price can reclaim at least $0.48 with accompanying volume. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5804 SELL SMA 5 $0.5646 SELL SMA 10 $0.5467 SELL SMA 21 $0.5192 SELL SMA 50 $0.5365 SELL SMA 100 $0.6077 SELL SMA 200 $0.6909 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5128 SELL EMA 5 $0.5369 SELL EMA 10 $0.5910 SELL EMA 21 $0.6644 SELL EMA 50 $0.7178 SELL EMA 100 $0.7141 SELL EMA 200 $0.7315 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? On both price charts, $XTZ remains vulnerable to a continuation of its downward trend. A brief oversold reaction toward $0.47 is possible, but unless price reclaims and holds above $0.49, rallies are likely to be corrective. Failure to defend $0.455 increases the probability of a deeper sweep into the $0.43–$0.44 demand zone. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Starting December 18th at 9:00 AM UTC, Bithumb will temporarily suspend all deposits and withdrawals for the INJ token. This Bithumb INJ suspension is a planned measure to facilitate a necessary network upgrade on the Injective protocol. While temporary service halts can cause concern, they are often essential for enhancing security, scalability, and overall network performance. This article breaks down everything you need to know about this scheduled maintenance. Why is Bithumb Suspending INJ Transactions? The primary reason for this Bithumb INJ suspension is a scheduled network upgrade on the Injective blockchain. Exchanges like Bithumb proactively halt deposits and withdrawals during such events to protect user funds. This precaution prevents potential transaction errors or losses that could occur if the network state changes mid-transfer. Therefore, this suspension is a standard security practice, not a reaction to any problem. Network upgrades are common in the crypto space. They introduce new features, improve efficiency, and fix bugs. For the Injective network, this upgrade could involve enhancements to its decentralized exchange infrastructure or its cross-chain capabilities. Bithumb’s action ensures a smooth transition for its users once the upgrade is complete. What Does This Mean for Your INJ Holdings? Understanding the scope of this Bithumb INJ suspension is key to managing your assets. Here is a clear breakdown of what is and isn’t affected: Deposits & Withdrawals (Suspended): You cannot send INJ to your Bithumb wallet from an external address, nor can you withdraw INJ from Bithumb to a private wallet. Trading (Likely Unaffected): The suspension typically applies only to moving tokens on and off the exchange. Spot trading of INJ against other cryptocurrencies like KRW or BTC on Bithumb’s internal order book will probably continue as normal. Existing Holdings (Safe): The INJ tokens already in your Bithumb spot wallet remain secure and under your account ownership. The suspension is a functional pause, not a freeze on assets. However, it’s wise to plan ahead. If you need to move INJ for a time-sensitive transaction, such as providing liquidity or participating in a governance vote on the Injective network, you must complete your withdrawal before the 9:00 AM UTC deadline on December 18th. How to Navigate the Suspension Period Staying informed is your best strategy. Mark the start time in your calendar and monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for updates on when services will resume. Exchanges usually provide completion notices through their website and social media channels. Furthermore, use this time to review your overall strategy. Is your portfolio diversified? Are you using secure storage practices? Temporary events like this Bithumb INJ suspension highlight the importance of understanding exchange mechanics and having a plan for different market scenarios. Conclusion: A Routine Step for a Better Network In summary, the temporary Bithumb INJ suspension is a standard, precautionary measure tied to a scheduled Injective network upgrade. It demonstrates Bithumb’s commitment to operational security and a smooth user experience. While it requires some advance planning from traders, such upgrades are ultimately positive, aiming to deliver a more robust and feature-rich blockchain. By understanding the reasons and scope of the halt, you can navigate this brief period with confidence and look forward to the enhanced capabilities it will unlock for the Injective ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still buy or sell INJ on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Most likely, yes. The suspension typically applies only to deposits and withdrawals from external wallets. Trading INJ against other pairs on the exchange’s internal market often continues uninterrupted. Q2: How long will the INJ deposit and withdrawal suspension last? A2: Bithumb has announced the start time but not a specific end time. The duration depends on the complexity of the Injective network upgrade. Monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my INJ tokens safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. Your existing INJ holdings in your Bithumb wallet are not frozen or at risk due to this operational pause. The suspension is a preventive measure for transaction integrity during the upgrade. Q4: What happens if I send INJ to my Bithumb address during the suspension? A4: It is strongly advised not to do this. Transactions sent during the suspension may not be credited automatically and could be lost or require manual recovery by support, which can be a lengthy process. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend INJ services? A5: Possibly. Other exchanges supporting INJ may enact similar temporary suspensions if they are also integrating the network upgrade. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. Q6: Where can I get official updates on this situation? A6: For the most accurate and timely information, refer to Bithumb’s official website announcement page and their verified social media channels.

You’re not alone. The recent volatility has left many investors wondering when the sun will shine again on digital assets. According to prominent crypto analyst Mignolet, the path to a sustained crypto market recovery requires one crucial ingredient most overlook: time. Let’s unpack his sobering yet vital analysis. Is the Traditional Bitcoin Cycle Really Over? Mignolet cuts through the noise on X, addressing a core debate. Many claim Bitcoin’s famous four-year cycle, tied to its halving events, is a relic of the past. However, he presents a compelling counterpoint. Despite the monumental arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs—a game-changer for institutional access—the market’s recent behavior still echoes that familiar rhythmic pattern. This suggests old forces are still at play, complicating the timeline for a true crypto market recovery . How Are ETFs Changing the Game? The introduction of ETFs is the biggest new variable. These funds bring massive, steady capital flows that could theoretically smooth out volatility and create new cycles. Mignolet acknowledges this but urges caution. If we are in a transition period between the old cycle and a new, ETF-driven one, the market enters uncharted territory. This means: Unpredictable Movements: The path upward may not be straight, and corrections could be sharp. New Triggers: Recovery may depend more on traditional finance metrics like ETF inflows rather than just retail sentiment. A Test of Patience: Investors used to quick, parabolic rallies might need to adjust their expectations. What Does This Mean for Your Strategy? If a swift crypto market recovery is unlikely, what should you do? First, manage expectations. An uptrend will be difficult and choppy. This isn’t a reason for despair, but for strategic refinement. Consider dollar-cost averaging to navigate volatility instead of trying to time the perfect bottom. Furthermore, use this time for research. Projects with strong fundamentals are more likely to lead the eventual crypto market recovery . Navigating the Path Forward The key takeaway is perspective. Mignolet’s analysis isn’t a prediction of doom, but a call for realism. Markets need time to absorb new structures like ETFs and find a new equilibrium. This period of consolidation lays the groundwork for a healthier, more sustainable advance. Therefore, resilience and a long-term view become your greatest allies in waiting for a genuine crypto market recovery . In conclusion, the road to a full crypto market recovery is more of a marathon than a sprint. While ETFs have rewritten some rules, historical cycles and new uncertainties suggest patience is paramount. By understanding these complex dynamics, you can build a strategy that withstands volatility and positions you for the next bull phase. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did analyst Mignolet say about the crypto market? A1: Mignolet stated that the cryptocurrency market will need significant time to recover and that achieving a sustained uptrend will be difficult, even with the influence of Bitcoin ETFs. Q2: Is Bitcoin’s four-year cycle finished according to this analysis? A2: Mignolet believes the previous bull cycle has ended. He notes that while ETFs are a major new factor, recent price action still followed the traditional four-year pattern, suggesting its influence isn’t completely gone. Q3: How do Bitcoin ETFs affect the market cycle? A3: ETFs bring large-scale institutional investment, which could create a new type of market cycle. However, if the market is transitioning between the old cycle and a new ETF-driven one, it could lead to more unpredictable price movements. Q4: Should I sell my crypto if recovery will take time? A4: Not necessarily. “Time to recover” doesn’t mean prices will only go down. It emphasizes volatility and consolidation. A long-term strategy like dollar-cost averaging can be more effective than trying to sell at a perceived bottom. Q5: What is the most important action for investors now? A5: The key is to manage expectations and practice patience. Use this period to research strong projects, consider steady accumulation, and avoid emotional decisions based on short-term price swings.

There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $89,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Any more gains might send the price toward the $90,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $91,000 and $91,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $87,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $85,500 level. The first major support is near the $85,000 level. The next support is now near the $83,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $82,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $80,000, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $85,500, followed by $85,000.

SBI Holdings and Startale Group plan to release the stablecoin in the second quarter of 2026. The partnership brings together SBI’s standing as a key player in Japan’s financial sector with Startale’s background in Web3 technology. Startale helped build the Soneium network, which has backing from Sony. “The transition to a ‘token economy’ is now an irreversible societal trend,” said Yoshitaka Kitao, Chairman and President of SBI Holdings. “By circulating it both domestically and globally, we aim to dramatically accelerate the movement toward providing digital financial services that are fully integrated with traditional finance.” The stablecoin has not been named yet. Both companies say it will be fully regulated and designed for worldwide settlement and use by institutions. Shinsei Trust & Banking, which operates under SBI Shinsei Bank, will manage the creation and redemption of the digital currency. SBI VC Trade, a licensed crypto exchange service provider, will handle its circulation. Startale recently put out its own stablecoin called Startale USD (USDSC) This dollar-based digital currency works for payments, rewards, and liquidity on Soneium. The new yen stablecoin and USDSC will work together as a “complementary currency stack” for a planned 24/7 tokenized stock exchange that Startale and SBI are building. “Our yen-denominated stablecoin is not just a means of everyday payment – it will play a central role in a fully on-chain world,” said Sota Watanabe, CEO of Startale. “In particular, we see enormous potential in enabling payments between AI agents and powering distributions for tokenized assets, both of which will soon become reality.” This is not SBI’s first time working with stablecoins. In August, the company said it partnered with Ripple to bring Ripple USD (RLUSD) to Japan in 2026. The project fits with efforts happening across Japan to build up a yen stablecoin market. Japan’s Financial Services Agency recently approved JPYC as the country’s first yen stablecoin. The agency also supports a joint stablecoin project from three major banks: Mizuho Bank, MUFG, and SMBC. Many other big financial companies in Japan are moving into the yen stablecoin space The Financial Services Agency recently approved a pilot program for a yen-backed stablecoin that includes three of Japan’s largest banking groups: Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui, and Mizuho. A person working in Japan’s crypto industry , who spoke to DL News without giving their name, said several other large financial groups are also preparing to issue yen stablecoins. SBI and Startale have signed a memorandum of understanding for their coin. They say it will “operate as a global settlement currency” and work as money in the tokenized real-world assets space. Real-world assets, or RWAs, are mostly physical items like real estate and art whose ownership gets divided up and traded on blockchain networks. The companies said they will finish “all necessary compliance” steps before launching. They said they “aim to offer a yen-denominated alternative in a stablecoin market now exceeding $300 billion in circulating supply and processing trillions of dollars in on-chain transactions annually.” They pointed out that this market remains “heavily concentrated in US dollar assets.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|SBI Holdings|Soneium|Sony|Startale Group,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-16 02:50:26

This move signals a potential seismic shift in how privacy-focused crypto tools are treated under U.S. law and follows Trump’s history of intervening in high-profile crypto cases. What Exactly Is the Samourai Wallet Case? Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill received prison sentences of five and four years respectively in November. Authorities charged them with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Their privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet offered features that law enforcement argued could facilitate money laundering, while supporters maintained it protected user financial privacy. The case has become a flashpoint in the broader debate about: Financial privacy rights in the digital age Regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency developers The legal boundaries of privacy-enhancing technologies Why Would Trump Review the Samourai Wallet Situation? Trump’s statement during a White House press conference reveals his growing engagement with cryptocurrency legal matters. When asked about the Samourai Wallet case, he responded that he had “heard about the matter” and would “look into it.” This isn’t his first intervention in crypto-related legal cases. Previously, Trump has granted: A pardon to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao Commutations for Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht These actions suggest Trump views some cryptocurrency prosecutions as overly aggressive or politically motivated. His willingness to review the Samourai Wallet case could signal a more lenient approach toward privacy-focused crypto tools if he returns to office. What Does This Mean for Crypto Privacy Tools? The potential review of the Samourai Wallet case carries significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Privacy-enhancing technologies face increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide, with developers often caught between innovation and compliance. Key questions emerging from this development include: Will other privacy wallet developers face similar legal challenges? How might this affect innovation in cryptocurrency privacy features? What precedent would a presidential review establish for future cases? Moreover, this situation highlights the ongoing tension between financial surveillance and individual privacy rights. As governments worldwide increase their monitoring capabilities, tools like Samourai Wallet that offer enhanced privacy become both more valuable and more controversial. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Developers For those involved in cryptocurrency, Trump’s announcement offers several important lessons: Legal landscape awareness: Stay informed about regulatory developments affecting privacy tools Compliance considerations: Understand the legal requirements for money transmission services Political engagement: Recognize how election outcomes can impact cryptocurrency enforcement Risk assessment: Evaluate the legal risks associated with using or developing privacy-focused tools The cryptocurrency community should monitor this situation closely, as the outcome could influence regulatory approaches for years to come. Whether Trump’s review leads to pardons, commutations, or simply increased attention, the Samourai Wallet case has become a symbol of the broader struggle between innovation and regulation in digital finance. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Privacy Trump’s decision to review the Samourai Wallet case represents more than just another legal proceeding—it’s a potential turning point for how privacy-focused cryptocurrency tools are treated under U.S. law. The outcome could either chill innovation in financial privacy technologies or establish a precedent for more balanced regulation. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to mature, cases like this will increasingly define the boundaries of acceptable innovation. The Samourai Wallet review reminds us that in the world of digital finance, legal decisions often carry as much weight as technological breakthroughs. Frequently Asked Questions What is Samourai Wallet? Samourai Wallet is a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet that offers enhanced anonymity features, including coin mixing and transaction obfuscation tools designed to protect user financial privacy. Why were the Samourai Wallet founders sentenced? Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill received prison sentences for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Prosecutors argued their wallet facilitated illegal transactions, while supporters maintained they were simply providing privacy tools. Has Trump intervened in crypto cases before? Yes, Trump has previously pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and commuted the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, indicating his interest in cryptocurrency-related legal matters. What could happen if Trump reviews the case? Possible outcomes include pardons, sentence commutations, or simply bringing increased public attention to what supporters view as an overly aggressive prosecution of privacy tool developers. How does this affect other privacy crypto tools? The review’s outcome could set a precedent for how regulators approach similar privacy-enhancing technologies, potentially influencing future enforcement actions and developer innovation. When might we learn the outcome of the review? There’s no specific timeline announced, but such reviews typically take weeks or months, depending on the complexity of the case and the administration’s priorities. Found this analysis insightful?

According to reports, the network had a market cap of $5 billion as of Dec. 6, and it still draws attention because people know the name. That visibility, however, does not settle the debate over whether the token belongs in a long-term portfolio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $200 Trillion? CEO Makes Bold Prediction Shiba Inu’s Price And Market Size Based on reports, Shiba Inu has seen massive moves over several years. Roughly five years ago it traded near $0.0000000001684; at the time of writing, it is quoted at about $0.000008439. SHIB’s all-time high stands at $0.00008845, which means the token trades roughly 85% below that peak. Reports have disclosed that SHIB has tanked about 55% so far this year, and some data points show almost a 60% decline over a recent 12-month span. Those drops have pushed many investors to ask whether the story that once lifted SHIB has faded. On-Chain Signals And Holder Counts There are mixed signals on the chain. Data from CryptoQuant is reported to show memecoin dominance falling to its lowest level since early 2024, a sign that speculative interest across similar tokens has ebbed. At the same time, the number of wallets holding SHIB moved from about 1.45 million at the start of the year to around 1.52 million more recently. That jump in holders was noted alongside the price slide. It suggests distribution rather than complete abandonment; small increases in holders do not always mean increased trading activity, but they can show steady retail interest. Memecoin markets are dead. pic.twitter.com/6kymLWH4JX — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 11, 2025 Pundit Views And The Utility Question Meanwhile, crypto pundit Neil Patel has listed reasons he would not treat Shiba Inu as a proper investment. He argues the memecoin doesn’t solve a clear, large-scale problem and points out that developer activity for SHIB is limited compared with many other networks. The claim is that much of SHIB’s value has been driven by hype cycles and not by broad real-world use. Those views were presented in firm terms, and they have been repeated across a range of commentaries that warn about hype-driven tokens.

Tether Fails To Acquire Premier Italian Football Club Juventus On Friday, Tether announced that it had submitted a proposal to acquire Juventus , one of the biggest football brands in the world. The stablecoin firm had previously acquired a 10% minority stake in the club, and with this new plan, it had intended to execute a full buyout. The first stage had included a proposal to Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family and majority stakeholder of Juventus. According to Reuters , Tether had offered the firm 2.66 euros per share, a notable premium above the then closing price of 2.19 euros. In a press release , Exor has responded to Tether, saying that its board has unanimously rejected the bid for its 65.4% controlling stake in Juventus. “Exor reaffirms its previous, consistent statements that it has no intention of selling any of its shares in Juventus to a third party, including but not restricted to El Salvador-based Tether,” noted the company. Founded in 1897, Juventus has established itself as one of the biggest football clubs globally, with a particularly memorable period of success coming during the 2010s, in which it won nine consecutive titles in the Serie A, the first division of Italian football. With Exor turning down the deal, the USDT issuer will have to reconsider its approach to the club popularly dubbed as The Old Lady. So far, Tether hasn’t issued any statements in answer. In the original announcement, Tether had announced that if the firm is able to acquire Exor’s stake, it will move to acquire the remaining shares of the club through a public tender offer at the same share price. This would put the total valuation of Juventus at about $1.17 billion. Tether had also noted that in the event that the transaction is completed, it will also be prepared to invest 1 billion euros in the football club. “Tether is in a position of strong financial health and intends to support Juventus with stable capital and a long horizon,” said CEO Paolo Ardoino. While The Old Lady enjoyed a strong period in the last decade, the 2020s haven’t been as kind. Since the 2019-20 season title win, Juventus hasn’t come close to becoming the Italian champion, with its best finish being third place during the 2023-24 season. Juventus also became part of a financial scandal in 2023, with Serie A punishing it with a 10-point deduction for false accounting. Thus, Tether’s interest has arrived when the club has been in a bit of a slump. USDT, Tether’s stablecoin, has been experiencing growth recently, with its market cap hitting a new record of $186.23 billion, according to data from DefiLlama .

Indexes in Japan dipped, while Australian shares edged higher, after the S&P 500 fell for a second straight session overnight. Futures linked to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were weaker in early Asian trading, signalling more pressure on Wall Street as traders wait for clues on growth, inflation and the Federal Reserve’s path. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $85,719, down 4.1% Ether : $2,930, down 6.1% XRP : $1.87, down 6.2% Total crypto market cap: $3.02 trillion, down 3.7% Analysts See Bitcoin Laying Foundations For A 2026 Return To Record Highs Despite the pullback, some crypto analysts remain upbeat on the medium term. Bitfinex’s research team expects the coming year to be defined by improving global liquidity conditions that will make Bitcoin “more solid than ever.” They argue that the groundwork is being laid for BTC to regain its all-time high near $126,110 in 2026, supported by looser monetary policy, rising liquidity and steady crypto adoption. Bitfinex also points to a changing market structure. With annual Bitcoin issuance now below 1%, they say the halving’s marginal impact has faded and recent drawdowns have been materially shallower, as flows from exchange traded funds, corporates and sovereign linked entities absorb multiples of yearly mined supply. In their view, that shift has created a market dominated by patient, long-term capital. Not everyone is in a rush to add risk. Lin Tran, senior market analyst at XS.com, said Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the psychological $90,000 level after being rejected near $100,000 shows a cautious tone is still in charge. According to Tran, investors are trimming exposure into year end and prioritising capital preservation after a powerful rally earlier in the cycle. Risk Appetite Pauses As Investors Look For Clarity From Upcoming Indicators In traditional markets, the yen strengthened against the dollar to around 154.85, as traders position for the Bank of Japan to lift its key rate to the highest level in three decades on Friday. A measure of the dollar slipped for a second day, trading near levels last seen in early October, as investors leaned into expectations of further easing from the Fed over the medium term. The broader backdrop is one of nervous consolidation into a heavy data week. Following the Fed’s latest rate cut, the November jobs report due Tuesday is expected to show a soft labour market and will include an updated estimate for October payrolls, which were delayed by the federal shutdown. The US consumer price index is scheduled for Thursday, alongside figures on retail sales, business activity and inflation that could challenge or reinforce the current narrative. Officials Split On Whether Current Fed Stance Is Appropriate For 2026 Fed officials have sent mixed signals. Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued that the current stance is unnecessarily restrictive, while New York Fed President John Williams said policy is “well positioned” for next year after last week’s move. Boston Fed President Susan Collins described the latest decision as a “close call,” noting she remains concerned about elevated inflation. In Japan, investors are watching the tug of war between the government’s need for cheap financing and the pressure from a weak yen that is pushing up import costs. Benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yields touched 1.97% earlier this month, the highest in 18 years, prompting Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda to warn that yields are rising “somewhat fast.” Back in the US, some strategists caution that data quality may be patchy after the Bureau of Labor Statistics played catch up following the shutdown. Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets says that backdrop could encourage a cautious reaction to this week’s prints, but if market expectations prove broadly correct it may set up another strong stretch for Treasuries, which are already on track for their best year since 2020. Wall Street closed lower on Monday as traders digested the Fed chatter and braced for the incoming numbers. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged their steepest daily declines in more than three weeks on Friday amid concern over inflation and debt fuelled AI investments, leaving both equity and crypto markets sensitive to any surprise in the data.
