For cryptocurrency investors watching monetary policy closely, this development signals potential turbulence ahead for traditional markets that often ripple through digital asset valuations. Why Are Fed Chair Odds Suddenly Changing? According to CNBC reports, Kevin Hassett is no longer the clear frontrunner to lead the Federal Reserve. The White House National Economic Council director previously enjoyed overwhelming support, but concerns about the Fed’s independence have changed the calculus. Multiple sources indicate that presidential aides worry about Hassett’s close relationship with Donald Trump potentially compromising the central bank’s autonomy. This matters because the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates directly influence market liquidity, inflation expectations, and investment flows across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. When traders lose confidence in central bank independence, volatility typically increases. How Could This Affect Financial Markets? The bond market reaction represents the most immediate concern. Analysts project potential long-term negative responses if markets perceive the next Fed chair as overly political. Specifically: Interest rate uncertainty: Markets might anticipate more aggressive rate hikes depending on the nominee’s approach to inflation Dollar volatility: Currency fluctuations could impact cryptocurrency valuations Risk asset re-pricing: Traditional safe havens and alternative assets like Bitcoin often see increased interest during periods of central bank uncertainty Hassett addressed these concerns directly during a recent CBS interview, stating that while the president has clear positions, the Fed makes policy decisions based on data and FOMC consensus, not political views. What Do Prediction Markets Reveal About Fed Chair Odds? The numbers tell a compelling story. Data from decentralized prediction market Kalshi shows Hassett’s nomination probability has plummeted from over 80% earlier this month to just 31%. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh has seen his odds surge to 52%. Prediction markets often provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polls because participants risk real money on their convictions. This dramatic shift suggests informed traders see genuine obstacles to Hassett’s nomination. Why Does Federal Reserve Independence Matter? The Federal Reserve’s credibility depends on its perceived independence from political pressure. When markets believe the central bank will make decisions based on economic data rather than political considerations, several benefits emerge: Stable inflation expectations: Businesses and consumers can plan with confidence Predictable monetary policy: Investors can assess risk more accurately International confidence: Global markets trust the dollar as a reserve currency Cryptocurrency advocates often point to central bank politicization as a key reason for Bitcoin’s existence as an alternative, decentralized monetary system. What Happens Next With Fed Chair Selection? The selection process now enters a more uncertain phase. Several factors will influence the final decision: Market reactions to potential nominees Congressional support for different candidates Economic conditions at the time of nomination Political considerations within the administration For cryptocurrency traders, monitoring these Fed chair odds provides valuable insight into potential monetary policy directions. The Fed’s approach to inflation, interest rates, and quantitative easing all significantly impact digital asset valuations. Key Takeaways for Investors The shifting Fed chair odds highlight several important considerations: Central bank independence remains crucial for market stability Political relationships can significantly impact appointment probabilities Prediction markets offer real-time insights into likely outcomes Monetary policy uncertainty often increases interest in alternative assets As the selection process continues, watch for further developments in Fed chair odds and corresponding market reactions. The ultimate nominee will shape monetary policy for years, affecting everything from mortgage rates to cryptocurrency valuations. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Kevin Hassett’s Fed chair odds drop so suddenly? Concerns emerged among presidential aides that Hassett’s close relationship with Donald Trump could compromise Federal Reserve independence. This political consideration changed the nomination calculus dramatically. How do prediction markets calculate Fed chair odds? Platforms like Kalshi allow users to trade contracts based on event outcomes. Prices reflect the market’s collective probability assessment, with participants risking real money on their predictions. Why does Federal Reserve independence matter for cryptocurrencies? When traditional central banks face credibility issues, some investors seek alternatives like cryptocurrencies. Perceived politicization of monetary policy can increase interest in decentralized digital assets. Who is currently favored in Fed chair odds? Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh now leads with 52% probability according to Kalshi data, while Kevin Hassett has fallen to 31%. How quickly could a new Fed chair be appointed? The nomination and confirmation process typically takes several months, but timing depends on political factors and congressional schedules. What should cryptocurrency investors watch regarding Fed chair odds? Monitor market reactions to different candidates, particularly regarding their views on inflation, digital currencies, and financial innovation. These positions could significantly impact crypto regulation and adoption. Found this analysis of shifting Fed chair odds helpful?

Bitcoin price prediction now points to a potential sweep of the $80,000 lows before a bullish reversal toward $100,000. On-Chain Data Shows $81K as Critical Support Data from Glassnode reveals Bitcoin’s True Market Mean, the average on-chain purchase price held by active market participants, stands near $81,000, serving as strong support during today’s 3.6% decline that sent prices below $86,000. Bitcoin's True Market Mean—the average on-chain purchase price of Bitcoin held by active participants—stood near $81K as strong support during the last drawdown. Bitcoin first broke above it in October 2023 and hasn't traded below since. pic.twitter.com/2Wz1EWPzIi — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) December 15, 2025 Crypto analyst Darkfost observed that inflows to Binance from “wholecoiners” (transactions exceeding 1 BTC) are collapsing compared to previous years. The yearly average now sits around 6,500 BTC, a level not seen since 2018. “What is particularly interesting is the trend these inflows have followed during this cycle compared to past ones. Instead of increasing as they did previously, wholecoiner inflows to Binance have steadily declined, even as Bitcoin continued pushing higher,” Darkfost explained. BTC demand on spot orderbooks currently sits at elevated levels, from $85,000 down to $80,000, suggesting continued downward pressure on the asset. However, analyst Ted Pillows reveals that defending the $81,000 support could enable Bitcoin to target the next major resistance zone around $92,000-$94,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Bearish Momentum Cooling Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays clear momentum deterioration after failing to maintain above the $100,000 psychological resistance, which now represents the key threshold required to resume a sustained uptrend. Price has since reversed and trades in the mid-$80,000 region, with sellers driving it toward a critical support band around $81,000. The RSI has dropped into the mid-30s, indicating growing bearish pressure, but approaches levels where downside momentum typically begins slowing. Source: TradingView If the $81,000 support maintains, the chart favors a short-term relief rally toward the $90,000–$95,000 region, with a larger move back toward $100,000 only probable if buyers reclaim that level on strong volume. However, a decisive weekly close below $81,000 would bring the final bull-market structure support near $76,000 into focus, and losing that level would significantly increase the risk of a deeper corrective phase. Pepenode Offers Investors 553% APY Ahead of 2026 Bull Run If Bitcoin finally breaks the $100,000 level and starts climbing again, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see another explosive rally.

Over 1 trillion SHIB tokens , worth more than $8 million , were moved to exchanges in just 24 hours last week, raising questions about what’s coming next for the Shiba Inu price prediction . Data from Santiment shows large holders are positioning for a possible sell-off, a move that often signals rising selling pressure. Shiba Inu has seen the highest amount of whale transfers since June 6th today, happening in tandem with a +1.06T net change to the amount of $SHIB on exchanges. The #24 market cap in crypto is likely to see high volatility in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/64slL6tGVw — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 9, 2025 While not always the start of a crash, these kinds of inflows tend to confirm the current trend, which, in SHIB’s case, is still heading lower. Over the past 30 days, SHIB has dropped 9.4% , and since the beginning of the year, it has lost 61% , as traders continue to rotate out of meme coins. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Despite Bearish News, SHIB Looks Bullish Shiba Inu recently bounced from support at $0.0000077 , but selling pressure returned quickly as it approached the $0.0000095 resistance zone. A descending price channel has been in play for months, and SHIB now looks set to retest the $0.0000077 level again, pointing to a possible 6% downside in the short term. Still, a potential reversal is on the table. If SHIB forms a double bottom at this level, it could spark a bounce toward the top of the channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also flashing a bullish divergence , showing rising momentum even as price trends lower, a classic sign that a local bottom may be forming. As meme coins begin showing early signs of strength, one new presale is standing out. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is capturing the spirit of Dogecoin’s early days and turning it into a fresh new meme coin where holders can share early opportunities and trading setups.

Still, historical patterns support a bullish XRP price prediction , and here’s why. Popular trader Steph is Crypto recently shared a chart showing a clear similarity to XRP’s 2017 accumulation phase, when the token was trading at just $0.25 . What followed was a massive rally that sent XRP to its all-time high within a year, and some believe the setup today could lead to something similar. $XRP is about to explode, just like it did in 2017. Buckle up! pic.twitter.com/hTISvgpa0q — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 14, 2025 Steph identified a similar accumulation pattern forming this year, right after XRP broke above the $1.70 level. Back in January 2018, XRP reached $3.84 , delivering a massive 1,440% gain for those who bought during the last major accumulation phase. XRP Price Prediction: Move Above $2.20 Could Set Things in Motion Looking at the daily chart, XRP has formed a falling wedge over the past few months, resulting from the sharp decline over the past few months. Source: TradingView The price has now compressed around the $2 mark, making this a key level to watch closely in the coming days. A breakout above $2.20 could flip the script entirely, invalidating the current bearish structure and potentially kicking off XRP’s next major move. If that happens, the first target in this time frame would be the 200-day EMA at $2.44 , offering a quick 20% upside , with a larger move toward $3 likely to follow. Should momentum continue building, the bold prediction shared by Steph is Crypto could start to play out in the months ahead, especially as crypto adoption continues to accelerate. Just like XRP, early-stage presales are starting to gain attention, and few stand out more than Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) .

This follows the wallet’s ongoing transition into a true multichain platform, after previously adding support for other blockchains, including Solana and various EVM networks. The update generates native Bitcoin addresses for users, supports SegWit transactions, and will add Taproot compatibility in a future release. Users can purchase Bitcoin via credit card, Apple Pay, PayPal , or bank transfers, and swap BTC with other supported assets directly in the wallet. MetaMask expands beyond Ethereum with native Bitcoin support and incentives MetaMask’s transition from an Ethereum-only wallet to a multichain platform occurred nearly a year after the wallet first announced it would introduce support for Bitcoin, marking the beginning of its expansion beyond Ethereum. The Bitcoin integration enables users to hold and transact the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, eliminating the need for wrapped tokens or third-party wallets. “We’re excited to announce that Bitcoin is now supported on MetaMask. This means you can trade and manage BTC alongside Ethereum, Solana, Monad, and Sei assets, all inside your MetaMask wallet,” a statement from the company reads. The network expansion comes amid a flurry of recent feature enhancements, as it seeks to stay near the top of a competitive wallet landscape. Just a few months ago, the wallet launched its own stablecoin, mUSD, on Ethereum and the layer-2 scaling network, Linea. Then, in October, it unveiled native support for swaps on Hyperliquid, allowing traders to easily place long or short bets on the popular Perps DEX. Earlier this month, MetaMask rolled out a native Polymarket integration, enabling users to place predictions on sports, crypto, and politics directly within the wallet. Users can now also trade Bitcoin after updating to the latest version of MetaMask. Those who swap into BTC will earn MetaMask reward points as part of a $30 million community rewards program, designed to support long-term engagement ahead of the wallet’s native token launch. Following the rollout of Bitcoin, MetaMask plans to add more networks in 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $86,332.54. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has fallen 3.2% over the last 24 hours. It’s 32% off its record high of more than $126,000 reached in early October. Major cryptocurrencies fell during U.S. morning hours Monday, continuing a now crystal-clear pattern of relatively poor performance while American stocks trade. Bitcoin’s underperformance during U.S. trading hours initially suggests weak demand from American investors, although the structure of spot Bitcoin ETFs, launched in January 2024, may also be influencing activity. “Since the iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT began trading, had you only owned it after hours (buy the close, sell the next open), it’s up 222%,” Bespoke Investment said in an X post. “Had you only owned intraday (buy the open, sell the close), it’s down 40.5%.” Crypto stocks also began the week significantly lower, with both Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRCL) down about 7%. Coinbase (COIN) dropped by more than 5%, while trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and eToro (ETOR) experienced smaller declines of approximately 2%. Brokerage Gemini (GEMI), which soared late last week on approval for adding prediction markets to its offerings, pulled back 10% Monday. MetaMask’s Bitcoin integration drives on-chain growth Industry observers view the integration as a significant convenience boost, expected to generate higher on-chain activity and extend MetaMask’s reach into additional market segments, including both institutional and retail users. The competition could apply pressure to offer multichain offerings to match MetaMask’s rising ecosystem. Although Bitcoin offers a different level of investment benefit, some experts argue that multichain wallets introduce increased security and operational complexities; they emphasize the importance of keeping wallets updated and safeguarding private keys and recovery phrases. Now, as Bitcoin is native to MetaMask, the wallet presents itself as a central hub for a range of digital assets for users online, as well as within the Web3 ecosystem, while also pushing the boundaries of cross-chain interoperability.

However, the price remains firmly capped by a descending trendline and structural resistance around the $3,400 level. While buyers defend the vital $2,905 low, the trend remains sideways until ETH can achieve a decisive close above the descending resistance to initiate the next major rally. ETH Attempts To Stabilize After The Selloff According to a daily update from CyrilXBT, Ethereum is attempting to form a base following its recent selloff, but the price remains capped below the 50-day EMA around $3,281. This level continues to act as a key barrier, keeping ETH from confirming a stronger recovery for now. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Drifts Lower—Is $3,000 About to Be the Battleground? At the time of the update, ETH was trading near $3,131. On the downside, initial support sits around $3,050, while a broader demand zone between $2,750 and $2,900 remains the more significant area where buyers are expected to step in if selling pressure returns. On the upside, resistance is concentrated between $3,280 and $3,300, aligning closely with the 50-day EMA, which represents a clear “prove-it” level. Looking ahead, a clean break and sustained hold above $3,300 could open the door for a move back toward the $3,500 area and beyond. However, failure to reclaim this resistance would likely lead to choppy price action, with a possible retest of the $3,000 level and even a revisit of the $2,800 zone. Ethereum Trades Below Descending Trendline Resistance Crypto analyst Kamile Uray revealed that ETH is currently confined, moving persistently under a blue descending trendline. This trendline is acting as a significant diagonal resistance barrier, limiting the extent of ETH’s bullish bounces and keeping the short-term pressure tilted downward. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Cooling Off: Healthy Consolidation or Momentum Fading? Despite this overhead resistance, the analyst identified a critical support structure. Uray noted that the possibility of the upward movement continuing remains valid as long as the price stays above the rising black trendline and above the low established at $2,905. This confluence of support is crucial for maintaining the market’s current bullish bias. If the blue descending trendline resistance is decisively broken, the subsequent rally is expected to target a series of higher resistance levels: $3,661, then $3,878, and finally $4,292. Kamile Uray synthesized the condition for the breakout, stating that the descending trendline will approximately be broken if ETH manages to achieve a daily close above the $3,400 level. Meanwhile, the key condition for expecting a continued upward movement is a close above $3,400 combined with the price successfully avoiding a close below the critical $2,905 low.

55847604,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92415,1765843236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Michael Saylor’s 2045 Bitcoin Projection: What It Means for XRP Price,https://timestabloid.com/michael-saylors-2045-bitcoin-projection-what-it-means-for-xrp-price/,"As digital asset markets remain under pressure from macroeconomic influence, investor attention is increasingly shifting toward long-term valuation scenarios. One discussion gaining traction is how alternative cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP, could perform if Bitcoin achieves the ambitious long-range forecast put forward by Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor. Market expectations earlier in the cycle leaned heavily toward a near-term surge across crypto assets. However, tightening financial conditions and reduced risk appetite have redirected focus toward multi-year growth models rather than short-term price fluctuations. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Thesis Michael Saylor has consistently maintained a highly optimistic view of Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. His confidence is reflected in Strategy’s accumulation strategy, which has made the company the largest known corporate holder of Bitcoin, with over 660,000 BTC. In July 2024, when Bitcoin was trading near $65,000, Saylor presented a long-term bull-case scenario projecting Bitcoin at $49 million per coin by 2045. Since then, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $126,000 in October 2025 before retreating due to macroeconomic pressures. Imagine if Michael Saylor is 100% correct… pic.twitter.com/4bSsyTpZDG — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) September 25, 2025 At current prices near $90,000, Bitcoin would still require an increase of more than 54,000% to reach Saylor’s long-term target. What This Could Mean for XRP Although Saylor’s projection focuses exclusively on Bitcoin, its implications extend to the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s dominance means sustained appreciation often influences capital flows into other major digital assets. XRP has historically shown strong directional alignment with Bitcoin, particularly during periods of market expansion. Over recent months, XRP’s declines have exceeded those of Bitcoin, reinforcing its sensitivity to broader market movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If Bitcoin were to follow a trajectory consistent with Saylor’s forecast, a proportional expansion model suggests XRP could experience substantial long-term appreciation. Based on such assumptions, XRP’s price could theoretically rise from approximately $2 to levels above $1,000 over the coming decades. Supportive and Critical Perspectives Some long-range forecasting platforms align with this view. Changelly, for instance, has projected XRP approaching the $1,100 range by the early 2040s, assuming sustained adoption and expanding use cases. However, this outlook remains highly contested . Critics argue that XRP’s large circulating supply creates significant valuation constraints. At four-digit price levels, XRP’s implied market capitalization would exceed $100 trillion, a figure many analysts consider unrealistic within existing global financial structures. While Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin forecast provides a framework for examining long-term possibilities, XRP’s potential path depends on its own adoption, regulatory clarity, and market structure. High-end projections remain speculative and should be weighed against structural limitations and broader economic realities.

Reports note that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55182, was published by the React team on December 3 and carries a maximum severity rating. Cybersecurity firm Security Alliance (SEAL) has confirmed that multiple crypto websites are actively being targeted, and they urge operators to review all React Server Components immediately to prevent wallet-draining attacks. Security teams say the bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to run code on affected servers, which has been turned into wallet-draining campaigns across several sites. A Wide Risk To Sites Using Server Components SEAL said the flaw affects React Server Components packages in versions 19.0 through 19.2.0, and patched releases such as 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1 were issued after disclosure. Crypto Drainers using React CVE-2025-55182 We are observing a big uptick in drainers uploaded to legitimate (crypto) websites through exploitation of the recent React CVE. All websites should review front-end code for any suspicious assets NOW. — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) December 13, 2025 The vulnerability works by exploiting unsafe deserialization in the Flight protocol, letting a single crafted HTTP request execute arbitrary code with the web server’s privileges. Security teams have warned that many sites using default configurations are at risk until they apply the updates. Attackers Inject Wallet-Draining Scripts Into Compromised Pages According to industry posts, threat actors are using the exploit to plant scripts that prompt users to connect Web3 wallets and then hijack or redirect transactions. In some cases the injected code alters the user interface or swaps addresses, so a user believes they are sending funds to one account while the transaction actually pays an attacker. This method can hit users who trust familiar crypto sites and connect wallets without checking every approval. Scanners And Proof-Of-Concepts Flooded Underground Forums Security researchers report a rush of scanning tools, fake proof-of-concept code, and exploit kits shared in underground forums shortly after the vulnerability was disclosed. Cloud and threat-intelligence teams have observed multiple groups scanning for vulnerable servers and testing payloads, which has accelerated active exploitation. Some defenders say that the speed and volume of scanning have made it hard to stop all attempts before patches are applied. More Than 50 Organizations Reported Compromise Attempts Based on reports from incident responders, post-exploitation crypto activity has been observed at more than 50 organizations across finance, media, government, and tech. In several investigations, attackers established footholds and then used those to deliver further malware or to seed front-end code that targets wallet users. SEAL has emphasized that organizations failing to patch or monitor their servers could experience further attacks, and ongoing monitoring is essential until all systems are verified safe.

Take a deep breath. According to a major new report from asset manager Grayscale, these quantum computing fears are vastly overblown for the immediate future. Their 2026 Digital Asset Market Outlook delivers a crucial dose of clarity, separating long-term research from short-term market reality. Why Are Quantum Computing Fears Surfacing Now? It’s a legitimate question. Quantum computers use principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems traditional computers cannot. In theory, a powerful enough quantum machine could break the cryptographic encryption that secures Bitcoin and other blockchains. This potential has sparked concern among some investors. However, Grayscale’s analysis acts as a reality check, urging the market to focus on tangible, near-term factors instead of distant hypotheticals. What Did Grayscale’s Report Actually Say? The core message is straightforward. While quantum computing poses a recognized long-term challenge, it is unlikely to directly impact crypto price volatility next year . The report highlights two key reasons for this calm assessment: Timeline: A quantum computer capable of threatening Bitcoin’s SHA-256 encryption is not expected before 2030 at the very earliest. Preparation: The cryptographic community is already actively researching and developing “post-quantum” cryptography—new encryption methods that would be secure against quantum attacks. Therefore, the immediate quantum computing fears influencing trader sentiment are misplaced. The market has more pressing concerns, like regulatory developments and adoption rates. Should Investors Ignore Quantum Threats Completely? Absolutely not. The report doesn’t advise ignorance; it advises perspective. Think of it like preparing for a storm forecasted for a decade from now. You acknowledge it, you support the scientists building better shelters (post-quantum crypto), but you don’t sell your house today. The blockchain industry’s proactive stance is a reason for confidence, not panic. This measured view helps stabilize irrational quantum computing fears . What Are the Real Market Drivers for 2025? If quantum isn’t a short-term driver, what should investors watch? Grayscale’s outlook implies focus should remain on: Institutional Adoption: Continued entry of traditional finance firms. Regulatory Clarity: Evolving frameworks from governments worldwide. Technological Upgrades: Scalability and utility improvements on major networks. Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates and global liquidity. These factors will have a far greater influence on your portfolio in the next 12 months than any quantum computing fears . The Bottom Line: A Call for Informed Calm Grayscale’s report serves as an authoritative voice cutting through the noise. It validates the technical concern while decisively placing it on a distant horizon irrelevant to current trading strategies. The key takeaway is reassurance . The crypto ecosystem is aware of the challenge and is not standing still. For the foreseeable future, Bitcoin’s security remains robust, allowing investors and developers to concentrate on building and adopting the technology today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can a quantum computer break Bitcoin tomorrow? A: No. Grayscale and most experts agree a machine powerful enough is likely more than five years away, with 2030 being a common estimate. Q: What is being done to protect Bitcoin from quantum computers? A> Researchers are developing “post-quantum cryptography”—new encryption algorithms. Bitcoin and other blockchains can theoretically adopt these upgrades through community consensus when necessary. Q: Should I sell my crypto because of quantum computing? A> Grayscale’s analysis suggests no. The threat is long-term, and the ecosystem is preparing. Short-term price movements are driven by other factors. Q: Are other assets besides Bitcoin at risk? A> Yes, any digital system relying on current public-key cryptography (like traditional banking infrastructure) could be vulnerable, making this a universal tech challenge, not just a crypto one. Q: Where can I read Grayscale’s full report? A> The “2026 Digital Asset Market Outlook” is typically available on Grayscale’s official website and investor research pages.

The latest data reveals the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to a mere 11, a stark indicator that investor sentiment has entered the “extreme fear” zone. This critical metric, a vital pulse check for the market, suggests traders are navigating one of the most pessimistic environments in recent memory. But what does this extreme reading truly mean for your portfolio? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional thermometer. Created by Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective psychology of cryptocurrency investors on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents paralyzing fear, while 100 signals euphoric greed. The current reading of 11 is alarmingly close to the bottom, indicating widespread panic and risk aversion. This index matters because extreme emotions often precede major market turning points. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes multiple market factors to gauge sentiment objectively. Here’s the breakdown of its components: Market Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trades and volume relative to recent averages. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of crypto discussions online. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Monitors Google search volume for cryptocurrency topics. This multi-source approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view, not just a reaction to price alone. What Does an “Extreme Fear” Reading of 11 Signal for Traders? An index level of 11 is a powerful contrarian signal. Historically, periods of “extreme fear” have often presented buying opportunities for patient, long-term investors. When fear dominates, assets can become undervalued as selling pressure overwhelms the market. However, it can also signal further downside if the fundamental market conditions are weak. Therefore, this is not a simple “buy” signal, but a critical alert to pay close attention. Actionable Insights: Navigating a Market in Extreme Fear Navigating this environment requires a cool head and a clear strategy. First, avoid making impulsive decisions driven by the prevailing panic. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) as a method to build positions gradually, reducing the risk of buying at a single peak. Third, use this time for rigorous research on projects with strong fundamentals. Finally, always ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your personal risk tolerance. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Conclusion: Fear as a Precursor to Opportunity The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 11 is a definitive snapshot of a fearful market. While unsettling, understanding this sentiment gauge empowers you to look beyond the panic. Extreme fear has frequently marked cyclical bottoms, offering strategic entry points. By focusing on data, maintaining discipline, and using tools like this index for perspective, you can make informed decisions even when the market’s emotional temperature is running cold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A> It is not a direct price predictor. It measures sentiment, which is a key market driver. Extreme readings often indicate potential trend reversals, but timing is uncertain. Q: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows “Extreme Fear”? A> It can be a good time to research and consider strategic entries, but it should not be your sole reason for investing. Always conduct your own analysis and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A> The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time view of market sentiment. Q: Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? A> While its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin due to its market dominance, the resulting sentiment reading generally reflects the broader cryptocurrency market. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A> You can view the live index on websites like Alternative.me, which is the primary source for this data.

55848590,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=878962,1765844970,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55848590.jpeg,Ford just abandoned its flagship electric vehicle to lose $19.5 billion,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ford-abandoned-flagship-electric-vehicle/,"Ford is expecting to take a hit of $19.5 billion after scrapping the flagship electric pick-up truck, F-150, along with a range of other larger EVs, to focus on hybrid models. The policy change comes after the Trump administration eliminated federal subsidies for electric car buyers, throwing the industry into uncertainty. Ford executives said they will now put money into manufacturing more conventional trucks and vans, lower-priced electric options, and a new power storage operation aimed at business clients like utility companies. Andrew Frick from Ford said, “Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas.” Ford has its own reasons for the decision. The company said the financial justification for building certain large electric models “has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.” “When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Jim Farley, CEO of Ford, told Reuters. The government pulled the $7,500 tax break for new electric vehicle purchases at the end of September. That move created a rush of buyers in September, but sales dropped 49 percent the following month, according to numbers from Cox Automotive. Other automakers pull back on electric vehicles Ford is not alone in backing away from electric vehicle commitments. General Motors said in October it would take a $1.6 billion hit while cutting back production of battery-powered cars. GM also announced plans to reintroduce the Chevy Bolt with batteries from Chinese manufacturer CATL, despite heavy import taxes on Chinese goods. The financial hit to Ford breaks down as follows: $12.5 billion will be recorded in the final three months of this year as the company reorganizes its electric vehicle operations. This includes $3 billion to close down a battery-making partnership with SK On, a South Korean firm. The remaining charges will be spread out through 2027. Frick said the company is responding to current market realities rather than predictions made years ago. He noted that American buyers are sending a clear message about what they want. While customers appreciate electric vehicle advantages, “they demand affordability, range confidence” and vehicles that work for their daily needs and jobs, he said. Despite the massive writedown, Ford actually improved its financial outlook for the year. The company now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax of $7 billion, higher than the $6 billion to $6.5 billion it projected in October. The Michigan-based manufacturer said that by 2030, roughly half its worldwide sales will come from hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles , and fully electric models. That compares to 25 percent in 2025. Farley had promoted the electric F-150 truck, called the F-150 Lightning, as the “truck of the future” when he unveiled it in 2021. However, the vehicle struggled with rising production costs and poor consumer acceptance. Sales fell 72 percent when comparing November 2025 to the same month in 2024. Ford’s electric vehicle unit, known as Ford e, lost $5.1 billion in 2024 and another $3.6 billion during the first nine months of 2025. The company said its new approach should make the electric division profitable by 2029. With Trump moving to reduce fuel economy requirements for American vehicles, Ford faces less pressure to electrify its lineup to meet government consumption standards. New focus on smaller and cheaper model The next version of the F-150 Lightning will be an extended-range electric vehicle, which means it will have a small gasoline engine that charges the battery pack. Frick said a “new low-cost universal electric vehicle platform” will form the basis for a “new family of smaller, more affordable and cost-efficient vehicles.” A new mid-size pickup truck is scheduled for 2027. The pivot toward smaller electric vehicles follows an announcement last week that Ford will work with French carmaker Renault to build compact electric cars and vans. The partnership aims to cut costs and speed up development to compete with Chinese manufacturers in Europe.

During this time, they discussed issues regarding financial monitoring and user privacy. This meeting illustrates part of the federal agency’s long-standing goal of enhancing the regulatory framework set up for digital assets. During the roundtable discussion, Hester Peirce, a Commissioner at the SEC widely known as the “ Crypto Mom ” for her strong support of the digital asset industry, along with Paul Atkins, the chair of the SEC, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda, took the initiative to elaborate on effective ways in which regulators can safeguard investors while also taking privacy concerns into account. This discussion took place as the SEC noted the significant rise of blockchain-based financial activities. Atkins noted that cryptocurrency could end up as a strong tool for financial surveillance Considering the heightened adoption of cryptocurrencies among firms, Atkins argued that cryptocurrency could position itself as the most powerful financial surveillance system that has ever existed globally. To achieve this accomplishment, the SEC chair declared that the situation will rely on how the US government chooses to regulate it. He also pointed out that the federal agency used to view every digital wallet as a broker in the past. This meant that they demanded more transaction reports from these digital wallets. After several considerations, Peirce agreed with Atkins. As the head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, she proposed that regulators should carefully reconsider the most effective time and method for monitoring financial transactions as the crypto market continues to expand. “Our country’s decline in financial privacy and its related rules need an update, and cryptocurrency is pushing for this change,” Peirce said. According to her argument, cryptocurrency is an essential aspect of the country’s financial system, as it establishes new methods for effective transactions that do not rely on financial intermediaries, which are a critical component of their current financial surveillance system. However, she pointed out that, as previously mentioned, public blockchains where multiple crypto transactions occur are visible to everyone. This finding has raised the need for tools that safeguard privacy. The individuals who attended the surveillance and privacy roundtable included representatives from the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash , the Blockchain Association, and the Crypto Council for Innovation. This event marked the sixth occasion organized by the task force to discuss various parts of digital asset regulation and policy since the “Crypto Mom” began heading the team in January. Considering the intense nature of the situation, several analysts decided to weigh in on the situation. They claimed that many people in the crypto industry have raised concerns regarding privacy practices. These concerns have been raised at a time when the market is surging swiftly while regulators, lawmakers, and courts attempt to tackle this challenge. US senators face a limited time to create laws for the digital asset market During this roundtable discussion, it was discovered that as Caroline Crenshaw, a Commissioner at the SEC, prepared to exit the agency in less than a month, Senators in the United States faced limited time to develop laws that would establish a comprehensive framework for the digital asset market before 2026. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the early versions of a proposed bill might grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more power over digital assets while shifting the SEC’s focus. On the other hand, it was confirmed that these senators have been actively negotiating to bring the CLARITY Act to a vote before the end of this year. This decision followed the bill’s passage in July through the House of Representatives. Still, sources argued that there is a high likelihood that Republican leaders might not achieve this goal as of Monday this week.

The new mode offers leverage of up to 1,001 times on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) pairs with instant execution and zero slippage while keeping orders off public order books. Also, as part of a promotional launch running until December 31, the platform has waived all gas costs and trading fees, though trades executed in Shield Mode will not count toward Aster’s airdrop rewards program. In June 2025, the platform introduced Hidden Orders, making it the first perpetual decentralized exchange to offer integrated hidden order functionality that conceals both price and size from other market participants. Traders have complained about the transparency problem One of blockchain technology’s fundamental characteristics is transparency; however, despite its best intentions, it has created an unexpected vulnerability for traders. This visibility enables maximal extractable value (MEV) attacks, a practice where bots and validators profit by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions. Common MEV strategies include frontrunning, where traders observe pending large orders and execute their own trades first. Then, there are sandwich attacks, which place orders immediately before and after a target transaction to profit from the resulting price movement. The problem has become serious in the DeFi space, where transparency allows strategic actors to profit from information asymmetries. Unlike traditional finance, where dark pools and private execution venues have long existed to protect large orders, most DEX trading activity can be viewed by the general public. Aster DEX sees privacy as path to competitive advantage In its announcement on X , Aster wrote, “Shield Mode is for traders who want performance without broadcasting their next move—a protected execution mode today and an early building block for the privacy features we’re exploring with Aster Chain.” One perk of the Shield Mode is “isolated margin for precise risk control,” allowing traders to limit potential losses to their position size while maintaining high leverage ratios. The feature includes one-tap long and short execution with zero slippage guaranteed on supported trading pairs during launch. This latest announcement comes as Aster is trying to establish itself as a major player in the perpetual trading market. The platform briefly overtook Hyperliquid as the largest decentralized perpetuals exchange protocol in September 2025. Currently, it leads Hyperliquid in terms of perps volume, seeing over $4.95 billion in the last 24 hours, compared to Hyperliquid’s $3.17 billion. The 30-day perp volume transaction on Hyperliquid is over $204.35 billion, while Aster saw $219.85 billion in perp volume. Hyperliquid still leads the platform in terms of DEX volume, raking in over $6.59 billion in the past 30 days, while Aster has seen over $2.72 billion. Where does privacy stand in the future of crypto? Aster has positioned Shield Mode as an early component of privacy features planned for its DEX. It also stated that it will be introducing a Flexible Fee Model soon, and this model will have a fixed percentage per trade in its commission mode and a profit-and-loss (PnL) mode, which allows users to pay only when they profit. These offers will definitely increase the platform’s users and also impact its position in the decentralized perps market. Aster’s approach to privacy reflects a growing recognition within DeFi that pure transparency may conflict with practical trading needs, and this concern has helped to boost privacy solutions like Zcash, which experienced a major revival this year.

This crypto market correction has seen Bitcoin and major altcoins fall in unison, driven by a potent mix of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment. Let’s break down the key forces behind this sudden downturn and what they mean for your portfolio. What’s Driving the Current Crypto Market Correction? The recent price drop isn’t happening in a vacuum. Analysts point to two primary catalysts shaking investor confidence. First, uncertainty surrounds the next U.S. Federal Reserve Chair. Second, growing fears of an AI-driven debt bubble are prompting a flight from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Together, these factors have created a perfect storm for a crypto market correction . How Does Fed Chair Uncertainty Rock the Crypto Boat? Reports suggest President Trump’s team may favor a more independent candidate over Kevin Hassett, who was seen as supportive of interest rate cuts. The potential nomination of someone like Kevin Warsh, known for a stricter stance, has altered market expectations. Interest Rate Expectations: The prospect of fewer or delayed rate cuts can strengthen the US Dollar, often putting downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Market Stability: While a “hawkish” Fed chair might ease long-term dollar concerns, the immediate uncertainty triggers volatility. Leverage Liquidation: This uncertainty amplified a sell-off, leading to the liquidation of roughly $527 million in long positions in 24 hours as over-leveraged traders were forced to exit. Therefore, the simple equation is: Fed uncertainty leads to market volatility, which then triggers a cascading crypto market correction through leveraged positions. Are AI Bubble Fears Fueling the Sell-Off? Beyond the Fed, a broader caution is gripping markets. The explosive growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) investment has led some experts to warn of a potential debt bubble. When investors grow nervous about one high-risk sector, they often pull money from others. Cryptocurrencies, still viewed as a risk-on asset class by many institutions, are often among the first to see outflows in such environments. This risk-averse shift is a significant contributor to the current crypto market correction , as capital seeks safer havens. What Can Traders Do During a Market Correction? While corrections can be unsettling, they are a normal part of market cycles. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Portfolio: Review your holdings and risk exposure. Ensure you are not over-leveraged. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For long-term believers, a crypto market correction can present strategic buying opportunities at lower price points. Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond the price chart. Has the fundamental value proposition of your assets changed? Stay Informed: Monitor macroeconomic news, especially Fed announcements and inflation data, as they are key drivers. The Bottom Line on This Market Move This crypto market correction is a stark reminder that digital assets do not trade in isolation. They are deeply interconnected with traditional finance and global macroeconomic sentiment. The dual pressures of Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and fears of an AI investment bubble have created a risk-off mood. For savvy investors, understanding these linkages is crucial. Corrections can shake out weak leverage and reset the market for healthier future growth, but navigating them requires patience, discipline, and a clear focus on long-term fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a crypto market correction? A: A crypto market correction is a decline of 10% or more from a recent peak in the overall value of cryptocurrency markets. It is a common and healthy pullback within a longer-term trend. Q2: How long do crypto corrections typically last? A: There’s no set timeframe. Corrections can last from a few days to several months, depending on the underlying causes and market sentiment. Q3: Should I sell my crypto during a correction? A: Panic selling is rarely a good strategy. Corrections are often where long-term investors look for buying opportunities. Assess your financial goals and risk tolerance before making any decision. Q4: Is the AI bubble the main reason for this drop? A: It’s a contributing factor, not the sole reason. The primary driver appears to be macroeconomic uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy. AI bubble fears have amplified the general move away from risk assets. Q5: Will Bitcoin recover from this correction? A: Historically, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have recovered from corrections and gone on to new highs. However, past performance does not guarantee future results. Recovery depends on broader economic conditions and market adoption. Q6: What’s the best strategy now: buy, hold, or sell? A: This depends entirely on your individual investment strategy. A common approach for long-term holders is to “hold” or strategically “buy” more through dollar-cost averaging. Short-term traders might adopt a different tactic based on technical analysis. Found this analysis of the crypto market correction helpful?

Yet, three years into this technological tsunami, a surprising pattern has emerged: while businesses are eagerly adopting AI solutions, consumer AI startups are struggling to find their footing. Why do most specialized consumer AI applications fail to resonate, and what will it take for the next Uber or Airbnb of AI to emerge? We spoke with leading venture capitalists who reveal the uncomfortable truths about today’s consumer AI landscape. Why Consumer AI Startups Struggle to Find Traction Despite the explosive popularity of general-purpose tools like ChatGPT, most consumer AI startups are failing to build sustainable businesses. According to Chi-Hua Chien, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital, many early AI applications around video, audio, and photo editing were “super cool” but ultimately ephemeral. “But then Sora and Nano Banana came out, and the Chinese open-sourced their video models. And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared,” Chien explained at a recent StrictlyVC event. Chien draws a compelling comparison to the early days of smartphones: “A lot of those applications were like the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.” This pattern suggests that many standalone consumer AI applications are vulnerable to being absorbed into larger platforms. The Generative AI Platform Stabilization Problem Both Chien and Elizabeth Weil, founder and partner at Scribble Ventures, believe we’re in a transitional phase for AI platforms. Chien argues that just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish. “I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period gave birth to massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb. We might be seeing early signs of this stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT. Weil describes the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground” – no longer simple novelties but not yet mature, indispensable products. Is the Smartphone Holding Back AI Consumer Products? One of the most provocative insights from the VCs concerns the limitations of our current devices. “It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien argued. Weil agreed that smartphones may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products, largely because they’re not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone during the presentation. The race for the next personal AI device is already underway: OpenAI and Apple’s former design chief Jonny Ive are reportedly working on a “screenless,” pocket-sized device Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures Multiple startups are attempting to introduce AI pins, pendants, or rings with mixed success What Successful AI Consumer Products Might Look Like Not every breakthrough AI consumer product will require new hardware. Chien suggested that a personal AI financial adviser customized to individual needs could be transformative. Similarly, Weil anticipates that personalized, “always-on” tutors will become ubiquitous, delivered directly from smartphones. However, both VCs expressed skepticism about AI-powered social networks where thousands of AI bots interact with user content. “It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” Chien said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.” Key Challenges Facing Consumer AI Startups Challenge Description Potential Solution Platform Dependency Standalone apps risk being absorbed into larger platforms Build defensible moats through network effects or unique data Device Limitations Smartphones may not be optimal for ambient AI experiences Wait for new hardware or build for emerging form factors User Expectations Consumers expect AI to be either free or incredibly valuable Focus on solving genuine pain points with clear value propositions Technical Maturity AI platforms are still evolving rapidly Build for flexibility and anticipate platform changes Actionable Insights for AI Entrepreneurs Based on the VC insights, here are key considerations for anyone building in the consumer AI space: Timing is everything : We’re likely 1-2 years away from the platform stabilization needed for breakout consumer AI successes Think beyond the smartphone : Consider how your product would work on emerging form factors like glasses, pins, or ambient devices Avoid the “flashlight trap” : Don’t build features that larger platforms can easily absorb – focus on creating unique value Solve real problems : Personal finance and education show promise because they address genuine consumer needs Preserve human connection : Be cautious about replacing human interaction with AI in social contexts The Future of Consumer AI Startups The current struggles of consumer AI startups shouldn’t be interpreted as a failure of the technology, but rather as growing pains in a rapidly evolving landscape. The VCs’ insights suggest we’re approaching an inflection point similar to the 2009-2010 mobile era, when the platform stabilized enough for transformative applications to emerge. The most successful consumer AI products will likely: Leverage AI’s unique capabilities rather than simply automating existing tasks Work across multiple device types, including emerging form factors Create genuine, measurable value for users Build defensible advantages that can’t be easily replicated by larger platforms The generative AI revolution is far from over for consumers – it may just be getting started. The current period of experimentation and failure is laying the groundwork for the truly transformative applications that will define how we interact with AI in our daily lives. The breakthrough moment for consumer AI isn’t a matter of if, but when – and the VCs watching this space most closely suggest that moment is closer than many realize.

The measures cover everything from listing rules to stopping people from trading on inside information. The Financial Conduct Authority released its plans just one day after lawmakers introduced draft laws targeting crypto businesses. The move attempts to strike a balance between making Britain an attractive place for digital money operations while keeping investors safe in a market known for big risks. The watchdog backed away from some of its tougher ideas that came out earlier this year. Crypto trading sites will now be allowed to list their own digital tokens on their platforms and buy and sell assets directly with customers—two activities the regulator had initially wanted to stop. Tuesday’s announcement came in three separate documents that spell out how the regulator plans to take its current rulebook for regular financial markets and reshape it to fit the unusual characteristics and dangers of digital currencies like Bitcoin. People and companies have until February 12 to send in their thoughts on the proposals. The final version of Britain’s crypto rules should be ready sometime next year before they officially start in 2027. Officials push back against critics David Geale, who runs payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the watchdog wants to do this correctly. “ Regulation is coming — and we want to get it right,” Geale explained. “Our goal is to have a regime that protects consumers, supports innovation and promotes trust.” Some people in the industry say Britain has been too careful about welcoming cryptocurrency, especially compared to how Donald Trump’s government in the United States plans to take a hands-off approach. The FCA, however, said it wants a crypto market “where innovation can thrive, but where people understand the risks.” The regulator made clear it cannot and should not eliminate every danger. “Instead, it should make sure anyone investing in crypto does so with their eyes open,” the watchdog said. Companies dealing in digital assets will have to follow the money rules that already exist for Mifid investment businesses, plus a brand-new set of requirements made just for crypto. They must also keep enough cash and liquid holdings on hand so they can shut down operations without causing serious damage if needed. The FCA warned that regulation cannot protect against every possible problem in the crypto space. “Anyone who buys cryptoassets should be aware of the risks involved — including that they might lose all the money they invest and the significant volatility of the cryptoassets’ value,” the regulator stated. Framework targets market abuse and staking The new framework covers rules for crypto middlemen and brokers, steps to prevent insider dealing and price manipulation, and oversight of companies running staking programs where people lock up their digital coins to earn rewards. The regulator said certain best-execution standards that regular stock exchanges must follow will not apply to crypto trading platforms. The watchdog also tackled the tricky issue of overseeing distributed finance technology, where deals happen directly between two parties without a middleman. The FCA wants “the same rules that apply in traditional finance should also apply” to this newer system. Some questions remain unanswered. The regulator plans to ask for input during the first three months of 2026 about whether crypto firms should fall under consumer duty requirements that force companies to ensure good results for clients, and whether customers can take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

Priced at $0.035, a price that is making it a very attractive new cryptocurrency, with over 18,480 distinct accounts already on board, which is a very noticeable sign of the immense adoption that is taking place. Unlike other altcoins with the potential of only making massive short-term gains for existing traders, Mutuum Finance is hard at work putting together a full DeFi platform, including a solution that is decentralized, with a lending, borrowing, yield-incentivized reward system, as well as interest-bearing tokens. This is now being reinforced by a real-world event, with the V1 Sepolia Testnet soon to be released in Q4, 2025, which is a huge development that has now cemented the development path of the project, with real implications on development, use, and relevance. This has now cemented MUTM as the best crypto to buy now, with researchers identifying that it has high adoption, a sound price, a sound level of adoption, as well as a sound development path for the future. This is now giving potential buyers a signal that not only is it a sound development but that it is on the verge of taking over the existing, burgeoning crypto environment. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Nears Sell-out Mutuum Finance is quickly making a name for itself as a prominent DeFi project on the horizon for 2026. The presale has garnered over 18,480 participants, bringing in over $19.5 million. The cost of tokens in Phase 6 is set at $0.035, but in Phase 7, the price rises 20% to $0.04, marking the final stages of presale participation to acquire this new crypto coin, MUTM, prior to listing on exchanges. Unlike most altcoins, which find value within speculation, Mutuum Finance focuses on utility, making the use of the MUTM token highly valuable. Mutuum Finance is gearing up for the launch of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet, which is set to take place toward the latter part of 2025. This launch release is going to provide support for major assets such as ETH and USDT, making it possible for individuals to interact with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the automated liquidator bot. It’s going to serve a useful purpose of educating people on how the entire process works. Innovative Dual Lending System One of the reasons why people are embracing MUTM is because of the two-lending models that it has. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) mechanism pools a significant amount of stable assets such as USDT and ETH, which are all audited within smart contracts, with the rate of interest fluctuating with regard to how the pools are used. In the case of assets with high volatility, such as meme coins, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network facilitates direct agreements between users, which helps volatile assets enter the system without disrupting the main pools. The P2C layer combined with the P2P layer thus provides a solid and dynamic environment for lending, making MUTM the best crypto to buy now with real utility. The Buying-and-Redistribute Mechanism Increases Value Mutuum Finance enhances the experience even further with what is known as the buy-and-redistribute mechanism. The transaction fees generated from the process of lending and borrowing are used to buy back tokens, which are later on redistributed to users who are staking mtTokens. This basically helps form a mutually catalytic growth loop where the more the use of the platform, the more buy-backs occur, leading to increased rewards, thus encouraging even more use. This basically helps make MUTM a DeFi crypto with greater value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is close to a price increase of 20% with the nearing completion of presale stage 6. Over 18,480 individuals have chipped in a sum of $19.5 million, with tokens currently at $0.035, set to rise to $0.04 with the onset of presale stage 7. Early birds still have a chance to acquire MUTM tokens, which come with a DeFi platform that has real-world use cases and tremendous potential for growth, making it the best crypto to buy now and a compelling new crypto coin for investors.

This movement suggests we might be witnessing the early stages of changing market dynamics that could impact your portfolio strategy. What Does the Rising Altcoin Season Index Mean for Investors? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market thermometer. Created by CoinMarketCap, this metric measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The recent rise to 22 indicates growing momentum for alternative cryptocurrencies, though we remain far from the threshold that signals a full altcoin season.

For weeks, the Senate Republicans and Democrats have been debating on what rules to implement in the incoming crypto legislation. The negotiations are being held up due to certain ethics provisions that the democrats are pushing for. Senate Banking Committee postpones voting on crypto bill to 2026 After weeks of intense negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats over important details in the bill, Chairman Tim Scott confirmed on Monday that his committee will not hold a markup hearing this week as previously hoped. Senator Mark Warner noted that there are still wide areas of disagreement between both sides, saying lawmakers don’t even have agreed-upon language for some sections. Jeff Naft, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Republican, said in a statement that the panel is continuing to negotiate and looks forward to a markup in early 2026. Scott emphasized that the overall priority is creating bipartisan legislation and making America the Crypto capital of the world. The legislation would also provide clarity for the digital asset industry. The market structure bill aims to define how the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission can oversee crypto markets . It would appoint the CFTC as a primary spot market regulator for cryptocurrency and more clearly define how securities laws apply to the sector. The House of Representatives passed its version of crypto market structure legislation in July called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. It received strong bipartisan support with a 294-134 vote, including 216 Republicans and 78 Democrats. What is holding up the crypto bill negotiations? Democrats have been pushing for rules that would prevent public officials from profiting from cryptocurrency ventures while in office. This issue largely targets President Donald Trump and his family’s various crypto-related businesses, including World Liberty Financial. Senator Cynthia Lummis revealed that the White House has already rejected these ethics provisions. Democrats sent a counteroffer to Republicans earlier this month, expressing concerns about interest or yield payments on stablecoin balances. The Democratic Working Group warned that such yields could trigger bank runs if customers withdraw a lot at once and also threaten financial stability if stablecoins lose their value. Democrats want the SEC to conduct initial reviews to quickly classify new digital assets. They also want crypto projects to keep providing regular updates and disclosures when founders or managers are still actively running the project. They have also pushed for stronger anti-money laundering measures and tools to combat illicit finance, particularly to isolate digital asset services used by North Korean bad actors from the U.S. financial system. Additionally, Democrats are calling for bipartisan representation on both the SEC and CFTC to ensure fair and effective regulation. Both the SEC and CFTC have begun taking steps to become friendlier regulators, regardless of legislation. The SEC has published staff statements and held multiple roundtables discussing how securities laws could apply to crypto. The CFTC has started allowing institutions it licenses to engage in spot crypto trading and recently granted no-action relief to prediction market operators.

Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven According to multiple macro-focused voices, the move could sap global liquidity and put fresh downward pressure on risk assets, with some traders already bracing for a sharp pullback. Japan’s policy shift matters because higher rates tend to strengthen the yen and raise the cost of borrowing. When that happens, traders who previously borrowed cheaply in yen to invest elsewhere are often forced to unwind those positions. That process can pull money out of global markets in a short period of time, and Bitcoin has often felt that impact as investors cut exposure during risk-off stretches. BOJ Tightening Drains Global Liquidity According to AndrewBTC, every BOJ hike since 2024 has coincided with Bitcoin drawdowns of more than 20%.

Traders are positioning before a busy slate of US data and central bank events that could sway flows. Analyst EX bluntly warned BTC will collapse “below $70,000” under the stated macro conditions, a stark forecast that highlights how crowded bets can amplify moves when liquidity is pulled. EVERY TIME JAPAN HIKES RATES, BITCOIN DUMPS 20–25% NEXT WEEK, THEY WILL HIKE RATES TO 75 BPS AGAIN. IF THE PATTERN HOLDS, $BTC WILL DUMP BELOW $70,000 ON DECEMBER 19. POSITION ACCORDINGLY. pic.twitter.com/IWU8JbXjn3 — ΞX (@rektbyEX) December 13, 2025 Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back Under $89K, Michael Saylor Smells Opportunity What This Means For Investors The story tying BOJ policy to Bitcoin’s swings is simple in outline: when funding costs in Japan rise, global borrowing becomes pricier, and risk assets can be sold as positions are reduced. That dynamic helps explain why past BOJ moves lined up with 20-30% declines in Bitcoin. Still, markets often try to price events ahead of time; a hike that’s already built into prices may have a smaller effect than one that comes as a surprise.

Brandt, who has traded financial markets for more than fifty years, argued that XRP backers display a level of conviction he associates with what he describes as poorly informed “perma bulls.” His remarks quickly reignited a familiar debate between traditional market technicians and XRP supporters who prioritize broader adoption narratives. Brandt explained that his assessment is rooted in decades of experience across commodities, equities, futures, and cryptocurrencies. According to him, some investor groups remain consistently optimistic regardless of prolonged drawdowns, shifting macroeconomic conditions, or repeated technical breakdowns. He grouped XRP supporters alongside long-term silver investors, suggesting that both communities maintain unwavering confidence even during extended periods of underperformance. For 50 years I have traded many thousands of contracts of every commodity, stock indexes and as many cryptos as you can think of The perma bulls who I find most uneducated and biased are those who trumpet Silver and XRP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 12, 2025 Responses From the XRP Community Unsurprisingly, Brandt’s comments were met with immediate pushback. Zach Rector , a prominent XRP-focused analyst, pointed to what he described as evolving sentiment among former critics. Rector highlighted a recent statement from YoungHoon Kim, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist, who announced on December 12 that he had begun accumulating XRP. Kim’s decision drew attention because of his previously firm stance against alternative crypto assets. Other responses emphasized analytical differences rather than confrontation. Market commentator X Finance Bull acknowledged Brandt’s extensive trading background but questioned whether conventional chart-based models fully reflect XRP’s current positioning. He argued that XRP’s valuation may increasingly depend on regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and its role within cross-border payment infrastructure rather than short-term price formations alone. Similarly, Altcoin Buzz suggested that many XRP holders are less focused on near-term market fluctuations and more concerned with long-range utility. In that view, Brandt’s critique reflects a divergence in investment philosophy rather than an objective judgment on XRP’s long-term viability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Context of the Dispute Brandt’s skepticism toward XRP is not new. Over the years, he has repeatedly questioned the asset’s valuation and has, at times, projected continued weakness against Bitcoin. XRP supporters frequently respond by pointing out instances where such forecasts did not materialize as expected. That said, Brandt’s outlook has not always been negative. Earlier this year, he identified a bullish technical setup on XRP that ultimately resulted in a price advance before broader market pressure led to a reversal. This mixed history underscores that his criticism is largely tied to investor behavior rather than an outright dismissal of XRP as a tradable asset. The exchange highlights an ongoing divide within the crypto market. While traders like Brandt rely heavily on historical price action and classical technical analysis, many XRP investors emphasize legal progress, institutional interest, and evolving financial infrastructure. This contrast continues to shape debate around XRP’s future and reflects broader tensions between traditional trading frameworks and adoption-driven investment theses.

Key macroeconomic data, policy signals, and sector-specific developments are set to test market sentiment and influence volatility across major digital assets. Traders and investors are closely watching how these events unfold, as shifting expectations around inflation and liquidity could determine whether the market recovers or extends its downside pressure . Events Set To Move Bitcoin And Crypto Market This Week Bitcoin and the broader crypto market face a pivotal week, with several high-impact economic events lining up just days before Christmas. With year-end liquidity thinning and the recent market downturn, price reactions to macro developments could be more volatile than usual. The period from December 16 to 19 features key US economic data releases alongside global policy decisions that directly influence risk sentiment. Cryptocurrencies remain highly sensitive to shifts in interest rate expectations and dollar liquidity, making this week decisive for Bitcoin’s near-term direction. On December 16, October retail sales data and the November US Jobs Report are scheduled for release. These data provide insight into consumer strength and labor market conditions, both of which influence the extent to which monetary policy may remain restrictive. Usually, stronger retail spending or job growth could reinforce expectations that interest rates stay higher for longer. This risk scenario often pressures Bitcoin and other crypto assets as tighter financial conditions tend to reduce speculative capital flows. Next are the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data and the December Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, due on December 18. Notably, inflation remains one of the most influential drivers for crypto markets . If inflation comes in stronger than expected, the US dollar could strengthen, weighing on Bitcoin prices. Conversely, softer inflation data may support risk assets by improving the outlook for Quantitative Easing (QE). December 19 will see the release of several key economic reports, including the National Core CPI year over year, November existing home sales, the revised UoM consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. National Core CPI is especially important as it is the primary measure of underlying inflation and often triggers market volatility. US FED And Japan Monetary Policy Events At the December 18-19 monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to announce its interest rate decision, which could affect global liquidity conditions. In a recent speech, Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the BOJ was weighing the advantages and drawbacks of raising interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75%. If a spike occurs, it could affect risk markets, including cryptocurrency. In addition, five US Federal Reserve speaker events are scheduled this week. Their comments and insights could quickly reshape crypto market expectations. Last week, the FED cut rates by 25 basis points at its final 2025 FOMC meeting , bringing the new US interest rate to 3.50-3.75%. This rate cut triggered a surprising sell off , underscoring significant impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-16 01:00:50
55849471,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245672,1765847111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Partnership: How Pocket Network RPC Services Power GetBlock’s Decentralized Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pocket-network-rpc-services-getblock/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Partnership: How Pocket Network RPC Services Power GetBlock’s Decentralized Future In a significant move for decentralized web3 infrastructure, Pocket Network has announced a strategic partnership with node provider GetBlock. This collaboration centers on providing wholesale Pocket Network RPC services , a development that could reshape how developers access blockchain data. For anyone invested in the future of decentralized applications, this partnership signals a major step toward more resilient and cost-effective infrastructure. What Does This Pocket Network RPC Services Deal Mean? The core of the agreement is straightforward yet powerful. GetBlock will now receive Pocket Network RPC services at wholesale prices for all supported blockchain networks. Consequently, GetBlock can operate nodes for various chains at a significantly lower cost. This arrangement directly translates to potential savings and improved service for the countless developers and projects that rely on GetBlock’s platform. Payments within this ecosystem will be made exclusively in POKT tokens, based on actual RPC usage. Therefore, as GetBlock’s demand for these services grows, so does the demand for the POKT token. Pocket Network expects this mechanism to not only increase token utility but also create a deflationary effect on its supply. Why Is This Partnership a Game-Changer? This deal addresses two critical pain points in the blockchain space: centralization risk and high infrastructure costs. By leveraging Pocket Network’s decentralized node network, GetBlock enhances its service reliability. If one node fails, hundreds of others can seamlessly handle the requests. This creates a robust Pocket Network RPC services layer that is resistant to outages and censorship. For end-users, the benefits are clear: Lower Costs: Wholesale pricing allows GetBlock to offer competitive rates. Enhanced Reliability: Decentralization reduces single points of failure. Greater Access: Developers get reliable access to a wide array of chains. How Does the POKT Token Benefit? The tokenomics of this partnership are particularly compelling. The POKT token is the lifeblood of the Pocket Network ecosystem. Every RPC request served by a node operator requires a payment in POKT. With a major client like GetBlock now consuming these services at scale, the network’s usage is poised for a substantial uptick. This usage-based model means value accrues directly to the token. More importantly, the protocol employs a unique burn mechanism. A portion of the POKT used for payments is permanently removed from circulation. As a result, increased demand from partnerships like this can lead to a deflationary pressure on the token’s total supply, potentially benefiting long-term holders. What Are the Challenges and Future Outlook? While the partnership is promising, success hinges on execution. GetBlock must successfully integrate and scale its use of the Pocket Network RPC services . Furthermore, the broader market must continue to value decentralization over the convenience of centralized providers like Infura or Alchemy. However, the trend is encouraging. The web3 industry is increasingly prioritizing censorship-resistant and reliable infrastructure. Partnerships like this validate the economic model of decentralized service networks. If successful, it could pave the way for similar integrations, solidifying Pocket Network’s position as a leading provider of Pocket Network RPC services . In summary, the Pocket Network and GetBlock partnership is more than a simple business deal. It is a strategic alignment that strengthens the decentralized backbone of web3. By making RPC access more affordable and robust, it empowers developers to build better applications. Simultaneously, it creates a powerful demand engine for the POKT token, aligning economic incentives with network growth and security. This collaboration exemplifies how thoughtful partnerships can accelerate the entire ecosystem’s move toward a truly decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are RPC services in blockchain? RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services are the interface that allows applications, like a crypto wallet or dApp, to communicate with a blockchain. They let you query data (like your balance) or send transactions. How does Pocket Network’s model differ from traditional providers? Traditional providers (e.g., Infura) run centralized server clusters. Pocket Network is decentralized, distributing requests across thousands of independent node operators, which improves uptime and reduces censorship risk. What is the deflationary effect mentioned for the POKT token? The protocol burns a portion of the POKT tokens used to pay for RPC services. As usage increases (like from the GetBlock deal), more tokens are burned, reducing the total supply over time, which can be positive for the token’s value if demand holds. Will this partnership make GetBlock’s services cheaper for developers? Potentially, yes. By accessing Pocket Network RPC services at wholesale prices, GetBlock lowers its own infrastructure costs. These savings can be passed on to its customers, offering more competitive pricing plans. Which blockchains are supported through this partnership? GetBlock will have access to all blockchain networks supported by Pocket Network. This includes major chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and many others, providing wide coverage for developers. How does this improve reliability for end-users? Decentralization means there is no single point of failure. If one node goes offline, the network automatically routes requests to other available nodes, ensuring consistent service availability. Found this deep dive into the pivotal Pocket Network and GetBlock partnership insightful? This kind of infrastructure development is crucial for web3’s growth.
