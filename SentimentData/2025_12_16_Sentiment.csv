For cryptocurrency investors watching monetary policy closely, this development signals potential turbulence ahead for traditional markets that often ripple through digital asset valuations. Why Are Fed Chair Odds Suddenly Changing? According to CNBC reports, Kevin Hassett is no longer the clear frontrunner to lead the Federal Reserve. The White House National Economic Council director previously enjoyed overwhelming support, but concerns about the Fed’s independence have changed the calculus. Multiple sources indicate that presidential aides worry about Hassett’s close relationship with Donald Trump potentially compromising the central bank’s autonomy. This matters because the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates directly influence market liquidity, inflation expectations, and investment flows across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. When traders lose confidence in central bank independence, volatility typically increases. How Could This Affect Financial Markets? The bond market reaction represents the most immediate concern. Analysts project potential long-term negative responses if markets perceive the next Fed chair as overly political. Specifically: Interest rate uncertainty: Markets might anticipate more aggressive rate hikes depending on the nominee’s approach to inflation Dollar volatility: Currency fluctuations could impact cryptocurrency valuations Risk asset re-pricing: Traditional safe havens and alternative assets like Bitcoin often see increased interest during periods of central bank uncertainty Hassett addressed these concerns directly during a recent CBS interview, stating that while the president has clear positions, the Fed makes policy decisions based on data and FOMC consensus, not political views. What Do Prediction Markets Reveal About Fed Chair Odds? The numbers tell a compelling story. Data from decentralized prediction market Kalshi shows Hassett’s nomination probability has plummeted from over 80% earlier this month to just 31%. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh has seen his odds surge to 52%. Prediction markets often provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polls because participants risk real money on their convictions. This dramatic shift suggests informed traders see genuine obstacles to Hassett’s nomination. Why Does Federal Reserve Independence Matter? The Federal Reserve’s credibility depends on its perceived independence from political pressure. When markets believe the central bank will make decisions based on economic data rather than political considerations, several benefits emerge: Stable inflation expectations: Businesses and consumers can plan with confidence Predictable monetary policy: Investors can assess risk more accurately International confidence: Global markets trust the dollar as a reserve currency Cryptocurrency advocates often point to central bank politicization as a key reason for Bitcoin’s existence as an alternative, decentralized monetary system. What Happens Next With Fed Chair Selection? The selection process now enters a more uncertain phase. Several factors will influence the final decision: Market reactions to potential nominees Congressional support for different candidates Economic conditions at the time of nomination Political considerations within the administration For cryptocurrency traders, monitoring these Fed chair odds provides valuable insight into potential monetary policy directions. The Fed’s approach to inflation, interest rates, and quantitative easing all significantly impact digital asset valuations. Key Takeaways for Investors The shifting Fed chair odds highlight several important considerations: Central bank independence remains crucial for market stability Political relationships can significantly impact appointment probabilities Prediction markets offer real-time insights into likely outcomes Monetary policy uncertainty often increases interest in alternative assets As the selection process continues, watch for further developments in Fed chair odds and corresponding market reactions. The ultimate nominee will shape monetary policy for years, affecting everything from mortgage rates to cryptocurrency valuations. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Kevin Hassett’s Fed chair odds drop so suddenly? Concerns emerged among presidential aides that Hassett’s close relationship with Donald Trump could compromise Federal Reserve independence. This political consideration changed the nomination calculus dramatically. How do prediction markets calculate Fed chair odds? Platforms like Kalshi allow users to trade contracts based on event outcomes. Prices reflect the market’s collective probability assessment, with participants risking real money on their predictions. Why does Federal Reserve independence matter for cryptocurrencies? When traditional central banks face credibility issues, some investors seek alternatives like cryptocurrencies. Perceived politicization of monetary policy can increase interest in decentralized digital assets. Who is currently favored in Fed chair odds? Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh now leads with 52% probability according to Kalshi data, while Kevin Hassett has fallen to 31%. How quickly could a new Fed chair be appointed? The nomination and confirmation process typically takes several months, but timing depends on political factors and congressional schedules. What should cryptocurrency investors watch regarding Fed chair odds? Monitor market reactions to different candidates, particularly regarding their views on inflation, digital currencies, and financial innovation. These positions could significantly impact crypto regulation and adoption. Found this analysis of shifting Fed chair odds helpful?

Bitcoin price prediction now points to a potential sweep of the $80,000 lows before a bullish reversal toward $100,000. On-Chain Data Shows $81K as Critical Support Data from Glassnode reveals Bitcoin’s True Market Mean, the average on-chain purchase price held by active market participants, stands near $81,000, serving as strong support during today’s 3.6% decline that sent prices below $86,000. Bitcoin's True Market Mean—the average on-chain purchase price of Bitcoin held by active participants—stood near $81K as strong support during the last drawdown. Bitcoin first broke above it in October 2023 and hasn't traded below since. pic.twitter.com/2Wz1EWPzIi — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) December 15, 2025 Crypto analyst Darkfost observed that inflows to Binance from “wholecoiners” (transactions exceeding 1 BTC) are collapsing compared to previous years. The yearly average now sits around 6,500 BTC, a level not seen since 2018. “What is particularly interesting is the trend these inflows have followed during this cycle compared to past ones. Instead of increasing as they did previously, wholecoiner inflows to Binance have steadily declined, even as Bitcoin continued pushing higher,” Darkfost explained. BTC demand on spot orderbooks currently sits at elevated levels, from $85,000 down to $80,000, suggesting continued downward pressure on the asset. However, analyst Ted Pillows reveals that defending the $81,000 support could enable Bitcoin to target the next major resistance zone around $92,000-$94,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Bearish Momentum Cooling Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays clear momentum deterioration after failing to maintain above the $100,000 psychological resistance, which now represents the key threshold required to resume a sustained uptrend. Price has since reversed and trades in the mid-$80,000 region, with sellers driving it toward a critical support band around $81,000. The RSI has dropped into the mid-30s, indicating growing bearish pressure, but approaches levels where downside momentum typically begins slowing. Source: TradingView If the $81,000 support maintains, the chart favors a short-term relief rally toward the $90,000–$95,000 region, with a larger move back toward $100,000 only probable if buyers reclaim that level on strong volume. However, a decisive weekly close below $81,000 would bring the final bull-market structure support near $76,000 into focus, and losing that level would significantly increase the risk of a deeper corrective phase. Pepenode Offers Investors 553% APY Ahead of 2026 Bull Run If Bitcoin finally breaks the $100,000 level and starts climbing again, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see another explosive rally.

Over 1 trillion SHIB tokens , worth more than $8 million , were moved to exchanges in just 24 hours last week, raising questions about what’s coming next for the Shiba Inu price prediction . Data from Santiment shows large holders are positioning for a possible sell-off, a move that often signals rising selling pressure. Shiba Inu has seen the highest amount of whale transfers since June 6th today, happening in tandem with a +1.06T net change to the amount of $SHIB on exchanges. The #24 market cap in crypto is likely to see high volatility in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/64slL6tGVw — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 9, 2025 While not always the start of a crash, these kinds of inflows tend to confirm the current trend, which, in SHIB’s case, is still heading lower. Over the past 30 days, SHIB has dropped 9.4% , and since the beginning of the year, it has lost 61% , as traders continue to rotate out of meme coins. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Despite Bearish News, SHIB Looks Bullish Shiba Inu recently bounced from support at $0.0000077 , but selling pressure returned quickly as it approached the $0.0000095 resistance zone. A descending price channel has been in play for months, and SHIB now looks set to retest the $0.0000077 level again, pointing to a possible 6% downside in the short term. Still, a potential reversal is on the table. If SHIB forms a double bottom at this level, it could spark a bounce toward the top of the channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also flashing a bullish divergence , showing rising momentum even as price trends lower, a classic sign that a local bottom may be forming. As meme coins begin showing early signs of strength, one new presale is standing out. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is capturing the spirit of Dogecoin’s early days and turning it into a fresh new meme coin where holders can share early opportunities and trading setups.

Still, historical patterns support a bullish XRP price prediction , and here’s why. Popular trader Steph is Crypto recently shared a chart showing a clear similarity to XRP’s 2017 accumulation phase, when the token was trading at just $0.25 . What followed was a massive rally that sent XRP to its all-time high within a year, and some believe the setup today could lead to something similar. $XRP is about to explode, just like it did in 2017. Buckle up! pic.twitter.com/hTISvgpa0q — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 14, 2025 Steph identified a similar accumulation pattern forming this year, right after XRP broke above the $1.70 level. Back in January 2018, XRP reached $3.84 , delivering a massive 1,440% gain for those who bought during the last major accumulation phase. XRP Price Prediction: Move Above $2.20 Could Set Things in Motion Looking at the daily chart, XRP has formed a falling wedge over the past few months, resulting from the sharp decline over the past few months. Source: TradingView The price has now compressed around the $2 mark, making this a key level to watch closely in the coming days. A breakout above $2.20 could flip the script entirely, invalidating the current bearish structure and potentially kicking off XRP’s next major move. If that happens, the first target in this time frame would be the 200-day EMA at $2.44 , offering a quick 20% upside , with a larger move toward $3 likely to follow. Should momentum continue building, the bold prediction shared by Steph is Crypto could start to play out in the months ahead, especially as crypto adoption continues to accelerate. Just like XRP, early-stage presales are starting to gain attention, and few stand out more than Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) .

This follows the wallet’s ongoing transition into a true multichain platform, after previously adding support for other blockchains, including Solana and various EVM networks. The update generates native Bitcoin addresses for users, supports SegWit transactions, and will add Taproot compatibility in a future release. Users can purchase Bitcoin via credit card, Apple Pay, PayPal , or bank transfers, and swap BTC with other supported assets directly in the wallet. MetaMask expands beyond Ethereum with native Bitcoin support and incentives MetaMask’s transition from an Ethereum-only wallet to a multichain platform occurred nearly a year after the wallet first announced it would introduce support for Bitcoin, marking the beginning of its expansion beyond Ethereum. The Bitcoin integration enables users to hold and transact the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, eliminating the need for wrapped tokens or third-party wallets. “We’re excited to announce that Bitcoin is now supported on MetaMask. This means you can trade and manage BTC alongside Ethereum, Solana, Monad, and Sei assets, all inside your MetaMask wallet,” a statement from the company reads. The network expansion comes amid a flurry of recent feature enhancements, as it seeks to stay near the top of a competitive wallet landscape. Just a few months ago, the wallet launched its own stablecoin, mUSD, on Ethereum and the layer-2 scaling network, Linea. Then, in October, it unveiled native support for swaps on Hyperliquid, allowing traders to easily place long or short bets on the popular Perps DEX. Earlier this month, MetaMask rolled out a native Polymarket integration, enabling users to place predictions on sports, crypto, and politics directly within the wallet. Users can now also trade Bitcoin after updating to the latest version of MetaMask. Those who swap into BTC will earn MetaMask reward points as part of a $30 million community rewards program, designed to support long-term engagement ahead of the wallet’s native token launch. Following the rollout of Bitcoin, MetaMask plans to add more networks in 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $86,332.54. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has fallen 3.2% over the last 24 hours. It’s 32% off its record high of more than $126,000 reached in early October. Major cryptocurrencies fell during U.S. morning hours Monday, continuing a now crystal-clear pattern of relatively poor performance while American stocks trade. Bitcoin’s underperformance during U.S. trading hours initially suggests weak demand from American investors, although the structure of spot Bitcoin ETFs, launched in January 2024, may also be influencing activity. “Since the iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT began trading, had you only owned it after hours (buy the close, sell the next open), it’s up 222%,” Bespoke Investment said in an X post. “Had you only owned intraday (buy the open, sell the close), it’s down 40.5%.” Crypto stocks also began the week significantly lower, with both Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRCL) down about 7%. Coinbase (COIN) dropped by more than 5%, while trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and eToro (ETOR) experienced smaller declines of approximately 2%. Brokerage Gemini (GEMI), which soared late last week on approval for adding prediction markets to its offerings, pulled back 10% Monday. MetaMask’s Bitcoin integration drives on-chain growth Industry observers view the integration as a significant convenience boost, expected to generate higher on-chain activity and extend MetaMask’s reach into additional market segments, including both institutional and retail users. The competition could apply pressure to offer multichain offerings to match MetaMask’s rising ecosystem. Although Bitcoin offers a different level of investment benefit, some experts argue that multichain wallets introduce increased security and operational complexities; they emphasize the importance of keeping wallets updated and safeguarding private keys and recovery phrases. Now, as Bitcoin is native to MetaMask, the wallet presents itself as a central hub for a range of digital assets for users online, as well as within the Web3 ecosystem, while also pushing the boundaries of cross-chain interoperability.

However, the price remains firmly capped by a descending trendline and structural resistance around the $3,400 level. While buyers defend the vital $2,905 low, the trend remains sideways until ETH can achieve a decisive close above the descending resistance to initiate the next major rally. ETH Attempts To Stabilize After The Selloff According to a daily update from CyrilXBT, Ethereum is attempting to form a base following its recent selloff, but the price remains capped below the 50-day EMA around $3,281. This level continues to act as a key barrier, keeping ETH from confirming a stronger recovery for now. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Drifts Lower—Is $3,000 About to Be the Battleground? At the time of the update, ETH was trading near $3,131. On the downside, initial support sits around $3,050, while a broader demand zone between $2,750 and $2,900 remains the more significant area where buyers are expected to step in if selling pressure returns. On the upside, resistance is concentrated between $3,280 and $3,300, aligning closely with the 50-day EMA, which represents a clear “prove-it” level. Looking ahead, a clean break and sustained hold above $3,300 could open the door for a move back toward the $3,500 area and beyond. However, failure to reclaim this resistance would likely lead to choppy price action, with a possible retest of the $3,000 level and even a revisit of the $2,800 zone. Ethereum Trades Below Descending Trendline Resistance Crypto analyst Kamile Uray revealed that ETH is currently confined, moving persistently under a blue descending trendline. This trendline is acting as a significant diagonal resistance barrier, limiting the extent of ETH’s bullish bounces and keeping the short-term pressure tilted downward. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Cooling Off: Healthy Consolidation or Momentum Fading? Despite this overhead resistance, the analyst identified a critical support structure. Uray noted that the possibility of the upward movement continuing remains valid as long as the price stays above the rising black trendline and above the low established at $2,905. This confluence of support is crucial for maintaining the market’s current bullish bias. If the blue descending trendline resistance is decisively broken, the subsequent rally is expected to target a series of higher resistance levels: $3,661, then $3,878, and finally $4,292. Kamile Uray synthesized the condition for the breakout, stating that the descending trendline will approximately be broken if ETH manages to achieve a daily close above the $3,400 level. Meanwhile, the key condition for expecting a continued upward movement is a close above $3,400 combined with the price successfully avoiding a close below the critical $2,905 low.

55847604,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92415,1765843236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Michael Saylor’s 2045 Bitcoin Projection: What It Means for XRP Price,https://timestabloid.com/michael-saylors-2045-bitcoin-projection-what-it-means-for-xrp-price/,"As digital asset markets remain under pressure from macroeconomic influence, investor attention is increasingly shifting toward long-term valuation scenarios. One discussion gaining traction is how alternative cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP, could perform if Bitcoin achieves the ambitious long-range forecast put forward by Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor. Market expectations earlier in the cycle leaned heavily toward a near-term surge across crypto assets. However, tightening financial conditions and reduced risk appetite have redirected focus toward multi-year growth models rather than short-term price fluctuations. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Thesis Michael Saylor has consistently maintained a highly optimistic view of Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. His confidence is reflected in Strategy’s accumulation strategy, which has made the company the largest known corporate holder of Bitcoin, with over 660,000 BTC. In July 2024, when Bitcoin was trading near $65,000, Saylor presented a long-term bull-case scenario projecting Bitcoin at $49 million per coin by 2045. Since then, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $126,000 in October 2025 before retreating due to macroeconomic pressures. Imagine if Michael Saylor is 100% correct… pic.twitter.com/4bSsyTpZDG — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) September 25, 2025 At current prices near $90,000, Bitcoin would still require an increase of more than 54,000% to reach Saylor’s long-term target. What This Could Mean for XRP Although Saylor’s projection focuses exclusively on Bitcoin, its implications extend to the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s dominance means sustained appreciation often influences capital flows into other major digital assets. XRP has historically shown strong directional alignment with Bitcoin, particularly during periods of market expansion. Over recent months, XRP’s declines have exceeded those of Bitcoin, reinforcing its sensitivity to broader market movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If Bitcoin were to follow a trajectory consistent with Saylor’s forecast, a proportional expansion model suggests XRP could experience substantial long-term appreciation. Based on such assumptions, XRP’s price could theoretically rise from approximately $2 to levels above $1,000 over the coming decades. Supportive and Critical Perspectives Some long-range forecasting platforms align with this view. Changelly, for instance, has projected XRP approaching the $1,100 range by the early 2040s, assuming sustained adoption and expanding use cases. However, this outlook remains highly contested . Critics argue that XRP’s large circulating supply creates significant valuation constraints. At four-digit price levels, XRP’s implied market capitalization would exceed $100 trillion, a figure many analysts consider unrealistic within existing global financial structures. While Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin forecast provides a framework for examining long-term possibilities, XRP’s potential path depends on its own adoption, regulatory clarity, and market structure. High-end projections remain speculative and should be weighed against structural limitations and broader economic realities.

Reports note that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55182, was published by the React team on December 3 and carries a maximum severity rating. Cybersecurity firm Security Alliance (SEAL) has confirmed that multiple crypto websites are actively being targeted, and they urge operators to review all React Server Components immediately to prevent wallet-draining attacks. Security teams say the bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to run code on affected servers, which has been turned into wallet-draining campaigns across several sites. A Wide Risk To Sites Using Server Components SEAL said the flaw affects React Server Components packages in versions 19.0 through 19.2.0, and patched releases such as 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1 were issued after disclosure. Crypto Drainers using React CVE-2025-55182 We are observing a big uptick in drainers uploaded to legitimate (crypto) websites through exploitation of the recent React CVE. All websites should review front-end code for any suspicious assets NOW. — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) December 13, 2025 The vulnerability works by exploiting unsafe deserialization in the Flight protocol, letting a single crafted HTTP request execute arbitrary code with the web server’s privileges. Security teams have warned that many sites using default configurations are at risk until they apply the updates. Attackers Inject Wallet-Draining Scripts Into Compromised Pages According to industry posts, threat actors are using the exploit to plant scripts that prompt users to connect Web3 wallets and then hijack or redirect transactions. In some cases the injected code alters the user interface or swaps addresses, so a user believes they are sending funds to one account while the transaction actually pays an attacker. This method can hit users who trust familiar crypto sites and connect wallets without checking every approval. Scanners And Proof-Of-Concepts Flooded Underground Forums Security researchers report a rush of scanning tools, fake proof-of-concept code, and exploit kits shared in underground forums shortly after the vulnerability was disclosed. Cloud and threat-intelligence teams have observed multiple groups scanning for vulnerable servers and testing payloads, which has accelerated active exploitation. Some defenders say that the speed and volume of scanning have made it hard to stop all attempts before patches are applied. More Than 50 Organizations Reported Compromise Attempts Based on reports from incident responders, post-exploitation crypto activity has been observed at more than 50 organizations across finance, media, government, and tech. In several investigations, attackers established footholds and then used those to deliver further malware or to seed front-end code that targets wallet users. SEAL has emphasized that organizations failing to patch or monitor their servers could experience further attacks, and ongoing monitoring is essential until all systems are verified safe.

Take a deep breath. According to a major new report from asset manager Grayscale, these quantum computing fears are vastly overblown for the immediate future. Their 2026 Digital Asset Market Outlook delivers a crucial dose of clarity, separating long-term research from short-term market reality. Why Are Quantum Computing Fears Surfacing Now? It’s a legitimate question. Quantum computers use principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems traditional computers cannot. In theory, a powerful enough quantum machine could break the cryptographic encryption that secures Bitcoin and other blockchains. This potential has sparked concern among some investors. However, Grayscale’s analysis acts as a reality check, urging the market to focus on tangible, near-term factors instead of distant hypotheticals. What Did Grayscale’s Report Actually Say? The core message is straightforward. While quantum computing poses a recognized long-term challenge, it is unlikely to directly impact crypto price volatility next year . The report highlights two key reasons for this calm assessment: Timeline: A quantum computer capable of threatening Bitcoin’s SHA-256 encryption is not expected before 2030 at the very earliest. Preparation: The cryptographic community is already actively researching and developing “post-quantum” cryptography—new encryption methods that would be secure against quantum attacks. Therefore, the immediate quantum computing fears influencing trader sentiment are misplaced. The market has more pressing concerns, like regulatory developments and adoption rates. Should Investors Ignore Quantum Threats Completely? Absolutely not. The report doesn’t advise ignorance; it advises perspective. Think of it like preparing for a storm forecasted for a decade from now. You acknowledge it, you support the scientists building better shelters (post-quantum crypto), but you don’t sell your house today. The blockchain industry’s proactive stance is a reason for confidence, not panic. This measured view helps stabilize irrational quantum computing fears . What Are the Real Market Drivers for 2025? If quantum isn’t a short-term driver, what should investors watch? Grayscale’s outlook implies focus should remain on: Institutional Adoption: Continued entry of traditional finance firms. Regulatory Clarity: Evolving frameworks from governments worldwide. Technological Upgrades: Scalability and utility improvements on major networks. Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates and global liquidity. These factors will have a far greater influence on your portfolio in the next 12 months than any quantum computing fears . The Bottom Line: A Call for Informed Calm Grayscale’s report serves as an authoritative voice cutting through the noise. It validates the technical concern while decisively placing it on a distant horizon irrelevant to current trading strategies. The key takeaway is reassurance . The crypto ecosystem is aware of the challenge and is not standing still. For the foreseeable future, Bitcoin’s security remains robust, allowing investors and developers to concentrate on building and adopting the technology today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can a quantum computer break Bitcoin tomorrow? A: No. Grayscale and most experts agree a machine powerful enough is likely more than five years away, with 2030 being a common estimate. Q: What is being done to protect Bitcoin from quantum computers? A> Researchers are developing “post-quantum cryptography”—new encryption algorithms. Bitcoin and other blockchains can theoretically adopt these upgrades through community consensus when necessary. Q: Should I sell my crypto because of quantum computing? A> Grayscale’s analysis suggests no. The threat is long-term, and the ecosystem is preparing. Short-term price movements are driven by other factors. Q: Are other assets besides Bitcoin at risk? A> Yes, any digital system relying on current public-key cryptography (like traditional banking infrastructure) could be vulnerable, making this a universal tech challenge, not just a crypto one. Q: Where can I read Grayscale’s full report? A> The “2026 Digital Asset Market Outlook” is typically available on Grayscale’s official website and investor research pages.

The latest data reveals the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to a mere 11, a stark indicator that investor sentiment has entered the “extreme fear” zone. This critical metric, a vital pulse check for the market, suggests traders are navigating one of the most pessimistic environments in recent memory. But what does this extreme reading truly mean for your portfolio? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional thermometer. Created by Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective psychology of cryptocurrency investors on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents paralyzing fear, while 100 signals euphoric greed. The current reading of 11 is alarmingly close to the bottom, indicating widespread panic and risk aversion. This index matters because extreme emotions often precede major market turning points. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes multiple market factors to gauge sentiment objectively. Here’s the breakdown of its components: Market Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trades and volume relative to recent averages. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of crypto discussions online. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Monitors Google search volume for cryptocurrency topics. This multi-source approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view, not just a reaction to price alone. What Does an “Extreme Fear” Reading of 11 Signal for Traders? An index level of 11 is a powerful contrarian signal. Historically, periods of “extreme fear” have often presented buying opportunities for patient, long-term investors. When fear dominates, assets can become undervalued as selling pressure overwhelms the market. However, it can also signal further downside if the fundamental market conditions are weak. Therefore, this is not a simple “buy” signal, but a critical alert to pay close attention. Actionable Insights: Navigating a Market in Extreme Fear Navigating this environment requires a cool head and a clear strategy. First, avoid making impulsive decisions driven by the prevailing panic. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) as a method to build positions gradually, reducing the risk of buying at a single peak. Third, use this time for rigorous research on projects with strong fundamentals. Finally, always ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your personal risk tolerance. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Conclusion: Fear as a Precursor to Opportunity The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 11 is a definitive snapshot of a fearful market. While unsettling, understanding this sentiment gauge empowers you to look beyond the panic. Extreme fear has frequently marked cyclical bottoms, offering strategic entry points. By focusing on data, maintaining discipline, and using tools like this index for perspective, you can make informed decisions even when the market’s emotional temperature is running cold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A> It is not a direct price predictor. It measures sentiment, which is a key market driver. Extreme readings often indicate potential trend reversals, but timing is uncertain. Q: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows “Extreme Fear”? A> It can be a good time to research and consider strategic entries, but it should not be your sole reason for investing. Always conduct your own analysis and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A> The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time view of market sentiment. Q: Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? A> While its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin due to its market dominance, the resulting sentiment reading generally reflects the broader cryptocurrency market. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A> You can view the live index on websites like Alternative.me, which is the primary source for this data.

55848590,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=878962,1765844970,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55848590.jpeg,Ford just abandoned its flagship electric vehicle to lose $19.5 billion,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ford-abandoned-flagship-electric-vehicle/,"Ford is expecting to take a hit of $19.5 billion after scrapping the flagship electric pick-up truck, F-150, along with a range of other larger EVs, to focus on hybrid models. The policy change comes after the Trump administration eliminated federal subsidies for electric car buyers, throwing the industry into uncertainty. Ford executives said they will now put money into manufacturing more conventional trucks and vans, lower-priced electric options, and a new power storage operation aimed at business clients like utility companies. Andrew Frick from Ford said, “Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas.” Ford has its own reasons for the decision. The company said the financial justification for building certain large electric models “has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.” “When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Jim Farley, CEO of Ford, told Reuters. The government pulled the $7,500 tax break for new electric vehicle purchases at the end of September. That move created a rush of buyers in September, but sales dropped 49 percent the following month, according to numbers from Cox Automotive. Other automakers pull back on electric vehicles Ford is not alone in backing away from electric vehicle commitments. General Motors said in October it would take a $1.6 billion hit while cutting back production of battery-powered cars. GM also announced plans to reintroduce the Chevy Bolt with batteries from Chinese manufacturer CATL, despite heavy import taxes on Chinese goods. The financial hit to Ford breaks down as follows: $12.5 billion will be recorded in the final three months of this year as the company reorganizes its electric vehicle operations. This includes $3 billion to close down a battery-making partnership with SK On, a South Korean firm. The remaining charges will be spread out through 2027. Frick said the company is responding to current market realities rather than predictions made years ago. He noted that American buyers are sending a clear message about what they want. While customers appreciate electric vehicle advantages, “they demand affordability, range confidence” and vehicles that work for their daily needs and jobs, he said. Despite the massive writedown, Ford actually improved its financial outlook for the year. The company now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax of $7 billion, higher than the $6 billion to $6.5 billion it projected in October. The Michigan-based manufacturer said that by 2030, roughly half its worldwide sales will come from hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles , and fully electric models. That compares to 25 percent in 2025. Farley had promoted the electric F-150 truck, called the F-150 Lightning, as the “truck of the future” when he unveiled it in 2021. However, the vehicle struggled with rising production costs and poor consumer acceptance. Sales fell 72 percent when comparing November 2025 to the same month in 2024. Ford’s electric vehicle unit, known as Ford e, lost $5.1 billion in 2024 and another $3.6 billion during the first nine months of 2025. The company said its new approach should make the electric division profitable by 2029. With Trump moving to reduce fuel economy requirements for American vehicles, Ford faces less pressure to electrify its lineup to meet government consumption standards. New focus on smaller and cheaper model The next version of the F-150 Lightning will be an extended-range electric vehicle, which means it will have a small gasoline engine that charges the battery pack. Frick said a “new low-cost universal electric vehicle platform” will form the basis for a “new family of smaller, more affordable and cost-efficient vehicles.” A new mid-size pickup truck is scheduled for 2027. The pivot toward smaller electric vehicles follows an announcement last week that Ford will work with French carmaker Renault to build compact electric cars and vans. The partnership aims to cut costs and speed up development to compete with Chinese manufacturers in Europe.

During this time, they discussed issues regarding financial monitoring and user privacy. This meeting illustrates part of the federal agency’s long-standing goal of enhancing the regulatory framework set up for digital assets. During the roundtable discussion, Hester Peirce, a Commissioner at the SEC widely known as the “ Crypto Mom ” for her strong support of the digital asset industry, along with Paul Atkins, the chair of the SEC, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda, took the initiative to elaborate on effective ways in which regulators can safeguard investors while also taking privacy concerns into account. This discussion took place as the SEC noted the significant rise of blockchain-based financial activities. Atkins noted that cryptocurrency could end up as a strong tool for financial surveillance Considering the heightened adoption of cryptocurrencies among firms, Atkins argued that cryptocurrency could position itself as the most powerful financial surveillance system that has ever existed globally. To achieve this accomplishment, the SEC chair declared that the situation will rely on how the US government chooses to regulate it. He also pointed out that the federal agency used to view every digital wallet as a broker in the past. This meant that they demanded more transaction reports from these digital wallets. After several considerations, Peirce agreed with Atkins. As the head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, she proposed that regulators should carefully reconsider the most effective time and method for monitoring financial transactions as the crypto market continues to expand. “Our country’s decline in financial privacy and its related rules need an update, and cryptocurrency is pushing for this change,” Peirce said. According to her argument, cryptocurrency is an essential aspect of the country’s financial system, as it establishes new methods for effective transactions that do not rely on financial intermediaries, which are a critical component of their current financial surveillance system. However, she pointed out that, as previously mentioned, public blockchains where multiple crypto transactions occur are visible to everyone. This finding has raised the need for tools that safeguard privacy. The individuals who attended the surveillance and privacy roundtable included representatives from the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash , the Blockchain Association, and the Crypto Council for Innovation. This event marked the sixth occasion organized by the task force to discuss various parts of digital asset regulation and policy since the “Crypto Mom” began heading the team in January. Considering the intense nature of the situation, several analysts decided to weigh in on the situation. They claimed that many people in the crypto industry have raised concerns regarding privacy practices. These concerns have been raised at a time when the market is surging swiftly while regulators, lawmakers, and courts attempt to tackle this challenge. US senators face a limited time to create laws for the digital asset market During this roundtable discussion, it was discovered that as Caroline Crenshaw, a Commissioner at the SEC, prepared to exit the agency in less than a month, Senators in the United States faced limited time to develop laws that would establish a comprehensive framework for the digital asset market before 2026. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the early versions of a proposed bill might grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more power over digital assets while shifting the SEC’s focus. On the other hand, it was confirmed that these senators have been actively negotiating to bring the CLARITY Act to a vote before the end of this year. This decision followed the bill’s passage in July through the House of Representatives. Still, sources argued that there is a high likelihood that Republican leaders might not achieve this goal as of Monday this week.

The new mode offers leverage of up to 1,001 times on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) pairs with instant execution and zero slippage while keeping orders off public order books. Also, as part of a promotional launch running until December 31, the platform has waived all gas costs and trading fees, though trades executed in Shield Mode will not count toward Aster’s airdrop rewards program. In June 2025, the platform introduced Hidden Orders, making it the first perpetual decentralized exchange to offer integrated hidden order functionality that conceals both price and size from other market participants. Traders have complained about the transparency problem One of blockchain technology’s fundamental characteristics is transparency; however, despite its best intentions, it has created an unexpected vulnerability for traders. This visibility enables maximal extractable value (MEV) attacks, a practice where bots and validators profit by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions. Common MEV strategies include frontrunning, where traders observe pending large orders and execute their own trades first. Then, there are sandwich attacks, which place orders immediately before and after a target transaction to profit from the resulting price movement. The problem has become serious in the DeFi space, where transparency allows strategic actors to profit from information asymmetries. Unlike traditional finance, where dark pools and private execution venues have long existed to protect large orders, most DEX trading activity can be viewed by the general public. Aster DEX sees privacy as path to competitive advantage In its announcement on X , Aster wrote, “Shield Mode is for traders who want performance without broadcasting their next move—a protected execution mode today and an early building block for the privacy features we’re exploring with Aster Chain.” One perk of the Shield Mode is “isolated margin for precise risk control,” allowing traders to limit potential losses to their position size while maintaining high leverage ratios. The feature includes one-tap long and short execution with zero slippage guaranteed on supported trading pairs during launch. This latest announcement comes as Aster is trying to establish itself as a major player in the perpetual trading market. The platform briefly overtook Hyperliquid as the largest decentralized perpetuals exchange protocol in September 2025. Currently, it leads Hyperliquid in terms of perps volume, seeing over $4.95 billion in the last 24 hours, compared to Hyperliquid’s $3.17 billion. The 30-day perp volume transaction on Hyperliquid is over $204.35 billion, while Aster saw $219.85 billion in perp volume. Hyperliquid still leads the platform in terms of DEX volume, raking in over $6.59 billion in the past 30 days, while Aster has seen over $2.72 billion. Where does privacy stand in the future of crypto? Aster has positioned Shield Mode as an early component of privacy features planned for its DEX. It also stated that it will be introducing a Flexible Fee Model soon, and this model will have a fixed percentage per trade in its commission mode and a profit-and-loss (PnL) mode, which allows users to pay only when they profit. These offers will definitely increase the platform’s users and also impact its position in the decentralized perps market. Aster’s approach to privacy reflects a growing recognition within DeFi that pure transparency may conflict with practical trading needs, and this concern has helped to boost privacy solutions like Zcash, which experienced a major revival this year.

This crypto market correction has seen Bitcoin and major altcoins fall in unison, driven by a potent mix of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment. Let’s break down the key forces behind this sudden downturn and what they mean for your portfolio. What’s Driving the Current Crypto Market Correction? The recent price drop isn’t happening in a vacuum. Analysts point to two primary catalysts shaking investor confidence. First, uncertainty surrounds the next U.S. Federal Reserve Chair. Second, growing fears of an AI-driven debt bubble are prompting a flight from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Together, these factors have created a perfect storm for a crypto market correction . How Does Fed Chair Uncertainty Rock the Crypto Boat? Reports suggest President Trump’s team may favor a more independent candidate over Kevin Hassett, who was seen as supportive of interest rate cuts. The potential nomination of someone like Kevin Warsh, known for a stricter stance, has altered market expectations. Interest Rate Expectations: The prospect of fewer or delayed rate cuts can strengthen the US Dollar, often putting downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Market Stability: While a “hawkish” Fed chair might ease long-term dollar concerns, the immediate uncertainty triggers volatility. Leverage Liquidation: This uncertainty amplified a sell-off, leading to the liquidation of roughly $527 million in long positions in 24 hours as over-leveraged traders were forced to exit. Therefore, the simple equation is: Fed uncertainty leads to market volatility, which then triggers a cascading crypto market correction through leveraged positions. Are AI Bubble Fears Fueling the Sell-Off? Beyond the Fed, a broader caution is gripping markets. The explosive growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) investment has led some experts to warn of a potential debt bubble. When investors grow nervous about one high-risk sector, they often pull money from others. Cryptocurrencies, still viewed as a risk-on asset class by many institutions, are often among the first to see outflows in such environments. This risk-averse shift is a significant contributor to the current crypto market correction , as capital seeks safer havens. What Can Traders Do During a Market Correction? While corrections can be unsettling, they are a normal part of market cycles. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Portfolio: Review your holdings and risk exposure. Ensure you are not over-leveraged. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For long-term believers, a crypto market correction can present strategic buying opportunities at lower price points. Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond the price chart. Has the fundamental value proposition of your assets changed? Stay Informed: Monitor macroeconomic news, especially Fed announcements and inflation data, as they are key drivers. The Bottom Line on This Market Move This crypto market correction is a stark reminder that digital assets do not trade in isolation. They are deeply interconnected with traditional finance and global macroeconomic sentiment. The dual pressures of Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and fears of an AI investment bubble have created a risk-off mood. For savvy investors, understanding these linkages is crucial. Corrections can shake out weak leverage and reset the market for healthier future growth, but navigating them requires patience, discipline, and a clear focus on long-term fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a crypto market correction? A: A crypto market correction is a decline of 10% or more from a recent peak in the overall value of cryptocurrency markets. It is a common and healthy pullback within a longer-term trend. Q2: How long do crypto corrections typically last? A: There’s no set timeframe. Corrections can last from a few days to several months, depending on the underlying causes and market sentiment. Q3: Should I sell my crypto during a correction? A: Panic selling is rarely a good strategy. Corrections are often where long-term investors look for buying opportunities. Assess your financial goals and risk tolerance before making any decision. Q4: Is the AI bubble the main reason for this drop? A: It’s a contributing factor, not the sole reason. The primary driver appears to be macroeconomic uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policy. AI bubble fears have amplified the general move away from risk assets. Q5: Will Bitcoin recover from this correction? A: Historically, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have recovered from corrections and gone on to new highs. However, past performance does not guarantee future results. Recovery depends on broader economic conditions and market adoption. Q6: What’s the best strategy now: buy, hold, or sell? A: This depends entirely on your individual investment strategy. A common approach for long-term holders is to “hold” or strategically “buy” more through dollar-cost averaging. Short-term traders might adopt a different tactic based on technical analysis. Found this analysis of the crypto market correction helpful?

Yet, three years into this technological tsunami, a surprising pattern has emerged: while businesses are eagerly adopting AI solutions, consumer AI startups are struggling to find their footing. Why do most specialized consumer AI applications fail to resonate, and what will it take for the next Uber or Airbnb of AI to emerge? We spoke with leading venture capitalists who reveal the uncomfortable truths about today’s consumer AI landscape. Why Consumer AI Startups Struggle to Find Traction Despite the explosive popularity of general-purpose tools like ChatGPT, most consumer AI startups are failing to build sustainable businesses. According to Chi-Hua Chien, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital, many early AI applications around video, audio, and photo editing were “super cool” but ultimately ephemeral. “But then Sora and Nano Banana came out, and the Chinese open-sourced their video models. And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared,” Chien explained at a recent StrictlyVC event. Chien draws a compelling comparison to the early days of smartphones: “A lot of those applications were like the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.” This pattern suggests that many standalone consumer AI applications are vulnerable to being absorbed into larger platforms. The Generative AI Platform Stabilization Problem Both Chien and Elizabeth Weil, founder and partner at Scribble Ventures, believe we’re in a transitional phase for AI platforms. Chien argues that just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish. “I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period gave birth to massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb. We might be seeing early signs of this stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT. Weil describes the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground” – no longer simple novelties but not yet mature, indispensable products. Is the Smartphone Holding Back AI Consumer Products? One of the most provocative insights from the VCs concerns the limitations of our current devices. “It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien argued. Weil agreed that smartphones may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products, largely because they’re not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone during the presentation. The race for the next personal AI device is already underway: OpenAI and Apple’s former design chief Jonny Ive are reportedly working on a “screenless,” pocket-sized device Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures Multiple startups are attempting to introduce AI pins, pendants, or rings with mixed success What Successful AI Consumer Products Might Look Like Not every breakthrough AI consumer product will require new hardware. Chien suggested that a personal AI financial adviser customized to individual needs could be transformative. Similarly, Weil anticipates that personalized, “always-on” tutors will become ubiquitous, delivered directly from smartphones. However, both VCs expressed skepticism about AI-powered social networks where thousands of AI bots interact with user content. “It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” Chien said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.” Key Challenges Facing Consumer AI Startups Challenge Description Potential Solution Platform Dependency Standalone apps risk being absorbed into larger platforms Build defensible moats through network effects or unique data Device Limitations Smartphones may not be optimal for ambient AI experiences Wait for new hardware or build for emerging form factors User Expectations Consumers expect AI to be either free or incredibly valuable Focus on solving genuine pain points with clear value propositions Technical Maturity AI platforms are still evolving rapidly Build for flexibility and anticipate platform changes Actionable Insights for AI Entrepreneurs Based on the VC insights, here are key considerations for anyone building in the consumer AI space: Timing is everything : We’re likely 1-2 years away from the platform stabilization needed for breakout consumer AI successes Think beyond the smartphone : Consider how your product would work on emerging form factors like glasses, pins, or ambient devices Avoid the “flashlight trap” : Don’t build features that larger platforms can easily absorb – focus on creating unique value Solve real problems : Personal finance and education show promise because they address genuine consumer needs Preserve human connection : Be cautious about replacing human interaction with AI in social contexts The Future of Consumer AI Startups The current struggles of consumer AI startups shouldn’t be interpreted as a failure of the technology, but rather as growing pains in a rapidly evolving landscape. The VCs’ insights suggest we’re approaching an inflection point similar to the 2009-2010 mobile era, when the platform stabilized enough for transformative applications to emerge. The most successful consumer AI products will likely: Leverage AI’s unique capabilities rather than simply automating existing tasks Work across multiple device types, including emerging form factors Create genuine, measurable value for users Build defensible advantages that can’t be easily replicated by larger platforms The generative AI revolution is far from over for consumers – it may just be getting started. The current period of experimentation and failure is laying the groundwork for the truly transformative applications that will define how we interact with AI in our daily lives. The breakthrough moment for consumer AI isn’t a matter of if, but when – and the VCs watching this space most closely suggest that moment is closer than many realize.

Coinbase Prime serves institutional clients with advanced trading tools and custody solutions. Therefore, moving assets to this platform typically indicates one of several strategic intentions: Liquidity preparation for potential trading activity Portfolio rebalancing across different assets Institutional custody for enhanced security measures Staking or earning yield through institutional products Why Should COMP Token Holders Care About This Move? For individual investors holding COMP tokens, institutional movements like these A16z Crypto deposits COMP to exchanges provide crucial market signals. Venture capital firms typically operate with longer time horizons and deeper market insights than retail traders. When they make substantial moves, it often precedes broader market trends. The timing of these deposits deserves particular attention. They occurred during a period of relative market stability, suggesting this wasn’t a panic-driven decision but rather part of a deliberate strategy. Given A16z’s reputation for thorough due diligence, their continued involvement with COMP—despite moving tokens to an exchange—might indicate confidence in the token’s underlying fundamentals. How Do Institutional Moves Impact Crypto Markets? Institutional activity creates ripple effects throughout cryptocurrency markets. When major players like A16z Crypto make substantial deposits or withdrawals, several market dynamics come into play: Price discovery becomes more efficient with larger volumes Market sentiment often follows institutional positioning Liquidity patterns shift based on where institutions place assets Regulatory attention may increase with visible institutional activity These A16z Crypto deposits COMP tokens to Coinbase Prime particularly matter because they demonstrate continued institutional engagement with DeFi tokens even during market transitions.

The measures cover everything from listing rules to stopping people from trading on inside information. The Financial Conduct Authority released its plans just one day after lawmakers introduced draft laws targeting crypto businesses. The move attempts to strike a balance between making Britain an attractive place for digital money operations while keeping investors safe in a market known for big risks. The watchdog backed away from some of its tougher ideas that came out earlier this year. Crypto trading sites will now be allowed to list their own digital tokens on their platforms and buy and sell assets directly with customers—two activities the regulator had initially wanted to stop. Tuesday’s announcement came in three separate documents that spell out how the regulator plans to take its current rulebook for regular financial markets and reshape it to fit the unusual characteristics and dangers of digital currencies like Bitcoin. People and companies have until February 12 to send in their thoughts on the proposals. The final version of Britain’s crypto rules should be ready sometime next year before they officially start in 2027. Officials push back against critics David Geale, who runs payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the watchdog wants to do this correctly. “ Regulation is coming — and we want to get it right,” Geale explained. “Our goal is to have a regime that protects consumers, supports innovation and promotes trust.” Some people in the industry say Britain has been too careful about welcoming cryptocurrency, especially compared to how Donald Trump’s government in the United States plans to take a hands-off approach. The FCA, however, said it wants a crypto market “where innovation can thrive, but where people understand the risks.” The regulator made clear it cannot and should not eliminate every danger. “Instead, it should make sure anyone investing in crypto does so with their eyes open,” the watchdog said. Companies dealing in digital assets will have to follow the money rules that already exist for Mifid investment businesses, plus a brand-new set of requirements made just for crypto. They must also keep enough cash and liquid holdings on hand so they can shut down operations without causing serious damage if needed. The FCA warned that regulation cannot protect against every possible problem in the crypto space. “Anyone who buys cryptoassets should be aware of the risks involved — including that they might lose all the money they invest and the significant volatility of the cryptoassets’ value,” the regulator stated. Framework targets market abuse and staking The new framework covers rules for crypto middlemen and brokers, steps to prevent insider dealing and price manipulation, and oversight of companies running staking programs where people lock up their digital coins to earn rewards. The regulator said certain best-execution standards that regular stock exchanges must follow will not apply to crypto trading platforms. The watchdog also tackled the tricky issue of overseeing distributed finance technology, where deals happen directly between two parties without a middleman. The FCA wants “the same rules that apply in traditional finance should also apply” to this newer system. Some questions remain unanswered. The regulator plans to ask for input during the first three months of 2026 about whether crypto firms should fall under consumer duty requirements that force companies to ensure good results for clients, and whether customers can take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

Priced at $0.035, a price that is making it a very attractive new cryptocurrency, with over 18,480 distinct accounts already on board, which is a very noticeable sign of the immense adoption that is taking place. Unlike other altcoins with the potential of only making massive short-term gains for existing traders, Mutuum Finance is hard at work putting together a full DeFi platform, including a solution that is decentralized, with a lending, borrowing, yield-incentivized reward system, as well as interest-bearing tokens. This is now being reinforced by a real-world event, with the V1 Sepolia Testnet soon to be released in Q4, 2025, which is a huge development that has now cemented the development path of the project, with real implications on development, use, and relevance. This has now cemented MUTM as the best crypto to buy now, with researchers identifying that it has high adoption, a sound price, a sound level of adoption, as well as a sound development path for the future. This is now giving potential buyers a signal that not only is it a sound development but that it is on the verge of taking over the existing, burgeoning crypto environment. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Nears Sell-out Mutuum Finance is quickly making a name for itself as a prominent DeFi project on the horizon for 2026. The presale has garnered over 18,480 participants, bringing in over $19.5 million. The cost of tokens in Phase 6 is set at $0.035, but in Phase 7, the price rises 20% to $0.04, marking the final stages of presale participation to acquire this new crypto coin, MUTM, prior to listing on exchanges. Unlike most altcoins, which find value within speculation, Mutuum Finance focuses on utility, making the use of the MUTM token highly valuable. Mutuum Finance is gearing up for the launch of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet, which is set to take place toward the latter part of 2025. This launch release is going to provide support for major assets such as ETH and USDT, making it possible for individuals to interact with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the automated liquidator bot. It’s going to serve a useful purpose of educating people on how the entire process works. Innovative Dual Lending System One of the reasons why people are embracing MUTM is because of the two-lending models that it has. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) mechanism pools a significant amount of stable assets such as USDT and ETH, which are all audited within smart contracts, with the rate of interest fluctuating with regard to how the pools are used. In the case of assets with high volatility, such as meme coins, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network facilitates direct agreements between users, which helps volatile assets enter the system without disrupting the main pools. The P2C layer combined with the P2P layer thus provides a solid and dynamic environment for lending, making MUTM the best crypto to buy now with real utility. The Buying-and-Redistribute Mechanism Increases Value Mutuum Finance enhances the experience even further with what is known as the buy-and-redistribute mechanism. The transaction fees generated from the process of lending and borrowing are used to buy back tokens, which are later on redistributed to users who are staking mtTokens. This basically helps form a mutually catalytic growth loop where the more the use of the platform, the more buy-backs occur, leading to increased rewards, thus encouraging even more use. This basically helps make MUTM a DeFi crypto with greater value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is close to a price increase of 20% with the nearing completion of presale stage 6. Over 18,480 individuals have chipped in a sum of $19.5 million, with tokens currently at $0.035, set to rise to $0.04 with the onset of presale stage 7. Early birds still have a chance to acquire MUTM tokens, which come with a DeFi platform that has real-world use cases and tremendous potential for growth, making it the best crypto to buy now and a compelling new crypto coin for investors.

This movement suggests we might be witnessing the early stages of changing market dynamics that could impact your portfolio strategy. What Does the Rising Altcoin Season Index Mean for Investors? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market thermometer. Created by CoinMarketCap, this metric measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The recent rise to 22 indicates growing momentum for alternative cryptocurrencies, though we remain far from the threshold that signals a full altcoin season.

For weeks, the Senate Republicans and Democrats have been debating on what rules to implement in the incoming crypto legislation. The negotiations are being held up due to certain ethics provisions that the democrats are pushing for. Senate Banking Committee postpones voting on crypto bill to 2026 After weeks of intense negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats over important details in the bill, Chairman Tim Scott confirmed on Monday that his committee will not hold a markup hearing this week as previously hoped. Senator Mark Warner noted that there are still wide areas of disagreement between both sides, saying lawmakers don’t even have agreed-upon language for some sections. Jeff Naft, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Republican, said in a statement that the panel is continuing to negotiate and looks forward to a markup in early 2026. Scott emphasized that the overall priority is creating bipartisan legislation and making America the Crypto capital of the world. The legislation would also provide clarity for the digital asset industry. The market structure bill aims to define how the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission can oversee crypto markets . It would appoint the CFTC as a primary spot market regulator for cryptocurrency and more clearly define how securities laws apply to the sector. The House of Representatives passed its version of crypto market structure legislation in July called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. It received strong bipartisan support with a 294-134 vote, including 216 Republicans and 78 Democrats. What is holding up the crypto bill negotiations? Democrats have been pushing for rules that would prevent public officials from profiting from cryptocurrency ventures while in office. This issue largely targets President Donald Trump and his family’s various crypto-related businesses, including World Liberty Financial. Senator Cynthia Lummis revealed that the White House has already rejected these ethics provisions. Democrats sent a counteroffer to Republicans earlier this month, expressing concerns about interest or yield payments on stablecoin balances. The Democratic Working Group warned that such yields could trigger bank runs if customers withdraw a lot at once and also threaten financial stability if stablecoins lose their value. Democrats want the SEC to conduct initial reviews to quickly classify new digital assets. They also want crypto projects to keep providing regular updates and disclosures when founders or managers are still actively running the project. They have also pushed for stronger anti-money laundering measures and tools to combat illicit finance, particularly to isolate digital asset services used by North Korean bad actors from the U.S. financial system. Additionally, Democrats are calling for bipartisan representation on both the SEC and CFTC to ensure fair and effective regulation. Both the SEC and CFTC have begun taking steps to become friendlier regulators, regardless of legislation. The SEC has published staff statements and held multiple roundtables discussing how securities laws could apply to crypto. The CFTC has started allowing institutions it licenses to engage in spot crypto trading and recently granted no-action relief to prediction market operators.

Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven According to multiple macro-focused voices, the move could sap global liquidity and put fresh downward pressure on risk assets, with some traders already bracing for a sharp pullback. Japan’s policy shift matters because higher rates tend to strengthen the yen and raise the cost of borrowing. When that happens, traders who previously borrowed cheaply in yen to invest elsewhere are often forced to unwind those positions. That process can pull money out of global markets in a short period of time, and Bitcoin has often felt that impact as investors cut exposure during risk-off stretches. BOJ Tightening Drains Global Liquidity According to AndrewBTC, every BOJ hike since 2024 has coincided with Bitcoin drawdowns of more than 20%.

Traders are positioning before a busy slate of US data and central bank events that could sway flows. Analyst EX bluntly warned BTC will collapse “below $70,000” under the stated macro conditions, a stark forecast that highlights how crowded bets can amplify moves when liquidity is pulled. EVERY TIME JAPAN HIKES RATES, BITCOIN DUMPS 20–25% NEXT WEEK, THEY WILL HIKE RATES TO 75 BPS AGAIN. IF THE PATTERN HOLDS, $BTC WILL DUMP BELOW $70,000 ON DECEMBER 19.

That dynamic helps explain why past BOJ moves lined up with 20-30% declines in Bitcoin. Still, markets often try to price events ahead of time; a hike that’s already built into prices may have a smaller effect than one that comes as a surprise.

Brandt, who has traded financial markets for more than fifty years, argued that XRP backers display a level of conviction he associates with what he describes as poorly informed “perma bulls.” His remarks quickly reignited a familiar debate between traditional market technicians and XRP supporters who prioritize broader adoption narratives. Brandt explained that his assessment is rooted in decades of experience across commodities, equities, futures, and cryptocurrencies. According to him, some investor groups remain consistently optimistic regardless of prolonged drawdowns, shifting macroeconomic conditions, or repeated technical breakdowns. He grouped XRP supporters alongside long-term silver investors, suggesting that both communities maintain unwavering confidence even during extended periods of underperformance. For 50 years I have traded many thousands of contracts of every commodity, stock indexes and as many cryptos as you can think of The perma bulls who I find most uneducated and biased are those who trumpet Silver and XRP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 12, 2025 Responses From the XRP Community Unsurprisingly, Brandt’s comments were met with immediate pushback. Zach Rector , a prominent XRP-focused analyst, pointed to what he described as evolving sentiment among former critics. Rector highlighted a recent statement from YoungHoon Kim, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist, who announced on December 12 that he had begun accumulating XRP. Kim’s decision drew attention because of his previously firm stance against alternative crypto assets. Other responses emphasized analytical differences rather than confrontation. Market commentator X Finance Bull acknowledged Brandt’s extensive trading background but questioned whether conventional chart-based models fully reflect XRP’s current positioning. He argued that XRP’s valuation may increasingly depend on regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and its role within cross-border payment infrastructure rather than short-term price formations alone. Similarly, Altcoin Buzz suggested that many XRP holders are less focused on near-term market fluctuations and more concerned with long-range utility. In that view, Brandt’s critique reflects a divergence in investment philosophy rather than an objective judgment on XRP’s long-term viability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Context of the Dispute Brandt’s skepticism toward XRP is not new. Over the years, he has repeatedly questioned the asset’s valuation and has, at times, projected continued weakness against Bitcoin. XRP supporters frequently respond by pointing out instances where such forecasts did not materialize as expected. That said, Brandt’s outlook has not always been negative. Earlier this year, he identified a bullish technical setup on XRP that ultimately resulted in a price advance before broader market pressure led to a reversal. This mixed history underscores that his criticism is largely tied to investor behavior rather than an outright dismissal of XRP as a tradable asset. The exchange highlights an ongoing divide within the crypto market. While traders like Brandt rely heavily on historical price action and classical technical analysis, many XRP investors emphasize legal progress, institutional interest, and evolving financial infrastructure. This contrast continues to shape debate around XRP’s future and reflects broader tensions between traditional trading frameworks and adoption-driven investment theses.

Key macroeconomic data, policy signals, and sector-specific developments are set to test market sentiment and influence volatility across major digital assets. Traders and investors are closely watching how these events unfold, as shifting expectations around inflation and liquidity could determine whether the market recovers or extends its downside pressure . Events Set To Move Bitcoin And Crypto Market This Week Bitcoin and the broader crypto market face a pivotal week, with several high-impact economic events lining up just days before Christmas. With year-end liquidity thinning and the recent market downturn, price reactions to macro developments could be more volatile than usual. The period from December 16 to 19 features key US economic data releases alongside global policy decisions that directly influence risk sentiment. Cryptocurrencies remain highly sensitive to shifts in interest rate expectations and dollar liquidity, making this week decisive for Bitcoin’s near-term direction. On December 16, October retail sales data and the November US Jobs Report are scheduled for release. These data provide insight into consumer strength and labor market conditions, both of which influence the extent to which monetary policy may remain restrictive. Usually, stronger retail spending or job growth could reinforce expectations that interest rates stay higher for longer. This risk scenario often pressures Bitcoin and other crypto assets as tighter financial conditions tend to reduce speculative capital flows. Next are the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data and the December Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, due on December 18. Notably, inflation remains one of the most influential drivers for crypto markets . If inflation comes in stronger than expected, the US dollar could strengthen, weighing on Bitcoin prices. Conversely, softer inflation data may support risk assets by improving the outlook for Quantitative Easing (QE). December 19 will see the release of several key economic reports, including the National Core CPI year over year, November existing home sales, the revised UoM consumer sentiment, and inflation expectations. National Core CPI is especially important as it is the primary measure of underlying inflation and often triggers market volatility. US FED And Japan Monetary Policy Events At the December 18-19 monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to announce its interest rate decision, which could affect global liquidity conditions. In a recent speech, Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the BOJ was weighing the advantages and drawbacks of raising interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75%. If a spike occurs, it could affect risk markets, including cryptocurrency. In addition, five US Federal Reserve speaker events are scheduled this week. Their comments and insights could quickly reshape crypto market expectations. Last week, the FED cut rates by 25 basis points at its final 2025 FOMC meeting , bringing the new US interest rate to 3.50-3.75%. This rate cut triggered a surprising sell off , underscoring significant impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-16 01:00:50
55849471,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245672,1765847111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Partnership: How Pocket Network RPC Services Power GetBlock’s Decentralized Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pocket-network-rpc-services-getblock/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Partnership: How Pocket Network RPC Services Power GetBlock’s Decentralized Future In a significant move for decentralized web3 infrastructure, Pocket Network has announced a strategic partnership with node provider GetBlock. This collaboration centers on providing wholesale Pocket Network RPC services , a development that could reshape how developers access blockchain data. For anyone invested in the future of decentralized applications, this partnership signals a major step toward more resilient and cost-effective infrastructure. What Does This Pocket Network RPC Services Deal Mean? The core of the agreement is straightforward yet powerful. GetBlock will now receive Pocket Network RPC services at wholesale prices for all supported blockchain networks. Consequently, GetBlock can operate nodes for various chains at a significantly lower cost. This arrangement directly translates to potential savings and improved service for the countless developers and projects that rely on GetBlock’s platform. Payments within this ecosystem will be made exclusively in POKT tokens, based on actual RPC usage. Therefore, as GetBlock’s demand for these services grows, so does the demand for the POKT token. Pocket Network expects this mechanism to not only increase token utility but also create a deflationary effect on its supply. Why Is This Partnership a Game-Changer? This deal addresses two critical pain points in the blockchain space: centralization risk and high infrastructure costs. By leveraging Pocket Network’s decentralized node network, GetBlock enhances its service reliability. If one node fails, hundreds of others can seamlessly handle the requests. This creates a robust Pocket Network RPC services layer that is resistant to outages and censorship. For end-users, the benefits are clear: Lower Costs: Wholesale pricing allows GetBlock to offer competitive rates. Enhanced Reliability: Decentralization reduces single points of failure. Greater Access: Developers get reliable access to a wide array of chains. How Does the POKT Token Benefit? The tokenomics of this partnership are particularly compelling. The POKT token is the lifeblood of the Pocket Network ecosystem. Every RPC request served by a node operator requires a payment in POKT. With a major client like GetBlock now consuming these services at scale, the network’s usage is poised for a substantial uptick. This usage-based model means value accrues directly to the token. More importantly, the protocol employs a unique burn mechanism. A portion of the POKT used for payments is permanently removed from circulation. As a result, increased demand from partnerships like this can lead to a deflationary pressure on the token’s total supply, potentially benefiting long-term holders. What Are the Challenges and Future Outlook? While the partnership is promising, success hinges on execution. GetBlock must successfully integrate and scale its use of the Pocket Network RPC services . Furthermore, the broader market must continue to value decentralization over the convenience of centralized providers like Infura or Alchemy. However, the trend is encouraging. The web3 industry is increasingly prioritizing censorship-resistant and reliable infrastructure. Partnerships like this validate the economic model of decentralized service networks. If successful, it could pave the way for similar integrations, solidifying Pocket Network’s position as a leading provider of Pocket Network RPC services . In summary, the Pocket Network and GetBlock partnership is more than a simple business deal. It is a strategic alignment that strengthens the decentralized backbone of web3. By making RPC access more affordable and robust, it empowers developers to build better applications. Simultaneously, it creates a powerful demand engine for the POKT token, aligning economic incentives with network growth and security. This collaboration exemplifies how thoughtful partnerships can accelerate the entire ecosystem’s move toward a truly decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are RPC services in blockchain? RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services are the interface that allows applications, like a crypto wallet or dApp, to communicate with a blockchain. They let you query data (like your balance) or send transactions. How does Pocket Network’s model differ from traditional providers? Traditional providers (e.g., Infura) run centralized server clusters. Pocket Network is decentralized, distributing requests across thousands of independent node operators, which improves uptime and reduces censorship risk. What is the deflationary effect mentioned for the POKT token? The protocol burns a portion of the POKT tokens used to pay for RPC services. As usage increases (like from the GetBlock deal), more tokens are burned, reducing the total supply over time, which can be positive for the token’s value if demand holds. Will this partnership make GetBlock’s services cheaper for developers? Potentially, yes. By accessing Pocket Network RPC services at wholesale prices, GetBlock lowers its own infrastructure costs. These savings can be passed on to its customers, offering more competitive pricing plans. Which blockchains are supported through this partnership? GetBlock will have access to all blockchain networks supported by Pocket Network. This includes major chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and many others, providing wide coverage for developers. How does this improve reliability for end-users? Decentralization means there is no single point of failure. If one node goes offline, the network automatically routes requests to other available nodes, ensuring consistent service availability. Found this deep dive into the pivotal Pocket Network and GetBlock partnership insightful? This kind of infrastructure development is crucial for web3’s growth.

PayPal seeks bank status to expand lending and join fintech boom PayPal’s recent plan aims to increase the company’s small-business lending capacity and decrease its reliance on third-party financial partners , the company said in a press release on Monday. If approved by regulators, PayPal Bank would open the door for the payments juggernaut to offer deposits insured by the FDIC, streamline lending for loans, and potentially roll out interest-bearing savings products as part of its broader consumer finance portfolio. Strengthening PayPal’s balance-sheet capabilities will help combat the lingering capital challenges faced by small businesses nationwide, PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said. This application comes amid a notable surge in banking charter activity among both fintech and cryptocurrency‑linked firms. Just a few days ago, in the wake of this situation, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted conditional preliminary approvals to a handful of crypto and digital asset companies, including Circle Internet Group, Ripple Labs , BitGo, Paxos, and Fidelity Digital Assets, to establish or convert into federally chartered national trust banks. These are critical moves in integrating crypto companies into the mainstream banking industry, but final permitting and full functionality will depend on a plethora of regulatory prerequisites. Unlike some of these crypto firms, which are pursuing national trust bank charters under federal oversight to provide custody, payments, and asset management services, PayPal’s charter bid is focused on expanding lending and deposit services within its existing ecosystem. And yet, the move is part of a larger pattern in the U.S. regulatory landscape today, which is much more amenable to innovation and the entry of non-traditional players into banking. Regulatory shifts spur bank charter rush The new momentum around bank charters for digital finance companies stems from policy changes and regulatory signals this year that have relaxed barriers for non-bank entrants. The regulatory clarity offered by a federal charter provides crypto firms with more access and a deeper connection to banks in such a national market, even as some trade groups, as well as traditional banks themselves, question risk standards and definitions of banking authority. Beyond the now-approved crypto firms, Nissan Motor Co.’s financing arm applied for the same charter that PayPal pursued earlier this year, and Japan’s Sony Group Corp. has also applied to become a bank. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, interest in becoming a bank has jumped compared to the Biden administration’s term, when very few applications were submitted, let alone considered, based on an understanding that approval would be challenging. If PayPal’s application is approved, Mara McNeill, a former CEO of Toyota Motor Corp.’s financing arm, is expected to oversee the new bank, guiding PayPal’s next step in integrating conventional banking capabilities with its global payments network.

SBI Holdings, one of the country’s largest financial groups, has announced plans to launch a groundbreaking yen stablecoin in the second quarter of 2026. This move represents a significant step toward bridging traditional finance with the emerging world of digital assets. What Makes This Yen Stablecoin So Important? Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, a yen stablecoin is a digital currency pegged 1:1 to the Japanese yen. This means it maintains stable value while offering the benefits of blockchain technology. SBI’s announcement comes through a strategic partnership with Startale, a Web3 joint venture between tech giant Sony and the Astar Foundation. This collaboration brings together traditional financial expertise with cutting-edge blockchain innovation. The timing is crucial as Japan positions itself as a leader in regulated digital asset adoption. The planned 2026 launch gives regulators and institutions time to prepare for this new financial instrument. Why Should You Care About a Yen Stablecoin? This development matters for several reasons. First, it represents institutional validation of stablecoin technology. When a major player like SBI enters the space, it signals serious commitment to blockchain’s future. Second, this yen stablecoin could transform how people and businesses handle digital transactions. Consider these potential benefits: Faster cross-border payments without traditional banking delays Reduced transaction costs compared to conventional methods 24/7 availability unlike traditional banking hours Programmable money for automated business processes However, challenges remain. Regulatory compliance, security concerns, and public adoption will determine the project’s success. The partnership with Startale suggests SBI is addressing these issues head-on. How Will This Yen Stablecoin Impact Japan’s Economy? The introduction of a regulated yen stablecoin could accelerate Japan’s digital transformation. Financial services, e-commerce, and international trade could all benefit from more efficient digital payment systems. Moreover, this move positions Japan competitively in the global race for central bank digital currency (CBDC) innovation. While the Bank of Japan explores a digital yen, private sector initiatives like SBI’s yen stablecoin could complement official efforts. The Web3 expertise from Startale, backed by Sony’s technological prowess and Astar’s blockchain experience, creates a powerful foundation. This partnership demonstrates how traditional corporations can successfully navigate the Web3 space through strategic collaborations. What Does This Mean for Global Stablecoin Adoption? SBI’s announcement signals growing institutional interest in stablecoins beyond the US dollar. As more countries develop their own national stablecoins, we might see a more diversified global digital currency landscape. This Japanese yen stablecoin could serve as a model for other nations considering similar initiatives. The careful planning with a 2026 timeline shows responsible development rather than rushed implementation. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this represents another step toward mainstream adoption. When major financial institutions embrace blockchain technology, it validates the entire sector’s potential. Conclusion: A New Era for Japanese Finance SBI Holdings’ planned yen stablecoin launch in 2026 represents a watershed moment for Japanese finance. By combining traditional financial strength with innovative blockchain technology through the Startale partnership, SBI is positioning Japan at the forefront of digital currency innovation. This development promises to make digital transactions more efficient, accessible, and integrated with global financial systems. As we approach 2026, watch how this project evolves and potentially transforms Japan’s financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What is a yen stablecoin?

Valued at approximately $505 million, this single transaction represents a seismic shift of capital that has analysts and traders scrambling to decipher its meaning. What does such a colossal BTC transfer signal for the market’s future? What Does This Massive BTC Transfer Actually Mean? When a BTC transfer of this magnitude occurs, it’s rarely a simple retail transaction. This movement of nearly 6,000 Bitcoin out of a custodial exchange like Coinbase and into a private wallet is a classic ‘whale’ behavior. Typically, this action suggests the entity behind the move is planning for long-term holding, often referred to as ‘cold storage.’ Therefore, this could be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, as the coins are being withdrawn from the immediate selling pressure of an exchange. Who Could Be Behind the Mystery Wallet? The ‘unknown’ nature of the receiving wallet is what fuels intense speculation. While the identity is hidden, the possibilities are fascinating. It could point to several key players: A Major Institution: A hedge fund, corporation, or pension fund establishing a new treasury reserve. A Crypto Whale Consolidating: An individual or entity moving assets from an exchange to a more secure, self-custodied wallet. Preparation for an ETF or Financial Product: An entity possibly preparing coins for use in a regulated product. The sheer size makes an institutional player the most likely candidate, highlighting the growing institutional footprint in the crypto space. How Do Large BTC Transfers Impact Market Sentiment? Large BTC transfers are more than just on-chain data; they are powerful psychological signals. The immediate market reaction often involves a mix of curiosity and caution. On one hand, moving coins off an exchange reduces readily available supply, which can be a bullish indicator. On the other hand, the mystery creates uncertainty. Traders watch closely to see if this is an isolated event or the start of a trend. Historically, accumulation by whales during price consolidation phases has often preceded significant upward movements. What Should Everyday Investors Take Away? For the average investor, this event is a masterclass in on-chain analytics. It underscores the importance of watching whale wallets and exchange flows. While you shouldn’t make impulsive trades based on one BTC transfer , it’s a crucial data point. It reinforces key principles: Transparency: The Bitcoin network makes all large movements public. Holder Sentiment: Large-scale withdrawal suggests a ‘HODL’ mindset among big players. Market Maturity: Half-billion dollar movements are becoming more common, signaling deeper liquidity. The Final Verdict on This $505 Million Move This colossal BTC transfer from Coinbase is a definitive show of strength. It demonstrates that high-net-worth players are actively managing Bitcoin positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars with long-term conviction. Rather than signaling an imminent sell-off, the move to an unknown wallet suggests these coins are being taken off the market for safekeeping. This action aligns with a broader narrative of Bitcoin as a digital gold for the modern era, where secure, long-term storage is paramount for major holders. The mystery adds intrigue, but the underlying message is one of steadfast accumulation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a BTC transfer from an exchange to a private wallet bullish? A: Generally, yes. It reduces the immediate selling supply on exchanges and indicates the holder intends to store the asset long-term, which is seen as a confident move. Q: Why is the wallet ‘unknown’? A: Bitcoin wallets are pseudonymous. While the transaction and balance are public on the blockchain, the identity of the owner is not, unless they choose to reveal it. Q: Could this be a sign of selling pressure? A: It’s unlikely. If the entity planned to sell soon, they would typically keep the coins on the exchange for faster execution. Transferring to a private wallet usually precedes holding. Q: How can I track large BTC transfers myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or dedicated alert services like Whale Alert, which monitor and tweet about large transactions in real-time. Q: What’s the difference between this and a BTC transfer to another exchange? A: A transfer to another exchange often signals intent to trade or sell across different markets. A transfer to a new, private wallet strongly suggests withdrawal for custody. Q: Has this affected Bitcoin’s price? A: Single transactions rarely cause immediate, direct price spikes. However, they significantly influence market sentiment and trader psychology, which can affect price trends over time.

The Wyoming-based digital asset bank is not accepting defeat after a federal court sided with the Federal Reserve. Instead, it has formally requested a rehearing, arguing the court got the law wrong. This fight centers on one crucial asset: a Federal Reserve master account . The outcome will determine if innovative financial institutions can fully integrate into the core of the U.S. payment system. Why is a Custodia Bank master account such a big deal? Think of a Federal Reserve master account as a direct line to the heart of the U.S. financial system. It’s not just another bank account. For qualified institutions, it allows them to move money, settle transactions, and access essential services directly with the Fed. This eliminates the need for an intermediary bank, which can reduce costs, increase speed, and provide greater control. For a crypto-native bank like Custodia, securing this master account is the holy grail of legitimacy and operational efficiency. It’s the key to bridging the traditional financial world with the digital asset ecosystem. What happened in the courtroom? The battle hit a major hurdle in October when the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s decision to deny Custodia’s application. The court ruled the Fed had broad discretion in these matters. However, Custodia’s legal team is now striking back. They contend the appellate panel misinterpreted the law, specifically the provisions granting special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs) like Custodia the right to access Fed services. Their rehearing petition argues this misinterpretation creates a dangerous precedent, effectively allowing the Fed to arbitrarily block state-chartered banks from the payments system. What are the core arguments in the rehearing request? Custodia’s filing is a detailed rebuttal. Let’s break down their main points: Legal Misinterpretation: The bank argues the court incorrectly applied the law, failing to recognize the statutory rights granted to it as a Wyoming SPDI. Precedent Risk: They warn that letting the ruling stand gives the Federal Reserve unchecked power to deny access to any state-chartered bank, stifling competition and innovation. Regulatory Clarity: A final decision will provide much-needed clarity for other crypto and fintech firms seeking to operate within a regulated banking framework. How does this impact the future of crypto banking? This is far more than just one company’s legal struggle. The quest for a Custodia Bank master account is a landmark test case. A successful rehearing and eventual victory for Custodia would tear down a significant barrier. It would signal that compliant crypto banks can achieve parity with traditional banks, potentially unleashing a wave of regulated innovation in digital asset custody and payments. Conversely, if the denial is finalized, it could cement a two-tiered system, pushing crypto services further to the fringes of finance and relying on less transparent intermediaries. What’s the potential ripple effect? The implications extend beyond Wyoming or crypto. This case challenges the boundaries of the Federal Reserve’s authority and the states’ rights to charter innovative banks. It asks a fundamental question: who gets to participate in the core of American finance? The answer will influence: State Innovation: Wyoming’s pioneering SPDI charter model. Banking Competition: The entry of new, technology-driven players. Consumer Access: To safer, regulated crypto banking services. The final verdict is still pending Custodia Bank’s fight for a Federal Reserve master account is entering a crucial new phase with this rehearing request. The legal maneuvering highlights the intense growing pains as digital assets seek a permanent home within the established financial order. While the court deliberates, the entire fintech and crypto industry watches closely. The decision will either open the door for a new era of integrated, regulated digital finance or reinforce the walls guarding the traditional system. One thing is certain: the battle for the Custodia Bank master account is a defining conflict for the future of money. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Federal Reserve master account? A master account is an account held directly with a Federal Reserve Bank. It allows eligible institutions, like banks and credit unions, to conduct transactions (e.g., wire transfers, check clearing) directly with the Fed without going through another commercial bank. Why was Custodia Bank’s master account application denied? The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City denied the application, citing concerns over Custodia’s business model and risk profile as a crypto-focused bank. The 10th Circuit Court later upheld the Fed’s broad authority to make such denials, a decision Custodia is now challenging. What is a Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI)? An SPDI is a novel type of bank charter created by the state of Wyoming. It is designed to cater to businesses dealing in digital assets, providing them with banking services while requiring them to hold 100% reserves of their clients’ fiat deposits. What happens if Custodia wins the rehearing? If the court grants a rehearing and eventually rules in Custodia’s favor, it could force the Federal Reserve to reconsider the application under a different legal standard. It would be a major victory for the crypto banking sector and state banking innovation. How long could this legal process take? Legal proceedings, especially appeals and rehearings, can be lengthy. The court must first decide whether to grant the rehearing petition. If granted, new briefs and arguments will follow. A final resolution could take many more months or even years. Does this affect other crypto companies? Absolutely. This case sets a critical precedent. A win for Custodia would pave a clearer regulatory path for other crypto firms seeking banking partnerships or charters. A loss would likely mean continued difficulties in accessing core banking infrastructure. Found this deep dive into the Custodia Bank legal battle insightful?

A recent on-chain revelation underscores this volatility with a stark example. A prominent early Bitcoin investor, often called a ‘Bitcoin OG,’ is currently facing an unrealized loss of approximately $54 million on a series of massive crypto long positions . This situation offers a powerful lesson in market risk and portfolio management for every trader. Who Is the Bitcoin OG Facing Massive Losses? On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens identified the investor by a wallet address starting with ‘1011short·oxb317d’. This entity is not a small-time trader. The scale of their activity reveals them as a major player, or ‘whale,’ in the crypto space. Their total exposure across three major cryptocurrencies was over $600 million, demonstrating significant conviction in their bullish outlook. However, the market’s recent movements have turned that conviction into a costly waiting game. How Did These Crypto Long Positions Unravel? The investor’s strategy was a straightforward bet on the continued rise of top assets. They opened large crypto long positions , meaning they bought assets expecting their value to increase. Let’s break down the specifics of these positions that have now slipped into the red: Ethereum (ETH): A position of 190,935 ETH, valued at $563 million, with an average entry price of $3,167. Bitcoin (BTC): A position of 1,000 BTC, worth $85.93 million, entered at an average price of $91,506. Solana (SOL): A position of 250,000 SOL, amounting to $31.53 million, with an average entry price of $137.53. When current market prices fell below these entry points, the paper losses began to accumulate, culminating in the reported $54 million deficit. This scenario highlights a critical truth: even well-capitalized veterans are not immune to market downturns. What Can Traders Learn From This $54M Lesson? This event is more than just a headline; it’s a case study in risk. First, it shows the danger of over-concentration, even in blue-chip assets. Second, it emphasizes that ‘unrealized loss’ is a key term. The investor has not sold, meaning this is a paper loss that could reverse if prices recover. However, holding through such drawdowns requires immense capital and psychological fortitude. For everyday investors, the takeaway is clear. Managing crypto long positions requires a disciplined strategy. This includes: Diversification: Spreading risk across different assets and strategies. Risk Management: Using stop-loss orders or position sizing to limit potential downside. Emotional Discipline: Avoiding panic selling during downturns or reckless doubling down. Is This a Sign of Broader Market Trouble? While one whale’s crypto long positions turning sour is significant, it does not necessarily predict a market collapse. Large investors often employ complex strategies, including hedging on other platforms. This single data point reflects individual risk, not a systemic failure. However, it does serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility in crypto markets and the importance of conducting thorough research before committing capital. Conclusion: Navigating the High Seas of Crypto Investment The story of the Bitcoin OG’s $54 million paper loss is a sobering reminder of the risks inherent in cryptocurrency trading. It demonstrates that crypto long positions , while a common bullish strategy, carry substantial risk if not managed with extreme care. The market does not discriminate based on tenure or portfolio size. For all traders, the fundamentals of prudent investing—research, diversification, and risk management—remain the most reliable compass in these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘unrealized loss’ mean in this context? A1: An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an asset that an investor still holds. The loss is ‘on paper’ because the asset has not been sold. If the investor sells at the lower price, the loss becomes realized. Q2: What is a ‘Bitcoin OG’ or ‘crypto whale’? A2: A ‘Bitcoin OG’ (Original Gangster) typically refers to an early adopter who has held Bitcoin since its early days. A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices. Q3: Could this investor recover from this loss? A3: Yes, absolutely. Since the loss is unrealized, if the market prices for BTC, ETH, and SOL rise back above their average entry prices, the loss will decrease and eventually turn into a profit. The key question is their ability to hold the position until that happens. Q4: Should I be worried about my own crypto investments? A4: This event highlights the importance of your personal risk management. Evaluate your own portfolio’s concentration, ensure you haven’t invested more than you can afford to lose, and consider if your strategy aligns with your risk tolerance. Do not base decisions solely on one investor’s situation. Q5: What are ‘long positions’? A5: A long position is the buying of an asset with the expectation that its value will increase over time. It is the most common investment strategy. In contrast, a ‘short position’ is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. Found this deep dive into high-stakes crypto trading insightful?

According to a report, individuals close to Trump have privately expressed concerns about Hassett’s candidacy , arguing his deep alignment with the president could undermine perceptions of the Fed’s independence and unsettle financial markets. . Some advisers reportedly fear that nominating a loyalist could further politicize the central bank. Surprisingly, this connection had earlier made Hassett a top candidate to assume Jerome Powell’s current position. Meanwhile, after this news leaked, reports mentioned that this opposition may clarify why interviews with candidates in early December were called off and later rescheduled for Kevin Warsh last week. Uncertainties surrounding the fate of the next Fed chair spark concerns Trump declared that he has already settled on who to serve as the chair of the Federal Reserve. This statement caught many by surprise after the president publicly claimed that Kevin Warsh, the former Fed Governor who is currently serving as the acting economic advisor to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a member of the board of directors at UPS, rose as the leading contender alongside Hassett. Trump’s remarks significantly affected Hassett’s odds, causing them to drastically drop on Kalshi prediction markets. Seeing how things turned out, the president argued, “I think the two Kevins are great.” Nonetheless, Monday reports noted that Hassett is still in the lead on Kalshi, with his odds showing a 51% chance. However, this percentage illustrates a decrease from more than 80% odds raised earlier this month. Warsh, on the other hand, experienced a substantial increase in odds, rising to a 44% chance from around 11% at the beginning of December. Analysts researched the situation and discovered that the current opposition appeared to be concentrated more on backing Warsh instead of criticizing Hassett. It also seems that apart from Trump, Jamie Dimon, the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase , preferred the former Fed governor. However, he positively talked about both Hassett and Warsh. In the meantime, a reliable source highlighted that Hassett outperformed his competitors in the race by taking Powell’s position at the end of November. Notably, Powell’s term is scheduled to conclude in May next year. Still, several sources emphasized that Hassett encountered some opposition as December progressed. Following this assertion, individuals raised concerns that the bond market might respond negatively if it perceived him as being too closely connected to the US president. This perception could produce a contrary result from what Trump expects, potentially leading to a surge in long-term yields due to escalating fears that Hassett will not adopt strong measures to address inflation in the event of its increase. Hassett embraced a stronger stance despite facing criticism Responding to this criticism, Hassett embraced a stronger stance on the issue of Federal Reserve independence. He made this move during an interview held this past weekend. In an appearance on “Face the Nation,” Hassett shared a transcript stating that, ‘Trump has strong and well-reasoned ideas about what we should do. However, the Federal Reserve’s role is to remain independent and collaborate with the Board of Governors and the FOMC to reach a consensus on interest rates.” This statement drew the attention of several reports, prompting them to reach out to Hassett for comment on the topic of discussion. When asked whether Trump’s opinion held the same essence as that of a central bank member voting, Hassett stated that it did not. He further explained that the president had no influence and his opinion only counted if it was rooted in solid data.

According to the analyst, XRP is undergoing a standard consolidation period following a strong upward move, with conditions still favoring a continuation of the broader bullish trend over the coming months. XRP recently slipped below the $2 level after spending several weeks trading within a narrow range. This price movement has coincided with a broader market slowdown that has weighed on most major digital assets, pushing the total cryptocurrency market valuation down to approximately $3.13 trillion. Despite this backdrop, some analysts maintain that XRP’s technical structure remains constructive. Bullish Outlook Remains Intact Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto reiterated his positive stance on XRP in a recent public update, stating that the probability of a bullish continuation remains high . He emphasized that the ongoing pullback does not represent exhaustion at the top of the market but instead reflects a temporary cooling-off period after a strong rally. #XRP – 3 to 6 Month Outlook Ignoring the percentages on the formation and focusing purely on market structure, the higher-probability scenario is UP, not down. Here’s why 1⃣Regime Shift Already Happened: #XRP broke out of a multi-year base and printed an impulsive leg.… pic.twitter.com/XN2JwZpO7h — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 13, 2025 According to EGRAG, XRP’s most recent upward move began when the asset broke out from a long-standing base that had constrained its price action for several years. This breakout occurred around the $0.50 region in late 2024, after which XRP advanced sharply to a high of approximately $3.39 in January. The price later extended further, recording another peak near $3.67 in July. Following this advance, XRP entered a phase characterized by reduced momentum and sideways movement. EGRAG explained that this transition is typical after a strong impulsive move, as markets often pause to absorb gains before determining the next directional move. In his assessment, this behavior supports the argument that the broader trend has not yet concluded. Key Technical Levels Support the Trend One of the central points in EGRAG’s analysis is XRP’s position relative to long-term moving averages. He highlighted that XRP continues to trade above its 21-month exponential moving average, which currently sits near the $1.90 level. Remaining above this indicator is often interpreted as a sign that longer-term bullish conditions are still in place. At the same time, XRP has fallen below the 9-month exponential moving average, positioned around $2.29, which reflects short-term weakness. However, EGRAG noted that temporary moves below shorter-term indicators are not unusual during consolidation phases and do not automatically invalidate the broader trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that previous XRP cycles have involved extended periods of sideways or downward movement before resuming an upward trajectory. As a result, the current decline does not represent a new development for long-term holders. According to his analysis, the bullish outlook would only be challenged if XRP were to record sustained monthly closes below the $1.80 to $1.60 range. Three to Six Month Price Expectations Looking ahead, EGRAG shared his expectations for XRP over the next three to six months. He stated that, based on the current market structure, the asset is more likely to resume upward movement than to experience a prolonged decline. His outlook assumes that XRP will continue to hold above the 21-month exponential moving average and gradually rebuild momentum. Under this scenario, EGRAG’s technical projections suggest that XRP could eventually move toward a new all-time high. His chart analysis suggests a potential target near $9.50, although he emphasized that increased volatility should be expected along the way. From current price levels, such a move would represent a substantial percentage gain. This target aligns with price levels EGRAG has referenced in previous analyses. In earlier commentary, he outlined scenarios where XRP could advance toward the $9.60 area, with longer-term projections extending significantly higher if broader market conditions and adoption trends remain favorable. While acknowledging that market conditions can change, the analyst concluded that XRP’s current structure supports patience rather than panic, particularly for investors focused on the medium-term outlook.

55851131,645196,1765850412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55851131.jpeg,Wall Street Keeps Buying XRP: US Spot ETFs Post 19-Day Inflow Streak,https://bitcoinist.com/wall-street-xrp-us-spot-etfs-19-day-inflow-streak/,"US-listed spot XRP ETFs just put together a streak that’s hard to ignore: 19 straight trading days of net inflows, with zero outflow sessions over the run, according to daily flow data compiled by Sosovalue. The numbers add up quickly. By Dec. 12, cumulative net inflows sat at $974.50 million, while total net assets across the products were shown at roughly $1.18 billion. XRP ETFs Log 19 Straight Trading Days Of Inflows The early days did most of the heavy lifting . Sosovalue’s table shows $243.05 million of net inflow on Nov. 14, then another surge on Nov. 24 ($164.04 million). There were also chunky adds on Nov. 20 ($118.15 million) and Dec. 1 ($89.65 million). Even as the pace cooled, inflows didn’t flip—Dec. 8 posted $38.04 million, and Dec. 12 added another $20.17 million. On X, Bitmern Mining founder and CEO Giannis Andreou framed it bluntly today: “19 consecutive trading days of inflows. Zero outflow days. Nearly $1B in net capital added.” He called it “sustained institutional positioning,” not retail froth. That “institutional bid” angle is also showing up in the asset rankings. In a Dec. 13 post, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg pointed to a separate snapshot of the US crypto ETP landscape showing XRP products now edging out Solana by total assets under management. Bloomberg Intelligence data in the chart puts XRP ETP assets at about $1.638 billion, just ahead of Solana at $1.566 billion, in a market where Bitcoin still towers over everything at $125.425 billion and Ethereum sits at $22.019 billion. McClurg’s explanation for the flip was less about Solana underperforming and more about where each asset “fits” in the wrapper trade. “SOL ETFs launched before XRP, but XRP ETFs have now passed SOL in total AUM. I expected this ,” McClurg wrote, adding “SOL is much more efficient to hold on-chain and to stake directly for retail audiences, whereas XRP has more institutional demand and no staking. As with everything, there will be an audience that prefers direct ownership, and an audience that prefers the ease of financial instruments. Some will do both.” Notably, from Dec. 8 to Dec. 12, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $287 million for the week, while Ethereum spot ETFs saw weekly net inflows of $209 million. SOL spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $33.6 million. At press time, XRP once again fell below the $2 mark. The token traded at $1.98 and thus at the key support zone. A drop below the red support band could strengthen the bear case for a deeper crash to the 100-week or even 200-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). XRP visited the latter during the October 10 crash.",XRP|Spot XRP ETFs|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-16 02:00:12

Cardano SuperTrend Has Flipped Bearish In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has appeared in the SuperTrend of Cardano. The “SuperTrend” refers to a TA indicator that’s generally used for determining whether a given asset is following a bearish or bullish trend. It’s built using the Average True Range (ATR), another TA indicator that measures the degree of volatility being experienced by the price. Related Reading: XRP Mildly Undervalued On MVRV: What About Bitcoin, Ethereum? The SuperTrend is represented by a single trendline that acts as both support and resistance, depending on which side the asset is trading. When the price is above this line, the indicator signals that the asset is in a bullish trend. On the other hand, being under the line implies the dominance of a bearish trajectory. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the SuperTrend of Cardano over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the weekly Cardano price broke above the SuperTrend line during 2023 and stayed over it throughout 2024 and much of 2025. Recently, however, the price has finally seen a reversal of trend, with the indicator now giving a bearish signal instead. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time that this pattern developed in ADA’s 1-week price. It would appear that the flip to a bearish trend led to a decline of more than 80% for the cryptocurrency in 2022. It now remains to be seen whether the SuperTrend giving a sell signal is foreshadowing something similar this time, or if Cardano will see the renewal of bullish momentum despite the pattern. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Forms Signal That Last Led To 95% Price Rally Cardano isn’t the only coin in the sector that has seen a flip in the SuperTrend recently. As the analyst has highlighted in another X post, the number one cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has also seen a change in its SuperTrend. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the weekly price of Bitcoin is now trading under the SuperTrend line, a sign that a bearish trend is taking over. Like for Cardano, the last time this flip happened was in the last bear market. Back then, BTC dropped by over 60%. ADA Price Cardano saw brief recovery above $0.48 last week, but the cryptocurrency has since witnessed a retrace as its price is now back at $0.40.

This pivotal deal merges social media marketing expertise with established Dogecoin and Litecoin mining operations, creating a new entity called Datacentrex. The transaction signals a significant evolution in how public companies approach cryptocurrency integration and revenue diversification. What Does the Thumzup Acquisition Mean for Investors? The completed Thumzup acquisition represents more than a simple corporate purchase. It marks a fundamental shift in business strategy. Thumzup, previously focused on social media marketing, now gains direct exposure to cryptocurrency mining revenue streams through Dogehash’s established operations. This vertical integration creates a unique hybrid model in the public markets. Investors should note the immediate practical outcome: the company begins trading on Nasdaq under the new ticker DTCX on December 16. The rebrand to Datacentrex reflects this expanded operational focus beyond its original marketing roots. Understanding the New Datacentrex Business Model Following the Thumzup acquisition, the newly formed Datacentrex operates on a clear two-part model. First, it continues the core Dogecoin and Litecoin mining operations acquired from Dogehash. Second, it implements a novel treasury strategy by reinvesting a portion of mining profits directly back into cryptocurrencies. The company has announced it will strategically allocate mining revenue into three major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC) as a long-term store of value Dogecoin (DOGE) to support its existing mining infrastructure Litecoin (LTC) to maintain operational continuity This approach creates a self-reinforcing cycle where mining operations fund further crypto asset accumulation. Why This Thumzup Acquisition Matters for Crypto Markets This transaction carries substantial symbolic weight for cryptocurrency adoption. A Nasdaq-listed company is not just investing in crypto, but actively acquiring and operating mining infrastructure. This move provides several key benefits: Enhanced Legitimacy: Brings cryptocurrency mining further into the regulated public market sphere Revenue Diversification: Creates hybrid revenue streams from both traditional marketing and crypto mining Strategic Positioning: Positions Datacentrex at the intersection of digital marketing and blockchain infrastructure However, challenges remain, including cryptocurrency volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and the technical demands of maintaining mining operations. The Future Roadmap for Datacentrex Post-Acquisition With the Thumzup acquisition complete, attention turns to execution. The success of Datacentrex will depend on several factors. Efficient mining operations must generate sufficient revenue to justify the acquisition cost. The treasury management strategy requires disciplined execution amid market fluctuations. Furthermore, the company must effectively communicate its dual identity to investors accustomed to its previous marketing focus. The December 16 Nasdaq relisting under DTCX provides the first major test of market reception. Investor response will indicate whether the market values this unique combination of digital marketing and cryptocurrency mining. Actionable Insights from This Corporate Evolution This Thumzup acquisition offers valuable lessons for both crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors. It demonstrates how established companies can pivot toward blockchain technologies through strategic acquisitions. The deal highlights the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency operations within conventional corporate structures. Moreover, it showcases a practical model for recycling crypto mining profits into further digital asset accumulation. For investors monitoring this space, key metrics to watch include: Mining efficiency and cost metrics post-acquisition Quarterly revenue breakdown between marketing and mining segments Execution of the stated cryptocurrency investment strategy Market valuation relative to pure-play mining companies Conclusion: A Transformative Moment in Crypto Integration The completed Thumzup acquisition of Dogehash represents a watershed moment in cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream financial integration. By transforming into Datacentrex, the company creates a novel blueprint for how public firms can bridge traditional business and blockchain operations. The strategic decision to reinvest mining revenue directly into cryptocurrency assets demonstrates sophisticated treasury management thinking. As Datacentrex begins trading as DTCX, it carries the potential to inspire similar hybrid models, accelerating institutional crypto adoption through practical, revenue-generating operations rather than speculative investment alone. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Thumzup acquire? Thumzup acquired Dogehash Technologies, a company operating Dogecoin and Litecoin mining infrastructure, in a complete acquisition that includes all mining assets and operations. When will Datacentrex start trading on Nasdaq? The company is scheduled to begin trading under the new ticker symbol DTCX on December 16, following the completion of the acquisition and rebranding process. What cryptocurrencies will Datacentrex invest in? The company plans to strategically invest its mining revenue into three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). Why is this acquisition significant? It represents a Nasdaq-listed company moving beyond cryptocurrency investment to actively owning and operating mining infrastructure, signaling deeper institutional adoption. What happens to Thumzup’s original marketing business? While the company rebrands to Datacentrex, it will likely continue its social media marketing operations alongside the new mining business, creating a diversified revenue model. What are the main risks for the new Datacentrex? Key risks include cryptocurrency price volatility affecting mining profitability, regulatory changes impacting crypto operations, and execution challenges in integrating two different business models.

The Chairman of Fundstrat and Bitmine recently took to social media to reinforce his bullish stance, suggesting that recent price adjustments in high-potential assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are moments for investors to pay close attention. But what’s the reasoning behind this confident call? Why Is This a Prime Buying Opportunity? Tom Lee points to a key market dynamic. He notes that assets with significant long-term growth potential, including artificial intelligence (AI), Bitcoin, and Ethereum, are currently hypersensitive to shifts in overall risk perception. When macroeconomic fears or negative headlines surface, these assets often experience exaggerated price drops. However, Lee argues this creates a disconnect. The short-term volatility masks their strong underlying fundamentals and future prospects. Therefore, a price dip is not a signal to sell, but a chance to acquire assets at a more attractive entry point before their long-term narrative resumes. Putting Money Where the Mouth Is: The Bitmine Example Lee’s view isn’t just theoretical talk. His associated company, Bitmine, recently demonstrated this conviction with a massive, real-world move. Reports confirmed that Bitmine purchased a staggering $321 million worth of Ethereum last week. This substantial investment during a period of market uncertainty serves as a powerful example of institutional faith. It shows that major players are actively treating downturns as a strategic buying opportunity to build positions, backing their optimistic outlook with significant capital. How Should Investors Approach This Opportunity? Understanding the theory is one thing, but acting on it requires a clear strategy. For individual investors, Lee’s perspective offers a crucial framework for navigating crypto volatility. Look Beyond the Headline Fear: Separate short-term market noise from long-term technological trends. Ask yourself if the core value proposition of Bitcoin or Ethereum has changed. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the absolute bottom, consider spreading purchases over time. This method reduces risk and systematically builds a position, turning every dip into a partial buying opportunity . Focus on Fundamentals: Evaluate the health of the network, developer activity, and adoption metrics, not just the price chart. Strong fundamentals often support recovery and growth. What Are the Risks and Challenges? While the potential is compelling, it’s vital to acknowledge the challenges. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and prices can fall further after any dip. Furthermore, the “risk-on” nature Lee describes means these assets could remain under pressure if broader economic conditions worsen. Therefore, any decision to buy must be part of a personalized plan. Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Maintain a well-diversified portfolio beyond crypto. Prepare for potential further short-term volatility even after buying. Conclusion: A Lesson in Conviction Tom Lee’s analysis cuts through the typical fear surrounding market dips. He reframes them as necessary phases that create valuable entry windows for forward-thinking investors. The key takeaway is to assess whether an asset’s long-term story remains intact. For Bitcoin and Ethereum, many believe the narrative of digital scarcity and programmable blockchain utility is stronger than ever. When viewed through this lens, a market correction transforms from a threat into a strategic buying opportunity . The recent action by Bitmine underscores that this isn’t just optimistic commentary—it’s a strategy being executed at the highest levels. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who is Tom Lee and why should I listen to him? A: Tom Lee is the Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors and Chairman of Bitmine. He is a well-known Wall Street strategist who has been analyzing markets for decades and is a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency space, often cited for his data-driven approaches. Q: Does this mean the price of BTC and ETH will go up immediately? A: Not necessarily. Calling a dip a buying opportunity is a strategic, long-term perspective. It suggests the price is attractive relative to future potential, but it does not guarantee short-term gains. Markets can remain volatile. Q: What does “risk perception” mean in this context? A> It refers to the overall appetite for risk among investors. When news about inflation, interest rates, or geopolitics makes investors fearful, they often sell riskier assets (like tech stocks and crypto) first, causing prices to drop more sharply than less volatile assets. Q: Is Bitmine’s $321M ETH purchase a guarantee of success? A> No single trade is a guarantee. However, it is a strong signal of institutional conviction. It shows that a major entity with significant resources is willing to back its belief in Ethereum’s future with substantial capital, even during uncertain times. Q: Should I invest all my savings based on this advice? A> Absolutely not. This perspective should inform your research, not replace it. Always practice sound risk management, diversify your investments, and never commit funds you cannot afford to lose. Consider it one data point in your broader strategy.

The platform officially designated the Myro token for investment caution , raising serious questions about this meme-inspired cryptocurrency’s future. If you’re holding MYRO or considering it, you need to understand exactly what this warning means and why it matters for your portfolio. Why Did Coinone Issue This MYRO Investment Caution? Coinone didn’t make this decision lightly. The exchange provided specific reasons for flagging MYRO, and understanding them is crucial for any investor. According to their announcement, the primary concern revolves around insufficient community activity. However, that’s just the surface issue. The exchange also expressed deeper worries about the project’s long-term viability and operational sustainability. This investment caution designation serves as a formal warning to users. Coinone essentially states that continuing to trade or hold MYRO might expose investors to unnecessary risk. The exchange cited “potential for harm to users” as a key factor in their decision-making process. What Does ‘Investment Caution’ Really Mean for MYRO? When an exchange like Coinone designates a token for investment caution , it’s not a trading halt or delisting—yet. However, it represents a significant red flag that often precedes more severe actions. Here’s what this designation typically involves: Increased scrutiny: The token receives closer monitoring from exchange compliance teams Warning labels: Trading pages display caution notices to inform users Potential restrictions: Future trading limitations or withdrawal constraints could follow Market impact: Other exchanges often take note and may conduct their own reviews For MYRO specifically, this designation comes at a critical time. The token, inspired by Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s dog, gained popularity during the recent meme coin surge. However, Coinone’s action suggests underlying issues that go beyond typical market volatility. How Serious Are the Community Activity Concerns? Coinone specifically mentioned “insufficient community activity” as a primary reason for their MYRO investment caution designation. But what does this actually mean for a cryptocurrency project? A vibrant community typically indicates several positive factors: Sustained developer engagement and project updates Active social media discussions and problem-solving Regular community events, AMAs, or governance participation Organic growth through word-of-mouth and genuine interest When these elements decline, it often signals deeper problems. A fading community can mean reduced liquidity, slower development, and ultimately, decreased token utility. For MYRO, this warning suggests the initial hype may not have translated into lasting engagement. Should You Be Worried About Your MYRO Holdings? If you’re holding MYRO, Coinone’s investment caution designation warrants immediate attention. However, panic selling isn’t necessarily the right response. Instead, consider these practical steps: Review the project’s recent developments: Check if the team has addressed Coinone’s concerns Monitor community channels: Assess whether engagement is genuinely declining or just shifting platforms Evaluate your risk tolerance: Determine if holding aligns with your investment strategy Watch for exchange responses: See if other platforms follow Coinone’s lead Remember, exchange warnings don’t automatically mean a project will fail. However, they do indicate that professional risk assessors have identified significant concerns that retail investors might overlook. The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Meme Coins Coinone’s action against MYRO reflects a growing trend in cryptocurrency regulation and exchange responsibility. As the market matures, exchanges face increasing pressure to protect users from potentially harmful assets. This MYRO investment caution decision demonstrates how platforms are implementing more sophisticated risk assessment frameworks. For the broader meme coin sector, this serves as a wake-up call. Projects cannot rely solely on initial hype and social media buzz. Sustainable growth requires genuine utility, active development, and—as Coinone emphasized—a truly engaged community. Exchanges are now watching these factors more closely than ever before. Final Verdict: Navigating the MYRO Situation Coinone’s investment caution designation for MYRO represents a significant development that investors cannot ignore. While the token remains tradable, the warning signals legitimate concerns about community engagement and project sustainability. Whether you’re currently holding MYRO or considering it, this situation highlights the importance of thorough due diligence beyond price charts and social media trends. The cryptocurrency market continues evolving toward greater accountability. Exchange warnings like this one help separate serious projects from fleeting trends. For MYRO specifically, the coming weeks will reveal whether the project can address Coinone’s concerns or if this caution will escalate to more severe restrictions. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘investment caution’ mean on Coinone? Investment caution is a warning designation that Coinone applies to tokens showing potential risks to investors. It indicates the exchange has identified concerns about the project’s sustainability, community activity, or other factors that might harm users. Can I still trade MYRO on Coinone after this warning? Yes, the investment caution designation doesn’t automatically stop trading. However, Coinone may add warning notices to the trading interface, and future restrictions could follow if concerns aren’t addressed. Will other exchanges also flag MYRO for caution? There’s no guarantee, but major exchanges often monitor each other’s risk assessments. Coinone’s action might prompt reviews on other platforms, especially if similar concerns exist. How long do projects typically remain under investment caution? There’s no fixed timeline. The designation remains until the exchange determines risks have been adequately addressed or escalates to more severe actions like trading suspensions. Should I sell my MYRO because of this warning? That depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. The warning suggests increased risk, but doesn’t guarantee the project will fail. Conduct your own research and consider your personal financial situation. Can a project recover from an investment caution designation? Yes, if the project addresses the exchange’s concerns—such as revitalizing community engagement or demonstrating improved sustainability—the designation can be removed. Found this analysis helpful?

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.4559 Market cap $486.82M Trading volume (24-hour) $15.92M Circulating supply 1.068B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.4899 24-hour low $0.4545 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.07% (Medium) 50-day SMA $0.5365 14-Day RSI 38.32 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.6909 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is trading below key moving averages, confirming bearish control. Momentum indicators show no bullish divergence yet, limiting bounce potential. If XTZ falls below $0.455, we might see further dips toward $0.43 before buyers reappear. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for December 16, $XTZ has decisively slipped below its mid-range support and is now pressing the lower Bollinger Band around $0.458–$0.455, signaling expanding downside volatility rather than a controlled pullback. The price is firmly below the 20-day SMA, currently near $0.488, which has flipped into dynamic resistance and confirms that the prior consolidation phase has resolved to the downside. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The latest daily candles show consecutive lower closes with weak intraday rebounds, indicating sellers are in control and buyers are failing to defend higher lows. The RSI sits near 36, hovering just above oversold territory, which suggests bearish momentum remains dominant with room for further downside before any technical relief bounce becomes statistically compelling. The MACD is marginally negative and flattening, but not yet curling up, implying downside pressure is slowing slightly rather than reversing. As long as $0.455 fails to reclaim quickly, the daily structure opens risk toward the $0.43–$0.44 zone, while any bounce into $0.488–$0.50 is likely to be sold. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart reinforces the bearish daily narrative, with price trading cleanly below the Alligator averages, which are now fully fanned downward, confirming a trending bearish phase rather than a range. Successive lower highs have capped price beneath $0.48, while the breakdown from $0.47 accelerated sell-side momentum into the $0.455 region. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD is deeply negative with widening red histogram bars, signaling strengthening downside momentum on the intraday level, not divergence. Likewise, the OBV continues to trend lower, confirming that this move is supported by distribution rather than thin liquidity noise. The absence of meaningful bullish divergence on either the MACD or OBV suggests that any short-term bounce would likely be corrective unless the price can reclaim at least $0.48 with accompanying volume. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5804 SELL SMA 5 $0.5646 SELL SMA 10 $0.5467 SELL SMA 21 $0.5192 SELL SMA 50 $0.5365 SELL SMA 100 $0.6077 SELL SMA 200 $0.6909 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5128 SELL EMA 5 $0.5369 SELL EMA 10 $0.5910 SELL EMA 21 $0.6644 SELL EMA 50 $0.7178 SELL EMA 100 $0.7141 SELL EMA 200 $0.7315 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? On both price charts, $XTZ remains vulnerable to a continuation of its downward trend. A brief oversold reaction toward $0.47 is possible, but unless price reclaims and holds above $0.49, rallies are likely to be corrective. Failure to defend $0.455 increases the probability of a deeper sweep into the $0.43–$0.44 demand zone. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Starting December 18th at 9:00 AM UTC, Bithumb will temporarily suspend all deposits and withdrawals for the INJ token. This Bithumb INJ suspension is a planned measure to facilitate a necessary network upgrade on the Injective protocol. While temporary service halts can cause concern, they are often essential for enhancing security, scalability, and overall network performance. This article breaks down everything you need to know about this scheduled maintenance. Why is Bithumb Suspending INJ Transactions? The primary reason for this Bithumb INJ suspension is a scheduled network upgrade on the Injective blockchain. Exchanges like Bithumb proactively halt deposits and withdrawals during such events to protect user funds. This precaution prevents potential transaction errors or losses that could occur if the network state changes mid-transfer. Therefore, this suspension is a standard security practice, not a reaction to any problem. Network upgrades are common in the crypto space. They introduce new features, improve efficiency, and fix bugs. For the Injective network, this upgrade could involve enhancements to its decentralized exchange infrastructure or its cross-chain capabilities. Bithumb’s action ensures a smooth transition for its users once the upgrade is complete. What Does This Mean for Your INJ Holdings? Understanding the scope of this Bithumb INJ suspension is key to managing your assets. Here is a clear breakdown of what is and isn’t affected: Deposits & Withdrawals (Suspended): You cannot send INJ to your Bithumb wallet from an external address, nor can you withdraw INJ from Bithumb to a private wallet. Trading (Likely Unaffected): The suspension typically applies only to moving tokens on and off the exchange. Spot trading of INJ against other cryptocurrencies like KRW or BTC on Bithumb’s internal order book will probably continue as normal. Existing Holdings (Safe): The INJ tokens already in your Bithumb spot wallet remain secure and under your account ownership. The suspension is a functional pause, not a freeze on assets. However, it’s wise to plan ahead. If you need to move INJ for a time-sensitive transaction, such as providing liquidity or participating in a governance vote on the Injective network, you must complete your withdrawal before the 9:00 AM UTC deadline on December 18th. How to Navigate the Suspension Period Staying informed is your best strategy. Mark the start time in your calendar and monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for updates on when services will resume. Exchanges usually provide completion notices through their website and social media channels. Furthermore, use this time to review your overall strategy. Is your portfolio diversified? Are you using secure storage practices? Temporary events like this Bithumb INJ suspension highlight the importance of understanding exchange mechanics and having a plan for different market scenarios. Conclusion: A Routine Step for a Better Network In summary, the temporary Bithumb INJ suspension is a standard, precautionary measure tied to a scheduled Injective network upgrade. It demonstrates Bithumb’s commitment to operational security and a smooth user experience. While it requires some advance planning from traders, such upgrades are ultimately positive, aiming to deliver a more robust and feature-rich blockchain. By understanding the reasons and scope of the halt, you can navigate this brief period with confidence and look forward to the enhanced capabilities it will unlock for the Injective ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still buy or sell INJ on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Most likely, yes. The suspension typically applies only to deposits and withdrawals from external wallets. Trading INJ against other pairs on the exchange’s internal market often continues uninterrupted. Q2: How long will the INJ deposit and withdrawal suspension last? A2: Bithumb has announced the start time but not a specific end time. The duration depends on the complexity of the Injective network upgrade. Monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my INJ tokens safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. Your existing INJ holdings in your Bithumb wallet are not frozen or at risk due to this operational pause. The suspension is a preventive measure for transaction integrity during the upgrade. Q4: What happens if I send INJ to my Bithumb address during the suspension? A4: It is strongly advised not to do this. Transactions sent during the suspension may not be credited automatically and could be lost or require manual recovery by support, which can be a lengthy process. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend INJ services? A5: Possibly. Other exchanges supporting INJ may enact similar temporary suspensions if they are also integrating the network upgrade. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. Q6: Where can I get official updates on this situation? A6: For the most accurate and timely information, refer to Bithumb’s official website announcement page and their verified social media channels.

You’re not alone. The recent volatility has left many investors wondering when the sun will shine again on digital assets. According to prominent crypto analyst Mignolet, the path to a sustained crypto market recovery requires one crucial ingredient most overlook: time. Let’s unpack his sobering yet vital analysis. Is the Traditional Bitcoin Cycle Really Over? Mignolet cuts through the noise on X, addressing a core debate. Many claim Bitcoin’s famous four-year cycle, tied to its halving events, is a relic of the past. However, he presents a compelling counterpoint. Despite the monumental arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs—a game-changer for institutional access—the market’s recent behavior still echoes that familiar rhythmic pattern. This suggests old forces are still at play, complicating the timeline for a true crypto market recovery . How Are ETFs Changing the Game? The introduction of ETFs is the biggest new variable. These funds bring massive, steady capital flows that could theoretically smooth out volatility and create new cycles. Mignolet acknowledges this but urges caution. If we are in a transition period between the old cycle and a new, ETF-driven one, the market enters uncharted territory. This means: Unpredictable Movements: The path upward may not be straight, and corrections could be sharp. New Triggers: Recovery may depend more on traditional finance metrics like ETF inflows rather than just retail sentiment. A Test of Patience: Investors used to quick, parabolic rallies might need to adjust their expectations. What Does This Mean for Your Strategy? If a swift crypto market recovery is unlikely, what should you do? First, manage expectations. An uptrend will be difficult and choppy. This isn’t a reason for despair, but for strategic refinement. Consider dollar-cost averaging to navigate volatility instead of trying to time the perfect bottom. Furthermore, use this time for research. Projects with strong fundamentals are more likely to lead the eventual crypto market recovery . Navigating the Path Forward The key takeaway is perspective. Mignolet’s analysis isn’t a prediction of doom, but a call for realism. Markets need time to absorb new structures like ETFs and find a new equilibrium. This period of consolidation lays the groundwork for a healthier, more sustainable advance. Therefore, resilience and a long-term view become your greatest allies in waiting for a genuine crypto market recovery . In conclusion, the road to a full crypto market recovery is more of a marathon than a sprint. While ETFs have rewritten some rules, historical cycles and new uncertainties suggest patience is paramount. By understanding these complex dynamics, you can build a strategy that withstands volatility and positions you for the next bull phase. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did analyst Mignolet say about the crypto market? A1: Mignolet stated that the cryptocurrency market will need significant time to recover and that achieving a sustained uptrend will be difficult, even with the influence of Bitcoin ETFs. Q2: Is Bitcoin’s four-year cycle finished according to this analysis? A2: Mignolet believes the previous bull cycle has ended. He notes that while ETFs are a major new factor, recent price action still followed the traditional four-year pattern, suggesting its influence isn’t completely gone. Q3: How do Bitcoin ETFs affect the market cycle? A3: ETFs bring large-scale institutional investment, which could create a new type of market cycle. However, if the market is transitioning between the old cycle and a new ETF-driven one, it could lead to more unpredictable price movements. Q4: Should I sell my crypto if recovery will take time? A4: Not necessarily. “Time to recover” doesn’t mean prices will only go down. It emphasizes volatility and consolidation. A long-term strategy like dollar-cost averaging can be more effective than trying to sell at a perceived bottom. Q5: What is the most important action for investors now? A5: The key is to manage expectations and practice patience. Use this period to research strong projects, consider steady accumulation, and avoid emotional decisions based on short-term price swings.

There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $89,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Any more gains might send the price toward the $90,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $91,000 and $91,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $87,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $85,500 level. The first major support is near the $85,000 level. The next support is now near the $83,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $82,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $80,000, below which BTC might accelerate lower in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $85,500, followed by $85,000.

SBI Holdings and Startale Group plan to release the stablecoin in the second quarter of 2026. The partnership brings together SBI’s standing as a key player in Japan’s financial sector with Startale’s background in Web3 technology. Startale helped build the Soneium network, which has backing from Sony. “The transition to a ‘token economy’ is now an irreversible societal trend,” said Yoshitaka Kitao, Chairman and President of SBI Holdings. “By circulating it both domestically and globally, we aim to dramatically accelerate the movement toward providing digital financial services that are fully integrated with traditional finance.” The stablecoin has not been named yet. Both companies say it will be fully regulated and designed for worldwide settlement and use by institutions. Shinsei Trust & Banking, which operates under SBI Shinsei Bank, will manage the creation and redemption of the digital currency. SBI VC Trade, a licensed crypto exchange service provider, will handle its circulation. Startale recently put out its own stablecoin called Startale USD (USDSC) This dollar-based digital currency works for payments, rewards, and liquidity on Soneium. The new yen stablecoin and USDSC will work together as a “complementary currency stack” for a planned 24/7 tokenized stock exchange that Startale and SBI are building. “Our yen-denominated stablecoin is not just a means of everyday payment – it will play a central role in a fully on-chain world,” said Sota Watanabe, CEO of Startale. “In particular, we see enormous potential in enabling payments between AI agents and powering distributions for tokenized assets, both of which will soon become reality.” This is not SBI’s first time working with stablecoins. In August, the company said it partnered with Ripple to bring Ripple USD (RLUSD) to Japan in 2026. The project fits with efforts happening across Japan to build up a yen stablecoin market. Japan’s Financial Services Agency recently approved JPYC as the country’s first yen stablecoin. The agency also supports a joint stablecoin project from three major banks: Mizuho Bank, MUFG, and SMBC. Many other big financial companies in Japan are moving into the yen stablecoin space The Financial Services Agency recently approved a pilot program for a yen-backed stablecoin that includes three of Japan’s largest banking groups: Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui, and Mizuho. A person working in Japan’s crypto industry , who spoke to DL News without giving their name, said several other large financial groups are also preparing to issue yen stablecoins. SBI and Startale have signed a memorandum of understanding for their coin. They say it will “operate as a global settlement currency” and work as money in the tokenized real-world assets space. Real-world assets, or RWAs, are mostly physical items like real estate and art whose ownership gets divided up and traded on blockchain networks. The companies said they will finish “all necessary compliance” steps before launching. They said they “aim to offer a yen-denominated alternative in a stablecoin market now exceeding $300 billion in circulating supply and processing trillions of dollars in on-chain transactions annually.” They pointed out that this market remains “heavily concentrated in US dollar assets.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This move signals a potential seismic shift in how privacy-focused crypto tools are treated under U.S. law and follows Trump’s history of intervening in high-profile crypto cases. What Exactly Is the Samourai Wallet Case? Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill received prison sentences of five and four years respectively in November. Authorities charged them with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Their privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet offered features that law enforcement argued could facilitate money laundering, while supporters maintained it protected user financial privacy. The case has become a flashpoint in the broader debate about: Financial privacy rights in the digital age Regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency developers The legal boundaries of privacy-enhancing technologies Why Would Trump Review the Samourai Wallet Situation? Trump’s statement during a White House press conference reveals his growing engagement with cryptocurrency legal matters. When asked about the Samourai Wallet case, he responded that he had “heard about the matter” and would “look into it.” This isn’t his first intervention in crypto-related legal cases. Previously, Trump has granted: A pardon to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao Commutations for Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht These actions suggest Trump views some cryptocurrency prosecutions as overly aggressive or politically motivated. His willingness to review the Samourai Wallet case could signal a more lenient approach toward privacy-focused crypto tools if he returns to office. What Does This Mean for Crypto Privacy Tools? The potential review of the Samourai Wallet case carries significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Privacy-enhancing technologies face increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide, with developers often caught between innovation and compliance. Key questions emerging from this development include: Will other privacy wallet developers face similar legal challenges? How might this affect innovation in cryptocurrency privacy features? What precedent would a presidential review establish for future cases? Moreover, this situation highlights the ongoing tension between financial surveillance and individual privacy rights. As governments worldwide increase their monitoring capabilities, tools like Samourai Wallet that offer enhanced privacy become both more valuable and more controversial. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Developers For those involved in cryptocurrency, Trump’s announcement offers several important lessons: Legal landscape awareness: Stay informed about regulatory developments affecting privacy tools Compliance considerations: Understand the legal requirements for money transmission services Political engagement: Recognize how election outcomes can impact cryptocurrency enforcement Risk assessment: Evaluate the legal risks associated with using or developing privacy-focused tools The cryptocurrency community should monitor this situation closely, as the outcome could influence regulatory approaches for years to come. Whether Trump’s review leads to pardons, commutations, or simply increased attention, the Samourai Wallet case has become a symbol of the broader struggle between innovation and regulation in digital finance. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Privacy Trump’s decision to review the Samourai Wallet case represents more than just another legal proceeding—it’s a potential turning point for how privacy-focused cryptocurrency tools are treated under U.S. law. The outcome could either chill innovation in financial privacy technologies or establish a precedent for more balanced regulation. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to mature, cases like this will increasingly define the boundaries of acceptable innovation. The Samourai Wallet review reminds us that in the world of digital finance, legal decisions often carry as much weight as technological breakthroughs. Frequently Asked Questions What is Samourai Wallet? Samourai Wallet is a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet that offers enhanced anonymity features, including coin mixing and transaction obfuscation tools designed to protect user financial privacy. Why were the Samourai Wallet founders sentenced? Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill received prison sentences for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Prosecutors argued their wallet facilitated illegal transactions, while supporters maintained they were simply providing privacy tools. Has Trump intervened in crypto cases before? Yes, Trump has previously pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and commuted the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, indicating his interest in cryptocurrency-related legal matters. What could happen if Trump reviews the case? Possible outcomes include pardons, sentence commutations, or simply bringing increased public attention to what supporters view as an overly aggressive prosecution of privacy tool developers. How does this affect other privacy crypto tools? The review’s outcome could set a precedent for how regulators approach similar privacy-enhancing technologies, potentially influencing future enforcement actions and developer innovation. When might we learn the outcome of the review? There’s no specific timeline announced, but such reviews typically take weeks or months, depending on the complexity of the case and the administration’s priorities. Found this analysis insightful?

According to reports, the network had a market cap of $5 billion as of Dec. 6, and it still draws attention because people know the name. That visibility, however, does not settle the debate over whether the token belongs in a long-term portfolio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $200 Trillion? CEO Makes Bold Prediction Shiba Inu’s Price And Market Size Based on reports, Shiba Inu has seen massive moves over several years. Roughly five years ago it traded near $0.0000000001684; at the time of writing, it is quoted at about $0.000008439. SHIB’s all-time high stands at $0.00008845, which means the token trades roughly 85% below that peak. Reports have disclosed that SHIB has tanked about 55% so far this year, and some data points show almost a 60% decline over a recent 12-month span. Those drops have pushed many investors to ask whether the story that once lifted SHIB has faded. On-Chain Signals And Holder Counts There are mixed signals on the chain. Data from CryptoQuant is reported to show memecoin dominance falling to its lowest level since early 2024, a sign that speculative interest across similar tokens has ebbed. At the same time, the number of wallets holding SHIB moved from about 1.45 million at the start of the year to around 1.52 million more recently. That jump in holders was noted alongside the price slide. It suggests distribution rather than complete abandonment; small increases in holders do not always mean increased trading activity, but they can show steady retail interest. Memecoin markets are dead. pic.twitter.com/6kymLWH4JX — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 11, 2025 Pundit Views And The Utility Question Meanwhile, crypto pundit Neil Patel has listed reasons he would not treat Shiba Inu as a proper investment. He argues the memecoin doesn’t solve a clear, large-scale problem and points out that developer activity for SHIB is limited compared with many other networks. The claim is that much of SHIB’s value has been driven by hype cycles and not by broad real-world use. Those views were presented in firm terms, and they have been repeated across a range of commentaries that warn about hype-driven tokens. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven Investor Takeaways And Risks Investors who want exposure to crypto are often told to look at major networks such as Bitcoin for scarcity-driven arguments; that point was brought up in several reports.

55853170,645066,1765854036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55853170.jpeg,Tether’s Bold $1.1 Billion Juventus Play Shut Down As Exor Holds Firm,https://bitcoinist.com/tethers-bold-1-1-billion-juventus-play-rebuked-exor/,"Tether has seen its Juventus buyout attempt rejected as majority stakeholder Exor has told the stablecoin giant its share is not for sale. Tether Fails To Acquire Premier Italian Football Club Juventus On Friday, Tether announced that it had submitted a proposal to acquire Juventus , one of the biggest football brands in the world. The stablecoin firm had previously acquired a 10% minority stake in the club, and with this new plan, it had intended to execute a full buyout. The first stage had included a proposal to Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family and majority stakeholder of Juventus. According to Reuters , Tether had offered the firm 2.66 euros per share, a notable premium above the then closing price of 2.19 euros. In a press release , Exor has responded to Tether, saying that its board has unanimously rejected the bid for its 65.4% controlling stake in Juventus. “Exor reaffirms its previous, consistent statements that it has no intention of selling any of its shares in Juventus to a third party, including but not restricted to El Salvador-based Tether,” noted the company. Founded in 1897, Juventus has established itself as one of the biggest football clubs globally, with a particularly memorable period of success coming during the 2010s, in which it won nine consecutive titles in the Serie A, the first division of Italian football. With Exor turning down the deal, the USDT issuer will have to reconsider its approach to the club popularly dubbed as The Old Lady. So far, Tether hasn’t issued any statements in answer. In the original announcement, Tether had announced that if the firm is able to acquire Exor’s stake, it will move to acquire the remaining shares of the club through a public tender offer at the same share price. This would put the total valuation of Juventus at about $1.17 billion. Tether had also noted that in the event that the transaction is completed, it will also be prepared to invest 1 billion euros in the football club. “Tether is in a position of strong financial health and intends to support Juventus with stable capital and a long horizon,” said CEO Paolo Ardoino. While The Old Lady enjoyed a strong period in the last decade, the 2020s haven’t been as kind. Since the 2019-20 season title win, Juventus hasn’t come close to becoming the Italian champion, with its best finish being third place during the 2023-24 season. Juventus also became part of a financial scandal in 2023, with Serie A punishing it with a 10-point deduction for false accounting. Thus, Tether’s interest has arrived when the club has been in a bit of a slump. USDT, Tether’s stablecoin, has been experiencing growth recently, with its market cap hitting a new record of $186.23 billion, according to data from DefiLlama .

Indexes in Japan dipped, while Australian shares edged higher, after the S&P 500 fell for a second straight session overnight. Futures linked to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were weaker in early Asian trading, signalling more pressure on Wall Street as traders wait for clues on growth, inflation and the Federal Reserve’s path. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $85,719, down 4.1% Ether : $2,930, down 6.1% XRP : $1.87, down 6.2% Total crypto market cap: $3.02 trillion, down 3.7% Analysts See Bitcoin Laying Foundations For A 2026 Return To Record Highs Despite the pullback, some crypto analysts remain upbeat on the medium term. Bitfinex’s research team expects the coming year to be defined by improving global liquidity conditions that will make Bitcoin “more solid than ever.” They argue that the groundwork is being laid for BTC to regain its all-time high near $126,110 in 2026, supported by looser monetary policy, rising liquidity and steady crypto adoption. Bitfinex also points to a changing market structure. With annual Bitcoin issuance now below 1%, they say the halving’s marginal impact has faded and recent drawdowns have been materially shallower, as flows from exchange traded funds, corporates and sovereign linked entities absorb multiples of yearly mined supply. In their view, that shift has created a market dominated by patient, long-term capital. Not everyone is in a rush to add risk. Lin Tran, senior market analyst at XS.com, said Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the psychological $90,000 level after being rejected near $100,000 shows a cautious tone is still in charge. According to Tran, investors are trimming exposure into year end and prioritising capital preservation after a powerful rally earlier in the cycle. Risk Appetite Pauses As Investors Look For Clarity From Upcoming Indicators In traditional markets, the yen strengthened against the dollar to around 154.85, as traders position for the Bank of Japan to lift its key rate to the highest level in three decades on Friday. A measure of the dollar slipped for a second day, trading near levels last seen in early October, as investors leaned into expectations of further easing from the Fed over the medium term. The broader backdrop is one of nervous consolidation into a heavy data week. Following the Fed’s latest rate cut, the November jobs report due Tuesday is expected to show a soft labour market and will include an updated estimate for October payrolls, which were delayed by the federal shutdown. The US consumer price index is scheduled for Thursday, alongside figures on retail sales, business activity and inflation that could challenge or reinforce the current narrative. Officials Split On Whether Current Fed Stance Is Appropriate For 2026 Fed officials have sent mixed signals. Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued that the current stance is unnecessarily restrictive, while New York Fed President John Williams said policy is “well positioned” for next year after last week’s move. Boston Fed President Susan Collins described the latest decision as a “close call,” noting she remains concerned about elevated inflation. In Japan, investors are watching the tug of war between the government’s need for cheap financing and the pressure from a weak yen that is pushing up import costs. Benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yields touched 1.97% earlier this month, the highest in 18 years, prompting Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda to warn that yields are rising “somewhat fast.” Back in the US, some strategists caution that data quality may be patchy after the Bureau of Labor Statistics played catch up following the shutdown. Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets says that backdrop could encourage a cautious reaction to this week’s prints, but if market expectations prove broadly correct it may set up another strong stretch for Treasuries, which are already on track for their best year since 2020. Wall Street closed lower on Monday as traders digested the Fed chatter and braced for the incoming numbers. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged their steepest daily declines in more than three weeks on Friday amid concern over inflation and debt fuelled AI investments, leaving both equity and crypto markets sensitive to any surprise in the data.

ETH price dipped below $3,120 and $3,050 to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below $3,000. A low was formed at $2,916 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,175 swing high to the $2,916 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . Besides, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $2,980 level.

It is one of the few sectors in the crypto market that have both strong narrative and proven product-market fit. However, the challenge for investors is that there aren’t many straightforward ways to participate. Circle is the only major issuer that’s publicly traded. Tether, which dominates the market, is still a private company. And while large firms like PayPal are introducing their own stablecoins, these efforts are still tiny relative to their overall businesses and don’t offer meaningful exposure. While these projects could serve as a proxy for investors who want to benefit from USDT’s growth, they also entail significant risk as a token projects instead of regulated stock. No Major Competitors in the Regulated Stablecoin Market 2025 is a pivotal year for stablecoins. The GENIUS Act formally established the regulatory status for stablecoins in the United States, and this is also reinforced by the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which explicitly favors privately issued stablecoins and restricts federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, from creating or promoting a U.S. CBDC. It is now very clear that digital money in the U.S. will be driven by privately issued stablecoins rather than a government-issued alternative. USDC ( USDC ) is expected to benefit the most from these regulatory tailwinds. It is the largest regulated stablecoin in both the U.S. and worldwide; it is backed by liquid transparent reserves with established institutional trust. Several newly launched regulated stablecoins backed by tech or financial giants, including PayPal’s PYUSD ( PYUSD-USD ), BlackRock’s BUIDL, and the Trump-linked USD1, are often mentioned as potential competitors, but their current scale is far too small to challenge USDC's dominant position in the foreseeable future. USDC's liquidity depth, integration with both enterprises and on-chain DeFi protocols, and established distribution networks created a scale-driven moat. These existing advantages position USDC to capture an outsized share of incremental demand as stablecoin adoption is set to accelerate in the coming years. Despite having strong backers, newer stablecoins such as PayPal's PYUSD, Trump-linked USD1 are all too small to compete with existing players. Source: BloFin Dune Dashboard Circle’s Revenue Outlook: Supply Growth Can Offset Falling Rates Circle ( CRCL ) currently has an overly concentrated revenue source and can be heavily impacted by interest rate fluctuation. This is the risk frequently being mentioned about its revenue model. Most of the company’s income comes from the interest earned on the reserves backing USDC, which are primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries. With the market expecting rate cuts ahead, this source of income will come under pressure. Supporters, however, argue that rising USDC circulation should more than make up for the hit from lower yields. This argument hinges on the assumption that USDC supply will expand significantly, and the scale effect of a larger reserve base can absorb compression in yields. Management guidance and industry estimates suggest a 40–60% annual growth in USDC supply, with some projecting triple-digit growth in favorable regulatory scenarios. Under these assumptions, Circle’s revenue is expected to increase considerably even in a declining interest rate environment. Potential New Revenue Source from Arc Blockchain We believe one of the most important potential revenue drivers for Circle ( CRCL ) is the Arc blockchain, which is built specifically for stablecoin-focused financial activity. To understand why Arc matters, we need to first understand USDC’s leading role in the on-chain economy. While USDT ( USDT-USD ) remains the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, USDC leads by a wide margin in actual on-chain usage. One way to understand this is through the concept of velocity. When measuring money, velocity refers to how frequently a unit of currency changes hands. Applied to stablecoins, it measures how often each token is used in transactions rather than sitting idle. High velocity suggests more frequent economic action. From the chart below, we can see USDC consistently has higher velocity than USDT, which means USDC is used more actively for on-chain economic activities such as payments, trading, and DeFi. To illustrate this in a concrete example. On Aave ( AAVE-USD ), the largest lending protocol, USDC accounts for the majority of both deposits and borrowing, whereas USDT plays a much smaller role. Source: BloFin Dune Dashboard Source: BloFin Dune Dashboard Every on-chain transaction requires users to pay gas fees to the underlying blockchain. For USDC, most of its activity currently takes place on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ), which means users must purchase and then pay ETH or SOL to cover gas fees whenever they move or interact with USDC. One of Arc’s key design choices is that USDC itself can be used to pay gas fees on the network. If Arc succeeds in pulling a meaningful share of USDC-related activity onto its own chain, the gas fees that are currently captured by Ethereum or Solana could instead flow back to Circle. In other words, Arc gives Circle a path to reclaim part of the economic value generated by USDC transactions that today accrues to other blockchains. Source: Circle Arc Conclusion Most of the arguments in favor of Circle focus on two points: strong regulatory tailwinds and the idea that market growth can offset the impact of declining interest income. We agree these are credible pillars of the bullish case. In this article, we also highlight a less-discussed angle: the potential revenue Circle could generate from operating a dedicated, USDC-centric Layer 1 blockchain. Arc could play a role similar to what Base has become for Coinbase ( COIN ). Base has quickly grown into a leading Ethereum Layer 2 and is now contributing a meaningful share of Coinbase’s broader revenue mix. If Arc gains traction, it could evolve into a significant Layer 1 network that captures a portion of the value currently flowing to blockchains like Ethereum and Solana through USDC-related activity. That said, we acknowledge there are clear limitations to this analysis. Arc is still in testnet, and it is too early to judge how much economic activity it can realistically attract back from established chains.

Over $394.5 million in positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with a staggering majority targeting optimistic traders. This event highlights the extreme volatility and inherent risks of leveraged trading. Let’s break down the crypto liquidations that shook Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. What Sparked This Wave of Crypto Liquidations? A sharp price decline across major digital assets triggered a cascade of margin calls. When traders use leverage to amplify their bets, a small price move against their position can force an automatic closure by the exchange. This past day, the pain was overwhelmingly felt by those betting on higher prices. The scale of these crypto liquidations signals a significant shift in short-term market sentiment from greed to fear. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Epicenter of the Storm The two market giants bore the brunt of the selling pressure. Here is a detailed breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC): Total liquidations reached $186 million. A crushing 84.41% of this value came from long positions being forcibly closed. Ethereum (ETH): The situation was even more one-sided. Out of $174 million in liquidations, a dramatic 93.16% were long positions. This data reveals that the recent downturn caught a massive number of bullish traders off guard. Their leveraged bets magnified their losses, contributing to further downward pressure in a negative feedback loop. Is This Just a Bitcoin and Ethereum Story? While BTC and ETH dominated the headlines, other major altcoins did not escape unscathed. Solana (SOL), for instance, recorded $34.54 million in liquidations, with 88.16% stemming from long positions. This pattern confirms the sell-off was broad-based, affecting the wider crypto market. Therefore, understanding crypto liquidations is crucial for anyone trading altcoins with leverage. How Can Traders Navigate Future Liquidation Events? Surviving these volatile periods requires discipline and risk management. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum risk. Second, avoid excessive leverage; it is a double-edged sword that can wipe out capital quickly. Third, monitor funding rates and open interest, as they can provide early warnings of market overheating. Finally, never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in derivatives markets. The Bottom Line on Major Crypto Liquidations In conclusion, the $394.5 million liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of the crypto market’s volatility. The extreme skew toward long positions indicates a rapid unwinding of bullish optimism. While painful for those affected, such events can create healthier market conditions by removing excessive leverage. For savvy traders, these periods of fear can also present new opportunities once the selling pressure subsides. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because they have lost the collateral (margin) needed to keep it open. This happens to prevent further losses. Why were most liquidations from long positions? The market price fell sharply. Traders who borrowed money to bet on prices rising (long positions) saw their positions move against them, triggering automatic closures. Do liquidations cause the price to drop further? Often, yes. Forced liquidations create additional sell orders in the market, which can exacerbate a price decline in a cascade effect. How can I avoid being liquidated? Use lower leverage, employ stop-loss orders, maintain sufficient margin in your account, and never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Are liquidations only a risk in perpetual futures? While common in perpetual futures and margin trading due to leverage, the core concept of a forced sale to cover a debt can apply in other leveraged financial products. What happens to the money from liquidated positions? The exchange uses the remaining collateral from the liquidated position to cover the loss. Any leftover funds may be added to an insurance fund or used to cover other traders’ profits. Found this breakdown of the recent crypto liquidations helpful?

In its 2026 outlook , the asset manager projects that BTC will set a fresh all-time high in the first half of next year, arguing that the market is shifting into a more mature, institution-led phase. The firm expects 2026 to accelerate what it calls structural shifts in digital asset investing. On one side is macro demand for alternative stores of value as public debt and fiat risks build. On the other is clearer regulation, which it says is finally pulling crypto into mainstream financial infrastructure instead of pushing it to the edges. Together, those forces should bring in new capital, broaden adoption among wealth managers and institutions, and pull public blockchains deeper into traditional markets, Grayscale argues. The firm believes this backdrop will lift valuations across crypto and mark the end of the so-called four-year cycle, the popular idea that Bitcoin’s fate is locked to a halving-driven boom and bust every four years. Image Source: Grayscale Rising Debt And Inflation Fears Drive Demand For Scarce Crypto Assets Crypto has already grown from a niche experiment to what Grayscale calls a mid-sized alternative asset class, with millions of tokens and roughly $3T in combined market value. Bitcoin and Ether sit at the core of that universe as scarce digital commodities and alternative monetary assets. Grayscale says rising debt and inflation worries will keep portfolio demand for such assets growing as investors look for ballast against fiat currency debasement. Supply dynamics are part of the story. Bitcoin’s issuance rate has dropped below 1% and the 20 millionth coin is expected to be mined in March 2026. In Grayscale’s view, that kind of transparent, capped supply looks increasingly attractive as fiscal imbalances mount, and it expects investors to treat BTC and ETH more like strategic holdings than short-term trades. 2026 may be the year digital assets enter their institutional era. Grayscale believes macro tailwinds and regulatory clarity will drive demand for scarce assets like $BTC & $ETH . https://t.co/ReaqqGksni — Grayscale (@Grayscale) December 15, 2025 Regulation is the other pillar. The firm notes that in recent years US authorities pursued investigations or lawsuits against many major crypto companies, but says that posture has started to shift. Bipartisan Legislation Expected To Cement A Clear US Crypto Rulebook Court wins opened the door to spot exchange traded products, Bitcoin and Ether ETPs launched in 2024, and the GENIUS Act on stablecoins passed in 2025. Grayscale now expects bipartisan crypto market structure legislation to become law in 2026, giving the industry a clearer rulebook and deeper access to capital markets. Spot ETPs are already pulling money in. Since US Bitcoin products debuted in Jan. 2024, global crypto ETPs have seen about $87B in net inflows, according to the report. Even so, Grayscale estimates that less than 0.5% of US-advised wealth is allocated to crypto, leaving plenty of room for slow-moving institutional capital to come in as platforms complete their due diligence and add tokens to model portfolios. Early adopters include names such as Harvard Management Company and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala. That institutional tilt has also changed how Bitcoin trades. Previous bull runs saw 1,000% plus gains over a single year. This cycle’s maximum year-over-year increase, around 240% into March 2024, is far tamer. Grayscale reads that as a sign of steadier buying from large pools of capital instead of a one off retail melt up, and it sees a relatively low chance of a deep, prolonged drawdown in 2026. Grayscale Maps 10 Themes Shaping Digital Assets In The Year Ahead Macro policy could add fuel. The last two major cycle peaks arrived while the Federal Reserve was raising rates. This time, the Fed cut three times in 2025 and is expected to continue easing next year. Kevin Hassett, seen as a contender to replace Jerome Powell as chair, recently said President Trump will choose someone who helps Americans get cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. Grayscale argues that a growing economy and broadly supportive Fed stance would align with stronger appetite for risk assets, including crypto. Around that core view, the firm maps ten big themes it thinks will drive digital assets in 2026, from dollar debasement and regulatory clarity to the expansion of stablecoins under the GENIUS Act, asset tokenization, privacy tooling, the intersection of AI and blockchains, faster DeFi lending, next generation infrastructure and default staking in proof of stake networks. It expects investors to favour tokens with clear use cases, measurable revenue and access to regulated venues. Two hot talking points do not make Grayscale’s main list. The report argues that quantum computing risk is real but still too distant to move prices next year, and that digital asset treasuries, despite owning chunks of BTC, ETH and SOL, are unlikely to drive major waves of forced selling or new demand in 2026. Taken together, the outlook paints 2026 as the dawn of what Grayscale calls crypto’s institutional era, one where the story is less about halving folklore and more about regulation, macro hedging and steady flows from traditional portfolios. In that world, it says, new highs for Bitcoin look more like a base case than a stretch target.

The punchline: a “conservative” target zone around $4.88–$5.50, and a “primary” bull-run target of $10.40. “Cardano Mirroring 2020 Blastoff Moment,” his post read, before laying out the two tiers: “Conservative: $4.88-$5.50” and “Primary: $10.40.” The Framework Behind The Cardano Price Prediction The framework he’s leaning on isn’t a clean five-wave impulse, he said. Instead, he framed it as something slower and messier — “more of like a large time-based macro correction here on the D-wave,” he said, describing what he believes is a triangle structure developing on the weekly chart. “We’re creating a triangle structure,” he said. “So I am going to be looking for the E-wave. That’s what ends up coming next.” Related Reading: Cardano’s December Slide Intensifies: What’s Driving the Decline and What Comes Next? A big part of the argument is confluence. Quantum Ascend walked through multiple measurements and trendlines, pointing to price zones where different tools cluster. One reference point was a prior A-to-B drawdown range that, in his view, still hasn’t been fully “closed out,” with a key level “up there at the $5.50 mark.” Then he zoomed out to the bigger structure, highlighting how an upper trendline from a C-to-D drawdown “converges with the 3.618 [Fibonacci extension] up here,” which he suggested adds weight to the $10 area. “So some confluence for that $10 area,” he said, pointing at the chart level he called out around $10.62. He also reached for a relative-performance comparison — not to Ethereum itself, but to Ethereum Classic. “I have another video from the past that compares Ethereum Classic to ADA,” he said. “And if it ends up doing a similar move to Ethereum Classic, that also puts us up into the $10 range.” Still, the near-term “safe” target he kept circling back to was the $5 region. After walking through a more recent drawdown “going back to the top of the Trump pump to where we’re at now,” he said a “full extension gets us pretty close… around $4.88,” adding that the $5 zone shows “a lot of different signs of confluence.” “For me, I’m going to say my conservative estimate for ADA is going to be that $5 range,” he said. Then he went straight to the headline number: “I think ADA gets up there around 10 bucks during this bull run.” To make the comparison feel less abstract, Quantum Ascend argued the current chop looks structurally similar to a prior period before ADA’s last breakout — a fractal-style read. “You guys notice the similarities here?” he asked, describing how both moves get “stopped out a little bit above the 0.5,” roll over, then revisit the lower trendline before pushing back to the top of the range. Related Reading: Cardano’s Recovery Stalls, but TVL Growth Signals Could Spark Year-End Upside And then he widened the lens beyond Cardano, tossing in a fairly aggressive macro view that sits underneath the bullish alt targets. “I honestly, guys, across the board right now, I believe that these corrections are coming to an end,” he said. “I think we have a blow off top in stock markets, in crypto and all of that coming.” But he also stressed he’s not married to a long-duration “supercycle” narrative. “I am not a long-term bull,” he said. “I am not [predicting a] Bitcoin super cycle to $400K.” His current bitcoin top, he added, is $155,000 — and he expects alts to “severely outperform” in the final leg before “it’s all over.” On the math side, Quantum Ascend framed $10.40 as big, but not absurd in a market that has already produced outsized multiples. “If we were to get that 1040, 25X, right?” he said, comparing it to prior cycles where ADA saw moves he pegged at “168X” and “75X.” “So we’re just talking about a 25er,” he added. “Not that crazy when you put it into perspective.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.4022.

The digital payments company aims to create an industrial loan arm called PayPal Bank to offer business lending solutions to “small businesses in the US.” Additionally, a state-chartered license would enable the PYUSD stablecoin issuer to originate loans, hold deposits, and access payment networks directly. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss emphasized that small businesses face “significant hurdles” in securing capital to grow their operations. “Establishing PayPal Bank will strengthen our business and improve our efficiency, enabling us to better support small business growth and economic opportunities across the U.S.,” Chriss said in the release. PayPal filed the application with Utah regulators and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Payments firm PayPal said on Monday it has applied to establish a bank in the United States, as companies rush to capitalize on a friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. https://t.co/fCMHY5zVMm — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) December 16, 2025 Crypto Firms Rush to Apply Bank Charter Amid Regulatory Shifts PayPal’s push for a bank license comes amid an increase in banking charter activity among crypto firms. The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) head, Jonathan Gould, recently highlighted that the agency received about 14 charter applications since the start of the year, including digital asset firms . Besides, PayPal has prioritized regulated integration of digital assets over recent years, including rolling out support for merchants to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum at checkout. The federal bank regulator, OCC, already has trust charter applications from five different crypto companies, including stablecoin issuer Circle, Coinbase and Ripple. For instance, Ripple intended to bring its dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, under federal supervision by seeking a national banking license . Per Monday announcement, PayPal has selected Mara McNeill to serve as PayPal Bank’s president, who has over two decades of experience in banking and commercial lending. PayPal Expands PYUSD Stablecoin Reach PayPal launched its dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD in Aug. 2023 in partnership with Paxos Trust Company, a US-regulated entity. Early this year, the US SEC dropped its high-profile crypto investigation on the stablecoin, with no further action, in a broader crackdown on crypto-linked enforcement actions. Last week, the firm confirmed that YouTube creators in the US can now choose to receive their payouts in PYUSD , pushing stablecoin into everyday payments.

This scenario is rapidly moving from fiction to reality. A recent report from Bitcoin financial services firm River reveals a stunning shift: fourteen of the top 25 banks in the United States are actively developing Bitcoin-based offerings for their clients . This marks a pivotal moment where traditional finance embraces the digital asset revolution. Why Are Major Banks Suddenly Interested in Bitcoin Products? For years, many traditional financial institutions viewed Bitcoin with skepticism or outright dismissal. However, the landscape has transformed dramatically. The primary driver is clear: overwhelming customer demand. As cryptocurrency awareness grows, clients are asking their trusted banks for secure, regulated access. Therefore, banks are responding not just to stay competitive, but to capture a significant new revenue stream and retain their customer base. This move represents a profound validation of Bitcoin’s role in the modern financial ecosystem. It signals that major institutions now see Bitcoin products not as a niche trend, but as a fundamental component of future financial services. The development efforts span various offerings, which may include: Custody Services: Secure storage solutions for Bitcoin assets. Investment Vehicles: Bitcoin-linked funds or managed portfolios. Transaction Services: Facilitating Bitcoin payments or transfers. Advisory Services: Guidance on incorporating Bitcoin into investment strategies. What Does This Mean for the Average Investor? The active development of Bitcoin products by trusted banks lowers the barrier to entry for millions of people. It provides a familiar and regulated pathway into the crypto market, reducing perceived risks associated with unknown exchanges. Moreover, institutional involvement brings greater liquidity, stability, and legitimacy to the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. However, this integration also presents challenges. Banks must navigate complex regulatory frameworks and ensure robust security measures to protect client assets. The products they develop will likely prioritize compliance and safety, which may differ from the features offered by native crypto firms. For the savvy investor, this means more choice and the ability to select a service that aligns with their risk tolerance and goals. The Future of Finance is a Hybrid Model The report from River underscores a broader trend: the lines between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) are blurring. We are moving toward a hybrid financial model where legacy systems and innovative blockchain technology coexist. The fact that over half of America’s banking giants are building Bitcoin products is a powerful indicator that this fusion is inevitable. This institutional momentum creates a positive feedback loop. As more banks offer Bitcoin products , adoption increases, which in turn encourages further development and innovation. It paves the way for broader acceptance in everyday commerce and long-term wealth management. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Bitcoin Adoption The revelation that 14 top US banks are developing Bitcoin products is a watershed moment. It marks the end of Bitcoin’s era as an outsider asset and its beginning as a mainstream financial instrument. This institutional embrace provides a seal of approval that will accelerate adoption, enhance market infrastructure, and ultimately shape the future of money. For investors, the message is clear: the bridge between traditional banking and digital assets is now open for business. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which banks are developing Bitcoin products? A: The River report specifies that 14 of the top 25 US banks are involved, though it may not name each one publicly. Typically, this includes major national and money-center banks responding to client demand. Q: What kind of Bitcoin products might banks offer? A> Banks are likely focusing on regulated, secure services like cryptocurrency custody (safekeeping assets), Bitcoin investment funds, and possibly payment or transfer services integrated with traditional accounts. Q: Is my money safe if I buy Bitcoin through a bank? A> Banks operate under strict regulatory oversight, which can offer a layer of security and insurance not always present on all crypto exchanges. However, it’s crucial to understand the specific terms, risks, and whether the Bitcoin is held in your name or the bank’s. Q: Why should I use a bank instead of a crypto exchange for Bitcoin? A> Using your existing bank can offer convenience, integrated financial management, and a trusted, familiar interface. It simplifies the process for those new to crypto who value the security and regulatory framework of traditional finance. Q: Will banks offering Bitcoin make its price go up? A> While not a direct guarantee, significant institutional adoption typically increases demand, improves liquidity, and enhances overall market stability, which are all factors that can positively influence long-term valuation. Q: When will these bank Bitcoin products be available? A> Development timelines vary by institution. Some banks may already be piloting programs with select clients, while others are in earlier stages. It’s advisable to check directly with your bank for their specific roadmap.

The first round of GeeFi’s presale finished in under two weeks, raising $500,000 . This strong start moved right into Phase 2, where GeeFi has already raised $800,000 by selling 13 million tokens . With tokens selling out quickly, experts say Phase 3 will start soon, so anyone interested should act fast before the price goes up. Ripple Gets Bank Approval, GeeFi Puts Control in Your Hands Ripple is in the news for getting the green light to open a special bank and for steady growth in its XRP exchange-traded funds. But while Ripple is working with big banks, GeeFi stands out by making sure regular users have real control over their money. With GeeFi’s decentralized exchange (DEX), you alone hold the keys to your crypto, no middlemen, no risk of someone else freezing your account. Everything stays safe and in your hands. GeeFi isn’t just about safe trading, it’s making it easy to use your crypto in real life, too. Soon, GeeFi will launch Crypto Cards made with VISA and Mastercard, so you can spend your crypto at millions of stores around the world. On top of that, the GEE token is designed to get more valuable over time because some tokens are regularly removed from circulation. This means as more people start using GeeFi, each token could become even more valuable. A Presale Built for Big Returns GeeFi’s presale is set up so that early buyers can see big gains. In Phase 2 right now, each GEE token costs just $0.06 . When GeeFi is listed on exchanges at $0.40 per token, anyone who bought in early could make a 667% profit right away. And if GeeFi reaches the $2 mark that some experts are predicting, a $1,600 investment today could turn into $60,000 , that’s a huge 3,233% return . GeeFi’s presale is getting a lot of attention. Over 13 million tokens have already been sold, and Phase 2 has brought in $800,000 so far. Because people are buying so quickly, experts think this phase will end soon. There are also talks about GeeFi being listed on major exchanges, which could make the price go up even more once public trading starts. Grow Your Money Easily with GeeFi Staking GeeFi isn’t just for people who want their investment to grow, it’s also a way to earn regular income on your crypto. With GeeFi Staking, you can use the easy GeeFi Wallet to lock up some of your tokens and get steady rewards. If you want to keep your tokens available at any time, you can get 10% yearly interest with no lock-in. If you don’t mind locking your tokens for a bit, you can earn more: 15% for one month , 22% for three months , or even 55% for a full year . Plus, if you tell a friend and they invest, you get a 5% bonus from their purchase. Don’t Miss Out, The Best Time to Get In Is Now GeeFi is becoming one of the most exciting crypto projects out there, with real features and a smart plan for growth. This presale is a limited-time chance to get in early before GeeFi becomes much more popular. Phase 2 is almost sold out, and when it ends, the price will go up, so acting now could make a big difference for your investment.

Speaking with reporters during a question-and-answer session at the Oval Office, Trump acknowledged the request. “I’ve heard about it, I’ll look at it,” the president said. He then asked Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was there at the time, to review the matter. “I don’t know anything about it, but we’ll take a look,” he added. Founders face money laundering charges Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill launched Samourai Wallet, a bitcoin wallet designed with privacy features. The wallet included a crypto mixing service that made it difficult to trace where money came from or where it went during transactions. The Justice Department arrested both men during Joe Biden’s time as president. They faced charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and running a money-transmitting business without proper licenses. Federal prosecutors claimed Rodriguez and Hill encouraged people to use Samourai to clean millions of dollars gained through illegal activities. Last month, Rodriguez got five years in prison for running Samourai with the mixing feature that authorities said helped wash millions in dirty money. Hill, who worked as chief technology officer, received four years. The president’s remarks about the Samourai case come after he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who started Silk Road, a marketplace on the darknet. Ulbricht had been serving two life sentences for running the site that allowed people to buy drugs and other banned items and services. Silk Road used bitcoin for payments and helped make the digital currency more popular. People in the bitcoin community who pushed for Ulbricht’s pardon are now doing the same for the Samourai founders and developers behind Tornado Cash, another mixing service for cryptocurrency. In October, Trump also pardoned Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the former head of Binance, saying the Biden administration’s “war against crypto” was over. Critics questioned the decision, especially after Trump told CBS he didn’t know who Zhao was. The White House later clarified that he meant he had never met him in person. Rodriguez responded to Trump Rodriguez posted a response on X following Trump’s comments. “I have always said that the most challenging aspect of getting a pardon for me and Bill would be getting the attention of [Donald Trump],” he wrote. “[President Trump] knows all about a weaponized Biden DOJ hunting down their political rivals … If he looks at our case closely it will be a case of deja vu, and I think he would do the right thing and grant us a pardon.” Rodriguez thanked Trump and supporters who backed his pardon request.

As the largest and leading financial event in the region, ADFW 2025 brought together the world’s top financial minds to redefine and shape the future of global markets. Adrian Wall, Senior Director of U.S. Policy at TRON DAO and Managing Director of the Digital Sovereignty Alliance, participated in the ADCB Stage panel titled “Have We Finished Building the Bridge?”. The session explored whether blockchain technology has effectively integrated with traditional financial systems or whether critical regulatory and infrastructure gaps remain. “By 2026, regulated stablecoins will increasingly function as a standard settlement tool for banks, fintechs, and enterprises rather than as an experimental technology,” said Wall. “The most successful blockchain infrastructure will be largely invisible to end users, delivering value without requiring technical understanding. While meaningful progress has been made at the value and settlement layer, further work is needed around standards, interoperability, and consumer protection. The bridge between traditional finance and decentralized systems will be complete when institutions can participate with confidence and the user experience seamlessly fades into the background.” Wall was joined by Demetrios Skalkotos, Chief DeFi and Protocols Officer at Blockdaemon, and Omer Husain, General Manager at Bitcoin DeFi, with moderation by Nilixa Devlukia, Senior Advisor at Global Counsel. Together, the panel examined the state of blockchain adoption through the lenses of regulatory evolution, institutional readiness, and market liquidity. TRON DAO’s participation at Abu Dhabi Finance Week reinforced its commitment to constructive engagement with global financial leaders and policymakers, supporting the responsible adoption of blockchain technology. As part of this broader effort, TRON supports the Digital Sovereignty Alliance (DSA), a nonprofit organization backed by a coalition of leaders from the blockchain and digital asset industry dedicated to advancing clear and ethical public policy, research, and education surrounding emerging technologies, including blockchain, cryptocurrency, Web3, and artificial intelligence. DSA was established to foster substantive, bipartisan dialogue and to support policies that help ensure emerging technologies deliver broad societal benefit. As advancements in areas such as blockchain and artificial intelligence continue to accelerate, thoughtful public policy is essential to address associated ethical, economic, and societal considerations. DSA is committed to convening experts, policymakers, and the broader public to advance informed, forward-looking regulatory approaches. Through continued collaboration and open dialogue, TRON DAO is helping shape a future in which digital financial infrastructure is secure, inclusive, and built to expand access and enable meaningful innovation at a global scale. About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E.

This strategic initiative promises to inject new energy and value directly into the burgeoning Bitcoin NFT ecosystem. But what does this mean for collectors, creators, and the future of digital art on Bitcoin? Let’s dive in. What is Magic Eden’s Ordinals Buyback Program? Magic Eden announced via X that it is committing a significant portion of its resources to support the Ordinals market. Specifically, the company will use 15% of all trading fees generated from Ordinals transactions to purchase Ordinals for its own treasury collection. This isn’t just a promotional stunt; it’s a long-term investment strategy that aligns the platform’s success directly with the health of the ecosystem it serves. This program effectively creates a built-in demand mechanism. Every time a user trades an Ordinal on Magic Eden, a slice of that fee is funneled back into the market to acquire more assets. Therefore, it establishes a virtuous cycle where trading activity fuels further collection and value appreciation. Why is This a Game-Changer for Bitcoin NFTs? The launch of this Ordinals buyback program signals a major shift in how marketplaces operate. Instead of simply being a passive facilitator, Magic Eden is becoming an active participant and stakeholder. This move builds immense trust and demonstrates a concrete commitment to the Ordinals protocol’s longevity. Here are the key benefits this program delivers: Sustained Market Support: It provides a constant, algorithmically-driven buyer, adding liquidity and stability. Enhanced Creator Confidence: Artists can feel more secure knowing the platform is financially invested in the success of the medium. Community Alignment: It proves Magic Eden’s profits are being reinvested to strengthen the very community that generates them. Price Floor Potential: The consistent buying activity can help establish healthier price floors for quality collections. How Does the Ordinals Buyback Program Work in Practice? The mechanics are elegantly simple. Imagine you sell an Ordinal for 1 Bitcoin on Magic Eden. The platform charges a small trading fee. From that fee, 15% is automatically earmarked for the buyback fund. Magic Eden’s team then uses this accumulating fund to strategically purchase Ordinals from the open marketplace. These purchased assets go into “The Magic Eden Treasury,” a collection held by the company itself. This approach is powerful because it’s transparent and self-sustaining. The program’s scale grows organically with the platform’s trading volume. More trading means a larger buyback fund, which means more support for the market. It’s a clear example of putting capital where your mouth is. What Challenges Could This Model Face? While innovative, the Ordinals buyback program isn’t without potential hurdles. Market volatility is a primary concern. If trading activity on Bitcoin Ordinals declines significantly, the fund’s size would shrink, reducing its impact. Furthermore, the selection criteria for which Ordinals to purchase will be closely watched. The platform must maintain a fair and unbiased approach to avoid accusations of favoritism or market manipulation. However, Magic Eden’s established reputation suggests they will navigate these challenges carefully. Their commitment likely includes a thoughtful acquisition strategy focused on artistic merit, historical significance, and community sentiment to benefit the ecosystem broadly. The Bigger Picture: A New Standard for NFT Marketplaces? Magic Eden’s move could set a powerful precedent. This Ordinals buyback program transcends a simple corporate treasury investment. It represents a new model of ecosystem partnership. Other marketplaces may now feel pressure to demonstrate similar levels of commitment beyond just providing a listing service. For the broader cryptocurrency and NFT world, it highlights a maturation phase. The focus is shifting from pure speculation to building sustainable, value-driven economies. Magic Eden is not just hosting a market; it’s actively cultivating and defending it, which is a profound evolution in platform strategy. Conclusion: A Confident Step Forward for Ordinals Magic Eden’s launch of its Ordinals buyback program is a masterstroke of confidence. It directly ties the platform’s financial incentives to the prosperity of its users and the Bitcoin NFT space. This creates a powerful alignment of interests that benefits creators, collectors, and the platform itself. By reinvesting fees directly into the ecosystem, Magic Eden is building a stronger, more resilient future for Ordinals, potentially reshaping expectations for all digital asset marketplaces in the process. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What percentage of fees is Magic Eden using for the buyback? A1: Magic Eden is allocating 15% of all trading fees generated from Ordinals transactions on its platform to fund the buyback program. Q2: Where do the purchased Ordinals go? A2: All Ordinals bought through this program go into “The Magic Eden Treasury,” which is the company’s official collection. Q3: Does this program apply to NFTs on other blockchains like Solana or Ethereum? A3: No. Currently, this specific Ordinals buyback program is exclusively for NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol. Q4: How will Magic Eden choose which Ordinals to buy? A4: While specific criteria aren’t fully detailed, the company is expected to focus on assets with artistic value, cultural significance, and those that support a healthy, diverse ecosystem. Q5: Can this program manipulate Ordinals prices? A5: Magic Eden’s activity will be public on the blockchain. The program is designed to provide sustained support and liquidity, not to manipulate prices. Its transparent nature is a key feature. Q6: What happens if trading volume drops? A6: The buyback fund’s size is directly tied to trading volume. Lower volume means a smaller fund, so the program’s scale naturally adjusts with market activity.

After a brief sigh of relief with net inflows, these investment vehicles experienced a dramatic reversal on December 15th. Data reveals a significant net outflow of $351.7 million, highlighting the fast-paced and often unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency investment through these regulated funds. What Caused the Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflow? The data paints a clear picture of widespread selling pressure. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was at the forefront, accounting for a substantial $230 million of the total net outflow. This single fund’s movement significantly drove the day’s negative trend. However, the selling was not isolated. Several other major spot Bitcoin ETFs also recorded notable outflows, indicating a broader shift in short-term investor sentiment rather than an issue with a single provider. A Detailed Look at the ETF Exodus To understand the scale, let’s break down the numbers from December 15th. The outflow was widespread across multiple prominent funds: Fidelity FBTC: $230.0 million outflow Bitwise BITB: $44.32 million outflow Ark Invest ARKB: $34.49 million outflow Grayscale GBTC: $27.51 million outflow VanEck HODL: $21.25 million outflow This collective movement underscores a decisive pullback from the spot Bitcoin ETF space. Interestingly, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded zero net flows for the day, standing still amid the exodus. The sole beacon of incoming capital was Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Fund (BRRR), which attracted a modest $6 million net inflow. Why Do Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows Matter? Daily net flow data for spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a crucial real-time gauge of institutional and retail investor appetite. Unlike traditional metrics, these figures show direct buying and selling pressure for the underlying Bitcoin held by the funds. Significant outflows, like the $351.7 million event, can signal profit-taking, risk aversion, or a reaction to broader market news. Therefore, monitoring these flows is essential for anyone tracking cryptocurrency market sentiment and potential price pressure. Key Takeaways and Market Implications This event delivers several critical insights. First, it demonstrates that investor sentiment toward spot Bitcoin ETFs can shift rapidly, even after positive days. Second, the data reveals diverging strategies among fund providers, with some experiencing heavy selling while others held steady. For investors, this highlights the importance of looking beyond headline Bitcoin price movements and understanding the flow dynamics within these popular investment wrappers. Conclusion: Navigating a Dynamic Landscape The $351.7 million outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is a powerful example of the market’s inherent volatility. While these products offer regulated exposure to Bitcoin, they are not immune to swift changes in investor confidence. This reversal emphasizes that the journey for spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely be marked by periods of both robust inflows and sharp outflows as the asset class matures. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to manage private keys or use a crypto exchange. What does ‘net outflow’ mean for an ETF? A net outflow occurs when the value of shares redeemed (sold) by investors exceeds the value of shares created (bought). For a spot Bitcoin ETF, this typically means the fund’s manager must sell some of its held Bitcoin to return cash to exiting investors. Why did Fidelity’s FBTC have the largest outflow? While the specific reason for FBTC’s large outflow isn’t always public, it can be due to large institutional trades, profit-taking by major holders, or specific investor reactions to market conditions or fund-related news. Can ETF outflows affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes, potentially. Significant outflows force the ETF provider to sell Bitcoin on the open market to raise cash for redemptions. This selling activity can create downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, especially if the outflow volume is large relative to daily trading volume. Should I be worried about investing in spot Bitcoin ETFs after this? Volatility is a fundamental characteristic of cryptocurrency markets. Outflows and inflows are normal parts of a young, growing asset class. Investors should align their spot Bitcoin ETF investments with their long-term strategy and risk tolerance, not just daily flow data. Where can I track spot Bitcoin ETF flow data? Data is compiled by various analytics firms and financial data platforms. Many cryptocurrency news websites and dedicated market analysts provide daily and weekly summaries of these flows.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signals Are ‘Hard To Ignore’: Analyst Warns Of Drop To April Lows Solana Takes The Popularity Crown On Monday, Solana was named the leading blockchain ecosystem by popularity in 2025 by crypto data aggregator CoinGecko. The study examined interest in blockchain ecosystems based on CoinGecko’s non-botted global web traffic from January 1 to December 14, 2025, only including ecosystems with actively listed coins and a non-zero percentage share of traffic. As a result, a total of 62 blockchain ecosystems were included in the study. Out of the 62 blockchain ecosystems studied, the 20 most popular represented a majority of 95.60% of global interest in chain-specific narratives. According to the report, the Solana ecosystem captured 26.79% of the global interest in chain-specific narratives this year, retaining its title as the most popular blockchain ecosystem for a second consecutive year. The Base ecosystem followed in second place, accounting for 13.94% of global investor interest in chain-specific narratives this year, led by constructive developments and partnerships. However, its mindshare experienced a 2.9% decrease from the 16.81% recorded in 2024. Similar to Solana and Base, the Ethereum ecosystem also retained its position from the 2024 list, ranking as the third most popular ecosystem with 13.43% of global interest. Meanwhile, Sui and BNB Chain moved up in the list, ranking 4th and 5th after more than doubling their mindshare in 2025. Per the study, the Sui ecosystem recorded the largest mindshare growth, with a 6.9% year-over-year (YoY) increase to reach 11.77% of the total global interest in chain-specific narratives. The BNB Chain ecosystem saw a 4.9% surge YoY to capture 9.05% in mindshare, fueled by the launch of Binance Alpha in May, which increased BNB Chain’s on-chain trading volumes, the report noted. Notably, XRP Ledger, Bittensor & Hyperliquid lead new entrants into the top rankings, securing a spot in the top 10 this year. SOL Memecoins Out Of Leading Narratives Despite leading the popularity rankings, CoinGecko highlighted that the Solana ecosystem’s mindshare had significantly decreased from the 38.79% it had dominated in 2024. According to the study, the ecosystem dropped by 12% this year, reflecting the blockchain’s “struggles to expand beyond its close association with meme coin speculation, as well as Solana’s range-bound price despite wider institutional adoption marked by the US ETFs launch.” This resulted in the Solana ecosystem dropping out of the top leading narratives list this year. In a Friday analysis, CoinGecko reported that memecoin emerged as the most popular crypto narrative in 2025 with a combined 25.02% of global investor interest across the main meme coin category and 35 meme coin trends. This represented a 5.65% decline from the 30.67% market share that the memecoin narrative held in 2024, suggesting that “the mania for purely speculative crypto may be subsiding.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds The Solana ecosystem lost its spot in the top five most popular crypto narratives, where it had ranked for the previous two years, after being overtaken by AI agents and the Made in USA narratives. Meanwhile, the Solana memecoin sector also dropped out of the top five narratives after a 3.08% decline in global investor interest from 2024. Nonetheless, “it remains to be seen whether the Solana narrative will be able to ride on new catalysts next year, as momentum from its comeback story runs out,” CoinGecko added. As of this writing, SOL is trading at $126, a 2.61% decline in the daily timeframe.

Data reveals a collective withdrawal of $224.94 million on December 15th alone, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. This sustained exodus from these newly established funds raises critical questions about the near-term trajectory for Ethereum’s institutional adoption. What Do the Spot ETH ETF Outflows Reveal? The data, compiled by TraderT, paints a clear and concerning picture: not a single spot ETH ETF managed to attract net inflows on that day. This uniform movement away from the products suggests a broader market hesitation rather than a shift between competing funds. The consecutive nature of the outflows indicates this is more than a one-off correction; it’s a developing trend that market watchers are monitoring closely. Breaking Down the $224.9M Spot ETH ETF Exodus Where exactly is the money leaving from? The outflows were widespread, impacting all major issuers. A closer look at the numbers shows which Spot ETH ETFs were hit the hardest: BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA): $139.26 million Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE): $35.10 million Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust: $20.18 million Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW): $13.01 million Fidelity Ethereum ETF (FETH): $10.96 million VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV): $6.43 million This breakdown is crucial. It shows that even industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are not immune to the current wave of redemptions affecting Spot ETH ETFs. Why Are Investors Fleeing Spot ETH ETFs? Understanding the ‘why’ behind the numbers is key. Several factors could be driving this capital flight from Spot ETH ETFs. First, broader macroeconomic uncertainty often leads investors to pull capital from perceived riskier assets like cryptocurrency. Second, Ethereum’s own price action and network activity can directly influence ETF flows. Finally, profit-taking after initial enthusiasm or a rotation into other asset classes could also be at play. The lack of inflows suggests new money is not entering to offset these redemptions. The Bigger Picture for Ethereum and Crypto ETFs While three days of outflows for Spot ETH ETFs are notable, it’s important to view this within the larger context. The approval and launch of these funds was a landmark event for crypto. Short-term volatility in flows is common for new financial products as they find their equilibrium. However, sustained outflows could pressure the underlying ETH price if the selling from the ETFs is not absorbed by other buyers. This period will test the depth and resilience of the market for these innovative Spot ETH ETFs. What’s Next for Spot ETH ETFs and Investors? For current and prospective investors, this trend underscores the importance of a long-term perspective. Spot ETH ETFs are a vehicle for exposure, not a guarantee of short-term gains. Monitoring flow data is a valuable tool, but it should be one part of a broader investment strategy based on fundamentals. The coming weeks will be telling. Will the outflows subside, or is this the beginning of a more prolonged downturn for these products? In conclusion, the third straight day of net outflows from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs, totaling nearly $225 million, is a significant data point that demands attention. It highlights the current cautious stance of institutional and ETF investors towards Ethereum. While not necessarily predictive of long-term failure, this trend serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility, even within regulated investment wrappers. The journey for Spot ETH ETFs, it seems, will be one of fits and starts as the market determines their true value and role. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Spot ETH ETFs? A1: Spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency. They allow investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the crypto themselves. Q2: Do these outflows mean the Spot ETH ETFs are failing? A2: Not necessarily. New financial products often experience volatility in their early days as the market finds a price equilibrium. Outflows can be due to profit-taking, broader market risk-off sentiment, or portfolio rebalancing. Sustained outflows over a much longer period would be a more concerning signal. Q3: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A3: When investors redeem shares of a Spot ETF, the fund manager must sell the underlying ETH to return cash. This selling activity can create downward pressure on ETH’s market price if the volume is significant and not offset by buying from other sources. Q4: Should I sell my Spot ETH ETF investment because of this news? A4: Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and long-term thesis for Ethereum. Short-term flow data is one factor among many. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Q5: Which Spot ETH ETF had the largest outflow? A5: On December 15th, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) experienced the largest single outflow, amounting to $139.26 million. Q6: Have there been any days with net inflows for Spot ETH ETFs? A6: The article states that on December 15th, no ETFs recorded net inflows. Historical data would be needed to confirm activity on previous days, but the focus here is on the emerging trend of consecutive outflows. Found this analysis of the Spot ETH ETF outflows insightful?

This means exchanges, wallet providers and other crypto service companies will move beyond current anti-money-laundering registration and into the same regulatory space as banks and brokers. Regulators To Apply Existing Rules Based on statements from ministers and officials, the Financial Conduct Authority will be the main supervisor for the sector. Firms will be required to meet standards on reporting, governance and customer protections similar to those applied in traditional finance. The shift is described as bringing clarity for businesses that want to operate long term in the UK, while giving regulators tools to act against fraud and market abuse. UK TO REGULATE CRYPTO UNDER FINANCIAL LAW FROM 2027 – The UK will bring cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin under full financial regulation from 2027, placing crypto alongside traditional financial products, per Reuters. – The Treasury plans to extend existing financial laws to… pic.twitter.com/RhWK96NN51 — BSCN (@BSCNews) December 15, 2025 Consumer Safeguards And Market Integrity Reports have disclosed that one of the core aims is stronger consumer protection. Officials say the changes will help block bad actors and reduce scams, and that the Treasury is also considering tighter rules around political donations made with crypto. The move follows a series of high-profile fraud cases and growing public concern about safety in crypto markets. The road to full regulation will be gradual. The Treasury has circulated draft legislation and ministers expect complementary rules from the FCA and the Bank of England to be ready by the end of 2026, ahead of the legal regime going live in 2027. Consultations and regulatory sandboxes are under way, giving firms time to adjust. How This Compares Internationally Based on reports, the UK’s plan is being framed more like the US approach than the EU’s Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA), which was introduced in 2024. Officials say closer alignment with US practice should help international firms that operate across borders, but it also raises questions about how UK rules will differ from both US and EU requirements in practice. A draft bill has been prepared and it has had only minor edits since first being published, according to government sources. Industry responses are mixed: some firms welcome the certainty, while lawyers and trade groups want clearer detail on how existing conduct rules will apply to crypto business models. The FCA is running targeted workstreams, including tests for stablecoin issuers and custody providers.

The first phase of funding hit its limit in less than two weeks, raising $500,000 . This success has spilled over into Phase 2, which has already brought in $800,000 by selling 13 million tokens . Demand is high, and the available supply is shrinking every day. Market experts predict that Phase 3 will start very soon. Investors are rushing to secure their position before the current phase ends and the price increases. Solana Sees Institutional Adoption, GeeFi Brings Financial Freedom JPMorgan recently selected Solana for a debt deal, while the token price consolidates around $137–$138 . Big banks are moving in, but GeeFi is focused on giving power back to the individual user. The platform is built around a non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX). This ensures you always keep full control of your private keys and your money. You never have to worry about a third party freezing your assets or mismanaging your funds. GeeFi connects the crypto world to real life with its upcoming Crypto Cards. Partnerships with VISA and Mastercard will allow you to spend your digital assets at millions of stores globally. This utility is supported by a deflationary token model. A smart burn mechanism constantly reduces the supply of GEE tokens. This scarcity helps push the value up over time as more people join the ecosystem and use its services. A Presale Built for Massive Profits The financial structure of the GeeFi presale offers a rare chance for huge returns. Right now, in Phase 2, you can buy GEE tokens for just $0.06 . The official listing price is set at $0.40 , which guarantees a 667% return the moment trading begins. The long-term forecast is even more exciting. Analysts project the token could hit a valuation of $2. If that happens, a simple $1,600 investment made today could grow into $60,000 , delivering a stunning 3,233% ROI . The crypto community is reacting strongly to these numbers. Over 13 million tokens have been sold in Phase 2 alone, raising $800,000 quickly. This buying pressure suggests the phase will sell out ahead of schedule. Rumors of listings on major centralized exchanges are adding fuel to the fire.

As a pivotal US jobs report looms, Asian currencies are caught in a cautious standstill, while the US dollar shows unexpected fragility. In the midst of this tense wait, one currency breaks ranks dramatically: the Indian Rupee has tumbled to a shocking, all-time low. For traders navigating global volatility, understanding this pre- nonfarm payrolls paralysis is critical. Why is the Asia FX Market So Muted Today? Trading activity across major Asia FX pairs is subdued, characterized by tight ranges and hesitant momentum. This isn’t mere calm; it’s strategic caution. The entire financial world is fixated on a single data point from the United States: the monthly nonfarm payrolls report. This jobs data is a powerhouse indicator for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy. A strong number could revive bets on hawkish Fed action, boosting the dollar and pressuring emerging market currencies. A weak number could confirm a dovish shift, weakening the dollar further. Traders are simply unwilling to place significant bets until this cloud of uncertainty clears. The US Dollar’s Surprising Weakness: A Temporary Lull? The US dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has edged lower in Asian trading. This pre-NFP softness is a key reason for the muted tone in Asia FX . However, this weakness is fragile. Market participants view it as a pause, not a reversal. The dollar’s near-term trajectory hinges entirely on the jobs data. A summary of recent dollar drivers shows the conflicting forces at play: Factor Impact on USD Current Market View Fed Rate Expectations Primary Driver Awaiting NFP for clarity Global Risk Sentiment Mixed Cautious, not fearful US Treasury Yields Correlated Stable ahead of data Technical Positioning Neutral to Bearish Profit-taking before event risk Indian Rupee Crisis: What’s Driving the Record Low? While most Asia FX moves are contained, the Indian Rupee (INR) is telling a different story. It has breached a critical psychological barrier, falling to a historic low against the US dollar. This isn’t just about the pre-NFP jitters; local factors are amplifying the pressure. Surging Oil Prices: India is a massive net importer of crude oil. Rising global oil prices directly worsen the country’s trade deficit, creating relentless demand for dollars and selling pressure on the rupee. Foreign Capital Outflows: Recent shifts in global portfolios have seen foreign investors pull money from Indian equity and debt markets, further increasing dollar demand. Central Bank Intervention: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is widely believed to be intervening to smooth volatility, but it is likely aiming to manage the pace of decline rather than defend a specific level. The confluence of these factors has overwhelmed the rupee, making it the standout casualty in today’s forex market . How Nonfarm Payrolls Will Dictate the Next Forex Market Move The nonfarm payrolls report is more than just a number; it’s the trigger for the next major wave in currency markets. Here’s what different outcomes could mean for Asia FX : Strong NFP & High Wage Growth: This scenario would signal a resilient US economy and persistent inflation. Expect a sharp US dollar rally as markets price in a higher chance of Fed rate hikes or delayed cuts. High-yielding but risky Asian currencies would likely come under significant selling pressure. Weak NFP & Moderate Wage Growth: This would fuel expectations that the Fed’s tightening cycle is truly over. The US dollar could extend its decline, offering relief and potential rallies for battered Asian currencies. The Indian Rupee might find a temporary floor. In-Line with Expectations: A report that matches forecasts might cause a brief volatility spike followed by a return to range-bound trading, as it provides little new information to shift the dominant market narrative. Actionable Insights for Forex Traders Navigating the Uncertainty In this environment, strategy is paramount. Blindly trading ahead of such a high-impact event is risky. Consider these approaches: Reduce Position Sizes: Volatility will spike after the NFP release. Trading smaller sizes helps manage the inevitable widening of spreads and sharp price moves. Focus on Pairs with Clear Narratives: While general Asia FX sentiment is muted, pairs like USD/INR have a stronger local story (oil prices, RBI policy) that can provide trading opportunities independent of the NFP outcome. Have a Plan for Multiple Outcomes: Don’t just bet on one scenario. Know your exit points and potential reversal levels for both a strong and weak dollar reaction. Watch Beyond the Headline Number: The unemployment rate and, crucially, Average Hourly Earnings (wage growth) will be just as important as the jobs number itself in determining the market’s reaction. Conclusion: The Calm Before the Storm The muted trading in Asia FX and the slight weakness in the US dollar represent a collective market inhale. The nonfarm payrolls report is the event that will force the exhale—a release that will determine momentum for the coming week. The dramatic plunge of the Indian Rupee serves as a stark reminder that even in a waiting game, local vulnerabilities can create explosive moves.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP)? The Nonfarm Payrolls report is a key US economic indicator released monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . It measures the change in the number of employed people, excluding farm workers, private household employees, and non-profit organization employees. Why does the Indian Rupee keep hitting record lows? The Indian Rupee is pressured by a combination of high global oil prices (increasing India’s import bill), foreign investor outflows, and the broad strength of the US dollar influenced by Federal Reserve policy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes periodically to manage volatility. Which Asian currencies are most sensitive to the US dollar and NFP data? Typically, currencies with high liquidity and close trade ties to the US, like the Japanese Yen (JPY) and South Korean Won (KRW), are highly sensitive. Emerging market currencies with current account deficits, like the Indian Rupee (INR) and Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), are also very vulnerable to shifts in US dollar strength. Who decides US interest rate policy? The Federal Reserve (Fed) , the central bank of the United States, sets monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets regularly to decide on the federal funds rate, which influences global currency valuations.

The firm plans to maintain Slurm as an open-source, hardware-agnostic tool, ensuring it remains broadly accessible to researchers and AI developers. Nvidia will increase SchedMD’s access to new systems and boost its development Nvidia is increasing its investment in open-source tools as part of a broader strategy to stay ahead in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence market. It has been working closely with SchedMD for over ten years, and now, with the acquisition, it will continue to invest in Slurm. Slurm, which translates to Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management, has long been an essential part of supercomputing. Currently, it is used in over half of the TOP500 supercomputers worldwide, allowing complex parallel computations to be scheduled. It also allows resources to be allocated across thousands of CPUs and GPUs. By integrating SchedMD, NVIDIA gains stewardship of this crucial piece of the HPC and AI software stack, connecting hardware acceleration (via NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs and InfiniBand networking) to sophisticated job scheduling and resource orchestration. Such integration will enhance performance for everything from training large language models to running mission-critical scientific simulations Danny Auble, CEO of SchedMD, spoke about the buy, saying, “We’re thrilled to join forces with NVIDIA, as this acquisition is the ultimate validation of Slurm’s critical role in the world’s most demanding HPC and AI environments. NVIDIA’s deep expertise and investment in accelerated computing will enhance the development of Slurm — which will continue to be open source — to meet the demands of the next generation of AI and supercomputing.” Nvidia also asserted, “Slurm, which is supported on the latest Nvidia hardware, is also part of the critical infrastructure needed for generative AI, used by foundation model developers and AI builders to manage model training and inference needs.” The AI chipmaker is bound to expand SchedMD’s reach into new systems, enabling customers to manage workloads more efficiently across their entire infrastructure. Additionally, the integration will enable customers to coordinate workloads across different hardware types and software better while benefiting from ongoing Slurm innovations. The company also plans to continue supporting Slurm with open-source software services and training for SchedMD’s broad customer base, which spans cloud, AI, manufacturing, and research organizations. Nvidia announced new Nano models earlier this week On Monday, Nvidia unveiled a new generation of open-source AI models, designed to be faster, more efficient, and more capable than their predecessors, responding to a surge in similar releases from China. It revealed its latest Nemotron models for use cases such as writing and software development, starting with the release of Nemotron 3 Nano. According to the chipmaker, the new Nano model cuts costs while improving accuracy on longer, more demanding workloads. Meanwhile, Meta is reportedly weighing a shift toward closed-source models, potentially making Nvidia one of the most prominent U.S. providers of open-source AI. To date, several U.S. states and government agencies have banned Chinese AI systems over security concerns. Most of those bodies claimed that Chinese models are being used in the Asian country’s military and intelligence operations. Nonetheless, Kari Briski, Vice President of Generative AI at Nvidia, emphasized that the company aims to provide users with a trustworthy model and is making training data and tools available for security testing and customization. Briski noted, “This is why we’re committed to it from a software engineering perspective.” The company’s shares even rose 1.35% following the announcement of its open-source AI models.

The state is adding to an already dense network of crypto kiosks operating under one of the country’s clearest regulatory frameworks. Bitcoin Bancorp Enters Texas, Citing Clear Rules and Strong ATM Demand Bitcoin Bancorp, which trades over the counter under the ticker BCBC, said the planned rollout would mark its entry into what it described as a strategically important market. BIG NEWS! Bitcoin Bancorp (OTC: $BCBC ) is set to deploy up to 200 licensed Bitcoin ATMs across Texas starting Q1 2026! Expansion Targets One of the Most Crypto-Friendly U.S. States as Part of a Broader National Growth Strategy Excited to bring easier Bitcoin access to the… — BitcoinBancorp (@BCBC_stock) December 15, 2025 The company is one of only three publicly traded Bitcoin ATM network owners in the United States and says it holds foundational patents tied to Bitcoin ATM technology. Eric Noveshen, a director at the firm, said agreements are already in place that could support faster revenue growth as the company moves from planning into execution. Following the announcement, Bitcoin Bancorp shares rose 7.83% on the day and are up 29.53% over the past five days, reflecting increased investor confidence in the expansion strategy. Source: Yahoo Finance The expansion comes at a time when Texas already hosts more than 4,000 live crypto ATMs, the highest number of any U.S. state. Large national operators, including Athena Bitcoin, Bitcoin Depot, Coinhub, Cryptobase, and Byte Federal, have established broad coverage across major cities such as Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. The presence of this existing infrastructure has lowered barriers for new deployments and signaled sustained consumer demand for in-person crypto access. Why Bitcoin ATM Operators Keep Flocking to Texas Texas’ appeal to ATM operators largely stems from its regulatory structure. State law treats virtual currency as a form of money under the Texas Money Services Act, placing Bitcoin ATM operators within a familiar licensing regime overseen by the Texas Department of Banking. Source: Americas Bitcoin Atm Companies must obtain a money transmitter license, meet minimum net worth requirements of at least $500,000, post a surety bond of no less than $150,000, and submit to regular examinations. Consumer protection has also become a growing focus. In Texas, state rules require Bitcoin ATM operators to clearly disclose fees, exchange rates, and complaint procedures. Federal Scrutiny Intensifies Around Bitcoin ATMs Oversight of Bitcoin ATMs in the United States is tightening at the federal level as regulators respond to rising fraud concerns and increased consumer use. Currently at the federal level, Bitcoin ATM operators are classified as money services businesses under the Bank Secrecy Act, placing them under the supervision of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This requires operators to maintain formal anti-money laundering programs, conduct customer identity verification, and monitor transactions for suspicious activity. Identity checks typically scale with transaction size, ranging from basic phone verification for smaller amounts to government-issued identification and enhanced due diligence for larger transfers. Operators are also required to file currency transaction reports for cash transactions exceeding $10,000, submit suspicious activity reports when necessary, and retain records for a minimum of five years. At the same time, federal lawmakers are moving to further regulate the sector. Proposed legislation such as the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act of 2025 shows a more focused concern over the role of crypto kiosks in scam-related losses nationwide. What the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act Proposes Introduced in the U.S. Senate as Bill S. 710, the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act of 2025, which has been read twice and referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, is designed to reduce fraud risks while increasing transparency for consumers. Key provisions of the bill include mandatory registration of virtual currency kiosks with the U.S. Treasury; also, operators are required to provide clear pre-transaction disclosures outlining terms, fees, and a warning that transactions are final and non-refundable. The bill mandates prominent fraud warnings on kiosks, the issuance of physical receipts containing transaction details and fraud-reporting information, and the implementation of written anti-fraud policies submitted to FinCEN.

This decision impacts both cross and isolated margin markets, primarily involving the FDUSD stablecoin. If you’re active in these markets, understanding this update is crucial to managing your positions and avoiding unexpected liquidations. Which Binance Margin Trading Pairs Are Being Removed? Binance made the official announcement on its website, specifying that the delisting of margin trading pairs will occur on December 23 at 6:00 a.m. UTC. The exchange is removing support for several popular trading pairs, creating immediate implications for traders using leverage. This action reflects Binance’s ongoing efforts to optimize its market offerings and maintain liquidity standards. The affected pairs fall into two main categories. First, cross margin pairs allow traders to use their entire margin balance as collateral for all open positions. Second, isolated margin pairs restrict collateral to specific positions, offering more risk control. The removal of these Binance margin trading pairs means traders can no longer open new positions in these markets after the deadline. What Are the Specific Pairs Facing Delisting? Let’s break down exactly which trading pairs will disappear from Binance’s margin platforms. The exchange provided clear lists in its announcement, and traders should review these carefully. Cross Margin Pairs Being Delisted: DOT/FDUSD ENA/FDUSD SEI/FDUSD FIL/FDUSD BONK/FDUSD ZK/FDUSD ETC/FDUSD WLD/FDUSD OP/FDUSD NEAR/FDUSD WIF/FDUSD APT/FDUSD DYDX/FDUSD TIA/FDUSD UNI/FDUSD Isolated Margin Pairs Being Delisted: DOT/FDUSD ENA/FDUSD SEI/FDUSD FIL/FDUSD BONK/FDUSD ZK/FDUSD ETC/FDUSD WLD/FDUSD OP/FDUSD NEAR/FDUSD WIF/FDUSD DYDX/FDUSD TIA/FDUSD Notice that most isolated margin pairs mirror the cross margin list, with APT/FDUSD and UNI/FDUSD being exceptions available only in cross margin before delisting. Why Is Binance Delisting These Trading Pairs? While Binance hasn’t provided specific reasons for each pair’s removal, several common factors typically influence such decisions. Exchanges regularly review their market offerings to ensure adequate liquidity, trading volume, and regulatory compliance. When certain margin trading pairs fail to meet these standards, delisting becomes necessary. Furthermore, the concentration on FDUSD pairs suggests Binance might be consolidating stablecoin liquidity. The exchange could be directing volume toward more popular pairs like those with USDT or BUSD. This strategic move helps maintain healthy markets where traders can execute orders efficiently without significant price slippage. What Should Affected Traders Do Immediately? If you currently hold positions in any of the affected Binance margin trading pairs , time is of the essence. You must take action before December 23 to avoid automatic liquidation. Binance typically closes all open positions in delisted pairs at the deadline, potentially at unfavorable prices. Here’s your actionable checklist: Close positions manually before the deadline Transfer assets to other trading pairs or wallets Cancel open orders in affected markets Monitor announcements for any updates or extensions Remember, after delisting, you cannot open new positions in these pairs. However, spot trading for these assets typically continues unaffected unless specifically noted. Always verify this distinction to avoid confusion between margin and spot market changes. How Does This Affect the Broader Cryptocurrency Market? Major exchange decisions like this delist of margin trading pairs often create ripple effects across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Other exchanges might follow similar evaluations of their FDUSD pair offerings. Additionally, projects whose tokens face delisting may experience temporary price pressure as margin traders exit positions. However, experienced traders understand that exchange optimizations are normal market maintenance. Binance’s action doesn’t necessarily reflect on the fundamental value of the affected cryptocurrencies. Instead, it represents an operational decision to maintain platform efficiency and trader experience. Final Thoughts on Binance’s Margin Trading Update Binance’s decision to delist multiple margin trading pairs serves as an important reminder about the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Platforms continuously evolve their offerings based on liquidity, demand, and regulatory considerations. While inconvenient for some traders, these adjustments ultimately contribute to healthier, more efficient markets. The key takeaway is simple: stay informed about exchange announcements and manage your positions proactively. The December 23 deadline provides ample time for adjustment, but procrastination could prove costly. By understanding which Binance margin trading pairs are affected and taking appropriate action, you can navigate this change smoothly and maintain control over your trading strategy. Frequently Asked Questions What happens to my open positions in delisted margin pairs? Binance will automatically close all open positions in the affected pairs at 6:00 a.m. UTC on December 23. To avoid potential liquidation at unfavorable prices, close your positions manually before the deadline. Can I still trade these pairs on Binance Spot? Yes, unless specifically announced otherwise. The delisting applies only to margin trading (both cross and isolated). The spot trading pairs for these assets should remain available. Why is Binance delisting these specific margin trading pairs? While not explicitly stated, exchanges typically delist pairs with low liquidity or trading volume. This helps maintain market quality and ensures traders can execute orders efficiently on remaining pairs. Will Binance delist more margin pairs in the future? Exchanges regularly review and optimize their market offerings. While no announcements exist about future delistings, traders should monitor official Binance communications for any updates. What should I do if I have pending orders in these pairs? Cancel all open orders (limit orders, stop-loss orders, etc.) in the affected margin pairs before the delisting time. After delisting, these orders will be automatically canceled by the system. Are other exchanges delisting similar FDUSD margin pairs? Currently, only Binance has announced this specific set of delistings. However, other exchanges might conduct similar reviews of their trading pair offerings independently.

Since Trump returned to office, the Securities and Exchange Commission sharply reduced crypto enforcement by pausing or dismissing roughly 60% of related cases. Samourai Wallet Case Catches Trump’s Eye US President Donald Trump said that he will review the case of Samourai Wallet developer Keonne Rodriguez. This means that Trump may explore the possibility of a pardon as pressure from privacy advocates and crypto users mounts. Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday focused on the US-Mexico border, Trump responded to a question about the case by saying he heard about it and would “take a look,” adding that he was not yet familiar with the details but was open to reviewing them. Rodriguez is a co-founder of the Bitcoin-focused privacy wallet Samourai, and was sentenced on Nov. 19 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. His co-founder, William Lonergan Hill, received a four-year sentence. The pair originally pleaded not guilty to more serious charges, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carried a potential maximum sentence of 20 years, alongside the money transmitter charge, which carries up to five years. Combined, the charges exposed them to at least 25 years in prison before they agreed to a plea deal in July. Announcement from the SEC The case quickly became a flashpoint in the debate over developer liability and financial privacy. Critics argue that Rodriguez and Hill are being punished for how third parties used open-source software they created. Those concerns also extended to other cases, including the prosecution of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, which privacy advocates say reflects an aggressive interpretation of money-transmitter laws by the US Department of Justice. Rodriguez is expected to begin serving his sentence this week, and said in a post on X that growing public attention is having an impact. He thanked supporters for urging Trump to intervene and said the “continued noise” around the case is working. In a recent interview with Bitcoin educator Natalie Brunell, Rodriguez said he believes there is a realistic chance of a pardon if the case is properly presented to Trump and senior officials in his administration. He suggested Trump’s own experiences with what he has described as a “weaponized” Justice Department could make him more receptive once the facts are reviewed. Rodriguez has also indicated that a traditional appeal is unlikely. He said he believes he waived his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement, although he is not entirely certain. Crypto Enforcement Slows Sharply at SEC Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scaled back cryptocurrency enforcement at a much higher rate than other areas of securities law since President Donald Trump returned to office. This is according to a report that was published Sunday by The New York Times. The regulator paused investigations, dropped cases, or dismissed roughly 60% of enforcement actions involving crypto companies and projects since January, far outpacing the retreat seen in non-crypto matters. The report pointed out several high-profile cases, including the SEC’s long-running lawsuits against Ripple Labs and Binance, and explained that the agency is no longer actively pursuing a single case against a firm with known ties to Trump. This fueled debate over whether political considerations are influencing enforcement decisions, particularly as the Trump family greatly expanded its presence in the digital asset sector in 2025. The SEC rejected suggestions of political favoritism by telling The New York Times that its decisions to wind down crypto investigations were driven by legal and policy considerations rather than personal or political interests. The newspaper also reported that it found no evidence that Trump directly pressured the agency to drop any cases. People in the industry also defended the SEC’s change in posture as a necessary correction rather than a politically motivated shift. Alex Thorn , head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, argued that framing the pivot as a result of Trump’s personal interests was misleading. He said the rollback is part of a reassessment of what he described as an “insane” regulatory approach toward crypto over the previous four years, during which enforcement actions were often criticized as unclear, overly aggressive, or disconnected from established securities law. At the same time, scrutiny intensified due to the Trump family’s growing involvement in digital assets. Entities linked to the president or his family have launched or backed several crypto-related ventures this year, including World Liberty Financial, the Official Trump meme coin, and American Bitcoin. While none of these ventures have been named in active SEC enforcement actions, their existence only added fuel to concerns about perceived conflicts of interest. Caroline Crenshaw The enforcement shift is also unfolding as the SEC prepares for a change in its leadership composition. The agency lost its final Democratic commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, after she served more than a year beyond the expiration of her term in 2024.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-16 05:30:00

The big question now is whether the asset can make a final pump for the year and tap $4,000 by Christmas, or it might be headed toward a major retreat to $2,000. To gain additional insight, we turned to four of the most widely used AI-powered chatbots to give their two cents on the matter. An Increase Seems More Plausible ChatGPT estimated that a rally is the more likely scenario, making a vital disclaimer that it is not guaranteed. It pointed out that the final quarter has historically been stronger for crypto than disastrous, suggesting that many traders are already cautious due to the recent volatility, which reduces the odds of a sudden crash. “By Christmas, Ethereum is more likely to challenge the upside than suffer a deep collapse, unless something breaks at the macro or Bitcoin level,” it added. ChatGPT claimed the chance of an ascent to $3,200 – $3,600 by December 25 is 45%, whereas a push beyond $4,000 is 25%. Tanking below $2,000 was estimated at around 10%. Grok, the AI chatbot integrated within X, argued that a plunge to $2K on Christmas seems ridiculous and would only be possible in the event of a black swan event like regulatory crackdowns or macroeconomic shock. That said, it predicted that a pump to $4,000 appears more plausible and will heavily depend on BTC’s performance and potential investor enthusiasm during the final days of the year. ‘A Million-Dollar Crypto Question’ Perplexity agreed with ChatGPT and Grok and also envisioned the rise to $4K as the more likely option. At the same time, it argued that bearish risks persist and a decline below $2,800 is not out of the question. Still, it doesn’t see how ETH can plummet to $2,000 without a shocking event like the meltdown of a popular exchange or another devastating factor. Google’s Gemini described the dilemma as “a million-dollar crypto question.” It estimated that a pump to $4,000 can be triggered by a sudden wave of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or a broader “Santa rally” for the entire crypto market. The unexpected approval of additional spot ETH ETFs or a massive institutional purchase may also have the same effect. It claimed that the odds of a drop to $2,000 are 29%, making this the less likely scenario, but still possible under some critical conditions.

Until now, the path was fraught with complexity. A groundbreaking new partnership is changing that game entirely. Animoca Brands Japan has teamed up with middleware platform Bifrost to provide a comprehensive suite for publicly listed Japanese companies to manage Bitcoin. This move signals a major step in institutional crypto adoption, offering a trusted bridge into digital asset management. Why Are Japanese Companies Eager to Manage Bitcoin?

Secondly, holding digital assets can attract a new investor demographic interested in innovative treasury strategies. However, the technical and regulatory hurdles have been significant. This partnership directly addresses those pain points, providing a compliant and secure on-ramp. How Will Animoca Brands Japan Help Companies Manage Bitcoin? The initiative is not just about buying and holding. Animoca Brands Japan and Bifrost are building a full-service framework. Their support covers three critical areas that make it feasible for Japanese companies to manage Bitcoin effectively: Secure Custody Solutions: Providing robust, regulated custody to keep corporate Bitcoin holdings safe. Active Asset Management: Enabling companies to earn yield through staking, lending, and DeFi protocols. Business Model Innovation: Assisting firms in launching new, recurring revenue streams based on blockchain technology. This holistic approach transforms Bitcoin from a static holding into a productive corporate asset. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Finance? This partnership is a powerful signal. When established, listed firms begin to formally integrate Bitcoin, it moves the asset class further into the financial mainstream. For Japan, a nation with a progressive stance on crypto regulation, this could catalyze a wave of adoption. Other companies will watch closely, potentially creating a domino effect. The ability for Japanese companies to manage Bitcoin professionally lowers the barrier to entry and reduces perceived risk. What Are the Key Challenges and Considerations? While the opportunity is immense, challenges remain. Market volatility requires careful treasury management policies. Regulatory compliance is an ongoing process, not a one-time check. Furthermore, the accounting and reporting standards for digital assets are still evolving globally. Success will depend on the partnership’s ability to navigate these complexities while providing clear, actionable insights to their corporate clients. In conclusion, the collaboration between Animoca Brands Japan and Bifrost is more than a service launch; it’s an infrastructure play for the future of corporate assets. By providing the tools for Japanese companies to manage Bitcoin securely and productively, they are building the rails for the next era of institutional finance. This initiative could well become the blueprint other regions follow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Animoca Brands Japan offering?

According to the analyst’s assessment, despite recent volatility across the broader digital asset market, the price has not shown signs of a decisive breakdown to far lower regions, supporting the view that buyers remain active and committed at current levels. The accompanying data shared by the analyst places particular emphasis on sentiment trends rather than short-term price fluctuations. While XRP consolidates, the balance between bullish and bearish views on social media has shifted increasingly in favor of optimism. This divergence between sideways price action and strengthening sentiment forms the core of the analyst’s argument. $XRP bulls vs bears in full force! Price is holding strong around $2.00 while sentiment across social media is turning increasingly bullish. This setup looks ready for a BIG PUMP https://t.co/oYMNnteixv pic.twitter.com/oeMyomSVMT — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 14, 2025 Social Sentiment Favors XRP Over Ethereum The visual data attached to the analysis highlights comparative sentiment readings sourced from Santiment, focusing on bullish versus bearish ratios for XRP and Ethereum . Within this dataset, XRP is shown ranking as the seventh most bullish digital asset by sentiment during the referenced week of 2025. Ethereum , by contrast, appears significantly lower on the list, positioned twenty-third for the same period. This contrast is central to Xaif Crypto’s interpretation. While Ethereum’s sentiment indicators suggest a cooling of optimism and reduced signs of speculative enthusiasm, XRP appears to be attracting comparatively stronger positive attention from retail participants. The chart implies that, even without an immediate price breakout, XRP is benefiting from a more favorable narrative among market observers. Price Stability at a Key Level Another notable point raised in the analysis is the resilience of XRP’s price around the $2.00 range. Holding this level while sentiment improves is presented as an important technical signal. Rather than reacting negatively to broader market uncertainty, XRP has maintained a steady footing, suggesting that selling pressure is being absorbed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst frames this behavior as evidence of an active contest between bulls and bears, with neither side yet achieving full control. However, the persistence of bullish sentiment during this period of consolidation is interpreted as a constructive development, particularly from a retail perspective. Expectations for a Stronger Move Based on the combination of sentiment data and price behavior, Xaif Crypto suggests that the current setup may be positioning XRP for a significant upward move . The emphasis is not on precise timing, but on the established conditions while the price remains range-bound. Overall, the analysis centers on the idea that XRP’s current market structure reflects confidence rather than exhaustion. With retail sentiment strengthening and the $2.00 level holding firm, the analyst’s outlook frames XRP as one of the more closely watched assets in the current phase.

In an opinion dated December 12 and published this week, the ECB stated that proposals in Italy’s draft 2026 budget may have “adverse implications” for bank liquidity. It cautioned that higher taxes could lead lenders to reduce the interest they pay on deposits to protect their profits. Such a course of action, the central bank said, would deplete liquidity buffers and create new vulnerabilities in the financial system. Apart from the potential for liquidity problems, the ECB highlighted broader economic concerns . A heavier tax burden on banks could mean less lending to households and businesses, it said. With credit already growing modestly in Italy, a further pullback would weigh on investment, consumption, and overall growth. European Central Bank warns budget plans may restrain credit The focus of the criticism is a suite of measures covering banks and insurers that are forecast to contribute more than €11 billion by 2028, according to Treasury estimates. The financial industry is projected to finance approximately one-fifth of the tax cuts and spending increases proposed for 2026–2028. Among the key elements of the budget are restrictions on how banks deduct interest expenses to reduce their tax liabilities. The government would also require lenders to spread provisions for some loan losses over several years and increase their IRAP corporate tax — effectively a levy on banks and insurers that choose to finance themselves in Canada — by two percentage points. The ECB cautioned that these changes could skew incentives for banks. The rules, by making write-offs more costly, could lead lenders to delay or reduce the recognition of losses on lower-risk loans. That, the ECB added, might gradually erode balance sheets and reduce transparency into their accounts at banks. The central bank also admonished Italy for frequently using one-off tax measures. It argued that the continuous insertion of ad hoc provisions adds complexity and uncertainty to the tax framework. This uncertainty, it added, could erode investor confidence and potentially increase the cost of banks’ funding. Italy presses ahead despite ECB concerns Despite numerous criticisms, any major changes to the budget in Italy are unlikely to be made. The financial sector is the backbone of the government’s fiscal plans, and there is little leeway for relaxing these measures. The House of Representatives is likely to pass this budget in parliament before the end of the year. The ruling coalition has backed the strategy, contending that banks should contribute more to government coffers after making large sums of money over recent years. Italian banks have been political targets since interest rates began rising. The right-wing government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has accused banks of failing to sufficiently remunerate depositors or ease lending conditions for firms, despite posting record profits with support from higher interest rates and state guarantee schemes during the Covid-19 pandemic. The ECB, however, urged caution. It cautioned that an additional tax burden would result in sudden recalibrations of real economy lending, particularly during an economic slowdown. Small businesses and households would likely be the most severely affected by such cuts. It also took a somewhat cautionary tone on the pro-cyclical nature of the draft law, suggesting that it might exacerbate economic downturns by encouraging banks to tighten credit when conditions worsen. It further noted that, as lending levels in Italy were already weak, the risks of negative repercussions for growth should not be underestimated.

According to a new market note from Matrixport, while total stablecoin supply remains near all-time highs, the pace of new capital inflows has peaked and is now slowing, considered a classic signal of buyer exhaustion. The firm notes that the rolling 12-month growth rate of stablecoin issuance topped out in late October and has since rolled over. The deceleration coincides with a roughly 3% decline in Bitcoin, which was trading near $85,860 on Tuesday morning, struggling to reclaim key moving averages. The Data: Liquidity Stock vs. Liquidity Flow On the surface, crypto liquidity appears abundant. Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) together command a combined market capitalization exceeding $260 billion. However, Matrixport argues that headline supply figures obscure a more important signal: the marginal liquidity needed to sustain price momentum is drying up. The firm attributes the slowdown primarily to the Federal Reserve’s shift toward a more cautious stance on future rate cuts. “Political constraints may have a greater impact on market flows than investors’ perceptions,” Matrixport wrote, adding that liquidity conditions remain constrained by weak retail participation.

Instead of rotating into risk assets, funds are remaining idle or moving into yield-bearing instruments. The firm links this behavior to growing uncertainty around the Fed’s policy path, as reinforced by recent FOMC minutes that offered little clarity on the timing or depth of easing. Market Reaction: Technical Damage Builds Price action has turned defensive. Matrixport notes that Bitcoin has lost its “bull market trend indicator” for the first time in several months, signaling weakening momentum beneath the surface. With the Fed unlikely to deliver aggressive easing in Q1, the firm warns that the “correction phase forecast since October” is likely to persist unless a new macro or liquidity catalyst emerges. Institutional View: Velocity Matters More Than Size Matrixport emphasizes that the key distinction separating institutional positioning from retail narratives is the difference between liquidity stock and liquidity impulse. A $260 billion stablecoin float may sound bullish, but without an accelerating rate of issuance and deployment, it acts more like a reservoir than a flood. Institutional desks are interpreting the Fed’s hesitation as a cap on leverage and risk-taking. Until the cost of capital meaningfully declines or stablecoin issuance re-accelerates on a rolling basis, Matrixport expects choppy, range-bound conditions rather than sustained breakouts.

The firm deployed over $56 million across several key players in the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic allocation provides a clear signal about where one of the most watched investment managers sees value and future growth within the cryptocurrency sector. What Did Ark Invest Actually Buy? According to data from The Block, Ark Invest spread its investment across multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The firm didn’t just dip a toe in the water; it made substantial commitments. Through its ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF ETFs, the company targeted a diversified basket of crypto-related equities and even its own product. Bitmine (BMNR): A $17 million investment. Coinbase (COIN): Shares worth $16.26 million. Circle (CRCL): An allocation of $10.8 million. Furthermore, the purchases included $5.94 million in Block stock, $5.2 million in Bullish (BLSH) shares, and a $1.24 million investment in its own Ark 21Shares Bitcoin Spot ETF. This blend shows a strategy targeting crypto mining, trading platforms, stablecoin issuers, and fintech innovators. Why Are These Ark Invest Crypto Stock Purchases Significant? This move is more than a simple portfolio rebalance. It represents a calculated vote of confidence during a period often marked by market uncertainty. For investors, these Ark Invest crypto stock purchases highlight specific areas of the industry that a leading institutional player believes are poised for success. Cathie Wood’s firm is known for its forward-looking, innovation-focused strategy, making its investment choices a key indicator for market sentiment. Moreover, buying shares in companies like Coinbase and Circle provides indirect exposure to the broader crypto economy’s health. When trading volumes and stablecoin usage grow, these companies typically benefit. Therefore, Ark’s investment can be interpreted as a bullish outlook on overall crypto adoption and infrastructure development. What Does This Mean for the Average Crypto Investor? While most individuals can’t make multi-million dollar stock purchases, they can learn from the strategy. Ark Invest’s actions offer actionable insights. The firm is diversifying within the crypto theme, not putting all its capital into one company. This approach mitigates risk while maintaining exposure to the sector’s growth. For the retail investor, it underscores the importance of looking beyond just Bitcoin or Ethereum. The supporting infrastructure—exchanges, financial service providers, and miners—forms a critical part of the ecosystem. Monitoring where “smart money” like Ark Invest flows can help inform your own research and due diligence process. Conclusion: A Clear Signal of Institutional Conviction Ark Invest’s latest Ark Invest crypto stock purchases send a unambiguous message of conviction. By deploying significant capital across a spectrum of crypto equities, Cathie Wood’s firm is betting on the continued maturation and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. This move provides a valuable case study in institutional crypto investment strategy, highlighting diversification and a focus on foundational industry players. For the market, it’s a potent reminder that major financial institutions continue to build strategic positions for the long term. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which Ark Invest ETFs were used for these purchases? A: The buys were made through three of Ark’s flagship ETFs: the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). Q: Is Ark Invest still bullish on Bitcoin itself? A: Yes. The $1.24 million investment in its own Ark 21Shares Bitcoin Spot ETF indicates ongoing direct bullishness on Bitcoin, alongside its equity bets on companies operating in the ecosystem. Q: What is the significance of buying Circle stock? A: Circle is the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Investing in Circle represents a bet on the growing use of stablecoins for payments, trading, and as a digital dollar within decentralized finance (DeFi). Q: Should I copy Ark Invest’s stock picks exactly? A: Not necessarily. Ark’s trades are part of a large, diversified institutional portfolio. Use them as a starting point for research, but always make investment decisions based on your own financial goals and risk tolerance. Q: Does this mean crypto stocks are a safe investment now? A: No investment is completely “safe.” Crypto-related stocks are often more volatile than the broader market. Ark’s purchase shows conviction, but it does not eliminate the inherent risks associated with this emerging asset class. Found this analysis of Ark Invest’s strategic moves helpful?

However, analysts forecast significant gains for one of the market’s leading altcoins in January 2026, citing three major catalysts that could reshape its market outlook. A Major Step Towards Broader Access In a recent analysis, Sam Daodu, a market expert from 24/7 Wall St., emphasized the importance of Vanguard’s decision to approve trading of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Daodu emphasized that the real significance lies in the facilitation of distribution; with Vanguard’s advisors able to allocate XRP exposure through regulated ETFs without additional cumbersome processes. He indicated that three interrelated factors are now at play: the influx of institutional capital through ETF investments, a reduction in supply, and the influence of Vanguard in altering the approach towards the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pulls Back Under $89K, Michael Saylor Smells Opportunity Notably, the results of the token’s exchange-traded fund launch have already been notable, with XRP inflows hitting $1 billion within the first four weeks of trading, making it one of the fastest-growing crypto ETF launches to date. Additionally, XRP’s market supply has contracted significantly, dropping by 45% from approximately 3.9 billion tokens at the beginning of 2025 to about 1.6 billion by December. This contraction can be attributed to large holders refraining from distributing their tokens, leading to an accumulation in whale wallets and the removal of tokens from liquid markets due to ETF custody. This decreased supply implies that smaller inflows now carry greater influence. With only 1.6 billion tokens available on exchanges, investments of $20-30 million in daily ETF purchases can have a substantive impact on market supply. A Key Driver For Price Appreciation The Vanguard XRP ETF launch is particularly significant in this context, as it locks tokens into regulated custody vehicles that are less likely to be sold frequently. Unlike tokens held on exchanges that can be quickly moved in and out, ETF custody tends to encourage a buy-and-hold strategy, fostering conditions for gradual price appreciation fueled by sustained institutional demand amid a diminishing available supply. Given that the decision to provide ETF access came late in the year, year-end trading typically focuses on maintaining existing allocations rather than creating new positions. While the ETF adds credibility to XRP without causing immediate price pressure, its journey to a $3 valuation by January will depend on how swiftly advisory capital mobilizes, the durability of supply compression, and the overall stability of the markets. XRP Price Path To $3 Three potential scenarios present themselves for XRP’s future. The most optimistic scenario sees advisory capital moving quicker than typical, perhaps allowing advisors to integrate small XRP allocations during January’s rebalancing. In this case, XRP ETF inflows could remain robust, ranging from $40-60 million daily, while the locked-up supply on exchanges supports a price increase that could see the XRP price surpass $2.25, aim for $2.60, and potentially test $3 by the end of January. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Compression Deepens as Analysts Debate if the Next Move Is a Rally or Breakdown The middle-ground perspective suggests a more conventional institutional timing. In this scenario, while the XRP ETF access will gain attention in December, actual allocations might ramp up gradually, leading to a daily influx of about $20-30 million instead of the earlier expected pace. Here, the XRP price could establish higher lows and breach the $2.25 mark, facing resistance between $2.40 and $2.80. Price fluctuations would focus more on future adoption rather than immediate implications. According to Daodu’s conclusions, and given these circumstances, the XRP price reaching $3 could take until the first or second quarter of 2026 rather than being an immediate milestone.

This landmark decision signals a powerful commitment to establishing clear, long-term rules for the digital asset market. For investors and industry players, this transition from a temporary to a permanent body provides the clarity and stability needed for confident participation in one of the world’s most active crypto economies. What Does a Permanent South Korea FSC Virtual Asset Division Mean? The FSC announced this structural change on December 16 through an official legislative notice. The core action involves amending the enforcement rules for the commission to convert the temporary Virtual Asset Division into a permanent organization. Furthermore, the Virtual Asset Inspection Division within the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will also gain permanent status. This dual move creates a robust, enduring framework for both policy-making and enforcement. Essentially, the South Korea FSC Virtual Asset Division will no longer operate on a provisional basis. It becomes a fixed part of the nation’s financial regulatory architecture. This permanence allows for: Long-term strategic planning for crypto market oversight. Dedicated resources and expertise focused solely on virtual assets. Predictable regulatory evolution for businesses and exchanges. Why Is This Regulatory Shift So Significant? South Korea boasts one of the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates globally. However, its regulatory approach has sometimes been reactive, responding to market events like exchange collapses. By establishing a permanent South Korea FSC Virtual Asset Division, regulators are shifting from a firefighting mode to a proactive, strategic stance. This move directly addresses the need for consistent oversight. A permanent division can develop deep institutional knowledge, craft nuanced regulations like the upcoming Virtual Asset User Protection Act, and foster safer market growth. It tells global investors that South Korea is building a mature, regulated environment for digital assets, moving beyond the volatility of its past. What Are the Immediate Benefits and Future Challenges? The immediate benefit is enhanced market confidence. Exchanges and service providers now have a stable point of contact and a clear signal that regulations are here to stay. For users, it promises stronger consumer protection and reduced fraud risk through sustained monitoring by the permanent FIU inspection unit. However, challenges remain. The permanent South Korea FSC Virtual Asset Division must now deliver on its mandate. Key tasks will include: Effectively implementing new user protection laws. Balancing innovation with investor safety. Navigating the complexities of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Ensuring its rules align with global standards to maintain competitiveness. The true test will be how this permanent body adapts to the fast-paced evolution of crypto technology while maintaining its regulatory goals. How Does This Impact the Global Crypto Regulatory Race? South Korea’s action places it at the forefront of nations creating dedicated crypto regulatory bodies. While the EU has MiCA and other regions have frameworks, the act of creating a permanent, specialized division within the top financial regulator is a powerful statement. It may set a blueprint for other Asia-Pacific economies. For global crypto firms, a clear and permanent regulatory structure in a major market like South Korea makes it a more attractive destination for expansion. It reduces the legal uncertainty that has hindered institutional investment. This move could accelerate the professionalization and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies within the country and inspire similar commitments abroad. Conclusion: A New Era of Clarity and Commitment The decision to cement the South Korea FSC Virtual Asset Division as a permanent entity is a watershed moment. It moves cryptocurrency regulation from the periphery to the core of financial governance. This provides the market with the long-sought predictability needed for sustainable growth. While the path ahead requires careful navigation, this foundational step ensures that South Korea will remain a central player in shaping the future of digital finance, with a dedicated watchdog now firmly in place. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did the South Korean FSC announce? A1: The FSC announced a partial amendment to its enforcement rules to change the status of its Virtual Asset Division and the FIU’s Virtual Asset Inspection Division from temporary to permanent organizations. Q2: When was this decision made public? A2: The announcement was made via a legislative notice in the official government gazette on December 16. Q3: Why is making the division permanent important? A3: Permanence provides regulatory stability, allows for long-term policy planning, dedicates sustained resources to crypto oversight, and signals a serious commitment to managing the virtual asset market. Q4: How will this affect cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea? A4: Exchanges will have a consistent and predictable regulatory body to engage with, which should simplify compliance and foster a more stable operating environment. Q5: Does this mean stricter regulations are coming? A5: It signifies more structured and enduring regulations. The focus will likely be on implementing existing laws like the Virtual Asset User Protection Act effectively, which aims to protect consumers while fostering a safe market. Q6: How does this compare to crypto regulation in other countries? A6: It positions South Korea alongside jurisdictions creating dedicated crypto regulatory frameworks. The move to a permanent division within the main financial regulator is a distinct and strong administrative commitment. Found this insight into South Korea’s pivotal regulatory shift helpful?

The metric dropped to a three-week low of $3.02 trillion in late trading on Monday, with Bitcoin leading the decline in what was expected to be a volatile week. BTC has lost support at $90,000, shedding almost $5,000 in a couple of hours as it tanked to $85,200, its lowest level since the massive leverage flush on December 2. The asset had yet to recover and was trading just below $86,000 during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. Crypto Analysts Weigh In Analyst ‘NoLimit’ offered another bearish outlook, claiming that the crash was caused by China, which “tightened regulations on domestic Bitcoin mining again,” forcing local miners offline. The same analyst added that the Bank of Japan would crash Bitcoin this week. Meanwhile, analyst ‘Sykodelic’ blamed it on derivatives markets again, specifically, high open interest. Today, we just had the biggest spike in OI on this move down in six weeks, they said before adding: “Basically, it is becoming extremely accepted to be bearish with everyone really feeling the pinch of the downtrending market. Its creating the environment where traders are chasing every drop with shorts, and short liquidity building up over and over.” According to Deribit, there is $2 billion in OI at the $85,000 strike price. Short sellers may hedge by selling spot or futures as the price falls toward their strike, thereby amplifying the downside. Analyst James Check observed that “Bitcoin market stress is now the highest we’ve seen since the 2022 bear.” There were around $100 billion in unrealised losses, falling hash rates, 60% of ETF inflows underwater, and treasury stocks trading below net asset values, he explained . Meanwhile, analyst ‘Skew’ made their observations about the current state of the market. $BTC As for the market there’s a few things to keep an eye on here Firstly, the bart like price action which seemingly is continuing due to lack of real trading & lack of directional positioning Secondly, the clear imbalance between supply & demand during these barts (high &… pic.twitter.com/Yok9R87wX8 — Skew Δ (@52kskew) December 15, 2025 US Crypto Legislation Delay The primary reason for the dump is likely to be the delay in crypto market structure legislation in the United States. A US Senate Banking Committee spokesperson said on Monday that there will not be a market structure markup this year, delaying the key bipartisan legislation until Congress reconvenes in early 2026. “The Committee is continuing to negotiate and looks forward to a markup in early 2026,” they explained. The crypto industry had widely expected this legislation, which grants the CFTC authority over spot markets, to make more progress before the end of the year.

The first phase of its funding campaign was a quick success, raising $500,000 in less than fourteen days and demonstrating strong investor backing. This energy has carried over into Phase 2, which has already brought in $800,000 from the sale of 13 million tokens . The current supply is selling out quickly, and analysts predict Phase 3 will begin very soon, making this a critical entry point before the price increases. Dogecoin Teeters, GeeFi Builds with Purpose Dogecoin is at a critical support level of $0.1372 , with some analysts predicting a potential 450% rally. This creates uncertainty, but GeeFi offers a project with clear utility. The platform’s foundation is a non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX), which ensures users always retain full control of their private keys and assets. This design eliminates the risks of centralized platforms and empowers users with financial autonomy, offering a more secure way to manage and trade crypto. GeeFi is also preparing to introduce its Crypto Cards. Through partnerships with VISA and Mastercard, these cards will allow users to spend their digital currencies at millions of locations worldwide. This practical application is enhanced by the GEE token’s deflationary mechanics. A built-in token burn process regularly reduces the total supply, which is intended to increase the token’s value as the ecosystem expands and user activity grows. A Presale Designed for Substantial Returns The GeeFi presale is structured to provide early investors with impressive returns. In the current Phase 2, GEE tokens are priced at just $0.06 . With a confirmed listing price of $0.40 , presale participants are positioned for a 667% gain from the moment the token goes live on exchanges. The future potential is even more striking. Some forecasts suggest the token could reach a value of $2. Should this occur, a $1,600 investment made today could turn into $60,000 , delivering a 3,233% ROI . Investor response has been overwhelmingly positive. Over 13 million tokens have been sold in Phase 2, raising $800,000 and showing intense demand. This momentum suggests the phase will sell out quickly. Furthermore, conversations about upcoming listings on major centralized exchanges are creating additional excitement, as such events typically drive significant price appreciation. Earn Passive Income with High-Yield Staking GeeFi provides more than just the potential for capital gains. The platform features a comprehensive staking program that allows you to earn passive income on your holdings. Accessible through the GeeFi Wallet, the program offers several flexible options. You can choose a plan with no lock-up period that yields a 10% APR . For those seeking higher returns, locking tokens for a fixed term offers 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a remarkable 55% APR for one year . A referral program also adds a 5% bonus on investments made through your unique link. The Opportunity to Invest Early Is Fading GeeFi stands apart with its focus on real-world use cases and a well-designed financial model. This presale is a limited-time chance to get involved in a project with high growth potential before it becomes widely known. Phase 2 is rapidly nearing its conclusion, and a price increase in Phase 3 is certain. The combination of guaranteed returns at listing and attractive staking rewards is creating a strong sense of urgency. Decisive investors are securing their tokens now before this opportunity is lost.

Key Takeaways: MetaMask added native Bitcoin support, allowing users to buy, swap, and send BTC directly from the wallet. The move replaces wrapped Bitcoin exposure and reflects MetaMask’s shift away from being an Ethereum-only wallet. MetaMask says more blockchain integrations are planned as part of its broader multichain expansion. The company announced the rollout on social media on Monday, nearly ten months after first hinting at the integration in February. With the update, Bitcoin now joins Ethereum, Solana, Monad and Sei as supported assets within MetaMask, allowing users to hold and transact BTC directly from the wallet. MetaMask Lets Users Buy, Swap and Send Bitcoin MetaMask said users can now buy Bitcoin, swap other tokens into BTC, and send or receive the asset, with confirmed transactions appearing automatically in their asset list. The company cautioned that Bitcoin transfers typically settle more slowly than transactions on EVM-compatible chains or Solana, reflecting the network’s design. To encourage adoption, MetaMask is offering reward points for users who swap into Bitcoin through the wallet. Until now, access to BTC on MetaMask was limited to wrapped versions of the asset, which rely on intermediaries and carry additional smart contract risk. The Bitcoin integration was first discussed earlier this year, when MetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay suggested the feature could go live in the third quarter of 2025. BITCOIN HAS ENTERED THE CHAT MetaMask now supports BTC. pic.twitter.com/S6ZdDStnct — MetaMask.eth (@MetaMask) December 15, 2025 Its arrival underscores the company’s broader effort to reposition itself as a multichain wallet rather than an Ethereum-only tool. MetaMask began that transition in May with support for Solana, followed by integrations with Sei in August and Monad in November. While details remain limited, the firm has signaled that further blockchain support is planned. “Bitcoin support marks the latest step in our multichain expansion,” MetaMask said, adding that additional networks are expected to be added in 2026. MetaMask to Integrate Polymarket As reported, MetaMask has entered the prediction market space through a new integration with Polymarket, allowing users to trade on real-world event outcomes directly from their wallets. The feature introduces one-tap funding, enabling deposits from any EVM-compatible chain, and rewards users with MetaMask points for each prediction placed. The partnership creates a new on-ramp for Polymarket, which has seen rapid growth over the past year, particularly during the 2024 US election cycle. A more favorable regulatory backdrop and renewed US market access have helped drive its expansion, with the platform now reportedly exploring a valuation of up to $15 billion following a strategic investment from Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the NYSE. The wallet is also preparing for the rollout of a native MASK token , as parent company Consensys gears up for a potential IPO . The move comes as Polymarket is recruiting staff for an internal market-making team that would trade against its own customers, mirroring a controversial feature already used by rival Kalshi that has drawn criticism and legal challenges. The New York-based prediction market startup has reportedly approached traders, including sports bettors, to join the new unit, people familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity because the plans remain private.

Rodriguez was sentenced to five years in federal prison last month for money laundering charges. During an afternoon event in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump answered a reporter’s question that he is aware of the case and is open to exploring a potential pardon. “I’ve heard about it, I’ll look at it,” he told the reporter. “Why you think it should be pardoned?” “It sounds like, based on your question, Rodriguez. We’ll look at that, Pam. Okay,” the President said to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was also present during the session. Samourai Dev Rodriguez Faces 5 Years Prison Charges The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, the CEO and CTO of Samourai Wallet on April 24. They each face one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The case was started under the Biden administration. Last month, District Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) handed down Rodriguez’s sentence to five years in prison. Rodriguez was accused of creating a Bitcoin mixing service that was allegedly used to launder $237 million in dirty money. He had voluntarily pleaded guilty in July. Rodriguez Responds to Trump’s Words In response to Trump’s consideration on Monday, Rodriguez said, “This is a big step forward.” I have always said that the most challenging aspect of getting a pardon for me and Bill would be getting the attention of @realDonaldTrump . He is very busy with many people competing for his attention. Today, thanks to the journalist at Decrypt, the President is aware of our… https://t.co/lmYljfFax9 — Keonne Rodriguez (@keonne) December 15, 2025 “This President knows all about lawfare. He knows all about a weaponized Biden DOJ hunting down their political rivals. He knows the tactics and tricks they play. If he looks at our case closely it will be a case of deja vu, and I think he would do the right thing and grant us a pardon,” Rodriguez wrote on X. Trump’s response comes four days before Rodriguez’s prison term begins. Besides, the crypto community is buzzing with #pardonsamourai hashtags, seeking the signing of a petition to reach 100K signatures . “Just as Ross Ulbricht was pardoned, Keonne must be forgiven, too,” wrote crypto entrepreneur Jesse Tevelow . “We cannot allow one of our own fellow Bitcoiners to spend time in jail for building a legitimate product that protects our Bitcoin and strengthens the network.” President Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht , who started Silk Road, a marketplace on the darknet. In October, Trump also pardoned Changpeng “CZ” Zhao , the former head of Binance, concluding months of speculation over his legal fate. These cases mark a major shift in Washington’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation.

Latest data shows U.S. spot XRP ETFs have attracted approximately $990.9 million in net inflows, lifting total net assets to around $1.18 billion in just one month. This rapid capital accumulation highlights a decisive shift in institutional and investor sentiment, positioning XRP as one of the strongest performers in the regulated digital asset investment landscape. Well, the persistence of these inflows is especially noteworthy. While ETF launches often spark brief surges of interest, sustaining positive flows for 30 consecutive days signals more than short-term speculation. It reflects durable investor conviction, driven by XRP’s expanding role in cross-border payments, improving regulatory clarity, and renewed confidence in its long-term utility. By contrast, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, long viewed as the anchors of institutional crypto exposure, have recently seen net outflows. These exits likely reflect profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or heightened caution amid broader market uncertainty. Against this backdrop, XRP’s persistent inflows signal a clear rotation of capital toward assets offering stronger near-term narratives and asymmetric upside potential. XRP ETF demand is also being driven by its clearly differentiated utility. Unlike Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative or Ethereum’s dominance in smart contracts, XRP is directly aligned with real-world payment infrastructure. As financial institutions accelerate the search for faster, lower-cost cross-border settlement solutions, XRP’s role as a blockchain-based payments rail is increasingly resonating with investors seeking functional exposure rather than purely speculative bets. The nearly $1 billion in inflows adds further significance. Achieved in a short timeframe, this milestone highlights a growing appetite for crypto ETF diversification beyond BTC and ETH. More importantly, it signals a shift in institutional behavior, capital is being allocated more deliberately, guided by utility, adoption potential, and strengthening regulatory clarity rather than legacy dominance alone. For now, XRP’s 30-day inflow streak ranks among the clearest signals in the digital asset market, pointing to a quiet yet decisive shift in investor capital and conviction. Conclusion XRP’s 30-day streak of continuous ETF inflows signals a pivotal shift in crypto investing. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs see outflows, XRP has drawn nearly $1 billion, highlighting rising institutional confidence in its utility-driven value. Sustained momentum could mark a broader capital rotation toward assets prioritizing practical adoption, regulatory clarity, and long-term growth over speculation.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-16 06:20:41

What Is Going On?,https://timestabloid.com/everyone-is-searching-for-xrp-right-now-what-is-going-on/,"Recent Google Trends data reveals a significant increase in global search interest for XRP over the past 24 hours. The upward movement in search volume, culminating in near-peak levels by midday December 15, reflects a notable intensification of public attention toward this digital asset. Analysts and market observers often view spikes in search activity as an indicator of widening curiosity, which developments in price action, regulatory news, or broader market dynamics can drive. Analysis of Search Trend Data The Google Trends chart attached to STEPH IS CRYPTO’s post shows relatively stable interest levels in XRP throughout the preceding period, with values mostly fluctuating between moderate and high interest. However, there is a clear upward trajectory beginning in the late hours of the previous day, followed by a sharp acceleration in search demand leading up to the data’s most recent timestamp. This pattern suggests that individuals worldwide are actively seeking information about XRP, indicating renewed attention or concern among retail and institutional participants. BREAKING: EVERYONE IS SEARCHING FOR $XRP RIGHT NOW. WTF IS GOING ON??? pic.twitter.com/xOoKBizdBo — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 15, 2025 The context for this increase is important. Search interest in digital assets often rises when price volatility increases, new market infrastructure developments occur, or significant regulatory actions are reported. In this case, market conditions for cryptocurrencies remain mixed. The broader cryptocurrency markets have experienced downward pressure lately, with major assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, trading lower amid macroeconomic uncertainty and risk-off sentiment among investors. A recent financial report noted that Bitcoin’s price has slipped below key resistance levels, as XRP also trades lower with the market. This general risk asset weakness may prompt investors to reevaluate their positions and search for information on alternative assets, such as XRP. Potential Catalysts Behind the Search Increase Several developments over recent weeks could be contributing to the renewed interest in XRP. Market data indicate that institutional flows into XRP-related exchange-traded products have been expanding, with assets under management for these products climbing as investors seek exposure through regulated vehicles. Analysts highlight that rising institutional engagement, particularly through ETF structures, may lend structural support to XRP’s market profile even while broader markets remain uncertain. Additionally, regulatory advancements have captured industry attention. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently granted conditional approval for national trust bank charters to several firms, including those associated with XRP infrastructure and related stablecoin issuers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While these approvals do not directly authorize deposit-taking or FDIC insurance, they mark a regulatory milestone that could encourage investors to reassess the long-term institutional framework for XRP-linked products. Technical analysts are also drawing attention to XRP’s price behavior. Recent evaluations suggest that, despite short-term price weakness, XRP’s price structure remains above key technical levels that historically have signaled trend continuation phases. Rising ETF assets and continued interest from derivative and institutional players may reinforce this perception among traders and observers. The recent surge in Google search interest for XRP reflects a heightened level of global curiosity and engagement with the asset. This increase in attention corresponds with various developments in the crypto and financial markets. While the short-term price environment for cryptocurrencies remains mixed, the intensification of search activity underscores that XRP continues to occupy a prominent position in market conversations.

Key Takeaways: The SEC has dropped or paused nearly 60% of crypto cases since Trump took office. Enforcement pullbacks include major cases against Ripple and Binance. The agency denies political motives, calling the shift a policy reset. The agency has dismissed or paused close to 60% of crypto-related cases, according to a report published Sunday by The New York Times. While enforcement activity continues across traditional markets, cases involving crypto firms have been disproportionately affected by withdrawals, pauses, or outright dismissals since January, the report said. SEC Retreats From Ripple and Binance Cases Among the most prominent cases cited were the SEC’s long-running lawsuits against Ripple Labs and Binance , both of which have seen significant pullbacks. The Times also noted that the regulator is “no longer actively pursuing a single case against a firm with known Trump ties,” a detail that has intensified scrutiny of the agency’s motives. The SEC pushed back on suggestions of political favoritism, telling the newspaper that its decisions were driven by legal and policy considerations rather than politics. The report added that it found no evidence President Trump directly pressured the agency to abandon specific investigations. Industry figures argue the enforcement retreat reflects a broader reassessment of the SEC’s earlier approach to crypto. Curious about crypto wallets and how to store and access crypto assets? Check out our Crypto Asset Custody Basics Investor Bulletin. https://t.co/x4HMYMHLAe pic.twitter.com/bSbP25nzOc — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) December 13, 2025 Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, said claims that the shift is linked to Trump’s personal interests overlook what he described as years of aggressive and inconsistent regulation. Thorn said framing the pivot as politically motivated ignores “four years of direct attacks by the actual partisans.” The backdrop to the enforcement slowdown includes a deepening connection between Trump-linked entities and the digital asset sector. In 2025, projects associated with the president or his family expanded significantly, ranging from World Liberty Financial to Trump-branded crypto initiatives, including the Official Trump memecoin and American Bitcoin, a mining venture backed by the president’s sons. Leadership Shift at SEC Looms as Final Democratic Commissioner Exits At the same time, changes at the top of the SEC are set to further reshape the agency’s stance. Paul Atkins, a Republican appointee seen as more receptive to market-driven regulation, is expected to remain chair for the foreseeable future. However, the commission is preparing to lose its final Democratic member. Caroline Crenshaw, whose term officially expired in 2024, is expected to depart in January after serving an additional 18 months. Trump has yet to announce nominees to fill her seat or another vacant Democratic position on the commission. Crenshaw has been one of the most vocal critics of the SEC’s softer approach to crypto under the Trump administration. In one of her final public appearances last week, she warned that easing oversight could expose markets to wider contagion risks, cautioning that reduced scrutiny may come at a cost to investor protection.

StraitX, a Singaporean payments infrastructure leader, has announced a powerful move: launching two new stablecoins directly on the Solana blockchain. This strategic launch introduces XSGD, pegged to the Singapore dollar, and XUSD, pegged to the US dollar, aiming to leverage Solana’s renowned speed for seamless transactions. Why Are StraitX Stablecoins on Solana a Game-Changer? The decision to build on Solana is no accident. For payments, speed and cost are everything. Solana’s blockchain is famous for its high throughput and low transaction fees, making it an ideal foundation for stablecoins designed for daily use. By choosing Solana, StraitX positions its new StraitX stablecoins to be among the fastest and most economical digital dollars available. This move directly challenges existing stablecoin networks. It offers users and businesses a compelling alternative, especially for cross-border transfers and real-time settlements where every second and cent counts. What Are XSGD and XUSD Stablecoins? Let’s break down the two new assets. XSGD represents a digital Singapore dollar, each token backed 1:1 by reserves of the national currency. Similarly, XUSD is a digital US dollar token with the same full backing. Their launch on Solana means they inherit the network’s capabilities. More importantly, both will utilize the new x402 payment standard on Solana. Think of x402 as a set of enhanced rules that make transactions more reliable and feature-rich for developers building payment apps. This technical edge could drive wider adoption. XSGD: Targets the robust Singapore economy and its role as a global financial hub. XUSD: Provides a fast, digital entry point to the world’s primary reserve currency. Common Goal: To bridge traditional finance and decentralized applications with compliant, efficient tools. How Will StraitX Impact the Stablecoin Landscape? The entry of a regulated, Singapore-based firm like StraitX brings significant credibility. It signals growing institutional comfort with public blockchains like Solana for serious financial infrastructure. This isn’t just a tech experiment; it’s a calculated step toward mainstream digital asset adoption. For users in Southeast Asia and beyond, the benefits are tangible. Imagine sending Singapore dollars to another country in seconds for less than a cent. Or, a US-based freelancer receiving payments instantly in XUSD without traditional banking delays. These StraitX stablecoins are built to make these scenarios a daily reality. What Challenges Lie Ahead for This Launch? Despite the promise, the path isn’t without hurdles. The stablecoin market, especially for USD, is fiercely competitive. Gaining liquidity and trust will be crucial for XSGD and XUSD. Furthermore, regulatory clarity continues to evolve in both the US and Singapore, which could influence growth. However, StraitX’s focus on compliance and its use of a high-performance chain like Solana are strong differentiators. Success will depend on forging partnerships with exchanges, wallets, and payment gateways to ensure these tokens are accessible and useful everywhere. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Dollars The launch of StraitX’s stablecoins on the Solana blockchain is more than just another crypto announcement. It represents a strategic fusion of regulated finance with cutting-edge blockchain technology. By offering fast, low-cost, and compliant digital versions of the Singapore and US dollars, StraitX is laying groundwork for the next generation of global payments. Watch closely as these tokens begin their journey to potentially reshape how value moves across borders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the StraitX stablecoins? StraitX is launching two stablecoins: XSGD (pegged to the Singapore dollar) and XUSD (pegged to the US dollar) on the Solana blockchain. Why was Solana chosen for this launch? Solana was selected for its high transaction speed and very low costs, which are critical for payment-focused stablecoins aiming for mass adoption. What is the x402 payment standard? The x402 is a technical standard on Solana designed to make payments more reliable and programmable, giving developers better tools to build with these stablecoins. Who is behind StraitX? StraitX is a payments infrastructure firm based in Singapore, operating with a focus on compliance and bridging traditional finance with digital assets. How can I use XSGD or XUSD? Once launched, you will be able to hold, send, receive, and use these tokens in supported wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Solana network. Are these stablecoins regulated? As a Singapore-based entity, StraitX is expected to adhere to the regulatory frameworks of Singapore, including potential stablecoin regulations under development.

The wallet built its positions at the start of the year during the peak of the AI Agent narrative, when capital chased anything linked to autonomous trading bots and AI-powered execution. With liquidity now thin and sentiment cooler, the same bets have been closed at a loss of about $28.54 million, or roughly 92%. Token by token, the damage is stark. The whale lost about 91%, or $15.89M, on AIXBT and 92%, or $9.87M, on FAI. 太惨烈了~ 一个巨鲸在年初的 AI Agent 热潮中用 $3112 万资金购买了多个 AI Agent 代币，如今随着浪潮退下，他在今天上午清仓割掉了这些 AI Agent 代币。他 $3112 万资金只卖回成 $257 万，亏损高达 $2854 万 (-92%)。 $AIXBT ：亏损了 91% ($1589 万)； $FAI ：亏损了 92% ($987 万)； $NFTXBT … pic.twitter.com/P0KTfUdqXn — 余烬 (@EmberCN) December 16, 2025 Aggressive Sell-Off Hammers AI Agent Tokens With Losses Across the Board Positions in NFTXBT and POLY, both from the Virtuals ecosystem, were nearly wiped out with losses of 99%, equal to around $690,000 and $780,000 respectively. The book did not fare much better elsewhere. BOTTO, an AI-driven art and curation project, produced an 84% hit of about $930,000. MAICRO, another Virtuals-linked agent token, cost the wallet roughly $380,000, a 90% drawdown versus its entry. Because order books in these names are now shallow, the forced exit hit prices in real time. Ember’s breakdown shows AIXBT falling about 10% during the selling, FAI dropping 8% and NFTXBT sliding 29%. BOTTO sank 32%, MAICRO tumbled 48% and POLY declined 26% as the whale worked its way through positions. Arkham Reveals Large-Scale Sell-Off as AI Agent Hype Fades Screenshots from Arkham’s explorer point to a sequence of transfers between the whale address and liquidity pools, with tens of millions of tokens in each project moving in quick succession. The flows suggest a deliberate decision to capitulate rather than a slow rebalance, locking in losses instead of waiting for a fresh burst of AI Agent speculation. For market participants who rode the same theme, the episode is a reminder of how narrative-driven sectors can behave once attention shifts elsewhere. Many AI Agent tokens launched into the tail end of the broader AI mania and never built the depth or organic usage that support large tickets on the way out. The liquidation also shows the limits of whale size in illiquid corners of crypto. Size that helps drive performance during the initial run-up can turn into a liability when liquidity dries up, since every attempt to exit pushes prices lower and erodes recovery value. For traders still navigating the agents meta, the whale’s exit cuts both ways. It is a sharp reminder that late-stage narratives can punish even deep wallets, yet some may view the flush as clearing stale supply from thin markets.

According to multiple security reports, the campaign has already netted roughly $300 million in stolen funds and shows few signs of slowing. Fake Zoom Meetings Used To Drain Wallets According to Security Alliance (SEAL) and other researchers, attackers first contact targets through messaging apps such as Telegram. They then invite victims to a video call that looks legitimate. During the call, the impostors claim there is a problem with sound or video and offer a “fix” — a file or a link that appears to be an official update. When the victim runs the file, malware installs and begins stealing credentials, browser data, and crypto keys. Several attacks are reported every day, and many follow the same pattern. Researchers say these staged calls let attackers bypass normal caution because people tend to trust someone they see on camera. SEAL is tracking multiple DAILY attempts by North Korean actors utilizing “Fake Zoom” tactics for spreading malware as well as escalating their access to new victims. Social engineering is at the root of the attack. Read the thread below for pointers on how to stay secure. https://t.co/2SQGdtPKGx — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) December 13, 2025 NimDoor, Other Malware Strains Target macOS And Wallets Based on reports, one strain tied to these schemes is NimDoor , a macOS backdoor that can harvest keychain items, browser-stored passwords, and messaging data. Security teams link NimDoor and related tools to BlueNoroff , a group connected to the Lazarus Group network. BlueNoroff has a long record of attacking crypto firms and exchanges. Once the malware is in place, wallets have been emptied within minutes. Victims often discover the theft only after seeing outgoing transactions on the blockchain. Deepfakes And Calendar Invites Make Scams More Convincing Researchers warn that attackers are not simply using fake names. They are also deploying AI-assisted deepfake video and voice tools to impersonate executives or known contacts. Attackers sometimes send calendar invites that look like genuine meeting requests from platforms such as Calendly, directing targets to attacker-controlled Zoom links. The level of social engineering makes the calls seem urgent and official, which reduces the time victims take to question what they are being asked to install. Attackers Target Individuals And Small Firms Alike Reports have disclosed that victims include individual traders, startup employees, and small teams at crypto companies. Losses are concentrated but widespread, with estimates around $300,000,000. Some victims have lost funds tied to browser wallets and hot wallets; others had recovery phrases captured and used to drain accounts. Security teams urge quick action when a suspicious update is offered during a remote session: They warn not to run it, verify separately, and treat unsolicited meeting fixes as high risk.

The fund, called My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), issues shares as digital tokens that live on the public Ethereum network and are aimed at qualified investors through the bank’s Morgan Money platform. Related Reading: Analyst: Bitcoin’s Cycle Is Intact, Yet No Longer Purely Market-Driven JPMorgan Issues Tokenized Fund On Ethereum Based on reports, MONY holds familiar, low-risk instruments such as US Treasury securities and repurchase agreements fully backed by Treasuries. The bank says the token shares represent direct ownership of the fund and can be held at blockchain addresses, opening up on-chain settlement and recordkeeping for a product that normally sits in traditional custody systems. Seeded With $100 Million Reports have disclosed that JPMorgan seeded MONY with $100 million of its own capital at launch. The move is meant to kickstart liquidity and show institutional seriousness about putting cash management products on-chain. The tokenization work is being handled by internal teams tied to JPMorgan’s digital-assets efforts, and the bank has been testing ways to move conventional securities into token form for several years. How The Tokens Work And Who Can Use Them Investors receive tokenized fund shares that may be transferred or recorded on Ethereum. Based on reports, access is limited: the fund is offered only to qualified clients via Morgan Money, not to the general retail public. The token structure mirrors traditional fund economics — holders are exposed to the same short-term instruments that underpin money-market products — but the record of ownership is stored on a public ledger. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $200 Trillion? CEO Makes Bold Prediction Qualified Investors And Access According to coverage, institutional clients with asset levels above $25 million and accredited individuals with at least $5 million are among those eligible, and the minimum initial investment sits at roughly $1 million. That narrow access aligns with regulatory guardrails for tokenized securities and with the bank’s goal of serving big, sophisticated cash managers first. Analysts say the launch is part of a broader push by big asset managers to experiment with tokenized share classes and on-chain settlement. Other firms have run pilots with similar ideas, and some have already put cash-like products on Ethereum. Based on reports, the move points to an industry desire to test whether blockchain can speed up settlement, increase transparency, or create new on-chain liquidity for institutional cash flows.

With BTC recently dropping back below $90,000, questions are resurfacing about what truly drives Bitcoin’s price. Historically, its value has been anchored more in conviction than in real economic activity, and that limitation is becoming increasingly visible. Bitcoin Hyper aims to push beyond that boundary by creating an environment where BTC can actively move, transact, and scale. Rather than attempting to modify Bitcoin, the project is designed to operate alongside it. Bitcoin remains unchanged as the ultimate settlement layer, while all the functions it was never built to handle are shifted elsewhere. Transactions and execution occur in a high-speed setting, finally allowing applications to function without restriction. This structure has drawn growing investor interest to HYPER, a token positioned at the core of Bitcoin’s evolution from a passive store of value into a functioning economic network. Access at the current level remains available for a limited time, with HYPER priced at $0.013425 for the next five hours before the following presale phase begins. Six-Figure Bitcoin Highlights the Next Challenge As 2025 approaches its end, it is likely to be remembered as the year Bitcoin firmly entered six-figure price territory. However, the recent pullback has reignited a more fundamental debate: is the store-of-value narrative alone enough to sustain further price growth? These concerns are also emerging in traditional financial markets. Strategy is facing scrutiny as index providers assess whether its significant Bitcoin exposure still warrants inclusion in major benchmarks, including MSCI indices. Analysts at JPMorgan have cautioned that a potential removal could result in billions of dollars in passive fund outflows. Meanwhile, Strategy’s stock has declined much more sharply than Bitcoin itself and is now trading closer to the value of the BTC it holds, rather than at the premium investors previously attributed to its Bitcoin-focused treasury approach.

Morgan says an MSCI delisting would trigger a $2.8 Billion forced sell off. They are banking on you not knowing the math. I assessed… pic.twitter.com/NszHcnYt69 — Adrian (@_Adrian) November 25, 2025 Scarcity by itself may no longer be sufficient to push Bitcoin’s price higher. For Bitcoin to return to and maintain six-figure levels, and eventually move beyond previous records, the network needs a new driver of demand. Bitcoin’s base layer was deliberately built to be minimal, conservative, and extremely resistant to change. It functions as a neutral settlement layer that places security and verifiability above all other priorities. This design philosophy is exactly what has allowed Bitcoin to operate for more than a decade without being compromised. However, that same philosophy also imposes a limitation. If Bitcoin must remain simple, then advanced execution cannot take place on the base layer and must exist elsewhere. There is no alternative approach. This is the role Bitcoin Hyper is designed to serve. Execution is shifted into a separate environment, while Bitcoin continues to act as the ultimate arbiter of truth. Bitcoin’s Simplicity Was a Deliberate Choice Bitcoin was created as an incorruptible form of money one that no government, corporation, or small group could modify, debase, or control. Achieving this required a system that was unbreakable by design, even if that meant giving up speed or flexibility. That is why Bitcoin depends on something as fundamentally simple as SHA-256: a one-way cryptographic function that avoids complexity but performs its core function exceptionally well. It can be verified instantly but cannot be reversed, and this imbalance forms the foundation of Bitcoin’s security. FUN FACT: Bitcoin runs on SHA256—a one-way cryptographic function. It’s what secures your sats with trillions of hashes per second. Want to see how unbreakable that really is?Watch this pic.twitter.com/SQ6iPGu918 — Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoin) April 24, 2025 Think of Bitcoin as solid bedrock. You don’t dig through bedrock every time you want to construct something new you build on top of it, because the strength underneath is what gives everything above it lasting value. From the outset, Bitcoin’s base layer was deliberately designed to be minimal and conservative. By limiting moving parts, it reduced potential attack vectors, lowered governance risk, and ensured the system could be verified by anyone without relying on complex logic. That discipline is exactly why Bitcoin has remained the most secure and decentralized network in the crypto ecosystem. At the same time, bedrock is not meant to be inhabited it is meant to support what’s built above it. Advanced functionality was never intended to reside on Bitcoin’s base layer, and attempting to force it there would weaken the very properties that give Bitcoin its value. This is the motivation behind Bitcoin Hyper. The project adds an additional layer above Bitcoin, allowing advanced functionality to exist without making any changes to the underlying chain. That execution layer operates on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), removing execution from Bitcoin’s slow base layer and placing it into an environment designed for speed and scalability. In this setting, transactions are fast and inexpensive, and complexity no longer acts as a constraint. The result goes beyond simple “hybrid apps” and represents a structural shift. Bitcoin no longer remains idle. BTC moves through DeFi, gaming, and real economic activity at Solana-level speeds, while final settlement continues to anchor back to Bitcoin fast on the surface, immutable at its core. The Infrastructure Bet Behind Bitcoin’s Next Move: HYPER The Bitcoin Hyper system is built to accomplish something Bitcoin has never been able to do at scale: make BTC usable in everyday economic activity. Within Bitcoin Hyper, applications are designed to accept Bitcoin itself as the medium of exchange. To interact with these applications, users must use BTC. This is where the shift occurs. When applications depend on BTC to operate, demand is no longer driven solely by speculation or macro narratives it becomes structural. Bitcoin begins to act less like dormant collateral and more like money actively circulating within an ecosystem. At the same time, Bitcoin Hyper is not only introducing a new use case for BTC. It is also creating a second layer of economic opportunity similar to what early Bitcoin adopters once experienced. That execution layer requires fuel, and that role is fulfilled by HYPER. The seat is optional. Hyper carries the whole ecosystem anyway. https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/lNbiunomew — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 10, 2025 HYPER functions as the gas token that powers transactions across the network, the staking asset used to help secure it, and the governance token that guides its long-term development. It is the asset that captures the growth of activity taking place on top of Bitcoin. This is why more than $29.5 million has already been raised in the presale, with investors making early commitments to the infrastructure they believe Bitcoin will ultimately require to continue moving higher. At the current presale price of $0.013425, many see HYPER as being valued based on development-stage risk rather than the potential of a fully operational ecosystem. How to Buy HYPER To purchase HYPER, visit the Bitcoin Hyper website and buy the token using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or a credit card.

The report now emphasizes sustainable economic growth as a crucial component of financial stability. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who chairs the FSOC, said that monitoring vulnerabilities alone is insufficient for financial stability; instead, sustainable long-term economic growth and economic security are interdependent with stability. The 2025 FSOC report eliminated the term “vulnerabilities” from its table of contents and reduced emphasis on identifying the systemic dangers of digital assets. FSOC says the GENIUS Act laid the foundation for crypto regulation The 2025 FSOC report highlighted the GENIUS Act as the legislation that established the federal framework for regulating stablecoin payments. The law requires 100% reserve disclosures and oversight by agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Controller of the Budget, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Trump administration has maintained a pro-crypto stance, urging regulators to withdraw previous broad warnings to financial institutions regarding their engagement with crypto-related activities. The GENIUS Act, signed into law in July by the President, now positions compliant stablecoins to support the U.S dollar’s role in the international financial system. According to the FSOC 2025 report, continued use of dollar-denominated stablecoins will reinforce the dollar position in global economic systems. Meanwhile, the 2025 FSOC report avoids flagging explicit vulnerabilities such as potential contagion from stablecoins or spot market connections. This is in contrast to the 2024 FSOC report, which had recommended congressional approval on stablecoin regulation and spot markets. The 2025 report’s digital assets section has included a ‘further actions’ subsection that references the President’s Working Group report on U.S. crypto activity and the administration’s agenda to enable innovation and American leadership in digital financial technologies. President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order 14178 in January, revoking Biden’s directive. The order introduced responsible growth of digital assets, while prohibiting the issuance of a central bank digital currency. Other regulatory steps highlighted in 2025 include the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 via SAB 122, which removes the balance-sheet liability requirements for custodial crypto assets. EU warns that stablecoins pose a financial systemic failure risk if unmanaged The OCC issued guidance earlier this year authorizing banks to conduct specific crypto transactions and granted preliminary trust charters to firms such as Circle, Ripple, Paxos, BitGo, and Fidelity Digital Assets. The 2025 report has encouraged institutional growth, especially in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds and tokenization assets. Such markets and institutions performed well in 2025. According to the 2025 FSOC report, illicit finance may be facilitated by stablecoins; however, most on-chain activities are transparent and legitimate. The report calls for continued enforcement without blocking lawful use cases of crypto assets. It also encourages ongoing regulatory developments across custody, anti-money laundering obligations, and the use of blockchain. Current frameworks such as the GENIUS Act allow for managed participation in the digital assets ecosystem. Globally, the Financial Stability Board and the Financial Action Task Force have shown concerns over fragmented oversight and illicit flows. For instance, European regulators have warned of the systemic risks posed by stablecoins. According to a Cryptopolitan report , Pierre Gramegna, the managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, cautioned in October that stablecoins could endanger global financial stability if left unregulated. Gramegna urged stablecoins to be tied to central bank money before gaining mainstream adoption to avoid the risk of the entire financial system collapsing, not just in Europe. The UK has also signaled that it will regulate crypto assets from 2027, aligning with the U.S. approach. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has called for Keir Starmer, UK Prime Minister, to prioritize stablecoin regulation.

With BTC dipping below $90,000, it’s becoming clearer that Bitcoin’s valuation has long been powered more by conviction than by real transactional use. That limitation is increasingly difficult to ignore. Bitcoin Hyper aims to remove that barrier by creating an environment where BTC can actually move, be used, and scale in real economic activity. Rather than attempting to modify Bitcoin Hyper is built alongside it. Bitcoin remains unchanged as the ultimate settlement layer, while the functions it was never meant to handle are moved off-chain. Transaction execution takes place in a fast, flexible ecosystem, finally giving applications the space they need to operate efficiently. This architecture is what’s driving investor interest in HYPER, the token positioned at the core of Bitcoin’s shift from a passive store of value into an active economic system. That opportunity is still open for a limited time. HYPER is currently priced at $0.013425, but that price is only available for the next five hours before the following presale phase begins. Six Figures Reveal Bitcoin’s Next Challenge As 2025 approaches its end, the year is set to be remembered for the moment Bitcoin firmly crossed into six-figure price levels. However, the recent pullback has reignited a more uncomfortable debate: can Bitcoin’s role as a store of value alone continue to support further price growth? That uncertainty is no longer limited to crypto circles and is beginning to appear in traditional financial markets. Strategy is facing mounting scrutiny as index providers review whether its substantial Bitcoin exposure still warrants inclusion in major benchmarks, including the MSCI indices. Analysts at JPMorgan have cautioned that any potential removal could result in billions of dollars exiting through passive investment funds. Meanwhile, Strategy’s stock has declined significantly more than Bitcoin itself and is now trading much closer to the underlying value of its BTC holdings, rather than maintaining the premium that investors previously attributed to its treasury-focused approach. MSCI $MSTR DE-LISTING FEAR MONGERING: THE $2.8 BILLION LIE First: Strategy is at ZERO risk of being delisted from other indices. Second: J.P. Morgan says an MSCI delisting would trigger a $2.8 Billion forced sell off. They are banking on you not knowing the math. I assessed… pic.twitter.com/NszHcnYt69 — Adrian (@_Adrian) November 25, 2025 Scarcity alone may no longer be sufficient to keep pushing Bitcoin’s price upward. For the market to reclaim and hold six-figure levels and eventually move beyond previous highs the network needs a new driver of demand. Bitcoin’s base layer was deliberately engineered to be lean, cautious, and resistant to change. It functions as a neutral settlement layer, placing security and verifiability above every other consideration. That conservative design is exactly what has allowed Bitcoin to operate reliably for more than a decade. However, this same philosophy also imposes a limitation. If Bitcoin must stay simple by design, then advanced execution and functionality must exist outside of it. There is effectively no alternative approach. This is precisely the space Bitcoin Hyper is designed to occupy. Execution is handled in a separate ecosystem, while Bitcoin continues to serve as the ultimate source of settlement and truth. Bitcoin’s Design Prioritized Simplicity by Choice Bitcoin was built as a form of money that cannot be altered, diluted, or controlled by any government, corporation, or small group of actors. Achieving that goal required a system engineered to be resilient above all else, even if it meant giving up speed and adaptability. This is why Bitcoin depends on the stark simplicity of SHA-256. It is a one-way cryptographic function that avoids complexity and specialization, yet performs its role with unmatched reliability. Verification is fast and straightforward, while reversal is effectively impossible and this imbalance is what underpins Bitcoin’s security model. FUN FACT: Bitcoin runs on SHA256—a one-way cryptographic function. It’s what secures your sats with trillions of hashes per second. Want to see how unbreakable that really is?Watch this 👇 pic.twitter.com/SQ6iPGu918 — Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoin) April 24, 2025 Think of Bitcoin as the foundation. You don’t drill into bedrock every time you want to expand a structure you build on top of it, because the strength underneath is what supports everything above. From the beginning, Bitcoin’s base layer was deliberately kept simple and conservative. By minimizing moving parts, it reduced attack vectors, limited governance risk, and ensured the system could be verified by anyone without relying on complicated logic. That discipline is a key reason Bitcoin remains the most secure and decentralized network in the crypto space. Still, bedrock isn’t meant to be lived in it’s meant to support what’s built above it. Advanced features were never intended to operate on Bitcoin’s base layer, and forcing them there would erode the very attributes that give Bitcoin its value. This is exactly why Bitcoin Hyper exists. It adds a layer above Bitcoin where advanced functionality can operate without modifying the underlying chain. That execution layer is powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), pulling execution away from Bitcoin’s slower base layer and placing it into an environment optimized for speed and scalability. Transactions become fast and inexpensive, and complexity is no longer a limiting factor. The result is more than simple “hybrid applications” it represents a deeper structural change. Bitcoin is no longer static. BTC moves through DeFi, gaming, and real economic use cases at Solana-level speeds, while final settlement still resolves back on Bitcoin. Fast at the top, immutable at the core. The Infrastructure Play Powering Bitcoin’s Next Phase: HYPER The Bitcoin Hyper framework is built around a single objective that Bitcoin itself has never achieved at scale: enabling BTC to function in everyday economic use. Within the Bitcoin Hyper environment, applications are designed to use Bitcoin directly as the means of exchange. Participation requires BTC, not a substitute or wrapper. That is where the dynamic begins to change. When applications depend on BTC to operate, demand shifts away from pure speculation or macro-driven narratives and becomes embedded in actual usage. Bitcoin starts to resemble an active currency circulating through an ecosystem, rather than idle collateral sitting on the sidelines. However, Bitcoin Hyper is doing more than expanding BTC’s utility. It also introduces an economic layer reminiscent of the early opportunities that first-generation Bitcoin supporters experienced. This execution layer requires energy to operate, and that role is fulfilled by HYPER. The seat is optional. Hyper carries the whole ecosystem anyway. ⚡️🔥https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/lNbiunomew — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 10, 2025 HYPER functions as the network’s gas token, enabling transactions across the system, while also serving as the staking asset that contributes to network security and the governance token that guides its long-term direction. It is the mechanism through which growth at the execution layer is captured. This is why the presale has already attracted more than $29.5 million, with investors positioning themselves early around the infrastructure they believe Bitcoin will need to sustain its next phase of growth. At the current presale price of $0.013425, many see HYPER as reflecting early-stage development risk rather than the valuation of a fully operational ecosystem. How to Purchase HYPER To acquire HYPER, visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and complete your purchase using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or a credit card. Bitcoin Hyper also recommends using Best Wallet, a widely used crypto and Bitcoin wallet. HYPER is already listed in Best Wallet’s Upcoming Tokens section, allowing users to buy, monitor, and later claim their tokens once the launch goes live.

Although XRP is still a liquid, major altcoin with strong market presence, its current phase is indicative of the fundamental shift that is occurring in the broader crypto markets. As the potential for growth in more established assets such as XRP becomes more marginal, institutional and individual investors are increasingly choosing to rotate their assets into more nascent projects that provide earlier investment entry points with more fundamentally sound growth opportunities. This is increasingly placing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly in the crosshairs as the next big crypto investment, as well as one of the cryptos to buy now for current investors. Currently priced at $0.035 and firmly in the final phase of “Phase 6” of its presale, with more than 18,500 unique holders and exceeding $19.5 million raised, Mutuum Finance is clearly gaining significant traction with a clear understanding of what it is that this crypto hopes to achieve. Contrary to many other coins that are trading on pure speculation, Mutuum Finance is developing a fundamentally more robust decentralized lending-and-borrowing platform with utility token mechanics built for sustainable yields into the foreseeable long-term future. As it enters the end stages of “Phase 6” with widespread anticipation of its V1 Sepolia Testnet, Mutuum Finance is increasingly becoming recognized for more than mere alternative investment opportunities to established assets such as XRP, representing something of a generational investment opportunity firmly before the broader crypto markets. XRP Bulls Holding Key Demand Zone Due to Firm Market Structure Ripple (XRP) has been engaged in a managed correction for the past few months, trading inside a clearly established downtrend since its initial impulsive move, which indicates a managed process of accumulation, as opposed to panic-selling. The current price is reacting to a major support area between $1.88 and $1.62, which has consistently shown intense buy interests in the past, with that same area becoming a crucial test of strength for bulls at the current juncture. So long as XRP is able to maintain support through this area, the overall positive market structure is maintained, keeping the potential for an upward shift purely dependent on renewed strength. This current phase of large-cap markets consolidating without disrupting essential support levels often precedes the quiet accumulation of capital into the next growth spot, an increasingly likely prospect for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big crypto and the best crypto to buy now. MUTM Presale Accelerates as DeFi Project Sees Increased Activity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly establishing itself among the leaders in DeFi for 2026. It is currently in Phase 6 of its presale with tokens selling for $0.035. This is the last chance for people to buy before Phase 7, where the tokens will be selling for $0.04. Additionally, Mutuum Finance has made it easier for people to invest by allowing the purchase of tokens using credit or debit cards. The two-tier lending system of the platform is widely appreciated for its scalability and efficiency. Designed in such a way that it connects the lender and the borrower through effective liquidity pools, MUTM allows for lucrative returns as well as resource optimization. So far, the presale phase of the project has managed to collect more than $19.5 million from 18,500+ participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Roadmap Mutuum is currently in the technology development stage of its ecosystem. Some of the key milestones in this phase are: Finalization of Smart Contracts Testing and internal quality assurance Building front-end and back-end components of DApp applications Integration of sophisticated risk management solutions The next phase will include a beta release on the Sepolia Testnet, as well as a security audit, before Mainnet network launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly climbing the ranks to become the next big crypto, with Phase 6 of their presale almost finished. Currently at a cost of $0.035, it boasts over 18,500 members with more than $19.5 million funding. Phase 7 is set to increase the pricing to $0.04, which is the last chance for investors to get on board. MUTM is set for long-term growth with its unique lending mechanism, interest-bearing tokens, and imminent Sepolia Testnet launch. Do not miss the chance to be part of a community that is set for generational growth before mass adoption, making it the crypto to buy now.

By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $0.5 (-10%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $0.5578 24-hour low $0.497 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.5 Price Prediction $ 0.4135 (-25.06%) Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 16.65% (Very High) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.8262 200-Day SMA $ 1.89 14-Day RSI 40.68 (Neutral) TIA price analysis: TIA price faces bearish pressure toward $0.5 TIA price analysis shows bearish pressure toward $0.5 Resistance for TIA is present at $0.715 Support for TIA/USD is present at $0.405 The TIA price analysis for December 16 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility toward the $0.5 level. Currently, sellers are controlling the price chart as they push the price toward support channels. TIA price analysis 1-day chart: TIA price faces selling pressure Analyzing the daily Celestia price chart, TIA price is facing rising selling momentum as sellers pushed the price toward $0.5 level. The recent selling pressure triggered strong liquidation on TIA. The 24-hour volume surged to $9.3 million, showing a slight increase in trading activity today. TIA is trading at $0.5, declining by over 10% in the last 24 hours. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers around the 32-level, showing that sellers are controlling the momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests lower volatility for the next few hours. TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility around $0.5, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The BoP indicator is bearish at 0.64, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent TIA prices from an immediate surge. However, if the TIA price successfully breaks above $0.715, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $1.222. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.405, resulting in a correction to $0.266. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold around $0.5 as buyers lose confidence, resulting in a downward push. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market. Recent news/opinions on TIA Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade introduced PeerDAS, increasing data availability capacity to 10–15 blobs per block, compared with Celestia’s roughly 1,600 blobs per day. This challenges Celestia’s modular DA narrative as Ethereum now supports more than 55 rollups and over $40 billion in total value locked. Celestia price prediction December 2025 Celestia’s price is declining following the market crash in October. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $0.5 and a maximum of $1.3, with an average of $0.9 in December. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction December 2025 $0.5 $0.9 $1.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward.

This new trading pair, LIGHT/USDT, goes live today at 8:00 a.m. UTC and supports leverage of up to 50x. This listing provides traders with a powerful new instrument to speculate on the price of LIGHT without an expiry date. Let’s explore what this means for the market and how you can navigate this opportunity. What Are LIGHT Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? Perpetual futures, or ‘perps’, are a cornerstone of crypto derivatives. Unlike traditional futures, they have no settlement date. This allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, provided they can manage the funding rate mechanism. The listing of LIGHT perpetual futures on a major exchange like OKX signals growing institutional and retail interest in the LIGHT token. It enhances liquidity and provides a regulated venue for sophisticated trading strategies. How Can You Trade LIGHT Futures on OKX? The process is straightforward for existing OKX users. You simply need to navigate to the Derivatives trading section and select the new LIGHT/USDT pair. However, the 50x leverage is a double-edged sword. It can amplify gains, but it also magnifies losses exponentially. Therefore, newcomers should approach with caution. Accessibility: Trade is available 24/7 with deep liquidity from OKX’s user base. Flexibility: Go long if you believe the price will rise, or short if you anticipate a drop. Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders. The high volatility of crypto assets makes this essential, especially with leverage. What Are the Key Benefits and Inherent Challenges? This listing offers clear advantages. Primarily, it grants efficient exposure to LIGHT’s price movements without needing to own the underlying asset. Furthermore, the 50x leverage allows for significant capital efficiency. Traders can control a large position with a relatively small margin. However, the challenges are real. The high leverage can lead to rapid liquidation if the market moves against your position. Additionally, you must understand the funding rate, a periodic fee exchanged between long and short positions to keep the futures price anchored to the spot price. Misunderstanding this can erode profits. Who Should Consider Trading LIGHT Perpetual Futures? This instrument is best suited for experienced traders who understand derivatives and risk management. It is not ideal for buy-and-hold investors or those new to cryptocurrency. If you have a strong thesis on LIGHT’s short-to-medium-term price direction and can stomach volatility, LIGHT perpetual futures offer a potent tool. For others, observing the price action and volume post-listing can provide valuable market sentiment data. Conclusion: A Strategic Addition for the Informed Trader OKX’s decision to list LIGHT perpetual futures is a strategic enhancement of its derivatives suite. It provides the market with more choice and sophistication. For the savvy trader, it represents a new avenue for potential profit. For the broader ecosystem, it signifies maturation and increased institutional-grade product offerings. As always, the key to success lies in education, prudent risk management, and a clear strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the ticker and trading pair for the new OKX futures contract? A1: The new contract is for LIGHT/USDT perpetual futures. Q2: What is the maximum leverage available for LIGHT perpetual futures on OKX? A2: OKX is offering leverage of up to 50x for this new futures pair. Q3: Do perpetual futures expire like traditional futures contracts? A3: No, a key feature of perpetual futures is that they have no expiry date. Positions can be held open indefinitely, subject to funding rate payments. Q4: Is trading perpetual futures riskier than spot trading? A4: Yes, significantly. The use of leverage amplifies both potential profits and potential losses, making risk management crucial. Q5: What time do LIGHT perpetual futures start trading on OKX? A5: Trading commenced at 8:00 a.m. UTC on the announcement date. Q6: Can I trade these futures on the OKX mobile app? A6: Yes, OKX’s full derivatives trading suite, including new listings like LIGHT perpetual futures , is accessible via their official mobile application.

Babylon Labs, the innovative developer behind a native Bitcoin staking protocol, has joined forces with DSRV, a global validator and Virtual Asset Service Provider. Together, they are building the foundation for BTCFi 2.0 , a new era designed specifically for institutional confidence and participation. This collaboration marks a significant leap forward in making Bitcoin’s immense value work harder within the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. What Exactly Is BTCFi 2.0 and Why Does It Matter? You might be wondering, what separates BTCFi 2.0 from the DeFi we know today? The first wave of decentralized finance largely revolved around Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. Bitcoin, despite being the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was often sidelined, requiring complex and risky bridges to participate. BTCFi 2.0 aims to change that by enabling Bitcoin to be used natively and securely for staking and earning yield, without ever leaving its own secure blockchain. This paradigm shift unlocks Bitcoin’s dormant capital, potentially bringing trillions of dollars of value into productive use. This new phase is not just about technology; it’s about trust and infrastructure. The goal is to create an environment where large-scale investors—think hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations—can engage with Bitcoin-based financial services with the same level of confidence they have in traditional markets. Therefore, the partnership between a cutting-edge protocol developer and a seasoned institutional validator is a perfect match to tackle this challenge. Meet the Architects: Babylon Labs and DSRV To understand the potential of this alliance, let’s look at what each partner brings to the table. Babylon Labs is the brains behind a novel Bitcoin staking protocol. Their key innovation? It allows Bitcoin to be used as staking collateral within ecosystems like Ethereum without the need for a bridge . This eliminates a major point of failure and security risk. Their protocol has already gained impressive traction, with over 62,000 BTC staked, demonstrating strong early adoption. On the other side is DSRV. They are not a newcomer; they are a established global validator and VASP with a core focus on serving institutions. Their expertise lies in: Secure Custody Solutions: Safeguarding digital assets with enterprise-grade security. Professional Validator Services: Ensuring blockchain network integrity and uptime. Robust Infrastructure: Providing the reliable backbone needed for 24/7 operations. In essence, Babylon Labs builds the groundbreaking highway for BTCFi 2.0 , and DSRV provides the guardrails, maintenance crews, and security checkpoints that make institutions feel safe to drive on it. What Are the Tangible Benefits of This BTCFi 2.0 Push? This partnership is poised to deliver concrete advantages that could reshape the market. First and foremost, it addresses the critical need for institutional-grade security and compliance . By combining DSRV’s custody and operational rigor with Babylon’s trust-minimized protocol, they create a solution that meets the high standards of professional investors. Secondly, it significantly enhances Bitcoin’s utility . Instead of sitting idle in cold storage, Bitcoin can now be put to work to secure other networks and generate yield, all while remaining natively on the Bitcoin blockchain. This creates a powerful new revenue stream for long-term Bitcoin holders. Finally, this collaboration could act as a major catalyst for mainstream adoption . When large institutions enter the space with confidence, it brings legitimacy, liquidity, and stability, benefiting the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges and Insights While the vision is compelling, the path to a fully realized BTCFi 2.0 is not without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a global patchwork, and institutions will move cautiously until frameworks are more defined. Furthermore, educating traditional finance about these new, complex mechanisms will be an ongoing effort. The technology itself, though innovative, must prove its resilience under real-world economic stresses and adversarial conditions. The key insight here is that true maturation of crypto requires these kinds of deep infrastructure partnerships. Innovation alone isn’t enough; it must be paired with operational excellence and a relentless focus on security to cross the chasm into the institutional world. The Babylon-DSRV alliance is a textbook example of this necessary convergence. The Final Word: A New Chapter for Bitcoin The partnership between Babylon Labs and DSRV is more than just a business deal; it’s a statement of intent for the future of finance. They are collaboratively building the essential pillars for BTCFi 2.0 , an ecosystem where Bitcoin’s value is fully activated within a secure, institutional-friendly framework. This move has the potential to unlock unprecedented liquidity, drive the next wave of adoption, and solidify Bitcoin’s role not just as digital gold, but as a foundational, productive asset in the global financial system. The era of Bitcoin simply being held is giving way to an era of Bitcoin being strategically deployed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Bitcoin staking, and how is it different in BTCFi 2.0? A: Traditionally, staking involves locking up crypto on a proof-of-stake network to earn rewards. BTCFi 2.0 enables Bitcoin (on its own proof-of-work chain) to be used as staking collateral for other networks without being bridged, making it more secure and native. Q: Why is the DSRV partnership crucial for Babylon Labs? A: DSRV provides the institutional-grade custody, validation services, and operational security that large investors require. This partnership adds a critical layer of trust and infrastructure that the protocol alone cannot provide. Q: Is my Bitcoin safe if it’s staked through this protocol? A: Babylon’s protocol is designed to be trust-minimized, meaning your Bitcoin never leaves the Bitcoin blockchain via a bridge. When combined with DSRV’s secure infrastructure, it aims to create a highly secure environment, though all crypto activities carry inherent risk. Q: Can retail investors participate in BTCFi 2.0? A> While the initial focus is on building institutional-grade rails, the technology and services developed will likely trickle down and become accessible to retail investors through various platforms and services in the future. Q: How does this differ from wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)? A> Wrapped Bitcoin involves locking BTC on the Bitcoin chain to mint a representative token on Ethereum, which requires a trusted custodian. Babylon’s approach aims to keep Bitcoin on its native chain while still allowing it to perform functions in other ecosystems, potentially reducing counterparty risk. Q: What’s the next big milestone for this partnership? A> The key next steps will involve further development and hardening of the staking protocol, onboarding initial institutional partners to the platform, and expanding the range of networks that Bitcoin can secure. Found this deep dive into the future of Bitcoin finance insightful? The move towards BTCFi 2.0 is a pivotal story for the entire crypto space.

55863938,https://nulltx.com/?p=152863,1765870723,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Visa Goes All-In on Stablecoins With New Advisory Practice,https://nulltx.com/visa-goes-all-in-on-stablecoins-with-new-advisory-practice/,"On December 15, Visa officially launched its Stablecoins Advisory Practice under Visa Consulting & Analytics, signaling a decisive shift from experimentation to execution. The new unit offers hands-on guidance to banks, fintechs, and enterprises looking to issue, integrate, and scale stablecoin-based payment systems. According to WatcherGuru , the advisory practice has already completed more than 20 global client engagements, helping organizations move beyond high-level strategy into live, production-grade implementations. This is not a research desk. It is an operational play. From Concept to Live Stablecoin Payments Visa’s Stablecoins Advisory Practice is designed to address a recurring problem across traditional finance. Interest in stablecoins is high. Execution remains difficult. Many institutions understand the potential of blockchain-based settlement but struggle with technical integration, compliance design, operational workflows, and go-to-market execution. Visa’s new unit steps directly into that gap. The advisory practice covers the full lifecycle of stablecoin deployment, including: Stablecoin education and market trends Use-case sizing and commercial strategy Technical integration and operational setup Deployment focused on cross-border payments and B2B settlement The emphasis is practical. Clients are not being sold theory. They are being guided through implementation decisions that affect cost, speed, compliance, and scalability. Visa’s role is to shorten the distance between intention and production. A Focus on Cross-Border and B2B Payments One area receives particular attention: cross-border and business-to-business payments. These segments remain among the most inefficient in global finance. Settlement delays, high fees, fragmented correspondent banking networks, and liquidity traps continue to burden enterprises and financial institutions. Stablecoins offer a direct alternative. By enabling near-instant settlement on blockchain rails, stablecoins can reduce both transaction costs and settlement times dramatically. Visa’s advisory unit is built to help clients identify where these efficiencies are most impactful and how to deploy them safely. For multinational companies and banks operating across jurisdictions, this is not about novelty. It is about working capital efficiency and operational resilience. Building on Visa’s Existing Stablecoin Infrastructure The launch of the advisory practice does not happen in isolation. Visa has already spent years working with stablecoins in production environments. That includes: USDC-based settlement flows Stablecoin-linked card products Direct wallet payouts to users These initiatives have allowed Visa to develop internal expertise across blockchain settlement, compliance integration, and network interoperability. As of 2025, Visa’s own stablecoin settlement volume is running at an annualized pace of $3.5 billion, according to figures cited alongside the announcement. This is not pilot-scale activity. It reflects real transaction volume flowing through Visa-connected systems. The advisory practice leverages these learnings, turning Visa’s internal experience into a service offering for the broader financial ecosystem. Stablecoins Reach Critical Mass Timing matters. The advisory launch comes as stablecoins surpass $200 billion in total market capitalization in 2025. What was once a niche instrument for crypto trading has become a foundational layer of global digital payments. Stablecoins now underpin remittances, on-chain settlement, merchant payments, and treasury operations. Their growth has attracted increasing attention from regulators, central banks, and multinational corporations. For Visa, this represents a structural shift. Stablecoins are no longer peripheral to payment networks. They are becoming part of the core settlement stack. By formalizing an advisory practice, Visa acknowledges that clients no longer need convincing. They need guidance. Visa Moves From Operator to Advisor Perhaps the most important signal in this announcement is strategic. Visa is not merely deploying stablecoins for its own network. It is advising others on how to do the same. That distinction matters. It suggests confidence. Not only in the technology, but in the regulatory trajectory and commercial viability of stablecoin-based payments. Visa’s advisory role positions it as a neutral infrastructure expert, capable of helping banks and fintechs navigate decisions around issuance models, custody frameworks, integration architecture, and compliance design. This is a notable evolution. Payment giants historically guarded their rails closely. In contrast, Visa is now helping clients build blockchain-based rails that may operate alongside, or partially outside, traditional card networks. That shift reflects reality. Payments are no longer confined to a single channel. They are becoming programmable, interoperable, and increasingly on-chain. The Bigger Picture: Finance Accelerates Toward Blockchain Rails The broader implications extend beyond Visa. With clearer regulatory frameworks taking shape in the United States and other major markets, traditional finance is accelerating toward blockchain-based settlement. The question is no longer whether stablecoins will be used, but how. Visa’s move underscores this transition. Rather than waiting for disruption, incumbents are shaping it. They are embedding blockchain capabilities into existing systems, aligning them with compliance requirements, and offering them as enterprise-grade solutions. This is how financial infrastructure evolves. Quietly. Incrementally. With advisory units, operational tooling, and institutional buy-in. Visa’s Stablecoins Advisory Practice is not a marketing announcement. It is a signal that stablecoins are entering the operational core of global payments.

In a stunning move that captured the crypto community’s attention, two anonymous whale addresses executed massive sell orders totaling $40.8 million in ETH over just two hours. This substantial transaction raises crucial questions about market sentiment and potential price movements for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Breaking Down the $40.8 Million Ethereum Whale Transaction The blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain first detected this significant activity. According to their report, the two anonymous whale addresses, identified only by their starting characters 0x2802 and 0x4c0A, sold a combined 14,000 ETH. This represents one of the most substantial coordinated sell-offs witnessed recently in the Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s examine how these anonymous whales executed their sales: Whale 0x2802 : Sold 10,000 ETH worth approximately $29.16 million across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) at an average price of $2,915.50 per ETH Whale 0x4c0A : Sold 4,000 ETH worth about $11.66 million through centralized exchanges including OKX, Binance, KuCoin, and Gate.io Why Would Anonymous Whales Sell ETH Now? When anonymous whales sell ETH in such substantial quantities, experienced traders pay close attention. These large holders typically have sophisticated market insights and their actions often precede significant price movements. The timing of this sell-off is particularly noteworthy given Ethereum’s recent price performance and broader market conditions. Several factors might explain why these anonymous whales decided to sell ETH at this moment: Profit-taking after recent price appreciation Portfolio rebalancing ahead of anticipated market volatility Concerns about regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency Liquidity needs for other investments or obligations Immediate Market Impact on Ethereum Price Following the news of these anonymous whales selling ETH, the market responded with noticeable movement. According to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum’s price dipped to $2,933.10, representing a 1.01% decline over the 24-hour period following the sales. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, such substantial sell pressure from anonymous whales often creates psychological impacts that extend beyond the immediate liquidity effect. The distribution method used by these anonymous whales provides additional insights. The first whale’s decision to use decentralized exchanges suggests a preference for maintaining privacy and avoiding centralized platform scrutiny. Meanwhile, the second whale’s use of multiple major exchanges indicates a strategy to minimize price impact through order fragmentation. What This Means for Average Ethereum Investors When anonymous whales sell ETH in these volumes, retail investors naturally wonder how to respond. First, it’s crucial to understand that whale movements represent just one piece of the market puzzle. While significant, they don’t necessarily dictate long-term price direction. However, they do provide valuable signals about sentiment among large, sophisticated holders. Consider these actionable insights for navigating whale-driven volatility: Monitor follow-up activity : Watch whether these anonymous whales begin accumulating again at lower prices Assess broader market context : Evaluate whether other indicators support a bearish thesis Review your risk management : Ensure your portfolio can withstand increased volatility Look for buying opportunities : Significant sell-offs sometimes create attractive entry points The Bigger Picture: Whale Movements in Cryptocurrency Markets The phenomenon of anonymous whales selling ETH highlights the unique transparency of blockchain markets. Unlike traditional finance where large institutional moves might remain hidden for quarters, cryptocurrency transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain. This creates both opportunities and challenges for market participants. Blockchain analytics tools like Lookonchain have democratized access to whale-watching capabilities that were once available only to professional trading firms. Now, any investor can monitor when anonymous whales sell ETH or other cryptocurrencies, though interpreting these signals requires context and experience. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Whale Activity The recent $40.8 million Ethereum sell-off by two anonymous whales serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency market dynamics. While such movements can create short-term volatility, they also represent the natural ebb and flow of sophisticated capital allocation in a maturing asset class. For informed investors, these events provide learning opportunities about market structure, whale behavior, and risk management strategies. Rather than reacting impulsively to whale movements, successful investors develop frameworks for interpreting such events within broader market contexts. The anonymous whales selling ETH today might be accumulating tomorrow—such is the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets where large players continuously adjust their positions based on evolving information and market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What are cryptocurrency whales? Cryptocurrency whales are individuals or entities that hold large amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions can significantly impact market prices due to the substantial volume of assets they control. Why do whales sometimes sell anonymously? Whales often use anonymous wallets to maintain privacy, avoid market front-running, and prevent drawing attention to their trading strategies. When anonymous whales sell ETH, they typically use techniques that obscure their full identity while executing large transactions. How can I track whale movements? You can monitor whale activity using blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, or specialized trading tools that flag large transactions. These platforms identify when anonymous whales sell ETH or other cryptocurrencies in substantial quantities. Should I sell when whales sell? Not necessarily. Whale movements represent just one data point among many. Consider your investment thesis, risk tolerance, and broader market conditions before making decisions based solely on whale activity. What’s the difference between DEX and CEX sales? DEX (decentralized exchange) sales typically offer more privacy but may have less liquidity, while CEX (centralized exchange) sales provide better liquidity but less anonymity. When anonymous whales sell ETH, their choice of platform reveals aspects of their strategy. Can whale sales predict market crashes? While large sales can indicate bearish sentiment among sophisticated investors, they don’t reliably predict market crashes. Many factors influence cryptocurrency prices, and whale movements should be considered alongside other indicators. Found this analysis of anonymous whales selling ETH helpful?

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-price-can-still-rally-35000-heres-why/,"A recent post from an XRP enthusiast argued that passage of the CLARITY Act could make a valuation of $1,000 for XRP a plausible outcome, citing a perceived repeat of the token’s 2017 trajectory . The post links two propositions: that clearer federal rules would remove regulatory overhang, and that clearing that overhang could trigger a large price advance similar in scale to the token’s earlier rally. If they pass The Clarity Act I dont think $1,000 is crazy XRP is following its 2017 pattern When price shot up 35,000% #XRP pic.twitter.com/QU1OvS9bR8 — Tuck Ricco (@dde_mo2442) December 14, 2025 What the CLARITY Act would do The Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act of 2025 is drafted legislation intended to clarify when digital assets are treated as commodities versus securities and to assign clearer supervisory roles among U.S. regulators. The bill text and legislative summaries indicate it would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a central regulatory role over digital commodities and related intermediaries while preserving certain SEC authority over primary-market transactions and fundraising, subject to narrowly defined exemptions. The act also attempts to define a digital commodity and set out expedited rulemaking and registration procedures for market participants. How the CLARITY Act could affect XRP Market commentary has centred on three mechanisms by which the CLARITY Act might affect the token’s market value. First, clearer statutory classification could reduce legal uncertainty for market-makers and institutional custodians, potentially increasing on- and off-ramps for large-scale participation. Second, the bill’s provisions could require or encourage changes in how large holders disclose or manage reserves, which some analysts say could alter the supply dynamics available to public markets. Third, if the law facilitates greater institutional custodial services and exchange listings, liquidity and access could expand materially—an effect that typically supports higher valuations for digital assets in bullish scenarios. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Some Observers Equate Clarity With Dramatic Price Moves Observers drawing parallels with 2017 point to the removal of a major regulatory barrier as a catalyst for concentrated buying—an outcome often described in markets as “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Analysts and market commentators have published commentary suggesting that anticipation of the CLARITY Act’s passage has already been factored into price behaviour and that renewed clarity could accelerate investor commitment. The assertion that XRP could reach $1,000 if the CLARITY Act passes rests on a chain of conditional events: statutory text, regulatory interpretation, market access changes, and investor behavior. The CLARITY Act would provide clearer legal classification, which could reduce uncertainty and influence supply and demand dynamics for the token. However, any projection that ties passage directly to a specific price level is speculative; the legislative process, implementing regulations, and market reaction timing all determine the real-world outcome.

Bybit, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has made a significant announcement that requires your immediate attention. The platform has confirmed it will delist three specific tokens from its spot trading markets. If you hold PELL, PURSE, or TRC, understanding the timeline and your options is critical to safeguarding your investments. Which Tokens Is Bybit Delisting and When? Bybit’s decision is precise and time-bound. The exchange will remove trading pairs for Pell (PELL), Purse (PURSE), and TerraClassicUSD (TRC). Therefore, the official Bybit delist action for spot trading will occur at 08:00 UTC on December 23 . This means all buy and sell orders for these assets will cease permanently at that moment. However, the process involves several key stages before the final halt. To ensure a smooth transition, Bybit will suspend deposits for these tokens earlier. You must check your Bybit wallet and act before these deadlines pass. What Does a Delisting Mean for Your Holdings? When an exchange like Bybit announces a delist , it’s not just a minor update. It’s a fundamental change to how you can interact with those assets on that platform. Essentially, the token is being removed from the active marketplace. Trading Stops: You will no longer be able to buy or sell PELL, PURSE, or TRC on Bybit’s spot market. Withdrawals Continue: Crucially, you can still withdraw your tokens to a private wallet or another exchange that supports them. This is your primary method of securing your assets. Potential Value Impact: Delisting news often leads to increased selling pressure and volatility. It’s wise to assess your position promptly. Why Would Bybit Delist These Tokens? Exchanges regularly review the assets they list to maintain market quality and protect users. A Bybit delist decision typically follows a rigorous evaluation. Common reasons include: Low trading volume and liquidity. Project development issues or lack of commitment. Failure to meet the exchange’s updated listing standards. Regulatory concerns or compliance challenges. While Bybit has not specified the exact reason for each token, this move aligns with industry best practices for managing a healthy trading ecosystem. It underscores the importance of staying informed about the projects you invest in. Your Action Plan Before the Bybit Delist Deadline Don’t wait until the last minute. Follow these clear steps to manage your exposure: Review Your Portfolio: Log into your Bybit account immediately and check if you hold any PELL, PURSE, or TRC. Make a Trading Decision: Decide whether to sell your tokens on Bybit before the deadline or withdraw them. Consider the market price and your long-term view on each project. Prepare for Withdrawal: If you choose to withdraw, ensure you have a compatible external wallet address ready. Double-check the address and network (e.g., ERC-20, BEP-20) to avoid loss of funds. Complete All Actions Early: Aim to finalize trades or withdrawals at least 24 hours before the deadline to avoid last-minute network congestion or technical issues. The Bigger Picture: Navigating Crypto Market Changes This Bybit delist event is a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Projects evolve, exchange policies update, and the landscape shifts. Successful traders are those who monitor official announcements and adapt their strategies accordingly. Treat exchange communications as essential reading, not just optional updates. In summary, Bybit’s removal of PELL, PURSE, and TRC is a definitive action with a fixed deadline. Your priority is to audit your holdings and execute your chosen strategy—whether selling on-platform or withdrawing—well before 8:00 AM UTC on December 23. Proactive management is your best tool for navigating these routine but important market events. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What happens if I still hold PELL in my Bybit account after December 23? A1: You will not be able to trade it on Bybit. However, the withdrawal function for delisted tokens typically remains open for a limited period after trading stops (often several weeks). You must check Bybit’s official announcement for the specific withdrawal deadline and move your tokens before it closes. Q2: Can I still deposit these tokens to Bybit? A2: No. Bybit will suspend deposits for PELL, PURSE, and TRC before the trading halt. Attempting to deposit them after that time will likely result in a loss of funds. Q3: Will this delisting affect the token’s price on other exchanges? A3: It can. News of a delist from a major exchange like Bybit often affects market sentiment, potentially causing price volatility across all platforms where the token is traded. It’s important to watch the broader market. Q4: Where can I trade these tokens after Bybit delists them? A4: You will need to find another cryptocurrency exchange that still lists the specific token (PELL, PURSE, or TRC). Use sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to check which exchanges offer trading pairs for these assets and ensure they are reputable. Q5: Is my money safe during this process? A5: Your assets are safe in your Bybit wallet, but you must take action to maintain control over them. The risk lies in inactivity—if you miss the withdrawal window, your tokens could become inaccessible on Bybit. Always act on official deadlines. Q6: How can I stay updated on future delistings? A6: Regularly check the “Announcements” section on the Bybit website or app. Following the exchange’s official social media channels is also a reliable way to receive immediate updates about such changes.

Historical Patterns Suggest So,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/will-bitcoin-suffer-a-20-decline-after-japans-rate-hike-historical-patterns-suggest-so/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a 4% drop, falling below the $86,000 mark on Monday, as market speculation grows regarding the cryptocurrency’s future following the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) interest rate decision. In a recent poll conducted from December 2 to 9, an overwhelming 90% of economists—63 out of 70—predicted that the BOJ would increase short-term interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% at this week’s planned meeting. Experts Warn Of Impact From BOJ Rate Hikes Experts on social media have noted a concerning trend: during the last three rate hikes by the BOJ, Bitcoin has typically dropped significantly. The statistics reveal the following declines: a 23% drop in March 2024, a 26% decline in July 2024, and a 31% dip in January of this year. Related Reading: Why XRP Isn’t Reacting to Major Institutional and Regional Developments Based on current prices just below $86,000, this would imply that if the cryptocurrency sees another 20% correction, it could drop all the way to 68,800. This would mean extending the gap compared to the all-time high of $126,000 by almost 46%. The group of experts further highlighted that the dynamics at play in Japan significantly impact Bitcoin’s performance as Japan holds the largest amount of US debt of any nation. When Japanese interest rates rise, capital tends to flow back to Japan, leading to reduced liquidity in dollars. This decrease in dollar liquidity often results in the selling of riskier assets like Bitcoin. On November 30, a foreboding sign of this potential downturn appeared when confirmation of Japan’s impending rate hike caused Bitcoin to dip to around $83,000, erasing approximately $200 billion from the overall cryptocurrency market. However, the bearish sentiment affecting Bitcoin is not solely the result of Japan’s actions. Market analyst known as NoLimit recently pointed to another critical factor: China’s renewed crackdown on Bitcoin mining. China’s Mining Crackdown Spurs Bitcoin Sell-Off The analyst recently asserted that China has tightened regulations, particularly affecting operations in Xinjiang, where a significant number of crypto mining setups were shut down in December. This led to the abrupt offline status of roughly 400,000 miners. The repercussions of such a sudden shift in mining activity are already evident. The Bitcoin network hashrate has fallen by about 8%, indicating that fewer miners are actively contributing to the network. NoLimit suggests that this sudden reduction creates immediate revenue-loss for miners, who may need to liquidate Bitcoin to cover operational costs or to relocate their equipment. Consequently, this generates actual selling pressure on the market, contributing to the downward price trend seen on Monday. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Compression Deepens as Analysts Debate if the Next Move Is a Rally or Breakdown Despite the short-term pain this creates, the analysts clarified that it does not indicate a long-term bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Instead, he views it as a temporary supply shock driven by regulatory decisions rather than a shift in demand. Historical patterns support this notion: when China has previously cracked down on miners, the cycle follows a familiar trajectory: miners are forced offline, hashrate dips occur, prices fluctuate, and eventually, the network adapts before Bitcoin moves forward again.

This initiative will see RLUSD integrated into Layer-2 (L2) solutions on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, facilitated by a partnership with Wormhole, one of the largest protocols for cross-chain interoperability. Ripple Targets Broader Blockchain Integration In a press release issued on Monday, Ripple and Wormhole detailed their plans to initiate testing on several notable L2 networks, including Optimism (OP), Base, Ink, and Unichain. The collaboration will leverage Wormhole’s Native Token Transfers (NTT) standard, which is designed to ensure efficient movement of liquidity across various blockchain ecosystems while allowing Ripple to maintain native control over RLUSD. Originally launched on both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum, RLUSD aims to enhance cross-chain functionalities and decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of Stablecoin at Ripple, emphasized the significance of stablecoins in the DeFi landscape, stating: Stablecoins are the gateway to DeFi and institutional adoption. RLUSD is designed from the ground up to be the trusted, liquid medium necessary for users to seamlessly enter, interact with, and exit the entire digital asset economy. The executive also highlighted that by launching RLUSD as the first US Trust Regulated stablecoin on these L2 networks , Ripple is also setting a standard where compliance meets on-chain efficiency. Looking toward, Ripple plans to launch RLUSD on additional chains, pending final regulatory approval. RLUSD Becomes Third-Largest US-Regulated Stablecoin Notably, RLUSD has achieved a market capitalization of $1.3 billion in less than a year, making it the third-largest stablecoin among US-regulated options, according to CoinGecko data . Positioned for compliance with the GENIUS Act, RLUSD’s circulating supply surged by 28% in November alone, crossing the billion-dollar threshold. It currently ranks behind only Circle’s USDC and PayPal’s PYUSD in the US-regulated dollar tokens. In a significant development in November of this year, Ripple also initiated a new pilot program with traditional finance giants Mastercard, WebBank, and crypto exchange Gemini aimed at facilitating credit card transaction settlements using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. This partnership allows WebBank to send RLUSD over the XRPL for instant settlement of daily payment obligations with Mastercard, eliminating the traditional delays associated with bank ACH transfers. Ripple’s president, Monica Long , described this pilot as a “meaningful step” toward demonstrating how regulated digital assets can expedite institutional payment processes. XRP, which is also associated with the company, is trading at $1.90. This represents a 5% drop over the past 24 hours, in line with the broader correction in the crypto market cap, which has seen Bitcoin (BTC) and other leading altcoins resume the downtrend witnessed over the past two months.

Despite this downturn, certain altcoins are showing resilience and maintaining their stability. This article delves into which digital assets are defying the trend and could be positioned for future growth. XDC Network Holds Steady with Promising Growth Signs Source: tradingview XDC Network (XDC) is trading between under five cents to slightly over five cents. There's a potential for upward movement, as it approaches the first resistance level a bit above five cents. If it surpasses this, it might target an increase towards the next resistance level, climbing approximately 16% from its current price range. Despite a nearly 8% drop in the past month, recent activity shows a small upward trend of almost 2% this week, suggesting signs of recovery. The indicators like RSI and moving averages suggest a stable momentum, hinting at possible growth if the market conditions remain favorable. Monero (XMR) Shows Potential for Growth With Recent Performance Source: tradingview Monero's price currently hovers between the high $370s and low $430s. It has gained almost 10% over the past week, contrasting a slight dip of under 2% for the month. Over six months, Monero has surged over 30%. These figures suggest a promising outlook. The coin's stability above $410, its short-term average, indicates strength. If Monero breaks past its nearby cap of mid-$450s, it could aim for the $515 mark, representing a potential 20% ascent from its current range. With steady momentum, Monero remains one to watch for investors, considering its resilience and proven growth track. TRON Eyes Potential Rebound Amidst Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview TRON (TRX) is currently trading between 27 and 28 cents, showing some stability. Recently, it saw a slight dip of just over 1% over the past week. Despite a recent one-month decline of nearly 6%, TRX could rise closer to its next resistance at 30 cents. Over the last six months, it has shown a bit of growth, a little under 2%. The current market indicators suggest that while it hasn’t been plain sailing, there is room for potential recovery. If TRX can surpass the 30-cent resistance, it might aim for 31 cents, which would mean an increase of over 10% from its lowest support level. Conclusion XDC, XMR, and TRX have shown resilience. Some altcoins may struggle, but these have maintained their structure well. XDC continues to offer appealing features. XMR's privacy focus keeps it relevant. TRX's network use also contributes to its stability. These coins stand out as stronger options in a challenging market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

55864268,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245785,1765872612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Cryptocurrency Moving Averages Signal Deep Market Correction: 75% of Top 100 Coins in Bear Territory,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocurrency-moving-averages-market-correction/,"BitcoinWorld Cryptocurrency Moving Averages Signal Deep Market Correction: 75% of Top 100 Coins in Bear Territory The cryptocurrency market is flashing warning signs that every investor needs to see. Recent data reveals a startling trend: 75% of the top 100 digital assets by market capitalization have fallen below their critical cryptocurrency moving averages . This technical breakdown suggests we’re witnessing more than just a routine pullback—this could be a fundamental shift in market sentiment that demands your attention. What Do These Cryptocurrency Moving Averages Actually Tell Us? When we talk about cryptocurrency moving averages , we’re referring to two key indicators: the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. These aren’t just random lines on a chart. They represent the average closing prices over specific periods, giving us a clearer picture of market trends by smoothing out daily price volatility. Think of the 50-day average as the short-term mood of the market, while the 200-day average reflects the longer-term sentiment. When prices drop below both these levels, it typically indicates sustained selling pressure and a bearish outlook. Currently, three-quarters of major cryptocurrencies find themselves in this precarious position. How Does This Compare to Traditional Markets? Here’s where the situation becomes particularly concerning for crypto investors. While 75% of top cryptocurrencies trade below their key averages, only 29% of the top 100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 show similar weakness. This disparity reveals something crucial: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing significantly more pressure than traditional tech stocks The correlation between crypto and traditional markets may be weakening Digital assets appear to be leading this downturn rather than following it This divergence suggests that cryptocurrency-specific factors—rather than broader economic conditions—might be driving this correction. Which Cryptocurrencies Have Entered Oversold Territory? Despite the widespread decline, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) provides a glimmer of insight. This momentum oscillator helps identify overbought and oversold conditions. Surprisingly, only eight of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have reached oversold levels: PI APT ALGO FLARE VET JUP IP KAIA This limited number of oversold coins presents a critical warning. If most cryptocurrencies haven’t reached oversold conditions despite falling below their cryptocurrency moving averages , there might be more room for prices to decline before finding solid support levels. What Should Investors Do During This Correction? Market corrections test investor psychology as much as they test portfolio values. When cryptocurrency moving averages signal widespread weakness, emotional decisions can lead to costly mistakes. Instead, consider these strategic approaches: Review your portfolio allocation – Ensure you’re not overexposed to assets showing the weakest technical signals Dollar-cost average carefully – If adding positions, consider spreading purchases over time rather than trying to time the bottom Monitor volume patterns – Look for signs of capitulation or accumulation that might signal trend reversals Set clear risk parameters – Determine your exit points before emotions cloud your judgment Remember, technical indicators like cryptocurrency moving averages provide context, not certainty. They help you understand the market environment but shouldn’t dictate every decision. Could This Be a Buying Opportunity in Disguise? Every market downturn creates both risk and opportunity. Historical patterns show that periods when most assets trade below their cryptocurrency moving averages often precede significant rallies. However, timing these reversals remains notoriously difficult. The current situation presents a paradox: widespread technical weakness suggests caution, while selective oversold conditions in specific coins might indicate value opportunities. This divergence means investors need to be particularly selective, focusing on fundamentals rather than just following the herd. Conclusion: Navigating the Cryptocurrency Moving Averages Crossroads The message from the charts is clear but complex. While 75% of top cryptocurrencies trading below their key averages signals significant market stress, the limited number of oversold conditions suggests this correction might have further to run. This creates a challenging environment where patience and discipline become your most valuable assets. Successful navigation requires understanding that cryptocurrency moving averages reflect past price action—they don’t predict the future. They provide essential context about market structure and sentiment, helping you make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions. As the market searches for direction, remember that the greatest opportunities often emerge from the most uncertain conditions. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when a cryptocurrency falls below its moving average? When a cryptocurrency’s price drops below its moving average, it typically indicates weakening momentum and potential trend reversal. The 50-day and 200-day averages are particularly watched as they signal short-term and long-term sentiment shifts respectively. How reliable are moving averages for predicting cryptocurrency prices? Moving averages work best as trend-following indicators rather than precise prediction tools. They help identify the market’s direction and strength but should be used alongside other indicators and fundamental analysis for complete investment decisions. Why are only eight cryptocurrencies oversold despite the widespread decline? The Relative Strength Index measures the velocity of price movements. The limited number of oversold coins suggests that while prices are falling, the decline hasn’t been rapid enough to trigger extreme oversold readings, potentially indicating more gradual selling pressure. Should I sell all my cryptocurrencies when they fall below moving averages? Not necessarily. Moving averages provide context about market conditions but shouldn’t trigger automatic selling. Consider your investment horizon, portfolio diversification, and the specific fundamentals of each asset before making decisions based solely on technical indicators. How long do cryptocurrencies typically stay below their moving averages? There’s no fixed duration. Some assets recover quickly, while others remain below key averages for extended periods during bear markets. Historical patterns vary significantly across different market cycles and individual cryptocurrencies. Can moving averages help identify buying opportunities? Yes, particularly when prices approach or test moving averages from below during uptrends, or when assets become significantly oversold relative to their averages. However, confirmation from other indicators and fundamental analysis strengthens these signals. Found this analysis helpful? Share it with fellow investors who need to understand what these cryptocurrency moving averages really mean for their portfolios.

Amidst this cooling trend, interest in certain quirky digital coins remains strong. Curious about which tokens still have eyes on them? This article reveals the coins that may still hold potential for a resurgence. Keep reading to discover which ones are being closely monitored for a comeback. Dogecoin Shows Mixed Signals, Potential to Reach New Levels Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twelve and fourteen cents. It's facing a key resistance at a little over sixteen cents and has support just below twelve. While its price fell over the last six months, losing nearly a quarter of its value, there's scope for growth if it surpasses these resistance levels. If Dogecoin climbs to its second resistance, it could mean an increase of more than thirty percent from current prices. While its RSI and MACD suggest caution, breaking through resistance could change its trend. The coin's value might turn positive in the coming months if buying pressures increase. SPX6900 Shows Volatile Path with Room for Rebound Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency SPX6900 (SPX) is in a price range between just under half a dollar to less than three-quarters of a dollar. Currently, it's experiencing some downward pressure but could potentially rise to its nearest resistance at around seventy-seven cents, a possible climb of over forty percent. Its journey to ninety-four cents is also on the horizon, marking a growth of over forty percent again from the nearest resistance. The recent month has seen stable prices, though the past half-year has been tough with the value dropping notably. With its RSI showing it's nearly oversold, and a sluggish MACD level, a potential rebound might be on the cards soon. Bonk's Price Steadies: Could It Leap Higher? Source: tradingview Bonk's price currently hovers between eight to nine thousandths of a cent. Recent movements show it flirting with resistance slightly above its range, around a tenth of a cent. Support holds firm just below eight thousandths. If Bonk breaches its next resistance level nearing one cent, it could jump by about 31%. However, if it slips to the next support level, it might dip by roughly 22%. The ten-day average sits slightly above the current price, while the hundred-day is even higher, suggesting moderate upside potential if the trend turns bullish. All eyes are on whether it will break higher or slip lower in the coming days. OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) Faces Potential Rebound Amid Recent Slump Source: tradingview The OFFICIAL TRUMP cryptocurrency is currently priced between $5 and $6. After a dip over the past month, losing over a quarter of its value, there's buzz around its potential to bounce back. Traders are eyeing the $6.37 mark where sellers may step in again, while the $4.88 level offers some buy support. If bullish trends prevail, prices could touch $7, marking a notable jump. The RSI is low, suggesting it might be oversold, which sometimes leads to bounces. However, recent downtrends signal caution, and investors hope the coin surpasses resistance levels to gain momentum. Conclusion Interest in memecoins has cooled, but some still attract attention. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains popular because of its strong community. SPX gained notoriety but faces declining hype. BONK had a rapid rise but is now less talked about. TRUMP emerged with political motives, capturing niche interest. These coins continue to be observed for any shifts in trends or renewed enthusiasm.

Glassnode reported that the past three months have shown “persistent relative weakness” across nearly all crypto sectors compared to BTC. This suggests that the capital is clustering around the top crypto. The OG crypto price dipped by more than 4% in the last 24 hours to trade below $86,000. The cumulative digital assets market cap dropped by 3.8% in the same session, losing the crucial $3 trillion mark.

However, the picture flipped in the second half as the dominance trended lower. Investors rotated into Ether and other majors after a strong but never fully reclaimed leadership afterward. BTC Dominance: Yearly Recap The first half of the year was clearly BTC-led, dominance rising and marking bottoms and rotations. In the second half, the picture flipped: dominance trended lower, making room for ETH rotation, but never fully reclaiming leadership afterward.… pic.twitter.com/wasqcm3SFA — Bitcoin Vector (@bitcoinvector) December 15, 2025 It added that the recent attempts to rebuild post-deleverage event have weakened again by year-end. This signals low conviction in BTC leadership and a market still searching for a clear anchor. The numbers back it up as Bitcoin price fell around 26% over the last quarter to around $86,000. This looks painful, yet it is still marginally better than the broader market’s 27.5% drawdown over the same period. Analysts say BTC remains stuck in a frustrating range between $85,000 and $94,000, with every bounce met by sellers who bought heavily near October’s all-time high. Bitcoin has mirrored the downturn in broader risk assets but hasn’t recovered alongside them. This highlights how thin liquidity and fading risk appetite continue to weigh on the market. Major crypto sectors post double-digit losses in Q4 Ether has performed worse. ETH price slumped by over 35% in the last 90 days, diving below $3,000. XRP and Solana prices have nosedived 38% and 47%, respectively, at the same time. XRP is trading at an average price of $1.87 at the press time. SOL is hovering around $126. Other sectors have been hit even harder. AI-linked tokens are down nearly 50% as the speculative frenzy around artificial intelligence cooled. The meme coin category has shed 56% of its market cap.

The company’s filings and chart commentary outlined new share sales, preferred issuance, and the price levels traders now track for a rebound. Strategy Buys 10,645 Bitcoin, Lifts Holdings to 671,268 BTC Strategy said it bought 10,645 bitcoin for about $980.3 million, paying an average of about $92,098 per coin, according to a company press release dated Dec. 15, 2025.The purchase pushed Strategy’s bitcoin holdings to 671,268 BTC as of Dec. 14, 2025, the company said. That implies it held 660,623 BTC before the latest buy, based on the totals it reported. Strategy said it acquired its full bitcoin position for about $50.33 billion in aggregate. It reported an average acquisition price of about $74,972 per bitcoin across its holdings, using its stated cost and coin totals. The company also said it achieved “BTC Yield” of 24.9% year to date for 2025. Strategy uses that metric to report performance tied to its bitcoin strategy, and it included the figure alongside the updated purchase and holdings numbers. In its post, Strategy referenced several tickers tied to the company and related securities, including $MSTR and $STRC, alongside $BTC. Online Criticism Follows Strategy ATM Disclosure The disclosure prompted commentary on X from market participants, including a post by user Rho Rider, after Strategy Inc. released details of equity and preferred stock sales completed under its at the market, or ATM, offering program. In a filing dated Dec. 15, Strategy said it sold 4,789,664 shares of its Class A common stock between Dec. 8 and Dec. 14. The company reported net proceeds of about $888.2 million from those common stock sales, after commissions. Strategy ATM Update Filing. Source: Strategy Form 8 K The filing also detailed sales of several preferred stock instruments during the same period. Strategy reported selling 163,306 shares of STRF preferred stock, 7,036 shares of STRK preferred stock, and 1,029,202 shares of STRD preferred stock. Net proceeds from preferred stock sales totaled about $100.8 million, according to the filing. Overall, Strategy said total net proceeds from all securities sold during the period reached about $989 million. The company reported no sales of STRC preferred stock during the window, while several preferred share programs remained available for future issuance as of Dec. 14. In his post on X, Rho Rider criticized the transactions as dilutive to common shareholders and argued that preferred stock issuance could further pressure common equity through dividend obligations. He also questioned the timing of the company’s capital activity. Strategy did not address those claims directly in the filing, which focused on reporting completed sales, proceeds, and available issuance capacity under its ATM programs Analyst Flags $340 “Volume Shelf” as Strategy Stock Sits in 2024 Support Zone A TradingView chart shared by trader Donald Dean on X showed Strategy Inc. (MSTR) trading inside a broad support area first established in mid 2024, as the stock stayed in a lower range after months of decline. Dean wrote that MSTR is “churning in the support area” and set a price target of $340, pointing to a visible “volume shelf” on the chart. MSTR Strategy daily chart.

Dean said MSTR would need to reclaim $231 to “get moving,” while the chart also marked higher reference levels around $387.24 and $424.00, alongside prior highs labeled near $457.22 and $543.00.

According to the report, LBank’s market share in major memecoin trading pairs increased from 11.2% in January 2025 to 28.9% in September 2025. This growth reflects increased trading activity on the platform and the broader engagement with its product ecosystem. According to the report, LBank has solidified its position as one of the world’s most dominant and comprehensive centralized exchanges. Throughout 2025, LBank was the only top-tier CEX to more than double its market share in memecoin spot trading volume among major platforms — surging from 11.2% in January 2025 to a peak of 28.9% in September 2025, consistently ranking among the top 3 exchanges by memecoin volume share for most of the year. Notably, LBank’s unrivaled 2025 memecoin dominance is propelled by two flagship innovations.

Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price signals look mixed, with one analyst warning $2,600 is the key bearish break level and another tracking a potential breakout above $3,600. The headlines now combine Wall Street’s tokenization push with a chart battle between support and resistance. JPMorgan launches tokenized money market fund on Ethereum JPMorgan said it will roll out its first tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain, according to a Wall Street Journal report shared in a screenshot. The bank’s asset management arm will seed the private fund with $100 million of its own capital and then open it to outside investors on Tuesday. The fund is called My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or “MONY.” The report said JPMorgan’s tokenization platform, Kinexys Digital Assets, supports the product. The Journal report said the fund will be available to qualified investors. It set eligibility at individuals with at least $5 million in investments and institutions with a minimum of $25 million, while also listing a $1 million investment minimum for the fund. Ethereum’s official X account also posted the update, saying JPMorgan will open MONY to outside investors after seeding it with $100 million and describing it as the firm’s first tokenized money market fund on Ethereum. Analyst flags bearish ETH structure after rejection near $3,400 CryptoPatel said Ethereum rejected a marked fair value gap near $3,400 and then slid to around the $2,900 area, based on his Dec. 16 TradingView chart and an accompanying post on X. He described the move as a roughly 16% drop from the rejection zone and said the broader structure still looks bearish. ETH USDT 8 hour chart. Source: CryptoPatel on X He pointed to $2,600 as a key “break of structure” level on his chart. He added that a break below that area would make $2,000 more likely, while also calling the current setup a bearish continuation on a shorter timeframe. At the same time, CryptoPatel wrote that he views longer term spot positioning differently, saying he plans to buy dips and targets a higher ETH range over the next one to two years. He framed the approach as using separate plans for different timeframes. MerlijnTrader says Ethereum “coiling” as $3,600 resistance comes into focus Meanwhile, Merlijn The Trader said Ethereum is “coiling” after holding a broad support zone and pressing into a weakening resistance band near $3,600, according to a post on X that included a two day ETH USD chart.

The development highlights a broader push to bring altcoin trading into established regulatory frameworks. It also reflects rising demand for perpetual-style futures among both retail and institutional participants. The move places SHIB at the center of renewed debate over its market positioning. Coinbase Launches SHIB Perpetual-Style Futures in the U.S. Coinbase confirmed on X that its 1k SHIB Index is now live on Coinbase Derivatives, opening access to U.S.-regulated perpetual-style futures tied to Shiba Inu. They said the product trades 24/7 and remains available to retail and institutional traders through approved Futures Commission Merchants. Coinbase positioned the rollout as part of its effort to broaden regulated crypto derivatives offerings in the United States. The SHIB product launched alongside several other altcoins. Coinbase included Cardano, Avalanche, Dogecoin, Sui, Polkadot, Hedera, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Chainlink in the same expansion. The meme coins featured prominently, with Shiba Inu drawing particular attention due to its scale and liquidity. By entering U.S.-regulated perpetual-style futures markets, SHIB now sits within the same compliance structure that governs derivatives linked to assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase did not provide projections on trading volumes but confirmed that the contracts operate under existing U.S. regulatory standards. The listing marks one of the most prominent regulated derivatives launches tied to a meme-originated token. Community points to regulatory progress and ecosystem depth Shiba Inu community member RuggRat responded by framing the Coinbase derivatives launch as evidence of SHIB’s progression beyond meme status. He said that access to regulated futures markets represents a milestone that few meme tokens reach. In his view, the product signals that SHIB no longer competes solely within the meme coin category. RuggRat also highlighted SHIB’s prior regulatory achievements. He pointed to its inclusion on Japan’s green list alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum after passing transparency, compliance, and technical reviews. That status, he said, makes SHIB eligible for Japan’s proposed 20% flat crypto tax. The rate would significantly reduce tax exposure compared with the country’s previous crypto tax structure, which reached up to 55%. Addressing claims that Shiba Inu lacks institutional traction, RuggRat said adoption has already begun. He cited SHIB’s appearance in a T. Rowe Price ETF filing in the United States, Valour’s launch of a SEK-denominated SHIB exchange-traded product across European markets, Gemini’s SHIB perpetual contracts, and the Coinbase 1k SHIB Index. He argued that these developments demonstrate growing institutional-grade access.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-16 09:22:25

Battery makers, transformer suppliers, and storage-system builders are seeing heavy demand from inside and outside China, and the money flow is insane. CATL, the world’s biggest battery maker, has seen its shares jump 45% this year. Sungrow, the second-largest energy-storage system supplier after Tesla, has climbed 130%. Both sit at the top of Shenzhen’s CSI New Energy index, which is up 38% in 2025. Brian Ho of Bernstein summed up the mood with one line: “Suddenly there’s a scramble for this power equipment.” No kidding. Even with neither CATL nor Sungrow revealing their US sales, official data shows that China supplies most US battery and energy-storage imports. Matty Zhao at BofA Global Research put it like this: “China is not only powering China. It’s actually powering the US, Europe and the rest of the world.” And in this market, that tracks. Despite President Donald Trump’s tariffs, export demand is what’s driving profits, because domestic competition inside China keeps margins thin. Zhao said companies make three to five times more on exported storage systems than on domestic sales. Tracking profit surges across China’s power suppliers Transformers, the backbone gear that keeps each data-center component fed the right amount of electricity, show the same pattern. Zhao said Chinese companies earn 10–20% gross margins at home but pull 40–50% when selling into the US and Europe. “They would rather continue to export and eat up the tariff,” she said. AI power needs are exploding. The International Energy Agency expects data centers to consume 945 terawatt hours by 2030, up from about 415 terawatt hours last year. That’s more than a fifth of all electricity the US currently produces in a year. Legacy grids aren’t built for this, and everyone knows it. So companies in the US are now turning to giant battery banks and micro grids, which run independently from traditional power networks. The US Department of Energy says micro grids are expanding fast and will soon make up a majority of America’s distributed energy resources. US reliance on China is not slowing. Across the first nine months of this year, 60% of lithium-ion battery imports came from China, up from 43% in 2020. Those imports hit $15 billion through September, triple the full-year total from 2020. This is happening even while Washington insists it wants to rely less on China. The Council on Foreign Relations warned in October that the biggest threat in the US-China AI race “stem[s] from supply chains.” Raymond Yeung of ANZ doesn’t think there’s real separation happening. “China and the US have basically not decoupled. They’re a single economy of two different jurisdictions,” he said. Yeung pointed to a “structural advantage” for Chinese groups in the AI supply chain, especially in lithium iron phosphate batteries. CATL leads that space, and Ho said demand remains strong because “there are just no other suppliers outside China.” China’s speed and prices dominate global supply chains Chinese firms win on price and speed. Zhao gave a blunt example on transformers: “If you buy from Korea you have to wait two to three years. If you have to urgently build out your grid for a data centre, you cannot wait for two years.” That speed advantage, mixed with cheap production, explains why both CATL and Sungrow have seen foreign revenue surge since 2018, the year Trump first raised tariffs on Chinese goods. And it’s not just batteries and transformers. US data-center operators buy optical transceivers from China’s Zhongji Innolight and circuit boards manufactured inside China. Despite loud talk of breaking supply chains, America still relies heavily on Chinese inputs for its AI build-out. Still, this may shift. Next year, the Trump administration plans to raise tariffs on Chinese batteries from 30.9% to 48.4% and tighten rules so equipment with high Chinese content struggles to qualify for federal tax credits. HSBC noted that many US buyers rushed installations this year ahead of those new rules, calling it “frontloaded installation in the US ahead of the implementation of the foreign entity of concern requirements.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The exchange that lists Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, and Amazon is sending its filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to start nonstop stock trading for five days each week. It wants its stocks open almost around the clock because demand for U.S. equities has exploded worldwide, and global investors are done waiting for Wall Street hours to line up with their time zones. The exchange said foreign investors held $17 trillion worth of U.S. stocks last year. Nasdaq’s data shows America’s market now accounts for almost two-thirds of the total value of listed companies across the world. Regulators have already approved new rules to open the door for longer trading windows, and major exchanges have been lining up with their own plans. Nasdaq moves forward with nonstop trading Nasdaq President Tal Cohen said discussions with U.S. regulators began months ago, and he expects the 23/5 system to go live in the second half of 2026. The filing hitting the SEC this week is the exchange’s first formal step. The New York Stock Exchange and Cboe Global Markets have also rolled out separate plans to extend their hours. Nasdaq executive Chuck Mack told Reuters that the U.S. market has turned into a global arena. He said, “There’s been this trend towards globalization for some time and we’ve seen the U.S. markets themselves become much more global.” He also said they now see “increasing demand for companies specifically listed on Nasdaq from geographies outside of the U.S. , much more now than in the past.” Right now, Nasdaq runs three weekday sessions: pre-market from 4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. , the regular session from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. , and post-market from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The new system replaces that structure with two daily sessions. The day session will run from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Then a one-hour break will be used for maintenance, testing, and clearing trades. After that, the night session starts at 9 p.m. and runs to 4 a.m. Trades placed between 9 p.m. and midnight will count as trades for the next calendar day. Under the new 23/5 plan, the trading week opens Sunday at 9 p.m. and closes Friday at 8 p.m. All of this depends on technology upgrades to the securities information processor, which must show accurate quotes nonstop. The U.S. Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. also needs to finish its nonstop clearing system by the end of 2026. Nasdaq sets new structure for global traders Supporters of extended trading hours say the move gives overseas traders faster reactions to global events that hit markets when the U.S. is asleep. Big banks on Wall Street are not fully convinced, since lower liquidity and higher volatility could hit returns. Demand for night-time trading has still been rising fast. Mack said volumes are usually smaller in extended sessions, but interest has jumped, especially during overnight U.S. hours. Many traders who want 24/7 access now use off-exchange platforms such as Blue Ocean, Bruce ATS, and OTC Moon. He said, “If you think of those investors around the world, they want to access this huge market on their own terms and they want to do it in their own time zones.” Trading hours for U.S. exchanges are more than a century old. They were originally built for paper orders on physical floors, but electronic trading never really changed the schedule. The shift to 23/5 marks the biggest overhaul of those hours in modern times. Earlier this year, Nasdaq also filed to allow trading of tokenized stocks, taking advantage of eased crypto rules under President Trump.

The bank argues that the October panel decision misinterpreted federal law and raises constitutional concerns about the Fed’s authority. The petition, filed on December 15, requests en banc review, asking all active circuit judges to examine whether regional Federal Reserve Banks can exercise unreviewable discretion over master account access for legally eligible institutions. Custodia contends the three-judge panel’s 2-1 ruling conflicts with the Monetary Control Act’s mandate that payment services “ shall be available ” to nonmember depository institutions, creating what it describes as an unconstitutional veto power over state banking charters. NEW: Wyoming crypto bank @custodiabank has filed a petition for rehearing en banc, meaning it’s asking the full Tenth Circuit (not just the original three-judge panel) to reconsider its October decision siding with the @federalreserve in denying Custodia a master account. The… pic.twitter.com/RDfeorIKGc — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 16, 2025 State Banking Authority Under Threat The filing raises federalism concerns about the Fed effectively overriding Wyoming’s 2020 decision to charter Custodia as a Special Purpose Depository Institution. Without master account access, the bank cannot utilize core Federal Reserve payment services, including wire transfers and automated clearinghouse systems, rendering its state-issued charter largely meaningless despite meeting all statutory eligibility requirements. “ When the Fed denies a master account to a state-chartered financial institution, it effectively vetoes a bank charter that State regulators have approved, ” the petition states. Wyoming created its SPDI framework specifically to attract digital asset companies, requiring 100% reserve backing and prohibiting lending to reduce risk. Custodia argues the Fed’s rejection undermines this carefully crafted state regulatory regime designed to foster blockchain innovation within stringent safety parameters. The constitutional implications extend beyond federalism. Custodia’s legal team contends that if regional Reserve Bank presidents hold unreviewable discretion over master accounts, they effectively become “ Officers of the United States ” wielding significant executive authority without proper constitutional appointment. Federal Reserve Bank presidents are selected by private bank directors and approved by the Board of Governors, a process Custodia argues violates the Appointments Clause if those officials exercise the discretionary power the majority opinion affirmed. Deep Judicial Split Emerges The petition highlights growing disagreement among Tenth Circuit judges on statutory interpretation. Judge Timothy Tymkovich’s dissent joined Judge Bacharach’s 2017 opinion in Fourth Corner Credit Union v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, creating a 2-2 split among circuit judges on whether the Monetary Control Act mandates master account access. Tymkovich wrote that the Fed’s interpretation grants “ unreviewable discretion ” that raises “thorny questions” under Article II while contradicting the MCA’s plain language, which requires services to be “ available to nonmember depository institutions. “ The Kansas City Fed denied Custodia’s application in January 2023 after 27 months of review, citing risks from its “ crypto-asset activities ” despite initially telling the bank there were “ no showstoppers ” with its application. A federal appeals court in Denver has upheld the Federal Reserve’s right to deny crypto-focused bank @custodiabank access to a master account. #Crypto #Custodia https://t.co/MAHuPSXT5x — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 1, 2025 Internal Fed documents revealed that staff deemed Custodia’s capital “ adequate ” and praised its “ impressive ” executive team, only for Board of Governors officials to intervene. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has since acknowledged publicly that the Fed possesses sufficient tools to manage risks without denying master accounts entirely. In an October interview , Waller suggested the Fed can “ tailor ” account structures to match individual bank risk profiles, undermining the necessity argument for blanket denials. OCC Exposes Systematic Crypto Debanking Custodia’s legal fight unfolds as federal regulators confront widespread debanking practices targeting crypto firms. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released findings in December showing all nine largest national banks imposed “ inappropriate ” restrictions on lawful businesses, including digital asset companies, between 2020 and 2023. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and others maintained internal policies requiring escalated approvals or imposing blanket restrictions on sectors deemed to conflict with institutional values. The review examined thousands of complaints about political and religious debanking, as well as crypto exclusions. @USOCC reveals nine major banks, including @jpmorgan “debanked” crypto and other lawful industries with inappropriate restrictions #CryptoNews #Banking https://t.co/hZYJOCY88v — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 11, 2025 Banks insisted they did not discriminate, but the OCC found many restrictive policies were publicly visible. In fact, Strike CEO Jack Mallers recently claimed his accounts were abruptly closed under vague references to “ concerning activity ,” fueling allegations of coordinated exclusion despite regulatory denials. The controversy intensified after President Trump signed an executive order in August intended to prevent banks from debanking customers solely for crypto-related activity.

Few understand this tension better than Joe Rey, whose decades behind the camera on sets with icons like Martin Scorsese, Hype Williams, Antoine Fuqua and Bob Giraldi exposed the deep-rooted limits of traditional media. The result has been catastrophic but predictable: platforms suppress content through opaque algorithms, exploit user data, and continually reduce creator payouts in a top-down system built to extract, not empower. Only a seismic shift—toward decentralized, trustless, permissionless broadcasting, can break this cycle. And that vision sparked the formalization of POPOLOGY® Networks , a groundbreaking media movement originating from a personal blueprint Rey authored in 2001, centered on “the personal popular” and a lifelong mission toward Global Inner Peace®. Today, POPOLOGY® is actively dismantling the old media order by introducing a Web3 broadcasting network rooted in ethical capitalism, where ownership, curation, and rewards are redefined through gamification. Its core innovation is a Superdelegated Proof-of-Stake Blockchain as a MICA compliant token system: the POPOLOGYcoin ($POPs) for utility and the non-tradeable POPs in-app points for engagement—all linked by a fixed 1,000 POPs = 1 POPOLOGY coin ratio that ensures fair, verifiable value distribution. With transparent blockchain-enabled DRM, Safe Harbor ISP protections under the DMCA, and even a USPTO Class Registration in media literacy, POPOLOGY® stands as a patented and fully realized alternative to Web2’s extractive architecture. Guided by a global leadership roster, including COO/CMO Oliver Fuselier (Emmy Award Winning Executive & Producer), the platform empowers its community through innovations like the POPcast® PEERstream™ (curated decentralized broadcasting) and POPmercial® BrandSmart™ smart-contract sponsorships. From directing & production designing for artists like the Backstreet Boys and LeAnn Rimes to patenting a decentralized media system, Rey’s singular journey merges creative mastery with breakthrough technology, culminating in an entirely new, people-powered standard for the future of digital media as the science of popular, yes POPOLOGY®. To explore this ambitious Web3 transformation, from the underlying patents to the philosophy behind the $5 CPM and the movement toward media sovereignty, we sat down with Founder and “1st POPOLOGIST®” Joe Rey and COO/CMO Oliver Fuselier for an exclusive look inside the POPOLOGY® revolution. You have decades of experience directing commercials and music videos for artists like the Spice Girls and Busta Rhymes. How did the hyper-centralized nature of the film and advertising industries inform your decision to build a Superdelegated Proof-of-Stake Blockchain system? My vast experience tells me “popular” is manufactured and is predominantly wielded by entities who have the most bank that drives influence. Yet “popular” is not limited to a manufactured commodity of programming. It includes a singularity of ones joy and endorsement that doesnt even make the ecommerce store or rated chart. It must be measured 1 person at a time, living in a realm of belief system, then accounted for in the plural of popular to become true consensus and that is science. Popular is a form of religion & science in one word. POPOLOGY untangles this phenomenon. The platform uses a core utility token, POPOLOGYcoin ($POPs), and non-tradeable in-app points, POPs. What is the strategic necessity of maintaining a fixed ratio of 1,000 POPs = 1 POPOLOGYcoin to prevent speculative volatility while still rewarding engagement? First off our POPOLOGYcoin = 1000 views to a brand seeking to sponsor POPcast PEERstreams on POPOLOGY. The in-app POPs reward actions as transactions within the dAPP, and facilitates a strong tokenomics of the POPOLOGYcoin via stretching the value of the token with POPs while still garnering the UTILITY VALUE for the Brand sponsoring the POPcast® curations of the users. POPOLOGY® is a ""gamified"" network featuring both Futures in Popular – a non-financial forecasting game – and the SKIP Protocol (earning +30 POPs for watching, losing -5 POPs for skipping content). How does this gamification layer drive more ethical and meaningful engagement than algorithmic incentives? POPOLOGY® replaces the opaque, addictive, and extractive mechanics of Web2 algorithms with a transparent, rules-based, game layer that rewards intention, not manipulation. Futures in Popular™ functions as a non-financial forecasting engine where users earn by accurately predicting which curated stories will gain traction. Instead of dopamine-loop swiping, users engage through strategy, timing, context awareness, and computational thinking — the same skills used in media analytics and cultural forecasting. This creates an ethical engagement loop because: Users are rewarded for understanding culture, not consuming endlessly. The “prediction market” is non-financial, avoiding gambling mechanics, but still giving players meaningful stakes in choosing wisely. Every prediction generates metadata entries on the Public Trust Ledger™, strengthening a community-powered Digital Rights Management system that classifies transformative fair use. Meanwhile, the SKIP Protocol (+30 POPs for intentional viewing, –5 POPs for skipping) aligns incentives between viewers, creators, and brands: Viewers earn more by watching content with intention, not by mindlessly scrolling. Skipping a POPmercial® or creator story imposes a light penalty, preventing fraudulent impressions and protecting advertisers from wasted spend. This replaces opaque Web2 ad fraud systems with cryptographically verifiable, human-linked micro-signals of authenticity. Together, these mechanics form a proof-of-intention protocol — a green alternative to Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.Instead of burning energy, POPOLOGY® generates consensus by measuring: human taste, human attention, and human judgment. The result is a more ethical, meaningful, and human-centered media economy, where engagement is earned through cultural insight rather than exploited through algorithmic addiction. POPOLOGY® is registered as a Safe Harbor ISP and aligns content tracking with DMCA.org. How critical is this dedication to digital rights management and copyright compliance to establishing trust in a decentralized, Web3-based network? It is absolutely foundational to POPOLOGY®’s legitimacy, long-term scalability, and regulatory defensibility as a decentralized media ecosystem. In Web3, most platforms avoid the hard work of rights management — which is why they struggle to attract major brands, creators, or institutional partners. POPOLOGY® took the opposite path: we built compliance into the protocol layer. As a Safe Harbor–registered ISP, POPOLOGY® earns the same legal protections and responsibilities as YouTube, Vimeo, or any major media network under Section 512 of the DMCA: Clear takedown & appeal pathways No liability for user-generated content when procedures are followed Legal recognition as a compliant hosting intermediary Auditable records of rights actions and provenance In a space polluted by rug pulls, pirated NFTs, and unlicensed AI content, trust is currency. POPOLOGY® becomes the first network where: compliance is deterministic rights are transparent creators and brands retain control provenance is on-chain disputes resolve cleanly ownership and transformation are verifiable This isn't compliance as a checkbox —it’s compliance as competitive advantage. Beyond the broader patent claims, you also hold a USPTO Class Registration specifically related to media literacy education. How do you see the platform integrating this educational mandate into the monetization and creation tools for the POPOLOGIST® user base? Our USPTO class registration in media literacy education isn’t a side note—it is one of the defining pillars of the POPOLOGY® ecosystem. It ensures that POPOLOGY® is not just a content platform, but an educational infrastructure where media literacy is built directly into the mechanics of creation, curation, rewards, and digital rights governance. Instead of opaque bidding, brands use POPOLOGY® coin to underwrite POPmercial® Sponsorships. How do you assure Fortune 500 brands that this creator-curated, permissionless advertising model will deliver predictable, high-value conversion in the absence of traditional ad-tech algorithms? Fortune 500 brands don’t care about “crypto,” “decentralization,” or “Web3 jargon.”They care about:predictability, brand safety, verified delivery, and measurable ROI. POPOLOGY® guarantees all four — not by replicating Web2 algorithms, but by replacing them with deterministic, rules-based smart-contract logic and cryptographic audience verification. As the ""1st POPOLOGIST®"" and the inventor of the vision, how does your leadership style foster the decentralized culture you preach, especially working with accomplished executives like COO/CMO Oliver Fuselier (Emmy Award Winning Executive & Producer)? As the 1st POPOLOGIST® and the originator of the vision, my leadership philosophy is simple:decentralization isn’t just a technical model — it’s a cultural discipline. In a decentralized ecosystem, authority doesn’t sit at the top of a hierarchy. It circulates. It’s earned through insight, contribution, and taste — the same values POPOLOGY® brings to creators, not just executives. So my role as Founder is not to control the culture, but to curate it the same way a POPOLOGIST® curates a great POPcast®. I lead by premise, not pressure. Vision sets direction — not ego. The system uses a Public Trust Ledger for permissioned data harvesting. How does this ledger give users more control over their digital footprint compared to current centralized platforms that monetize individual data without compensation? POPOLOGY® flips the Web2 data model upside down. On current centralized platforms, your behavior, interests, browsing patterns, and engagement data are extracted, packaged, and sold without your knowledge, consent, or compensation. The platform owns the data, the platform monetizes the data, and the platform decides how it is used. POPOLOGY® rejects that model completely. Our system is built around a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the POPOLOGY® Academy for Media Arts — whose legal mandate is to protect users, not exploit them. This nonprofit operates the Public Trust Ledger™, the cryptographic backbone that manages all permissioned data harvesting on the network. Can you elaborate on how the POPsphere™ metasearch engine specifically uses decentralized curation to aggregate media from diverse platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, etc.) to challenge the ranking and suppression caused by profit-driven algorithms? The POPsphere™ is not just a search tool — it is a decentralized metasearch engine that aggregates media from across the internet (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitch, Vimeo, X, etc.) and reorganizes it through human curation instead of corporate algorithms. Traditional platforms each run their own profit-optimized feed algorithms, which determine: what rises what gets buried which creators are surfaced which narratives are suppressed which advertisers win which communities stay invisible POPOLOGY® challenges this system fundamentally. The POPsphere™ bundles multiple platform algorithms into one unified population of content Every platform has its own algorithmic bias: YouTube → retention + ad yield TikTok → velocity + watch loops Facebook → engagement volatility Instagram → aesthetic value + ad conversion X → immediacy + controversy POPOLOGY® pulls content from ALL of them and bundles these siloed ranking systems into a single aggregated population. This means: No single corporate algorithm dominates visibility A creator suppressed on one platform can thrive in the POPsphere™ Biases cancel each other out, instead of controlling the feed Content stands on merit, taste, and cultural resonance, not algorithmic favoritism POPOLOGY® dissolves the walls between platforms. We create a meta-population of media, where the best stories from everywhere enter a shared cultural pool, free from each platform’s suppression mechanics. Decentralized curation replaces algorithmic ranking Instead of letting invisible A.I. determine visibility, POPOLOGY® shifts power to POPOLOGIST® curators who: select remix contextualize transform sequence annotate and publish content inside POPOLOGY® POPcasts®. This transforms algorithm-driven discovery (top-down) into people-driven discovery (bottom-up). Culture decides visibility — not code. With the platform built on a philosophy of Global Inner Peace, what is the biggest cultural impact you anticipate POPOLOGY® Networks will have beyond the technology and tokenomics? POPOLOGY® as a civilizational shift, not just a technological one. It ties your philosophy of Global Inner Peace to the true measure of popular, by and for the people. Use this for interviews, podcasts, keynote speeches, and investor conversations where vision matters. The Biggest Cultural Impact POPOLOGY® Will Have Beyond Technology & Tokenomics At its core, POPOLOGY® was never just a platform — it is a philosophy.It was built on the belief that Global Inner Peace begins when people understand themselves and each other through culture, not conflict. And the single greatest cultural impact we anticipate is this: POPOLOGY® will give the world a true measure of “popular” — defined by the people, not the platforms. For the first time in internet history: popularity is not manufactured by corporate algorithms culture is not manipulated by ad engines visibility is not sold to the highest bidder influence is not controlled by opaque ranking systems Instead: POPOLOGY® returns the power of discovery, relevance, and cultural meaning back to the collective public — transparently, democratically, and peacefully. This is where the cultural revolution truly begins. It transforms attention into a shared asset, not a weapon POPOLOGY® treats attention as: human energy cultural contribution a measurable, ethical asset a force that deserves compensation, not exploitation When attention is respected, not harvested, peace emerges naturally from the system’s design. It builds a community where creators and audiences collaborate, not compete Web2 pits creators against each other for reach.POPOLOGY® aligns incentives so: creators curate each other's work viewers benefit from engagement brands support intentional storytelling the network grows cooperatively This is decentralized harmony, not algorithmic warfare. It replaces digital noise with digital meaning The SKIP Protocol, Futures in Popular™, and curation-based POPcasts® shift the entire network from: attention → intentionconsumption → consciousnessscrolling → participationdivision → connection This is the cultural scaffolding of Global Inner Peace™. POPOLOGY teaches media literacy on a mass scale Because the Public Trust Ledger™ is run by a 501(c)(3), and because curation requires reflection, POPOLOGY® organically teaches: truth detection context understanding narrative analysis discernment empathy creative self-expression Media literacy is emotional literacy.Emotional literacy is cultural healing. The greatest cultural impact of POPOLOGY® will be the restoration of public sovereignty over culture itself. Not a company.Not a platform.Not an algorithm.But people. The true measure of popular becomes a global mirror —reflecting authentic stories, shared taste, collective wisdom, and human connection. That is how a media network becomes a peace network. And that is the legacy POPOLOGY® aims to build. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The firm said memory buyers for AI data centers are crowding out phone makers as Nvidia systems keep pulling huge volumes of parts built by SK Hynix and Samsung. Counterpoint said the pressure from AI players is now strong enough to distort the normal supply chain for consumer devices. The group said this shift will hit the market even as President Trump heads into another year with tech firms already dealing with higher production costs. Counterpoint said shipments could fall 2.1% next year after earlier expectations of steady or improving growth. The note said shipment data does not show sales, but it measures demand because it tracks how many units go to stores and other channels. The group said the stress starts with memory parts, and the price jumps will reach consumers as producers try to protect margins. It said average selling prices could rise 6.9% in 2026 after a previous forecast of 3.6%. Chip shortage hits all price tiers Counterpoint said specific chokepoints in the semiconductor chain are forcing up costs for every supplier. The team said DRAM used in AI servers is also a core piece inside phones, and the same product now faces demand levels far above supply. DRAM pricing has surged through the year, and Counterpoint said the effect is already visible in the final device costs. The note said low-end phones priced under $200 now face a 20% to 30% rise in their bill of materials since the start of the year. The firm said mid-range and high-end devices saw 10% to 15% higher material costs. Counterpoint added that “memory prices could rise another 40% through Q2 2026, resulting in BoM costs increasing anywhere between 8% and over 15% above current elevated levels.” Counterpoint said companies will likely pass those higher costs to buyers. The group said some firms may cut component quality by using weaker camera parts, cheaper displays or older audio hardware. Others may reuse old components inside new models. Counterpoint said many brands will also push customers toward higher-priced phones to protect revenue. Research director MS Hwang said “Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters.” Hwang added that Chinese brands in the mid-to-low tier will feel stronger pressure because they have less room to balance market share and profit. Hwang said this will “play out especially” among those players as they face rising material costs. Counterpoint said continued AI data-center build-outs are pulling huge volumes of memory into Nvidia-based systems.

Jack Yi, founder of LD Capital, recently shared his compelling perspective on X, expressing strong confidence in ETH fundamentals despite recent market turbulence. His analysis offers more than just optimism—it provides a data-driven framework for understanding why Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the on-chain finance revolution. Why Are ETH Fundamentals So Strong Right Now? Jack Yi’s confidence stems from observing fundamental shifts in market structure. He notes that while spot market liquidity has decreased significantly since the October 10 market crash, the derivatives market now drives price action more prominently. This transition represents a maturation of Ethereum’s market ecosystem, where sophisticated instruments and institutional participation increasingly influence valuation. Recent price fluctuations, according to Yi, fall within expected parameters when considering two key factors: the four-year cryptocurrency cycle and seasonal patterns around the Christmas period. These patterns create predictable volatility windows that experienced investors can navigate strategically. Navigating Market Cycles with Strategic Patience Timing the absolute bottom of any market presents significant challenges, and Yi acknowledges this reality openly. However, he views the current period as a suitable buying opportunity for those with medium- to long-term perspectives. This approach aligns with historical patterns where patient accumulation during periods of uncertainty has rewarded disciplined investors. Yi emphasizes three key considerations for current market conditions: Cycle Awareness: Understanding where we stand in the four-year cryptocurrency cycle Structural Shifts: Recognizing how derivatives markets now influence price discovery Fundamental Strength: Maintaining focus on Ethereum’s underlying technological advantages ETH as a Core Asset in On-Chain Finance From a strategic portfolio perspective, Yi positions Ethereum as more than just another cryptocurrency. He identifies ETH as a core asset in the emerging era of on-chain finance—a digital foundation upon which decentralized applications, financial instruments, and new economic models are being built. This long-term vision extends beyond Ethereum alone. Yi also highlights World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as a key portfolio component, suggesting a diversified approach within the broader blockchain ecosystem. His firm’s investment thesis and data-driven strategies, developed through extensive research, remain valid despite short-term market movements. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What does this mean for individual investors and institutions monitoring cryptocurrency markets? First, recognize that market structure evolves. The increasing dominance of derivatives indicates growing sophistication but also introduces new dynamics that require understanding. Second, separate noise from signal. Short-term price movements often distract from fundamental developments. Ethereum’s ongoing technological upgrades, developer activity, and ecosystem growth continue to strengthen its position regardless of daily price action. Finally, consider time horizons carefully. Yi’s medium- to long-term perspective suggests that current market conditions may offer strategic entry points for those willing to look beyond immediate volatility. The Compelling Case for ETH Fundamentals Jack Yi’s analysis provides more than just bullish sentiment—it offers a framework grounded in market observation and strategic thinking. His confidence in ETH fundamentals reflects deep understanding of both technical developments and market mechanics. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues evolving, such perspectives become increasingly valuable. They help investors distinguish between temporary market conditions and enduring structural advantages. For Ethereum, the combination of technological innovation, ecosystem growth, and maturing market infrastructure creates a compelling foundation for long-term value. Frequently Asked Questions What does Jack Yi mean by ETH fundamentals? He refers to Ethereum’s underlying technological strengths, developer ecosystem, network activity, and long-term utility in on-chain finance—factors that exist independently of short-term price movements. Why does the derivatives market matter for Ethereum? As derivatives gain influence over price discovery, they indicate growing institutional participation and market sophistication, which can lead to more stable long-term valuation mechanisms. How should investors approach the current market according to Yi? He suggests viewing current conditions as a strategic buying opportunity for medium- to long-term investors, while acknowledging the difficulty of timing absolute market bottoms. What role does the four-year cycle play in Yi’s analysis? Historical patterns suggest cryptocurrency markets move in roughly four-year cycles influenced by Bitcoin halving events, providing context for current volatility and future potential. Why does Yi mention World Liberty Financial (WLFI)? He identifies it as a complementary portfolio component to Ethereum, suggesting a diversified approach within the broader blockchain finance ecosystem. How reliable are data-driven strategies in volatile markets? While short-term volatility can challenge any strategy, data-driven approaches grounded in fundamental analysis typically perform better over longer time horizons.

DOGE continues to benefit from its unmatched brand recognition, deep liquidity, and enduring retail appeal, making it a familiar choice for traders seeking exposure to momentum-driven rallies. At the same time, attention is increasingly shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly rising DeFi project positioned as a top cheap cryptocurrency to invest in due to its early-stage pricing and accelerating adoption. Currently priced at $0.035 and deep into Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has already attracted over 18,500 holders, signaling strong confidence in its decentralized lending-and-borrowing ecosystem and interest-bearing token model. Together, DOGE and MUTM represent two distinct yet complementary investment narratives, one rooted in market legacy and community strength, the other driven by innovation, utility, and early-entry upside, offering investors a balanced way to position for both near-term momentum and long-term growth. Dogecoin Defends Critical Support as Accumulation Signals Emerge Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently holding a major long-term support zone between $0.13 and $0.14, an area that has historically acted as a launchpad for strong upside moves. Price action has compressed around this level, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution, while downside momentum continues to slow, a combination that often precedes a directional breakout. If DOGE confirms a bounce from this base, analysts see potential for a recovery toward the $0.18–$0.21 range; however, a decisive break below this support would invalidate the bullish setup and shift sentiment back to caution. As traders closely monitor DOGE’s next move, many are also broadening their focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best crypto for early investors seeking a functional DeFi play. MUTM Presale Nears Full Capacity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as one of the most sought-after DeFi projects of 2025. Phase 6 of its presale is approaching full allocation, with over 18,500 participants contributing more than $19.5 million. Tokens are currently priced at $0.035, presenting one of the final chances for early investors before Phase 7 increases the price by 20% to $0.04. This strong presale performance highlights MUTM as a top cheap cryptocurrency to invest in, offering both growth potential and practical DeFi utility. Unlike many altcoins that rely on speculative trading, Mutuum Finance emphasizes real-world adoption and functional use cases. Its focus on transparency, structured lending mechanisms, and utility-oriented tokenomics positions MUTM as a cryptocurrency with long-term potential and measurable value. Dual-Layer Lending Model Powers Platform Adoption A central driver of Mutuum Finance’s growth is its dual lending framework, designed to serve both stable and high-volatility assets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Aggregates large assets like USDT, ETH, and SOL in fully audited smart contracts, offering dynamic interest rates based on pool utilization. For instance, lending $15,000 USDT may generate mtUSDT tokens yielding approximately 15% annually, equaling $2,250. Borrowers can pledge $2,000 worth of ADA to access $1,500 in USDT liquidity without selling their holdings. Built-in stability factors and liquidation protocols maintain solvency and optimize fund usage. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Facilitates direct agreements for higher-risk or niche assets, allowing users to manage volatility without impacting the stability of the main liquidity pools. This dual architecture provides a scalable, flexible ecosystem for lending, borrowing, and staking, enhancing engagement with MUTM and supporting long-term adoption as the top cheap cryptocurrency to invest in. mtTokens Deliver Continuous Passive Income Mutuum Finance introduces mtTokens, which users receive upon supplying assets to the platform. Unlike traditional deposits that only yield returns upon withdrawal, mtTokens generate interest in real time. This approach enables users to maintain liquidity across other DeFi protocols while simultaneously earning passive rewards, fostering active participation and sustained engagement within the MUTM ecosystem. Dogecoin (DOGE) offers legacy strength, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides early-stage upside. Phase 6 of MUTM’s presale is nearly full, with 18,500+ holders and $19.5M raised, priced at $0.035 before Phase 7 moves it to $0.04. Early investors can secure exposure to a functional DeFi platform with dual lending and interest-bearing mtTokens. Act now to position for both short-term momentum and long-term growth in the best crypto of 2025.

The debate around the best cheap crypto to buy now has intensified as structured presales outperform stagnant large caps. In this environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been emerging as a focal point, with analysts highlighting its pricing structure, development milestones, and growing participation as key inputs for a forward-looking valuation. This Mutuum Finance price forecast draws on those factors to explain why experts believe this cheap crypto could follow a familiar growth path. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been progressing through a transparent, phase-based presale that continues attracting steady demand. The presale is currently in Phase 6, which is now 98% filled, reinforcing urgency among late entrants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $19,500,000 since presale began, and Total MUTM Holders since presale began: 18,480. Current price in phase 6: $0.035, representing a 250% or 3.5x increase from the $0.01 phase one price. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the chance to scoop tokens this cheap is quickly ending. Once Phase 6 closes, Phase 7 will open with a near 20% price increase to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launch price is set at $0.06, and analysts note that this stepped pricing structure has historically rewarded early participation by compressing upside into later stages. This presale dynamic has positioned MUTM prominently in discussions around the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) V1 Protocol Roadmap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has reinforced its credibility through visible development progress. The team confirmed that the V1 protocol will debut on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 . The testnet will include a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot, with ETH and USDT serving as the initial assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral functions. This milestone represents the project’s first operational release, moving it beyond concept and into active testing. Analysts evaluating what crypto to invest in often weigh timelines heavily, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s defined roadmap has reduced execution uncertainty. The presence of a live testnet has historically acted as a catalyst for repricing in DeFi crypto, as markets begin to value demonstrated functionality rather than future intent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has complemented its presale with community-focused incentives that have sustained visibility. To celebrate the presale, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway , awarding $10,000 in MUTM to each of 10 winners. This initiative has expanded awareness beyond existing holders and has encouraged broader participation during Phase 6. Such incentives have historically accelerated holder growth during early phases, an input analysts often consider when modeling post-launch liquidity and demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Leaderboard Activity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a dashboard featuring a leaderboard of the top 50 holders. A 24-hour leaderboard adds a competitive layer, where each day the #1 ranked user receives a $500 MUTM bonus if at least one transaction occurs within that window. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, ensuring continuous engagement rather than one-off spikes. This mechanism has encouraged repeat activity and visibility of large participants, reinforcing confidence among smaller buyers assessing what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in at this stage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Prediction Logic Experts constructing a Mutuum Finance price forecast have been drawing parallels with earlier DeFi growth cycles. One commonly cited comparison has been Solana’s 2020–2021 expansion. SOL traded as low as approximately $0.50 in mid-2020 before accelerating to an all-time high near $260 in 2021. That move unfolded over roughly 18 months and delivered an ROI of more than 51,000%, driven by a combination of ecosystem launches, developer adoption, and improving market sentiment. Analysts stress that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not Solana, yet the structural similarities lie in timing and positioning. SOL began its rally when its network shifted from development to visible deployment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is approaching a comparable inflection point as its V1 protocol enters testnet. With MUTM priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 and a launch price of $0.06, experts forecast that post-launch repricing could realistically deliver a 440% ROI as liquidity deepens and the protocol moves closer to mainnet readiness. This forecast factors in presale demand, holder growth, defined milestones, and historical behavior of early-stage DeFi crypto once functionality becomes tangible. While market conditions will influence timing, analysts argue that the current setup supports a bullish price trajectory relative to today’s valuation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been aligning presale traction, development delivery, and engagement mechanics into a coherent growth narrative. As investors continue weighing what crypto to buy now, this cheap crypto has been standing out for combining structured pricing with visible progress. That combination underpins the optimistic Mutuum Finance price forecast gaining traction among market watchers.

New data reveals that South Korean crypto exchanges have been bombarded with a record-shattering number of hacking attempts this year, raising urgent questions about digital asset security. The sheer scale of these attacks highlights the critical need for robust protection in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. What’s Behind the Record Surge in Attacks on South Korean Crypto Exchanges? According to a report by Financial News, based on data from South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service, the country’s four major trading platforms—Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Gopax—endured a staggering 1,154,594 hacking attempts through November 2024. This figure represents a dramatic escalation, more than doubling the total number of attacks recorded in the entire previous year. For perspective, consider the rapid growth: 2022: 268,419 attempts 2023: 1,128,079 attempts 2024 (through Nov): 1,154,594 attempts This exponential increase suggests that South Korean crypto exchanges have become a prime target for cybercriminals, likely due to the high trading volumes and sophisticated user base in the region. Why Are Hackers Targeting These Platforms? The concentrated focus on these specific exchanges isn’t random. South Korea has long been a global hotspot for cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Therefore, its major trading platforms hold significant volumes of digital assets, making them attractive targets. The data, obtained by lawmaker Kang Jun-hyeon’s office, points to a sustained and sophisticated campaign. Hackers are constantly evolving their methods, employing tactics like: Phishing attacks to steal login credentials Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks to overwhelm systems Exploiting software vulnerabilities Social engineering targeting exchange employees This relentless assault underscores the perpetual cat-and-mouse game between exchange security teams and malicious actors. How Can Users Protect Their Crypto Assets? While exchanges bear the primary responsibility for securing their infrastructure, users must also adopt stringent security practices. The surge in attacks on South Korean crypto exchanges serves as a powerful reminder for all investors to prioritize safety. Here are actionable steps you can take: Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, move assets off exchanges into personal cold storage wallets. Enable 2FA: Always use two-factor authentication, preferably with an authenticator app, not SMS. Beware of Phishing: Never click suspicious links in emails or messages claiming to be from your exchange. Monitor Accounts: Regularly check your exchange account for any unauthorized activity. Proactive security is your best defense in an environment where threats are constantly multiplying. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? This record number of hacking attempts will undoubtedly intensify the debate around cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea and globally. Lawmakers and financial supervisors are now under increased pressure to implement stricter security mandates for all South Korean crypto exchanges . Potential regulatory responses could include mandatory penetration testing, higher capital reserve requirements for security, and real-time attack reporting protocols. The goal is to build a more resilient ecosystem that can withstand these aggressive threats without compromising innovation. In conclusion, the shocking data on hacking attempts against major South Korean crypto exchanges is a wake-up call for the entire industry. It highlights the non-negotiable importance of cybersecurity in the digital asset space. As the value locked in cryptocurrencies grows, so too does the incentive for attackers. The path forward requires a collaborative effort—exchanges must invest heavily in cutting-edge security, regulators must craft sensible frameworks, and users must exercise constant vigilance. The security of your digital wealth ultimately depends on this multi-layered approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Which South Korean crypto exchanges were targeted in these hacking attempts? A1: The data specifically covers the four largest exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit, and Gopax. Q2: Does this mean these exchanges were successfully hacked? A2: Not necessarily. The data refers to “attempts” or attacks, which include everything from probing for weaknesses to full-scale assaults. A high number of blocked attempts can indicate strong security defenses are in place. Q3: How does 2024 compare to previous years for South Korean crypto exchange hacking? A3: 2024 has seen an unprecedented surge. With over 1.15 million attempts through November, it has already more than doubled the total for all of 2023. Q4: What should I do if I use one of these exchanges? A4: Review and strengthen your personal security measures immediately. Ensure you have 2FA enabled, use a unique password, and consider moving large holdings to a private wallet for long-term storage. Q5: Are exchanges in other countries seeing similar trends? A5: While this report focuses on South Korea, exchanges worldwide face constant cyber threats. South Korea’s high profile and market activity make it a concentrated target. Q6: What are exchanges doing to combat this threat? A6: Major exchanges typically employ dedicated cybersecurity teams, conduct regular audits, use multi-signature cold wallets for funds, and have insurance policies to protect user assets in the event of a breach.

If anything, the analyst believes that the current downtrend actually plays into the XRP long-term target, claiming that the cryptocurrency remains inherently bullish. If the analyst is right, then it means that the XRP price could be gearing up for another major uptrend that could send it to new peaks. XRP Price Is Only In Wave 4, Not A Bear Market In the post that was shared on X, Dark Defender explained that the XRP cryptocurrency was not in any kind of bear market. Instead, the current downtrend is only a result of the altcoin entering Wave 4 of the Elliot Wave, leading to the decline. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says Given that Wave 4 is a historically bearish wave, it would explain why the XRP price has dropped so quickly. However, the crypto analyst explained that this wave did not just start, as it has been in play since February 2025. Hence, it would need to play out completely before the next wave can begin. Going by this analysis, it would mean that the last and final wave of the theory is yet to play out, which is often the most bullish of all the waves. As a result, the analyst urges XRP investors not to panic as the price continues to play out according to plan. In the end, the target remains $5.85, according to Dark Defender, beating its previous all-time high of $3.8. Price Could Be Rounding A Bottom Another analyst also contributes that the XRP price is not in a bear market, and could, in fact, be putting in a bottom. STEPH IS CRYPTO points out that the XRP RSI is actually showing a rare bullish divergence on the daily chart, one of the few times that this has happened over the years. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Crash, And Will It Continue? This is significant because back in 2022, a similar bullish divergence had appeared on the daily chart ,and the result was a rapid rise once the distribution was done. As the crypto analyst explains, the fact that this bullish RSI divergence has appeared on the XRP daily chart again suggests that the sellers are actually running out of steam. While there is no set target for where the XRP price is headed, the prediction suggests that a rally could be in the works. “Nothing is guaranteed — but from a technical perspective, this is one of the strongest early reversal signals you can get,” the analyst stated.

Pushing Crypto Bill Discussions To Next Year In a statement released on Monday, a spokesperson for Chair Scott, a South Carolina Republican, noted that the Senate Banking Committee is actively negotiating with its Democratic counterparts in pursuit of a bipartisan approach to digital asset market legislation. “Chairman Scott and the Senate Banking Committee have made strong progress,” said spokesperson Jeff Naft, emphasizing the ongoing efforts to create a robust regulatory framework that would provide clarity for the crypto industry and position the US as a leader in the digital asset space. The delay comes at a time when the committee has produced multiple draft versions of the bill. However, with Congress preparing to return from its holiday break, the immediate focus will shift to funding the federal government, as the current funding bill is set to expire on January 30. The negotiations had intensified over the past week, with Republicans from the Banking Committee collaborating with Senate Democrats to find a workable compromise. Democrats have advocated for additional time in discussions, reflecting concerns about various issues, including financial stability, market integrity, and ethical considerations . In particular, the ethics concerns have been linked to President Donald Trump and his family’s crypto-related business dealings, which have reportedly increased their wealth. Regulators Intensify Oversight Of Digital Assets Despite the legislative stall, federal regulators are continuing to engage with the cryptocurrency sector. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued multiple staff statements and convened roundtable discussions to explore how existing securities laws apply within the crypto market. In parallel, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has begun allowing licensed institutions to engage in spot crypto trading and recently granted no-action relief to specific prediction market operators regarding data requirements. Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is set to take significant steps towards implementing the country’s stablecoin bill, or most commonly known as the GENIUS Act. The FDIC board is expected to review a proposed rule that will outline approval requirements for banks issuing payment stablecoins through their subsidiaries, opening the proposal for public commentary and discussion. Travis Hill, the FDIC chair nominee, who may be confirmed by the Senate as soon as this week, highlighted that the FDIC is are already working on establishing prudential standards for stablecoin issuers under FDIC supervision. These standards would cover areas such as capital requirements, reserves, and risk management.

Why Experts Predict One Last Shakeout Before the Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-dropping-further-why-experts-predict-one-last-shakeout-before-the-rally/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is facing pressure after falling below important support levels. Several market watchers believe a final dip may come before a short-term recovery. This takes place as traders prepare for upcoming economic reports and low year-end liquidity. BTC Slips Below Key Trendline Bitcoin dropped below $86,500, breaking out of an upward channel that had been in place since late November. This move points to weakness in the current trend. Colin Talks Crypto, a popular industry analyst, noted that the cryptocurrency looks oversold and close to a short-term bottom. He wrote, “ A capitulation wick down will be the final shakeout ,” suggesting that the next sharp drop could mark the bottom. He expects the range between $74,000 and $81,000 to offer support, adding, “I’m fully expecting a nice juicy bounce that lasts for 4–8 weeks after the bottom is found.” He also mentioned this could happen before the end of the month. Bitcoin recently touched $85,200, the lowest point since December 2, when a major leverage flush occurred. This selling pattern fits the idea that a final wave down may shake out weaker holders before a rebound. Holding $87K is Critical Analyst Ali Martinez shared a view that Bitcoin is now at a major decision point. His chart shows BTC trading just above a rising support line. “ Hold $87,000 or risk a move toward $70,000 ,” he warned. A close below that level could trigger a larger drop toward $80,500, or even $74,600. At the same time, resistance levels are marked around $92,500 and $95,600. If Bitcoin stays above $87,000 and pushes higher, short-term upside may still be possible. But for now, the price is stuck between pressure from both sides. Another analyst, CRYPTOWZRD, added : “$BTC is attempting to break the higher low trendline. This will apply more pressure towards $73,000 if it plays out.” Market Sentiment and Liquidity Trends Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume is around $49.9 billion. The price has fallen almost 4% in the past day and over 4% over the last seven days. The total crypto market value also fell to $3.02 trillion — the lowest in three weeks. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that global liquidity is rising, but Bitcoin has not responded. “There’s still a lot of 4-year cycle selling paired with tax loss harvesting into the end of the year,” he said. He expects Bitcoin to have a better shot at growth in early 2026, once volume returns and seasonal selling ends. Meanwhile, the next move may be driven by economic figures due this week, including unemployment numbers and PMI data.

The message reinforces a long-standing view within institutional finance: the largest volumes and revenues are generated at the bank and corporate level, not through small retail transfers. According to the analysis, this reality explains the continued relevance of infrastructure-focused firms such as Ripple and Stellar, which are positioned to serve institutional payment flows rather than consumer-facing use cases. The post challenges the assumption that legacy money transfer companies are on the verge of being replaced. Instead, it suggests that established firms such as Western Union are more likely to adapt by integrating new technologies over time. The transformation underway is not centered on the immediate removal of intermediaries, but on upgrading the core systems that support large-scale transfers between financial institutions. Don’t forget: “The BIG MONEY is in cross border payments —> that’s why we have Ripple and Stellar.” Watch. https://t.co/WMHQKCRh81 pic.twitter.com/SDc3m1RFqj — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 14, 2025 Business-to-Business Payments as the Core Opportunity The attached video expands on this idea by explaining that the most expensive and inefficient part of the global payment system exists in cross-border business payments. These transactions occur at scale, involve high volumes, and are typically handled through correspondent banking arrangements. While the basic structure of these systems remains intact, the speed and efficiency of settlement can be improved through distributed ledger technologies that allow data to move faster than funds traditionally do. From this perspective, the focus of networks like Ripple and Stellar is not on individual consumers sending money to family members abroad, but on enabling banks to transact with one another more efficiently. The emphasis is on backend infrastructure that supports institutional activity, where even small efficiency gains can translate into substantial cost reductions. Permissioned Networks and Institutional Design The speaker in the video also outlines a key distinction between open blockchain systems and those designed for institutional use . Open, permissionless networks enable anyone to participate without approval, which supports accessibility. In contrast, many systems intended for enterprise payments operate on a permissioned basis, where participants are known entities and membership is restricted. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This structure aligns with regulatory and compliance requirements faced by banks. In such networks, participating institutions maintain direct relationships with one another and transact through shared ledgers that facilitate faster settlement while preserving established governance standards. The process remains bank-centric, with distributed ledger technology, like the XRPL , acting as an efficiency layer rather than a replacement for the financial system. Effect on the Payment Landscape SMQKE’s post ultimately underscores that the largest financial opportunities in digital payments are tied to institutional adoption rather than consumer speculation. By targeting cross-border, high-volume transactions, companies focused on payment infrastructure are addressing a segment of the market where inefficiencies are most costly. The analysis positions Ripple and Stellar as examples of platforms designed to operate within this reality, emphasizing that the future of payments innovation is being shaped behind the scenes, at the level where banks move money with other banks across borders.

55868573,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=879188,1765879476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55868573.jpeg,Oil markets sink as Brent slips under $60 and WTI hits $55,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/global-oil-markets-crash-brent-wti/,"Brent broke below $60 and sent a shock across the oil market, dropping to $59.96 after a steady grind lower through 2025. WTI followed the move and sat near $55. Traders watched the decline build for months as supply kept rising while demand stayed weak. The market has been flooded by fresh barrels from OPEC+ and producers across the Americas, and forecasts show that imbalance getting even worse next year. The year’s loss deepened fast, and no one seemed surprised anymore. The shift in mood also came from renewed hope that Russia’s war in Ukraine could move toward a settlement. That hope cut into the geopolitical premium that had held crude higher for years. At the same time, investors tried to measure the impact of U.S. pressure on Venezuela. With President Trump still pushing hard on sanctions strategy, traders kept guessing how Venezuelan flows might shift. EU targets Russian oil operations The European Union rolled out another sanctions package against Russian oil interests, naming traders Murtaza Lakhani and Etibar Eyyub for helping Russia bypass Western rules on crude exports. The EU has now issued 19 sanction rounds and listed more than 2,600 individuals and entities. But Russia keeps finding new paths, still sending millions of barrels to India and China at discounted rates. Much of that crude moves through a large “shadow fleet” of ships operating outside the normal maritime system. The latest restrictions ban EU citizens from doing business with the listed names, limiting their shipping and insurance options. The EU also targeted nine more people and companies tied to the shadow fleet, including figures linked to Rosneft and Lukoil. Analysts expect the bloc to add more than 40 ships this week, which would lift the total to around 600 vessels. Moscow brushed off the move, saying the sanctions only harm Europeans. Russia’s Permanent Mission to the EU said, “We note with regret Brussels’ inability to recognise a simple truth: if the same action is repeated over and over and does not produce the desired result, it means the original strategy fundamentally does not work and is flawed.” The statement added that the measures would deepen “the growing socio-economic problems and the declining standard of living for European citizens.” Asia-Pacific markets extend losses Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific stocks are also crashing, following the lead of Wall Street as investor grow sicker and sicker of the AI trade. Oracle’s stock ORCL fell by more than 5%, Broadcom plunged by over 2%, and Microsoft also dropped by 2.6%. South Korea’s Kospi led the fall, losing 2.24% and closing at 3,999.13. The Kosdaq slid 2.42% to 916.11. It marked the first time in almost two weeks that the Kospi dropped under 4,000. Korea Zinc plunged nearly 14% after reports that the firm agreed to sell $1.9 billion in shares to a joint venture controlled by the U.S. government and unnamed U.S. strategic investors. Drug developer ADEL said it signed a deal with Sanofi worth up to $1.04 billion. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined 1.54% and ended at 25,235.41. Mainland China’s CSI 300 dropped 1.2% to 4,497.55, its lowest close since November 25. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.56% to 49,383.29, and the Topix slipped 1.78% to 3,370.5. Japan’s flash composite PMI eased to 51.5 from 52 in the previous month. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.42% and ended at 8,598.9 after giving up earlier gains. Get seen where it counts.

This launch, powered by a license from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), marks a significant step in bringing regulated, speculative trading on future events to American investors. But what exactly is a Gemini prediction market , and why does it matter for you? What is the Gemini Prediction Market Service? Operated through its affiliate, Gemini Titan, Gemini Predictions is a platform where users can trade on the likely outcome of real-world events. Think of it as a financial market for forecasts. Users buy shares predicting a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ result on questions like “Will the Fed raise interest rates in Q3?” or “Will Ethereum trade above $4,000 by year-end?” The service promises real-time execution and fully transparent trading, a core principle for the Winklevoss-led exchange. Why is This US Launch a Big Deal? The key differentiator is regulation. By securing a license from the CFTC, Gemini brings a layer of legitimacy and consumer protection often absent in decentralized prediction markets. This regulatory green light allows the Gemini prediction market to operate across the United States, offering a compliant alternative. For the average user, this means: Trust and Security: Assets are held on a regulated, US-based exchange. Market Integrity: The CFTC oversight helps ensure fair pricing and prevents manipulation. Mainstream Accessibility: It simplifies access, allowing users to engage with prediction markets directly from their existing Gemini account. How Could a Prediction Market Benefit Crypto Traders? Beyond simple speculation, a regulated prediction market serves as a powerful tool. It aggregates crowd wisdom to create a probabilistic forecast, which can be a valuable sentiment indicator. For instance, the price of a “Bitcoin ETF approval” contract could signal market expectations more clearly than social media chatter. Therefore, traders can use these markets to hedge positions or gain insights into upcoming catalysts affecting crypto prices. What Are the Potential Challenges? However, this innovation is not without its hurdles. Regulatory scope is limited; the CFTC license pertains to event contracts, not all forms of prediction markets. Furthermore, liquidity in new markets can be thin, leading to volatile prices. Users must also remember that this is speculative trading—while regulated, it still carries significant risk of loss. Actionable Insights for Interested Users If you’re considering trying Gemini Predictions , start with a clear strategy. Treat it as a sophisticated tool, not a game. Begin with small amounts on events you understand deeply. Use it to complement your existing research, not replace it. Most importantly, always assess the liquidity of a specific contract before trading, as this impacts your ability to enter and exit positions smoothly. The Future of Prediction Markets in Crypto Gemini’s nationwide launch could be the catalyst that brings prediction markets into the mainstream financial toolkit. Its success may encourage other regulated entities to follow, increasing competition and innovation. This move bridges the gap between traditional finance’s desire for forecast derivatives and the crypto world’s native comfort with speculative assets. The long-term vision is a more efficient market where information from diverse sources is continuously priced in. In conclusion, the launch of the Gemini prediction market is a pivotal moment. It demonstrates the maturation of the crypto industry under a regulatory framework while providing US traders with a novel, transparent way to express views on future events. This service has the potential to enhance market efficiency and offer new strategic avenues for informed participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Gemini prediction market available in all US states? A1: While Gemini has a CFTC license to operate nationwide, availability can sometimes depend on state-level money transmitter laws. It’s best to check directly within your Gemini account for the most accurate service availability in your location. Q2: What kind of events can I trade on? A2: Initially, events will likely focus on financial markets, crypto prices, and economic indicators—topics within traditional regulatory boundaries. Expect questions related to interest rates, ETF approvals, and asset price levels. Q3: How is this different from sports betting or gambling? A3: The key difference is regulatory classification and purpose. This is structured as a financial market contract overseen by the CFTC, intended for hedging and price discovery. Sports betting is typically regulated at the state level as a gaming activity. Q4: Do I need a separate account from my main Gemini crypto account? A4: No. The Gemini prediction market service, Gemini Predictions, is integrated into the main Gemini platform. You can access it and fund contracts using your existing account balance. Q5: What are the fees for trading on Gemini Predictions? A5: Gemini has not publicly detailed a specific fee schedule for Predictions. Typically, such services involve a small taker/maker fee model or a spread. Users should review Gemini’s official fee page for the most current information. Q6: Are my winnings taxable? A6: Yes. In the United States, profits from trading in prediction markets are generally considered taxable income. You should consult with a tax professional to understand your specific reporting obligations.

This divergence highlights the complex interplay between economic indicators and currency valuations that traders must navigate. Why Is the US Dollar Slipping Before Payrolls Data? The US dollar has been losing ground against major currencies as traders position themselves cautiously ahead of the non-farm payrolls report. Market participants are showing increased risk aversion, with many reducing their dollar exposure in anticipation of potential volatility. This preemptive movement reflects growing uncertainty about the strength of the American labor market and its implications for Federal Reserve policy. Several factors are contributing to the dollar’s weakness: Reduced expectations for aggressive Fed rate hikes Technical positioning ahead of major economic releases Broader risk-off sentiment in global markets Concerns about economic growth momentum Sterling’s Surprising Strength Despite Weak Economic Indicators The sterling has managed to gain ground even as UK employment data disappointed market expectations. This counterintuitive movement suggests that currency traders are looking beyond immediate economic releases and considering broader macroeconomic factors. The pound’s resilience indicates that market participants may be pricing in future policy moves by the Bank of England or anticipating improvements in the UK economic outlook. Currency Pair Movement Key Driver GBP/USD +0.4% Dollar weakness, sterling resilience EUR/USD +0.3% Broad dollar selling USD/JPY -0.2% Risk aversion, yield differentials The Critical Importance of Payrolls Data for Forex Traders Payrolls data represents one of the most significant economic indicators for currency markets, providing crucial insights into the health of the US labor market. The upcoming release is particularly important as it could influence Federal Reserve policy decisions and reshape market expectations for interest rates. Traders are closely monitoring several key aspects of the report beyond just the headline number. Key elements to watch in the payrolls report: Non-farm payrolls change (headline figure) Unemployment rate adjustments Average hourly earnings growth Labor force participation rate Revisions to previous months’ data How Economic Indicators Shape Currency Market Movements Economic indicators serve as the fundamental drivers of currency valuations, providing traders with essential information about the relative strength of different economies. The current market dynamics demonstrate how currencies can sometimes move contrary to immediate data releases, as traders incorporate multiple factors into their decision-making processes. Understanding these complex relationships is crucial for successful forex trading. The interplay between different types of economic data creates a complex trading environment: Leading indicators (future economic activity) Coincident indicators (current economic conditions) Lagging indicators (past economic performance) Market expectations versus actual results Actionable Insights for Navigating Current Forex Market Conditions Traders operating in the current forex market environment should consider several strategic approaches to manage risk and identify opportunities. The divergence between currency movements and economic data highlights the importance of comprehensive analysis and flexible trading strategies. Key considerations for forex traders: Monitor multiple timeframes for confirmation of trends Use appropriate position sizing given increased volatility Consider correlations between currency pairs and other asset classes Maintain awareness of central bank communications and policy signals Implement risk management strategies for data release events FAQs: Understanding Forex Market Dynamics What causes currencies to move against economic data expectations? Currencies can move contrary to economic data due to several factors including pre-positioning by traders, revisions to previous data, changes in market expectations, and consideration of forward-looking indicators rather than backward-looking data. How does the Federal Reserve influence the US dollar? The Federal Reserve influences the US dollar through monetary policy decisions, interest rate changes, quantitative easing programs, and forward guidance about future policy actions. What role does the Bank of England play in sterling valuation? The Bank of England affects sterling through its monetary policy committee decisions, interest rate settings, asset purchase programs, and economic projections that influence market expectations. Why is non-farm payrolls data so important for currency markets? Non-farm payrolls data provides crucial insights into US employment trends, which directly influence Federal Reserve policy decisions, economic growth projections, and investor sentiment toward the US economy. How can traders prepare for major economic data releases? Traders can prepare by reviewing consensus forecasts, understanding historical data patterns, adjusting position sizes, implementing appropriate stop-loss levels, and monitoring related markets for confirmation signals. The current forex market movements demonstrate the sophisticated nature of currency trading, where immediate economic data must be interpreted within broader macroeconomic contexts. The US dollar’s preemptive weakness ahead of payrolls data and sterling’s resilience despite disappointing employment figures highlight how currencies can sometimes defy conventional expectations. As traders navigate these complex dynamics, understanding the interplay between different economic indicators and market psychology becomes increasingly important for identifying opportunities and managing risk in the ever-evolving forex market landscape.

It also provides an overview of custody models for tokenized assets and analyzes liquidity facilitation products, which can make the secondary market more active. The cooperation is based on the previous partnership between DMCC and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) of Dubai, which aimed to develop infrastructure to tokenize commodities within a regulated framework. Education and institutional engagement Besides developing infrastructure, the cooperation also includes an educational component, according to which Crypto.com will collaborate with the DMCC Crypto Centre. The parties will form technical and educational training to promote institutional knowledge of tokenized assets and digital trade instruments. Some of the suggested activities include workshops, hacks, and skills-building courses designed for companies considering tokenized asset models. The programs will empower responsible experimentation and sharing of knowledge in the growing Web3 and digital asset ecosystem in Dubai. According to DMCC, the extended involvement is expected to make Dubai a trade innovation hub through connecting traditional commodities markets with new digital asset technologies through structured, regulated initiatives. Crypto.com’s parallel expansion into market intelligence platforms In another announcement, Crypto.com also announced its partnership with ERShares and Signal Markets to create a global future-intelligence platform based on prediction markets. The program is being introduced under the brand Crypto.com | Derivatives North America (CDNA), a CFTC-registered exchange and clearinghouse affiliated with Crypto.com. The platform will be designed to integrate macroeconomic data, financial market indicators, and corporate outcomes into a single, prediction-driven platform. As stated by the parties, it will incorporate probabilistic modeling in various aspects, including interest rates, inflation, employment, equities, commodities, digital assets, and corporate earnings. In the partnership, ERShares will conduct research design, information integration, and media dissemination, while Signal Markets will provide the probability-based modeling and forecasting architecture.

This development comes after the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend in September, citing new evidence that reportedly came from a confidential informant. The lawsuit covers those who purchased Pump.fun-launched tokens from March 2024 onward and suffered out-of-pocket losses. The defendants have attempted to dismiss the motion citing legal technicalities, but the court has upheld the motion and given the plaintiffs time to incorporate the new evidence, which means the battle is about to begin anew. What’s the new evidence in the Solana, Pump.fun class action lawsuit? The claims included in the recently released court documents , which have granted the plaintiffs leave to file an amendment, range from violation of the securities act to RICO violation and unjust enrichment allegations. “What appeared to be a fair, automated marketplace was, Plaintiffs say, structurally tilted to extract value from ordinary users while rewarding those with privileged access to Solana’s infrastructure and Jito Lab’s transaction ordering tools,” the documents claim . The plaintiffs allege they got their hands on after an informant who had gone missing reached out, claiming to have incriminating chat logs of up to 5000 messages. Going by the new evidence, the court deemed the proposed amendments sufficient enough to proceed and has denied or deferred related defense motions as needed. The internal chat logs that are expected to be presented as evidence involve Pump.fun personnel, Solana Labs engineers, Jito Labs executives and other third parties. The defendants have asked that the motion be denied outright because the plaintiffs did not attach a proposed amended complaint, but the court countered the proposition, and the leave to file a second amended complaint was granted. The plaintiffs have also requested a corresponding schedule modification to allow them sufficient time to process the new evidence and incorporate it into the second amended complaint they plan to file. The filing has not happened yet, but when it does, the pending motions to dismiss the current complaint from September 2025, which currently remain, may become moot or get reset. In summary, the battle has only just begun, and its outcome is likely to affect the entire Solana ecosystem. Why are Solana and Pump.fun getting sued? The origin of the Solana, Pump.fun lawsuit goes back to the beginning of the year when a class action lawsuit was filed by retail investors who had lost money on memecoin purchases. The lawsuit saw the plaintiffs accuse the Pump.fun platform, its co-founders, Solana Labs Inc., the Solana Foundation and associated executives, which include the likes of Anatoly Yakovenko, Raj Gokal, Dan Albert, Austin Federa, and Lily Liu, of orchestrating a plan to extract value in what was called the “Pump Enterprise.” The core allegations leveled against the defendants now claim they rigged token launches in a way that secretly granted insiders priority access to purchase newly launched tokens, all of which the plaintiffs claim would be impossible to do without Solana’s validator infrastructure and transaction ordering tools. This arrangement allegedly gave those insiders the chance to buy as many of the new tokens at the lowest possible prices, trigger rapid price spikes via the bonding curve mechanism the Pump platform integrated, and subsequently dump on retail buyers who placed an order thinking they were playing on a level playing field. This meant the retailers bought at inflated prices, which ultimately resulted in widespread losses each time the price collapsed.

According to his analysis, the present price behavior closely resembles the structure that formed in 2017 shortly before a sharp and unexpected market expansion. While he stopped short of suggesting that history will repeat exactly, he emphasized that several technical and macro indicators deserve careful consideration by market participants. The analyst focused on XRP’s daily timeframe, particularly price action following the October 10, 2025, liquidation event, when approximately $19 billion in crypto positions were wiped out across the market. He described this as the largest liquidation event recorded. In the aftermath, XRP and several other altcoins rebounded rapidly, with XRP posting a recovery exceeding 100%. More importantly, he noted that price action since then appears to be forming a higher low, alongside a potential double-bottom structure. #XRP Is Repeating a Pattern I’ve Only Seen Once Before pic.twitter.com/eje53Q1OJa — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 15, 2025 Comparison With the 2017 Market Cycle STEPHISCRYPTO explained that a similar sequence occurred in 2017, beginning with a large liquidation wick, followed by a prolonged consolidation phase that tested investor confidence. During that period, XRP eventually established a double bottom before entering a rapid upward expansion. He stressed that the current environment feels similarly uncertain, with persistent downside pressure and mixed market signals. Yet the structure itself remains technically constructive as long as the higher low holds. He cautioned, however, that macroeconomic risks cannot be ignored. A central concern raised was the Bank of Japan’s expected interest rate decision scheduled for December 19. The analyst stated that since 2024, each rate hike by the Bank of Japan has coincided with notable downside pressure across crypto markets, including XRP. This upcoming hike, expected to raise rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, would be the first in nearly a year and is widely anticipated by the market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Conflicting Signals From Indicators and On-Chain Data Despite these risks, the analyst highlighted that this cycle differs from previous ones, as the broader crypto market has already experienced a significant pullback ahead of the anticipated rate decision. He also referenced historically low retail participation, noting that current interest levels are at yearly lows, contrasting sharply with the heightened activity seen one year earlier. On the technical side, he addressed a bearish signal from a long-term EMA ribbon indicator on the three-day chart. Historically, such signals have preceded multi-month drawdowns ranging from moderate to severe, although he acknowledged a recent exception in 2024 when losses were limited before a strong recovery. This, he suggested, introduces uncertainty rather than a definitive outlook. Balancing these concerns, the analyst suggested whale accumulation . He also observed liquidity concentrations above the current price, indicating areas the market may eventually test. Taken together, STEPHISCRYPTO concluded that XRP remains in a fragile but potentially constructive phase, where both downside risks and longer-term upside scenarios must be weighed carefully.

The pullback has been sharp enough to punish altcoins, yet data from social and on-chain trackers show traders are cautious rather than fearful, suggesting conviction has not fully cracked. Market Sees Broad Declines At the time of writing, BTC had fallen roughly 3.6% in the last 24 hours and was hovering around $87,000, according to market data shared by Santiment. Ethereum (ETH) had dropped even harder, sliding more than 6% to just above $2,900, while total crypto market capitalization shed an estimated $140 billion in a matter of hours. Several altcoins also experienced the sell-off. Santiment’s December 15–16 market snapshot showed a sea of red across large- and mid-cap tokens, with ASTER down about 12%, ENA lower by 9%, SUI off 8%, and HYPE sliding 7%, being some of the day’s steepest decliners. According to analytics firm Glassnode, the movement extended a pattern where capital appears to be concentrating in Bitcoin, with most other crypto sectors lagging behind its performance for the past three months. However, what stood out was behavior rather than price alone. Santiment’s data showed Bitcoin’s social chatter rising more than 40% in a single day, while Ethereum mentions climbed close to 75%. According to the platform’s analysts, such jumps usually appear near short-term extremes, when traders argue loudly during drops. Nevertheless, other on-chain metrics and social sentiment have not yet shown classic signs of a market bottom, such as spikes in DeFi liquidations or extreme fear, suggesting the downtrend could have further to go. Stress Builds, But Panic Signals Remain Absent Market watchers have offered several explanations for the sell-off. For example, a December 16 analysis linked it to delayed U.S. legislation on crypto market structure and heavy derivatives positioning around the $85,000 strike. Elsewhere, veteran trader Peter Brandt, writing on December 15, warned that Bitcoin’s longer-term chart structure resembles past cycle tops, though he stressed historical comparisons are not forecasts. Still, signs of forced selling are scarce. On-chain metrics show unrealized losses rising but not spiking, while ETF flows and exchange balances suggest holders are waiting rather than rushing for exits. Even Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin buying earlier this month has not triggered broader stress across the market, according to Santiment. For now, players in the market appear to be closely monitoring the flagship cryptocurrency’s ability to defend $85,000, and until leverage unwinds or sentiment flips sharply negative, the current slide looks more like pressure building than a full capitulation.

The poll puts investor sentiment at 7.4 on a scale that tops out at 10, the strongest reading in four and a half years. That jump reflects changes in cash levels, stock exposure and expectations for global growth, and the number speaks for itself. Combined exposure to equities and commodities has climbed to the highest level since February 2022, right before Covid-era inflation smashed markets and pushed global interest rates up fast. The survey also points to rare optimism. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at BofA, said this type of bullish mood has appeared only eight times this century. He pointed to stretches like November 2010 through February 2011, during the recovery from the financial crisis, and the wave between November 2020 and July 2021, when the post-Covid rebound pushed risk appetite higher. He said these periods usually align with sharp bursts of growth and big swings in asset prices. Tracking shifts across major equity indexes The global rally is already visible. The MSCI All-Country World Index has gained almost 20% in 2025, marking a third straight year of strong double-digit returns. Central banks across major economies have been cutting rates while growth stays solid, and that mix has pulled benchmarks close to record highs. The survey shows 57% of respondents expect a soft landing for the economy, and only 3% expect a hard landing, the lowest share in two and a half years. Cash holdings dropped to 3.3% from 3.7% in the prior month. Concerns remain around U.S. tech valuations, with many watching what they call an AI bubble . A net 14% of participants still think companies are spending too much on capital expenditure, down from the 20% peak last month. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 164 points, or 0.34%, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.56% and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped almost 0.83%. All three major U.S. indexes ended Monday in the red after losses in large AI-linked stocks. Europe had a rough morning too. The Stoxx 600 traded 0.2% lower at mid-morning in London. Most sectors and major bourses dipped. The CAC 40 fell 0.10% to 8,116.64. The FTSE 100 moved 0.44% lower to 9,708.52. Germany’s DAX slid 0.36% to 24,141.53, and Spain’s IBEX 35 lost 0.36% at 16,980.40. Italy’s FTSE MIB inched 0.08% higher to 44,150.17, giving Europe at least one green spot. The broader Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 0.19% to 581.44. Tracking changes in global economic signals Economic data from Europe came in soft Tuesday morning, with private-sector activity in the euro area getting slower than expected as German industry weakened. According to data from LSEG, the Composite PMI from S&P Global slipped to 51.9 from 52.8, still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, as analysts had expected a steady reading. This comes as the European Central Bank is preparing to set rates for the last time this year. Traders do not expect major policy changes, given that inflation is still near the 2% target. U.S. Treasury yields dipped as investors braced for fresh data. The 10-year yield eased to 4.178%, down less than a basis point. The 2-year held at 3.508%, while the 30-year ticked up to 4.853%. Shorter maturities showed mixed moves, with the 1-month at 3.696%, the 1-year at 3.555%, the 3-month at 3.655% and the 6-month at 3.62%. A basis point equals 0.01%, and yields move opposite of prices. Traders are now waiting for November jobs data. Economists expect 50,000 new nonfarm payrolls, down from 119,000 in September. They see unemployment at 4.5%, slightly higher than September’s 4.4%. October retail sales numbers will also hit Tuesday morning, adding more fuel for markets already moving on rate expectations under President Trump’s 2025 economic backdrop.

The recent drop adds to ongoing concerns about a deeper correction toward the $1 area. Analysts are watching current price action as volume rises and technical indicators weaken. Breakdown Signals and Volume Spike XRP is trading around $1.88 after falling through the $1.93 support zone, which now acts as resistance. The move comes with a nearly 6% drop over 24 hours and a weekly loss of over 8%. Trading volume jumped more than 87% in a single day, now above $3.6 billion. This increase suggests stronger activity from larger players or wider repositioning. Crypto analyst Cheds Trading warned that XRP may be forming a high-time frame topping pattern. He described it as a “rounding top or M with higher high,” and added, “Measured move to roughly MA 200 area/$1.00 range.” XRP has also fallen below the 8 EMA, 34 EMA, and 50 SMA on the weekly chart, indicating weakness in the trend. Meanwhile, the weekly Bollinger Bands are starting to widen, while the price remains below the midline. With XRP unable to stay above $2, momentum remains on the downside. If $1.75 fails to hold, the 200-week moving average near $1.07 becomes the next area to watch. Ali Martinez flagged $1.92 as the level to hold. XRP has consistently printed lower highs and lower lows since its July peak at $3.65, showing no signs of reversal so far. “$1.92 is the level $XRP must hold to avoid a drop to $1,” he said. In addition, the 4-hour chart from ChartNerd shows XRP inside a descending channel. Price is now testing the lower edge of the range near $1.87–$1.90, overlapping a demand zone. ChartNerd noted, “$XRP LTF PA unfolding as expected,” hinting at a possible bounce. Whale Selling and Short Positioning Ali reported that 1.18 billion XRP has been sold by large holders over the past four weeks, with 280 million tokens sold in the last week alone. CryptoPotato also reported over $1 billion in XRP sold by large holders. This increased distribution adds to the selling pressure seen across recent sessions. Niels pointed out that downside liquidity “ has been completely taken out ,” and noted that funding rates across exchanges have turned negative. He said that this kind of short-heavy market could “ start a squeeze ” if any upside momentum returns. Despite inflows into spot ETFs, XRP underperformed compared to other major tokens. The price movement appears driven more by technical selling than new developments.

Washington suspended the plan after weeks of irritation over slow movement in wider trade talks. British officials confirmed the freeze and said it happened last week. The deal had been announced in September during Trump’s state visit , and now it sits on ice because both sides cannot get through basic trade fights. Trade talks have been dragging since May, when both countries agreed to a plan that softened the tariffs Trump placed on British goods. People involved allegedly said the US team was running out of patience with the UK’s refusal to respond to “non-tariff barriers.” These barriers sit inside rules and regulations for food and industrial goods, and US officials want them changed. The UK did allow 13,000 tonnes of US beef into the country each year without tariffs, but even that came with a clear note in the agreement saying both sides would still work on giving more access to American farm products. The US has been asking the UK to accept American food standards, but no promise was made inside the deal. US targets UK trade barriers and taxes Trump has complained before about digital services taxes that target US tech companies. The UK is one of the countries with such a tax. But one UK official said the issue was being blown out of proportion and argued it was not blocking the deal. “The digital services tax is a red herring,” the official said. The same official added, “We are down to negotiating some of the most difficult issues. Both sides expect this to take some time. But the dialogue remains open, active, and constructive.” Even while the tech deal was collapsing, UK business secretary Peter Kyle and science secretary Liz Kendall were already in the US meeting with tech leaders. Their trip had been planned earlier and was not changed after Washington suspended the agreement. British officials described the US team as “very tough negotiators,” but insisted the talks are not dead. One of them put it simply: “We are pretty sure we can get this back on track.” The UK government tried to calm nerves by saying the relationship with Washington remains strong. A spokesman said, “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hardworking people in both countries.” The statement did not gloss over the suspension, but it tried to keep the tone steady while both sides argue over growth, control, and standards. The freeze on the tech pact comes only weeks after a different deal between the countries moved forward. Earlier this month, the UK agreed to raise NHS spending on medicines after the US decided to remove tariffs on British drug exports. That part of the trade relationship seems to be holding up better. A White House official described the pharmaceutical pact as “historic” and said the US and UK would “continue to work towards full implementation” of the broader trade framework.

The company filed paperwork with the SEC to move its legal home from Delaware to Texas, effective December 15. This Coinbase Texas incorporation shift is more than just a change of address; it’s a strategic decision with potential ripple effects for the crypto giant and the industry it helps lead. What Does the Coinbase Texas Incorporation Actually Mean? First, let’s clarify what “state of incorporation” entails. A company’s state of incorporation is its legal birthplace. It determines which state’s corporate laws govern its internal affairs, like shareholder rights and director duties. For decades, Delaware has been the default choice for major U.S. corporations due to its well-established court system. Therefore, Coinbase’s move to Texas is a notable departure from tradition. The company was quick to assure stakeholders that the change is purely administrative. In its SEC filing, Coinbase stated the move “will not affect the company’s business, operations, or the rights of its stockholders.” No physical offices are closing, and no jobs are moving solely because of this legal change. However, the timing and location are too specific to be purely coincidental. Why Would Coinbase Choose Texas Over Delaware? This is the central question for industry observers. While the official reason is administrative efficiency, the context provides clearer clues. The decision follows a period of intense regulatory scrutiny from federal agencies like the SEC, which is headquartered in the Northeast. Texas, in contrast, has positioned itself as a cryptocurrency-friendly hub . Here are the potential benefits driving this strategic Coinbase Texas incorporation : Regulatory Alignment: Texas state officials have been vocal supporters of blockchain innovation and digital assets, creating a potentially more sympathetic regulatory environment. Business Climate: Texas is known for its pro-business policies, lower taxes, and efforts to attract technology firms, which could offer long-term operational advantages. Symbolic Statement: The move can be seen as aligning the company’s legal identity with a region actively courting the crypto industry, a powerful signal to the market and policymakers. Are There Any Challenges or Risks with This Move? While the benefits seem clear, relocating a corporation’s legal home is not without its complexities. Changing the governing law for a company of Coinbase’s size involves meticulous legal work to ensure a seamless transition. Shareholder agreements, corporate bylaws, and existing contracts must all be reviewed under Texas law. Furthermore, Texas’s corporate legal framework, while robust, is less frequently tested for complex, modern issues like digital asset securities than Delaware’s Chancery Court. This could introduce uncertainty in future legal disputes. However, Coinbase’s legal team has likely weighed these factors, concluding that the strategic advantages of the Coinbase Texas incorporation outweigh the potential procedural hurdles. What This Means for the Future of Crypto in America Coinbase’s decision is a bellwether. When a publicly-traded industry leader makes such a calculated geographic shift, it sends a message. It highlights the growing tension between crypto businesses and certain federal regulatory approaches. It also underscores the “state competition” model, where states like Texas, Wyoming, and Florida vie to become the most attractive domicile for web3 companies. This move could encourage other crypto and fintech firms to reconsider their own legal footprints. If the Coinbase Texas incorporation proves successful, we may see a migration of corporate charters to states with clearer digital asset regulations. This decentralization of corporate governance could reshape the American financial technology landscape. Conclusion: A Strategic Pivot with Broad Implications Coinbase’s relocation of its incorporation to Texas is a multifaceted strategic play. On the surface, it’s a simple administrative update. In reality, it’s a confident step into a more supportive jurisdiction and a public relations maneuver that reinforces the company’s commitment to operating in a favorable regulatory climate. It demonstrates how crypto enterprises are proactively navigating the complex U.S. legal system to secure their future. This bold move is less about leaving Delaware and more about embracing a vision for growth anchored in Texas. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean Coinbase is moving its headquarters from Delaware to Texas? A: No. The state of incorporation is a legal designation, not the location of its physical headquarters or major offices. Coinbase’s main offices remain operational as before. Q: Will my Coinbase stock or account be affected? A: According to the company’s filing, no. Shareholder rights and account operations remain unchanged by this legal move. Q: Why is Delaware so popular for incorporation? A: Delaware has a specialized court (Chancery Court) for business disputes, a well-developed body of corporate law, and offers certain tax and privacy benefits for company management. Q: Is Texas becoming a hub for cryptocurrency companies? A: Yes, Texas has actively worked to attract crypto mining operations and blockchain businesses through favorable regulation and energy policies, positioning itself as a major crypto hub. Q: Could this move help Coinbase in its legal battles with the SEC? A> Not directly in federal cases. However, it situates the company’s internal governance under Texas law, which may be more favorable for certain corporate legal matters related to its crypto business model.

A wallet linked to its spot Ethereum ETF transferred a staggering 47,463 ETH, worth approximately $140 million, to Coinbase Prime. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a thunderous signal of deepening institutional commitment to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Let’s unpack what this massive move truly means. What Does This BlackRock ETH Deposit Actually Mean? First, let’s clarify the players. Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform for large institutions, offering secure custody and high-volume trading. Therefore, a BlackRock ETH deposit of this magnitude to such a venue is a clear operational move, not a casual trade. It strongly suggests BlackRock is preparing for increased activity related to its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This could involve seeding the ETF, facilitating creation/redemption processes, or simply securing assets in a trusted, institutional-grade environment. Why Is This a Game-Changer for Ethereum? BlackRock’s action is a powerful endorsement. When the world’s largest asset manager moves hundreds of millions in ETH, it validates Ethereum’s infrastructure and long-term viability for professional investors. This BlackRock ETH deposit contributes to a broader narrative of institutional adoption, which brings: Enhanced Liquidity: Large, stable holdings can improve market depth. Increased Legitimacy: It attracts more conservative capital from pensions and endowments. Price Stability Potential: While not guaranteed, long-term institutional holding can reduce volatile sell-side pressure. Moreover, this move comes amidst intense regulatory scrutiny of Ethereum itself. BlackRock’s confident deposit can be seen as a bet on a favorable regulatory outcome for ETH. What Challenges and Questions Remain? However, this bullish signal doesn’t erase all questions. The crypto market remains volatile, and regulatory clarity in the U.S. is still evolving. Furthermore, while a BlackRock ETH deposit is significant, it’s one piece of a complex puzzle. Market observers will now watch for: Follow-on deposits or withdrawals from the same address. Official comments or filings from BlackRock regarding its Ethereum strategy. The overall flow of institutional funds into crypto custodians like Coinbase Prime. The key insight is that institutions like BlackRock operate on a different timeline and risk calculus than retail traders. Their moves are strategic, not speculative. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers So, what should you take away from this news? Don’t view it as a short-term trading signal. Instead, see it as a fundamental shift in the market’s architecture. This BlackRock ETH deposit is a milestone in the maturation of crypto. It underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data for institutional wallets and understanding the infrastructure they use, like prime brokerages. The convergence of traditional finance and decentralized networks is accelerating. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption In summary, BlackRock’s $140 million BlackRock ETH deposit to Coinbase Prime is far more than a large transaction. It is a definitive statement. It signals robust institutional confidence, prepares the ground for a potential spot ETF, and strengthens Ethereum’s position as the leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized finance. While challenges persist, this move is a compelling chapter in the story of cryptocurrency growing up. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this BlackRock ETH deposit mean the spot Ethereum ETF is approved? A> Not directly. This is an operational preparation by BlackRock. The deposit could be for seeding the fund or securing assets in anticipation, but final ETF approval from the SEC is still pending. Q: Will this large deposit cause the price of ETH to go up? A> While it’s a strong positive signal, single transactions don’t guarantee immediate price action. It supports a bullish long-term narrative of institutional demand, but short-term prices depend on many broader market factors. Q: What is Coinbase Prime? A> Coinbase Prime is a specialized division of Coinbase that provides custody, trading, and prime brokerage services exclusively for institutional clients like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Q: How was this BlackRock ETH deposit identified? A> Blockchain analytics firms and on-chain data trackers (like Onchainlens, which reported this) monitor wallet addresses known to be associated with large institutions and flag significant movements. Q: Is my Ethereum on a regular exchange as safe as on Coinbase Prime? A> Coinbase Prime employs additional security protocols and insurance tailored for institutional-sized holdings. For most retail investors, standard Coinbase or self-custody is appropriate, but the security scales and requirements differ vastly for $140 million.

55872616,645439,1765886423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55872616.jpeg,OCC’s Approval Of Crypto Charters Faces Pushback From Banking Lobbyist Groups,https://bitcoinist.com/occs-approval-crypto-charters-pushback-banking/,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently sparked a wave of criticism from traditional finance groups following its approval of conditional bank charters for five cryptocurrency firms: Ripple, Circle, BitGo, Paxos, and Fidelity. Stablecoins Seen As Direct Threat Following the OCC’s announcement, industry stakeholders quickly voiced their concerns. Traditional banks expressed apprehension that these approvals stretch the definition and historical purpose of the national trust bank charter. Rebeca Romero Rainey, president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America, stated that the conditional approvals endanger consumers and create institutions that the OCC may not effectively manage. She further remarked that the new framework allows stablecoin operators access to the federal banking system without the rigorous capital and regulatory requirements that traditional banks must uphold. Todd Phillips, a professor at Georgia State University and former attorney with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also noted that stablecoins pose a direct threat to the conventional banking model. He remarked that banks are reacting aggressively to counter this emerging competition from stablecoins, which are perceived as encroaching on their market share. In defense of the OCC’s actions, Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould emphasized the benefits of new entrants in the federal banking sector , asserting that they would introduce fresh products and services while enhancing competition. He views this as a positive move for consumers and the broader banking industry. Banks Raise Alarm Over OCC’s Crypto Trust Charters One key difference between trust banks and conventional banks is their inability to accept deposits or make loans. Nonetheless, banks are wary that these newly chartered firms may venture beyond merely holding assets to back stablecoins. Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, expressed concern that this expansion of the trust charter blurs the lines defining banking activities and could lead to regulatory arbitrage. The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) also raised questions about the OCC’s approval process, urging transparency to help the public understand the rationale behind these decisions. Greg Baer, the BPI’s president and CEO, emphasized the need for clarity around the applications. The current conditional approvals for crypto trust banks present a more viable litigation landscape than earlier fintech charters, according to Andrew Grant, co-founder of Runway Group, a consultancy focused on financial technology. Many banks are reportedly unhappy about the momentum of the OCC’s recent decisions, suggesting they may take steps to introduce regulatory friction against these new entrants. Furthermore, the provisions of the GENIUS Act permit the establishment of national banks without deposit insurance, which complicates the ability of traditional banks to mount effective legal challenges against the approved cryptocurrency firms. Todd Baker, a senior fellow at the Richman Center for Business, Law and Public Policy at Columbia Business School, noted that while litigation may yield some restrictions on crypto-related activities, it is unlikely to impact stablecoin issuance, redemption, or custody.

On-chain data also revealed that unrealized losses for BTC whales have reached levels not seen since 2023. CryptoQuant also found that wallets that purchased BTC over the past three months recorded a profit/loss margin of -25%. The analytics firm acknowledged that a drop in the range of -12% to -37% historically led to bull run reversals. BTC’s drop shows short-term holders under pressure Short-Term Holders Under Pressure “Historically, prolonged periods in which STH remain at a loss tend to coincide with weak-hand cleansing phases and supply transfer toward higher-conviction holders.” – By @oro_crypto pic.twitter.com/SFomZxz2Hl — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 15, 2025 Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUCoin, said new whales exiting the market don’t automatically imply forced selling. He added that capitulation risk increases if Bitcoin loses cost-basis levels for recent buyers, especially around ETF or institutional entry zones . On-chain data revealed that Bitcoin’s sell-side pressure differs across all investor cohorts. The data signals a divergence between long-term and short-term holders. Short-term holders recorded a 30-day net position change of more than 768,000 BTC as of December 15. The increase shows a sign of accumulation in the markets. On-chain data also showed that the net position change for long-term holders was -755,000. The data signals distribution in the Bitcoin market. The supply held by long-term BTC holders has decreased by approximately 1.78 million BTC to 13.68 million BTC over the past four months. The supply held by the short-term holders has risen by approximately 1.8 million BTC to 6.28 million BTC since July. “The shift from long-term to short-term holders is a normal feature of late-cycle bull markets, reflecting profit-taking and capital rotation rather than outright stress.” -Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUCoin. Thakral also believes that the current BTC level looks less like a structural top and more like a classic wealth transfer phase. The analytics firm added that the shift from long-term to short-term holders sets the base for consolidation before the next leg higher. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is exchanging hands at around $86,331, down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. BTC has also plummeted more than 4.3% in the last 7 days and 10.45% in the last 30 days. CryptoQuant revealed that the realized price for Bitcoin short-term holders has remained at $104,000 since October 30, 2025. The analytics firm stated that there’s a significant divergence between the market price and the short-term capital cost basis, primarily due to the gap between Bitcoin’s price and the short-term realized price. On-chain data also revealed that short-term holders who have exited the market since October 30 saw realized losses. Short-term holders recorded an average high loss of around -12.6%, signaling an active capitulation process. CryptoQuant suggests that liquidations drove BTC’s price lower Bitcoin’s Price Drop Was Driven by Liquidations — Not Spot Selling “In this context, the current move should be viewed less as a collapse in fundamental demand and more as a structural deleveraging event.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/i1DSrt2Ttw — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 16, 2025 A report by XWIN Research Japan revealed that Bitcoin’s drop was driven less by spot market selling but by forced liquidations in the derivatives market. The research firm argued that Bitcoin’s drop was largely liquidation-led, as its sharp price drops coincided with spikes in long liquidations. The DeFi asset management platform noted that highly leveraged long positions in futures markets as the main cause of the liquidation-led market. XWIN Research Japan stated that a drop in BTC’s price below key levels leads to long positions being forcibly closed due to breaching maintenance margin requirements. The firm added that liquidations are set as market sell orders, which adds sudden selling pressure and causes the market to drop further. According to the report, liquidations also amplify the drop in falling prices by triggering a cascade of forced selling. CryptoQuant’s chart revealed a similar chain reaction occurring with Bitcoin. The analytics firm acknowledged that the current move should be considered less as a collapse in fundamental demand. CryptoQuant believes it should be viewed more as a structural deleveraging event.

After spending the past several weeks falling lower into the $0.13 price region, Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index on the weekly timeframe has reached levels that have only appeared a handful of times over the asset’s entire trading history. The observation, first highlighted by crypto analyst Cryptollica, revisits how Dogecoin has behaved the last few times this technical condition happened. A Rare Weekly RSI Signal In Dogecoin’s History Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index has dropped into a narrow zone around the 33 level, a condition that has appeared only four times over roughly eleven years of trading history. Each of those occasions aligned with periods where selling pressure had largely run its course, even though price action itself did not immediately reverse. Instead, these phases were marked by quiet accumulation. Related Reading: XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows, But Why Is Price Still Low? The Dogecoin chart highlights these moments clearly, with pronounced RSI dips into the lower band during 2015, 2020, and 2022. In each case, price followed a similar script: extended basing ranges formed after the RSI reached this level, laying the groundwork for the next sustained advance. Now in late 2025, Dogecoin’s RSI is again exhibiting this same structural behavior, and this places the current price action in a way that might play out bullish. Short-term oversold readings are relatively common as reversal indicators, but they often produce false starts. However, since this is on the weekly timeframe, this specific setup tends to emerge only during broader market resets and is much more reliable. During those resets, the RSI stabilized and rebounded from the 30 to 33 zone as price gradually transitioned from consolidation into a new uptrend. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: @Cryptollica On X What The Current RSI Setup Could Mean Going Forward As of mid-December 2025, Dogecoin is trading in the low-$0.13 to mid-$0.14 range, having slipped back below $0.14 that had been acting as short-term support in recent weeks. This price area has been volatile, with moves between roughly $0.13 and about $0.15, reflecting an ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers and a lack of decisive bullish momentum. The sellers are winning right now, with Dogecoin trading at $0.13, down by 5% in the past 24 hours and about to lose this price level. Related Reading: Silk Road Bitcoins Are On The Move Again, Is The BTC Price Ready For Another Dump? Nonetheless, the weekly RSI that’s currently at the usually significant zone adds additional context. It proposes a scenario where Dogecoin is about to reach a price bottom and buyers regain control in the coming weeks. However, considering that this is a weekly indicator, Dogecoin’s price action might continue to consolidate around this level for the next few weeks before any meaningful bounce takes place.

This innovative approach has made it incredibly accessible for anyone to launch a token with minimal barriers. The platform’s significance extends beyond simple token creation. It represents a fundamental shift in how liquidity is generated and distributed in decentralized finance. By automating the launch process and providing immediate liquidity, Pump.fun addresses one of the most persistent challenges in crypto: the liquidity problem for new projects. PUMP Tokenomics: Understanding the Fuel Behind the Platform To make an accurate Pump.fun price prediction, we must first understand its tokenomics. The PUMP token serves multiple critical functions within the ecosystem: Governance: Token holders can participate in platform decisions and future developments Fee Distribution: A portion of platform fees is distributed to PUMP stakers Access Tier: Higher tiers of platform features require PUMP token holdings Ecosystem Incentives: Rewards for liquidity providers and active participants The token’s utility creates inherent demand that could drive price appreciation as platform adoption grows. With a carefully designed emission schedule and deflationary mechanisms, PUMP’s tokenomics appear structured for sustainable growth rather than short-term speculation. Market Analysis: Current Position and Competitive Landscape Pump.fun operates in the highly competitive crypto launchpad space, but its specialization in meme coins gives it a unique niche. The platform’s success is closely tied to Solana’s overall performance and the continued popularity of meme coin culture within crypto communities.

PUMP Price Prediction 2026: The Medium-Term Outlook Looking toward 2026, several factors will influence PUMP’s price trajectory. Our analysis considers both platform-specific developments and broader market conditions: Platform Adoption: Continued growth in meme coin launches on Solana Solana Ecosystem: Overall health and expansion of Solana DeFi Regulatory Environment: Potential impacts on meme coins and launchpads Competitive Response: How other platforms adapt to Pump.fun’s model If current trends continue and Solana maintains its position as a leading blockchain for retail activity, PUMP could see significant appreciation by 2026. The token’s price will likely correlate strongly with platform usage metrics and total value locked. 2027-2030 Long-Term Forecast: Leading Solana’s DeFi Boom? The critical question for long-term investors is whether Pump.fun can transition from a meme coin launchpad to a comprehensive meme coin platform that offers additional services and features. Our 2027-2030 prediction considers several potential scenarios: In a bullish scenario where Solana becomes the dominant blockchain for retail DeFi activity and Pump.fun expands its offerings to include trading tools, analytics, and cross-chain capabilities, PUMP could achieve remarkable growth. The platform’s first-mover advantage in the Solana meme coin space provides a strong foundation for expansion. However, challenges remain. The meme coin market is notoriously volatile and subject to changing trends. Platform security, regulatory compliance, and technological scalability will all play crucial roles in determining whether Pump.fun can maintain its leadership position through the end of the decade. Risks and Challenges: What Could Derail the Prediction? No price prediction is complete without considering potential risks. For Pump.fun and the PUMP token, several factors could impact performance: Regulatory Pressure: Increased scrutiny on meme coins and launchpads Security Vulnerabilities: Platform exploits or smart contract risks Market Saturation: Too many similar platforms entering the space Solana Network Issues: Technical problems affecting the underlying blockchain Community Sentiment Shift: Changing attitudes toward meme coins Investors should monitor these risk factors closely and adjust their strategies accordingly. Diversification remains crucial when investing in specialized crypto platforms. Investment Strategy: How to Approach PUMP for Your Portfolio Based on our analysis, here are actionable insights for investors considering PUMP: Position Sizing: Given the specialized nature of the platform, consider PUMP as a satellite position rather than a core holding Entry Points: Look for accumulation opportunities during broader market corrections Monitoring Metrics: Track platform usage, total value locked, and Solana network activity Exit Strategy: Define clear profit-taking levels based on your investment horizon Remember that investing in platform tokens like PUMP involves additional risks compared to more established cryptocurrencies. The token’s value is directly tied to platform success, making thorough due diligence essential. FAQs: Answering Your Pump.fun Questions What makes Pump.fun different from other launchpads? Pump.fun specializes exclusively in meme coin launches on Solana, offering an extremely low barrier to entry through its bonding curve mechanism. This focus allows it to capture a specific niche within the broader launchpad market. How does the PUMP token generate value? The PUMP token derives value from multiple utility functions including governance rights, fee sharing, platform access tiers, and ecosystem incentives. As platform usage grows, these utilities create natural demand for the token. Is Pump.fun associated with Solana Labs? While Pump.fun operates on the Solana blockchain and contributes to its ecosystem, it is an independent platform not directly affiliated with Solana Labs or its founder Anatoly Yakovenko . What are the main competitors to Pump.fun? Primary competitors include other Solana-based launchpads and decentralized exchanges like Raydium , as well as multi-chain platforms that have begun offering similar meme coin launch services. How secure is the Pump.fun platform? While the platform has implemented various security measures, all DeFi platforms carry inherent smart contract risks. Users should never invest more than they can afford to lose and should consider the experimental nature of such platforms. Conclusion: The Future of Pump.fun in Solana’s Ecosystem Pump.fun represents an intriguing case study in blockchain specialization and niche market capture. Our analysis suggests that while the platform faces significant challenges and operates in a volatile segment of the market, it has established a strong position within Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. The PUMP token’s future will depend heavily on the platform’s ability to evolve beyond its current offerings and navigate the complex regulatory and competitive landscape. For investors, PUMP offers exposure to both the meme coin phenomenon and Solana’s broader DeFi growth. However, this exposure comes with elevated risk that must be carefully managed. As with all cryptocurrency investments, thorough research, proper position sizing, and risk management are essential.

Price volatility has returned, sentiment is divided, and traders are watching key levels with growing intensity. After months of sharp rallies, corrections, and consolidation, the token is approaching a phase where fear and opportunity tend to overlap. Historically, this is where decisive moves are born. Against this backdrop, a bold forecast circulating across crypto social media has reignited debate. Crypto Bull, a widely followed technical analyst on X, recently shared a forward-looking XRP outlook that is gaining traction among market participants. His projection outlines a near-term downside phase before a powerful upside expansion unfolds over the coming year. #XRP will drop to $1.75, then rise to $16 by end of January, 2026. You read it here first. pic.twitter.com/uGOUhDolvC — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 15, 2025 Short-Term Weakness and Market Structure Crypto Bull’s analysis places strong emphasis on market structure rather than emotion. According to his assessment, XRP remains vulnerable to a final corrective move toward the $1.75 region . This level aligns with historically significant liquidity zones and prior consolidation ranges on higher timeframes. From a technical perspective, such a pullback would not invalidate the broader bullish trend. Instead, it would represent a reset phase designed to remove late leverage and weak hands. Similar corrective moves have occurred in previous XRP cycles before major price expansions followed. Why a Deep Pullback Could Be Constructive The projected dip is framed as a structural necessity, not a breakdown. XRP has already experienced rapid appreciation during the current cycle, and sustained rallies rarely occur without deeper retracements . A move to $1.75 would also coincide with key Fibonacci retracement levels monitored by institutional and algorithmic traders. Market data continues to show strong long-term holding behavior, with large wallets maintaining positions despite volatility. This suggests that downside moves are increasingly viewed as accumulation opportunities rather than exit points. The Case for a $16 XRP by January 2026 Looking beyond the correction, Crypto Bull’s outlook turns decisively bullish. His longer-term projection targets a potential rise toward $16 by the end of January 2026 , contingent on cycle continuation and broader market strength. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This forecast is supported by historical XRP cycle behavior, where explosive rallies often follow extended consolidation and final shakeouts. It also aligns with expectations of renewed capital inflows into high-liquidity altcoins once Bitcoin dominance peaks. Fundamental Tailwinds Supporting the Thesis Beyond technicals, XRP’s fundamentals remain materially stronger than in prior cycles. Ripple’s expanding payment corridors, growing institutional partnerships, and increased clarity following the conclusion of its legal battle with the SEC have reshaped XRP’s market profile. Additionally, the maturation of on-chain liquidity solutions and stablecoin infrastructure has improved XRP’s utility narrative. These factors provide a stronger foundation for sustained upside if market conditions cooperate. Final Thoughts While no price prediction is guaranteed, Crypto Bull’s projection reflects a disciplined, cycle-based approach rather than hype-driven optimism. A temporary drop to $1.75 may test investor conviction, but history shows that XRP’s most aggressive rallies often begin when sentiment is weakest. As always, market participants are advised to monitor price action closely and separate long-term structure from short-term noise.

Visa will settle transactions over Solana, and it will back Circle’s coming Arc blockchain once that network goes live. Visa has run tests abroad before this shift, but this rollout is the first time the company is wiring stablecoin settlement into U.S. banks. Trump signed a federal stablecoin framework in July, and that law cleared the path for institutions to use fiat-backed digital dollars for domestic and cross-border payments. Circle’s token is backed by dollar assets like Treasuries, giving banks a way to move money without actually touching traditional clearing rails that usually take days. Expanding stablecoin settlement inside U.S. banks Luca Cosentino, Cross River’s senior vice president of product, said demand from fintech and crypto companies is rising fast. “There’s a new wave of demand coming from these fintech, crypto clients that are serving these new use cases, and for us, that demand is very big,” Luca said . Companies are shipping payment cards tied to stablecoin balances, letting users spend digital dollars while merchants receive local currency. Banks see this setup as a way to pull in new clients. Luca said the ability to settle card flows in stablecoins will help banks lure startups that need faster settlement for global users. Long term, he said stablecoins will be a “no-brainer capability that will be increasingly adopted.” Stablecoins are built to hold a steady value, and USDC stays tied to the U.S. dollar through one-to-one reserves. That structure is drawing big payment companies into the race. Analysts predict that stablecoins could handle more than $50 trillion in yearly payment flows by 2030. Mastercard said in April it would let merchants take stablecoin payments, and Fortune reported in October that the company is in talks to buy crypto infrastructure firm Zero Hash. Driving settlement growth across networks Traditional banks have become more open about stablecoin plans this year as Trump eased federal pressure on digital assets. Visa partnered earlier this year with Stripe on a tool called Bridge, giving fintechs a way to launch stablecoin card programs across several countries at once. It started in Latin America, where demand is concentrated because many local currencies swing sharply week to week. Stablecoin rails also cut settlement times. Legacy payment rails can take up to three business days on Visa’s network. Blockchains settle around the clock, including weekends. Visa reported $3.5 billion in annualized stablecoin settlement volume as of November 30. The number is growing fast, but it is still small next to the $17 trillion handled across the wider Visa network last year. Visa now wants to anchor itself as the main settlement partner for companies building on stablecoins. The company launched a global advisory practice this week to guide banks, merchants, and fintechs that want to use digital-dollar rails. Visa is also pushing its tokenized asset platform, which lets financial institutions issue fiat-backed tokens for their own programs. The company is betting that stablecoins will sit at the center of payment flows in the years ahead. And with U.S. banks finally cleared to use them, Visa is moving early to lock in its spot.

55872956,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245871,1765887011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: Visa Launches USDC Payment Services for US Banks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/visa-usdc-payment-services-banks/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Move: Visa Launches USDC Payment Services for US Banks In a groundbreaking development for digital finance, Visa has announced it will provide USDC payment services for U.S. banks. This strategic move connects traditional banking with cryptocurrency stability, potentially transforming how Americans handle digital transactions. The service leverages Circle’s USDC stablecoin, offering banks a regulated bridge to the growing world of digital assets. What Are Visa’s New USDC Payment Services? Visa’s new offering represents a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. The financial giant will enable U.S. banks to integrate USDC transactions into their existing payment infrastructure. This means customers could soon use stablecoins for everyday banking activities through their trusted financial institutions. The service builds on Visa’s existing cryptocurrency partnerships and technological infrastructure. According to reports from Unfolded on X, this initiative specifically targets the U.S. banking sector initially. The timing coincides with increasing regulatory clarity and institutional interest in digital assets. Why Does This Matter for Traditional Banking? This development matters because it addresses several key challenges in digital finance. First, it provides banks with a compliant pathway into cryptocurrency services. Second, it offers customers the stability of USDC while maintaining familiar banking relationships. Third, it could accelerate adoption by reducing technical barriers for financial institutions. The benefits for banks considering these services include: Reduced transaction costs compared to traditional cross-border payments Faster settlement times through blockchain technology New revenue streams from cryptocurrency-interested customers Competitive positioning in the evolving financial landscape How Will USDC Integration Work Practically? Practically speaking, Visa’s USDC payment services will likely function as a layer between traditional banking systems and blockchain networks. Banks can offer USDC wallets to customers, enable conversions between fiat and USDC, and process transactions through Visa’s network. This approach maintains regulatory compliance while providing cryptocurrency benefits. The implementation follows Visa’s established pattern of partnering with cryptocurrency companies. Circle, as the issuer of USDC, brings regulatory compliance and technical expertise to the partnership. This collaboration creates a trustworthy ecosystem for banks hesitant about entering cryptocurrency independently. What Challenges Might Banks Face? Despite the exciting potential, banks will encounter several challenges when adopting these services. Regulatory compliance remains complex, with different states having varying cryptocurrency regulations. Technical integration requires significant investment in new systems and staff training. Additionally, customer education will be crucial for successful adoption. However, Visa’s established position in payments helps address these concerns. Their experience with global compliance frameworks provides banks with confidence. Their technical infrastructure reduces implementation complexity. Their brand recognition helps with customer trust and adoption. The Future of Banking with Stablecoins Looking forward, Visa’s USDC payment services could fundamentally change banking relationships. Customers might maintain hybrid accounts with both fiat and USDC balances. International transactions could become nearly instantaneous and significantly cheaper. Small businesses could benefit from more efficient payment processing. This development represents more than just another cryptocurrency partnership. It signals a maturation of digital assets into practical financial tools. As more banks adopt these services, we may see accelerated innovation in financial products and services built on stablecoin foundations. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Digital Finance Visa’s decision to offer USDC payment services marks a watershed moment in financial technology evolution. By bridging traditional banking with cryptocurrency stability, they create practical pathways for mainstream adoption. This move validates stablecoins as legitimate financial instruments while providing banks with tools to compete in the digital age. The success of these services will depend on bank adoption rates, regulatory developments, and customer response. However, the direction is clear: digital assets are becoming integrated into traditional finance, with major players like Visa leading the charge toward practical implementation. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are Visa’s USDC payment services? Visa’s USDC payment services enable U.S. banks to offer customers the ability to transact using Circle’s USDC stablecoin through existing banking infrastructure and Visa’s payment network. Which banks will offer these services first? Visa hasn’t announced specific bank partners yet, but the service is designed for U.S. banks generally. Adoption will likely begin with banks already exploring cryptocurrency services. How is USDC different from other cryptocurrencies? USDC is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, making it less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Each USDC is backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. Will customers need special accounts for USDC transactions? Banks will likely integrate USDC capabilities into existing accounts or offer specialized digital asset accounts, depending on their implementation approach and regulatory requirements. Are these services available internationally? Initially, Visa is focusing on U.S. banks, but successful implementation could lead to international expansion following regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions. How does this affect traditional banking fees? USDC transactions typically have lower costs than traditional cross-border payments, but banks will determine specific fee structures based on their business models and competitive positioning.

55873481,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=31342,1765887565,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,"Oxidizing Kraken, Part 2: from bet to backbone",https://blog.kraken.com/product/engineering/rust-part-2-from-bet-to-backbone,"It’s time to tell how that early bet became the default way we build backend systems, what we learned about scaling people and software together, and how new AI tools are influencing how we build today. Goals and outcomes Large-scale rewrites rarely end well. They drift, they stall, and they often never finish because some last piece of legacy code holds everything together. Our story turned out differently. Despite constraints and a constant balancing act among new features, compliance, and technical remediation, we completed the effort. The result isn’t perfect (Is a six-year-old codebase ever perfect?), but it’s a solid foundation that enables us to expand, delegate, and accelerate. We now have millions of lines of Rust across hundreds of services, and our engineering organization has grown beyond 200 people. We achieved what we set out to do, and more. We minimized the opportunity cost of the rewrite by growing the Rust stack opportunistically. As our PHP stack became harder to evolve, we shipped new features in Rust. This kept our time to market largely unchanged: the time invested in the rewrite was offset by the increasingly slow PHP product updates caused by technical debt. The rewrite progressed through our product roadmap, not beside it. We did take detours to rebuild entire subsystems, but those were unavoidable and quickly paid for themselves once those paths ran on Rust. Performing under pressure Late 2020 and early 2021 were defining. The bull run pushed every system to its limits. We faced connection storms and blocking I/O saturating our PHP services. Because we had already invested in Rust foundations, we could respond quickly: migrating our REST APIs to async Rust based on Tokio. That move unlocked reuse across layers and drastically simplified the stack. Together with improvements to our C++ trading engine, it helped make Kraken one of the most performant exchanges – not only at low-latency trading, but across every user-facing system. That snappiness is now part of our identity. Architecture and design: team and system as one A team and the software it builds are symbiotic, like a tree and its environment. Our legacy codebase contained years of tacit, tribal knowledge — intricate logic understood by only a handful of engineers. The rewrite gave us a chance to rediscover, document, and share that knowledge, transforming it from individual expertise into collective understanding. This alignment around a coherent architectural vision brought consistency across the stack, making it far easier for engineers to navigate and contribute beyond their immediate domains. That level of cross-collaboration wasn’t feasible before, and while deep expertise still matters, it now exists within a shared, accessible framework. That foundation has become a cornerstone of our engineering culture. To scale both teams and capacity, we decoupled monoliths and moved toward an event-driven architecture, powered by an in-house stream-processing framework for Kafka written in Rust. This design supports autonomy, composability, and observability — with clear boundaries and strong contracts. Past the honeymoon Six years in, we’re long past the honeymoon phase with Rust: it has become an afterthought. Day to day, we talk more about our Tokio-based ecosystem than the language itself: shared crates, testing frameworks, metrics, tracing, and service scaffolding. Rust is now the platform we stand on, not the topic of debate. Explore open engineering roles at Kraken A pragmatic multi-language strategy Rust is our primary backend language by a wide margin with several million lines across hundreds of core services, and hundreds of engineers working with it daily. But we don’t optimize for uniformity at all costs. We privilege velocity and autonomy. Different problems call for different tools, and teams retain the freedom to move fast — as long as they speak the same protocol. That protocol is gRPC (Protobuf). We standardize internal service communication on gRPC, ensuring clean interoperability across Rust, C++, Go, Python, and TypeScript (Node.js). We define protobufs once, generate idiomatic clients and servers for every supported stack, and everything else — tracing, retries, deadlines, observability — follows automatically. This allows teams to interoperate seamlessly regardless of implementation language. Our default stack is Rust – Tokio-based, with internal libraries for I/O, RPC, storage, and telemetry. We still rely on C++ for ultra-hot paths like our trading engine. Go, Python, and TypeScript each have their place when their ecosystems or ergonomics make more sense. The contract is gRPC; the SLOs, observability, and security posture are the same. This gives us autonomy without chaos: teams pick the right tool, but all services share the same contract. Why Rust kept paying dividends The ideas that drove our early adoption of Rust continue to prove themselves in production: Reliability by construction: ownership and borrowing eliminate entire classes of memory and concurrency bugs before they ship Fewer heisenbugs: those elusive defects that change behavior when observed rarely survive Rust’s compile-time checks. Failure modes by design: explicit error semantics makes errors first class constructs, not an afterthought. Reuse at scale: a shared runtime enables common crates for codecs, auth, metrics, and configuration, compounding leverage across teams. Less toil, more velocity: as keeping-the-lights-on costs dropped, we reinvested that time into faster product delivery. The journey wasn’t without detours. We sometimes had to pause and rebuild subsystems from scratch, and those moments carried real cost. We also encountered periods of dependency hell, caused by poorly defined internal boundaries and API surfaces that pulled implementation details into shared crates. Those challenges weren’t Rust-specific — they’re familiar to anyone scaling a fast-moving system — but they taught us to design clearer contracts and isolation boundaries. Still, Rust brings a level of precision to business logic that remains invaluable. Years later, when we revisit code to trace an encoding or clarify a critical data path, that precision is a godsend. The intent of the code is explicit, and the invariants are enforced by the compiler itself. The payoff has been lasting: stability, clarity, and confidence across the stack. Coding in Rust with AI assistants AI coding assistants have become a practical part of our workflow. They understand and write Rust, help navigate large codebases, and explain idioms inline. Engineers use them in different ways — some as pair-programming companions, others through more structured, spec-driven approaches. However they’re used, they make coding faster and reduce friction in day-to-day development. Rust’s design makes it particularly compatible with AI tools. Its strong type system, borrow checker, and compiler hints provide clear feedback that helps these assistants generate better, safer code. AI helps with scaffolding, tests, and exploration, while Rust ensures that what lands in the codebase is correct and maintainable. The combination improves productivity without compromising quality. People and culture Rust has been a magnet for engineers who value correctness, performance, and clarity. It attracts people who take ownership, think systematically, and care about building durable systems. With a consistent stack and shared idioms, we’ve built a culture where engineers collaborate across domains, review each other’s work effectively, and share responsibility for quality. We hire for fundamentals, curiosity, and the drive to improve. Prior Rust experience helps but isn’t required; what matters most is the ability to reason about systems, write secure and maintainable code, and deliver with integrity. AI tools make onboarding smoother and help new hires ramp up quickly, but great engineering still comes from rigor, collaboration, and care. Our mission goes beyond building reliable infrastructure: Kraken exists to accelerate the global adoption of crypto so more people can achieve financial freedom and inclusion. You can read more in the Kraken Culture Explained page. That mission shapes how we work and who we hire. As Krakenites, we default to transparency, directness, and radical ownership; we value integrity over titles, clarity over ceremony, and long-term thinking over shortcuts. We operate with trust and autonomy, bias for action, and an expectation that everyone brings both judgment and humility to the table. On top of that culture, we build a broad and ambitious product ecosystem: Kraken app and the main Kraken website , offering intuitive trading experiences and flexible placement strategies Krak app and the Krak Card , our crypto-native global money and debit card experience Kraken Pro app and our Kraken Pro advanced trading interface , which deliver powerful trading tools, analytics, and portfolio management Kraken Institutional including Kraken Prime , which provides qualified custody, OTC services, and specialized workflows for professional clients, and much more — all powered by our Kraken Platform. This environment rewards a shared mindset: precision, accountability, and pride in our work. Rust reinforces those values by demanding rigor, and our people carry them forward by building with purpose and trust. We’re always looking for engineers who share that mindset and want to grow with us. The new default What began as a technical refresh has become much more than that. Rust is now the foundation of how we build and think—quietly enabling performance, safety, and velocity while letting teams focus on product and impact. The platform we built together has become the backbone of our systems, but more importantly, the shared discipline and culture around it have become part of who we are as engineers. We’ve proven that large-scale rewrites can succeed, that a pragmatic multi-language strategy can stay coherent, and that great teams keep evolving with their tools. The work continues – refining, scaling, and welcoming new engineers who share our curiosity and standards. If you’re one of them, come build the next chapter with us .

This isn’t science fiction—it’s the revolutionary reality being created by Everbloom, a startup using artificial intelligence to transform textile waste into premium fibers. In an industry where sustainability often comes with premium prices, Everbloom’s breakthrough promises to disrupt fashion with affordable, eco-friendly materials that could change how we think about luxury textiles forever. How Everbloom AI is Revolutionizing Sustainable Fashion The fashion industry faces a critical dilemma: growing demand for luxury materials like cashmere clashes with environmental sustainability. Traditional cashmere production requires specific goat breeds that produce only 4-6 ounces annually per animal, creating supply chain pressures that lead to unsustainable practices. Everbloom’s solution? An AI-powered material science platform called Braid.AI that creates premium fibers from waste materials. This technology represents a fundamental shift in how we approach textile production, moving from resource extraction to intelligent upcycling. The Textile Waste Crisis and Everbloom’s Solution Global textile waste has reached alarming levels, with millions of tons ending up in landfills annually. Everbloom addresses this crisis by targeting waste streams containing keratin—the protein found in cashmere, wool, and feathers. Their process begins with collecting waste from various sources: Cashmere and wool farms Textile mills and manufacturing facilities Down bedding suppliers Poultry industry feathers (future expansion) The collected waste undergoes a transformation process where it’s chopped, combined with proprietary compounds, and processed through standard textile manufacturing equipment. This approach ensures compatibility with existing industry infrastructure, making adoption practical for manufacturers. Creating Biodegradable Materials Through AI Innovation Everbloom’s most significant achievement lies in creating fully biodegradable materials that match or exceed traditional fiber quality. Their AI system, Braid.AI, fine-tunes multiple parameters to achieve specific fiber characteristics: Parameter Controlled Effect on Fiber Target Material Molecular structure Softness and texture Cashmere replacement Fiber diameter Warmth and weight Wool alternatives Chemical composition Durability and dye uptake Polyester substitutes Processing temperature Strength and elasticity Various textiles “All the components we’re using are biodegradable,” says Sim Gulati, Everbloom’s CEO. The company is currently conducting accelerated testing to validate their materials’ environmental claims, potentially setting new standards for sustainable textiles. The Economics of Upcycled Cashmere Production Everbloom challenges the “sustainable premium” concept—the idea that eco-friendly products must cost more. Their business model demonstrates that sustainability and affordability can coexist. Key economic advantages include: Lower raw material costs using waste streams Compatibility with existing manufacturing equipment Reduced environmental compliance expenses Potential for premium pricing without premium production costs “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati explains. “In order for a material to be successful, you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product.” What Does This Mean for the Future of Fashion? Everbloom’s technology represents more than just another sustainable material—it signals a fundamental transformation in how we produce textiles. The implications extend far beyond cashmere: Supply Chain Transformation: Moving from resource-intensive extraction to circular waste utilization Quality Preservation: Maintaining luxury fiber characteristics without animal welfare concerns Industry Accessibility: Making sustainable materials available at various price points Environmental Impact: Dramatically reducing fashion’s carbon and water footprint The startup has already raised over $8 million from investors including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV , indicating strong confidence in their approach from the venture capital community. Frequently Asked Questions What is Everbloom’s main innovation? Everbloom has developed Braid.AI, an artificial intelligence system that transforms keratin-based waste (like chicken feathers and textile scraps) into premium fibers indistinguishable from materials like cashmere. How does Everbloom’s process work? The company collects waste materials, processes them with proprietary compounds, and uses standard textile manufacturing equipment to create new fibers. Their AI system fine-tunes the formulation and processing parameters to achieve specific material qualities. Are Everbloom’s materials truly biodegradable? According to CEO Sim Gulati , all components used are biodegradable. The company is conducting accelerated testing to scientifically validate these claims. Who are Everbloom’s investors? The startup has raised over $8 million from investors including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV . When will Everbloom’s materials be available commercially? While specific timelines aren’t provided, the company is actively developing partnerships and scaling production capabilities for broader market availability. The Transformative Power of AI in Sustainable Materials Everbloom’s breakthrough demonstrates how artificial intelligence can solve complex environmental challenges while creating economic value. By turning waste into luxury, they’re not just creating another sustainable material—they’re redefining what’s possible in fashion innovation. Their approach proves that sustainability doesn’t require compromise on quality, affordability, or scalability.

The payments giant will allow US financial institutions to settle transactions using Circle Internet Group Inc.’s USDC stablecoin over the Solana blockchain. Faster Settlement for U.S. Banks? By allowing USDC settlement, Visa said it is offering banks and fintechs faster funds movement over blockchain networks, seven-day availability, and improved resilience during weekends and holidays. Initial participants include Cross River Bank and Lead Bank, both of which are settling transactions with Visa in USDC over the Solana blockchain. Visa said broader availability for U.S. institutions is planned through 2026. Blockchain Infrastructure and Arc Partnership Visa said it is also deepening its collaboration with Circle by serving as a design partner for Arc, a new Layer 1 blockchain currently in public testnet. Arc is being built to support high-performance, large-scale commercial activity onchain. Visa plans to use Arc for USDC settlement within its network and intends to operate a validator node once the blockchain goes live, further integrating blockchain infrastructure into its core settlement processes. Modernizing Treasury and Liquidity Management According to Visa, U.S. stablecoin settlement allow seven-day settlement windows, improved liquidity management, and greater automation for participating banks. The framework is designed to bridge traditional payment rails with blockchain-based infrastructure while maintaining Visa’s standards for security, compliance, and reliability. “Financial institutions are preparing to use stablecoins as part of their treasury operations,” said Rubail Birwadker, Visa’s Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships. “USDC settlement gives banks a faster, programmable option that integrates with existing systems.” Building on a Global Stablecoin Track Record This latest U.S. launch builds on Visa’s earlier stablecoin settlement pilots across Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East and Africa. Visa began experimenting with USDC settlement in 2021 and became one of the first major payment networks to settle transactions in a stablecoin in 2023. Circle said the U.S. expansion represents a milestone for institutional adoption of stablecoins, while early banking partners highlighted benefits such as clearer liquidity timing and API-driven settlement. Visa said it will continue to expand its stablecoin capabilities and recently launched a Stablecoins Advisory Practice through Visa Consulting & Analytics to help financial institutions assess and implement stablecoin strategies. @Visa launches a stablecoin advisory service to help banks and fintechs navigate regulation and adoption as the market tops $300B. #Stablecoins #DigitalPayments https://t.co/9APTexHQ0X — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 15, 2025 Binance Blockchain Week Highlights Stablecoin Momentum Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week 2025, Binance CEO Richard Teng focused heavily on the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market, describing stablecoins as one of crypto’s most effective real-world use cases. He said global stablecoin market capitalisation climbed by nearly 50% this year, while the number of wallets holding stablecoins has also risen by around 50%. Teng highlighted transaction data as evidence that stablecoins are moving firmly into the financial mainstream. He noted that daily stablecoin transaction volumes have now surpassed those processed by Visa. Teng also attributed this growth to improving regulatory clarity, including recent progress in the US, and pointed to emerging-market initiatives such as Bhutan’s nationwide crypto payments system built on Binance Pay as examples of how stablecoins are increasingly being used as core payment infrastructure rather than speculative instruments.
