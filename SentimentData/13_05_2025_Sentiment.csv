Here’s What the Charts Suggest,https://bitzo.com/2025/05/can-near-and-render-regain-momentum-to-reclaim-january-highs-heres-what-the-charts-suggest,"NEAR and RENDER showed impressive gains earlier this year, but can they bounce back to those peak levels? Recent chart movements provide potential hints and signals of what's ahead for these cryptocurrencies. Readers will discover the technical indicators suggesting possible upward trends and the factors influencing the future performance of these digital assets. NEAR Protocol Surge Amid Six-Month Pullback and Key Level Trade Opportunities Over the past month, NEAR Protocol recorded a notable 53.40% increase, alongside a 37.94% weekly boost, showcasing a sharp recovery in the short term. Despite this, the coin experienced a significant 40.10% decline over the last six months, reflecting difficulties in its longer-term trend. Price movements indicate rapid gains occurring within an overall context of downward pressure. The current price fluctuates between $1.944 and $2.858, with support around $1.42 and resistance at $3.25. Recent gains have been driven by bulls, but there is no clear trend as bears remain active near resistance. Trading strategies may include cautious buying at support and potential selling near resistance should momentum weaken. Upward Surge Amid Wider Volatility and Cautious Momentum Last month, RENDER saw a significant surge of about 43.59%, while the six-month performance decreased by approximately 26.02%. This indicates a mixed trend, with short-term gains near 23.90% suggesting some bullish energy despite the longer-term downturn. The price movements reveal a volatile pattern, with a quick monthly recovery contrasting with a broader decline seen over the half-year period. Recent fluctuations have attracted renewed attention, highlighting the dynamic nature of the market despite ongoing instability. Currently, RENDER trades between $3.06 and $5.33, facing immediate resistance at $6.18 and support at $1.65, with a second resistance level at $8.45. Bullish signals from a 65.67 RSI and positive momentum indicators suggest potential upward movement, though oscillators caution against overextending. Trading strategies should focus on buying near support while watching for opportunities to capitalize on breakouts or pullbacks near resistance levels. Conclusion The charts indicate potential signs of recovery for both NEAR and RENDER . Technical indicators show an upward trend might be forming. If buying pressure continues, these coins could challenge their January highs. Monitoring key support and resistance levels will be crucial. Both projects have strong fundamentals that may bolster investor confidence. Overall, the possibility exists for NEAR and RENDER to regain momentum, but sustained growth will depend on broader market conditions.

Currently trading at $1.05, THETA has rallied over 38.2% in the past month, signaling renewed market interest. The platform’s foundational dual-token model—with THETA for governance and TFUEL for operational use—continues to support content delivery networks and real-world utility. With a circulating supply of 1 billion tokens, a revitalized development roadmap, and strong industry partnerships, Theta’s consistent upward movement positions it as one of the best crypto assets to watch this quarter. While Theta has firmly established Itself, Qubetics ($TICS) represents the next big step in blockchain adoption. Built to close the gap between Web3 ideals and real-world application, Qubetics integrates tools that enhance privacy, utility, and economic efficiency. Its Decentralized VPN solution is particularly impactful, offering businesses, remote professionals, and digital-first participants a secure, scalable, and censorship-resistant way to access global services. With privacy becoming a core pillar of Web3 architecture, Qubetics delivers practical features that past-generation chains failed to address—making it a top contender for the best crypto to buy right now. At the same time, BNB is making headlines with institutional momentum and bullish forecasts. Priced at $616, BNB recently saw trading volume double to $753 million. The excitement follows VanEck’s proposal for a BNB ETF, which would allow institutions to access BNB while earning staking rewards. Backed by Binance’s unmatched infrastructure, BNB also caught attention from Standard Chartered, which forecasts a 360% increase to $2,775 by 2028. This projection underscores growing confidence in BNB’s long-term utility as the primary token powering Binance Smart Chain. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN Access and Unmatched Presale Traction Qubetics is emerging as the go-to network for community members seeking functionality and forward-compatible infrastructure. Its Decentralized VPN feature ensures encrypted, uninterrupted internet access—empowering users with censorship resistance and data protection without reliance on centralized intermediaries. For remote workers and enterprise users alike, this solution offers a powerful way to bypass geo-restrictions, secure sensitive data, and maintain performance across jurisdictions. Traditional VPNs lack the decentralization and transparency Qubetics enables. That distinction is quickly making it one of the best crypto to buy right now. The platform’s momentum is best reflected in its thriving presale. Stage 34 of the Qubetics presale is live, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.2532. To date, more than 512 million tokens have been sold to over 26,200 holders, raising over $16.9 million. Participants who entered at Stage 1 for $0.01 have already locked in a 2,432% return, a rare early-stage success story in today’s maturing digital asset space. Presale Performance and ROI Projections For those just discovering the project, it’s far from too late. Entering the crypto presale at the current $0.2532 price still presents compelling upside. A move to $1 would yield a 294% ROI, and if $TICS reaches $5, participants could see a 1,874% return. Analysts point to ROI potential as high as 5,822% if $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch. These figures highlight why Qubetics is consistently named among the best crypto to buy right now. Qubetics is also deploying platforms like QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE to support decentralized application development, further strengthening its long-term value and ecosystem depth. With active community engagement and real-world application at its core, $TICS is more than a token—it is a critical piece of the blockchain infrastructure of the future. Theta (THETA): The Engine Behind Decentralized Streaming Theta Network has long been a quiet performer with real-world use cases. It brings decentralization to video content delivery, challenging centralized models with more efficient and cost-effective alternatives. With THETA serving governance and TFUEL powering transaction fees and streaming rewards, the dual-token economy is engineered for performance and scalability. Currently trading at $1.05, Theta has rebounded sharply, up more than 38% month-over-month. While it’s still well below its all-time high of $15.90, technical indicators point to continued recovery, driven by ecosystem upgrades and partner integrations. Theta’s use case is both accessible and proven: content delivery, bandwidth sharing, and user-driven infrastructure. The token’s consistent progress and revival in market sentiment make it one of the best crypto to buy right now, particularly for backers seeking innovation outside of traditional finance. Theta delivers functional decentralization with active adoption, renewed price momentum, and real-world relevance in media and entertainment sectors. BNB: Institutional Adoption and Blockchain Dominance Binance Coin (BNB) is redefining what large-scale utility looks like in digital finance. The token is at the center of one of the largest blockchain ecosystems globally—Binance Smart Chain—and its usage spans trading fee discounts, staking, payments, and liquidity operations. As of May 2025, BNB is trading at $616 and gaining traction from both retail and institutional channels. Two major events are fueling the surge in market attention. First, Standard Chartered’s forecast projects a rise to $2,775 by 2028, a trajectory supported by Binance’s unparalleled dominance in global exchange volumes. Second, VanEck’s proposed BNB ETF introduces the potential for regulated, Wall Street-compatible exposure to BNB, along with staking rewards—an offering that could attract billions in institutional capital. Recent data shows that BNB’s daily volume has surged to $753 million, reflecting a significant uptick in activity and positioning. With critical infrastructure already in place, high-volume liquidity, and ecosystem-wide integration, BNB is a foundational asset for anyone serious about the digital economy. These developments reinforce its position as one of the best crypto to buy right now, especially for participants looking to engage in network utility and scalability. BNB combines unmatched utility, strategic market positioning, and institutional credibility, creating a compelling asset for the present and future market cycle. Final Thoughts Real momentum is forming across the digital asset landscape, and community members are increasingly aligning with projects that deliver measurable value. Theta is showing strong signs of revival, built on a working decentralized video ecosystem. BNB, backed by dominant infrastructure and the possibility of an SEC-approved ETF, is capturing both attention and capital. But it’s Qubetics that holds a unique position—offering a rare blend of early-stage access, real-world use cases, and rapid community growth. With its decentralized VPN, real-time application in digital privacy, and a presale currently in Stage 34, Qubetics offers substantial upside for early participants. Entry at $0.2532 can still deliver ROI ranging from 294% to 5,822%, depending on how post-launch performance unfolds. Time is a crucial factor, and those waiting on the sidelines may miss out as momentum builds into Stage 35. For backers searching for the best crypto to buy right now , the choice lies in identifying assets that combine innovation, scale, and timing. Qubetics, Theta, and BNB each fulfill these criteria—with Qubetics offering a particularly rare entry point still open.

For those following the intersection of cutting-edge tech and investment, Google’s latest move is significant. Google has announced a new initiative aimed squarely at fostering the next wave of innovation in AI. Google AI Launches New Investment Fund Google recently unveiled its AI Futures Fund. This initiative is designed to back startups that are leveraging the advanced AI tools developed by Google DeepMind, the company’s leading AI research and development lab. The fund signals Google’s commitment to supporting founders who are pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. The AI Futures Fund is structured to provide support across various stages of a startup’s growth, from early seed funding to later-stage rounds. This flexibility ensures that companies at different points in their journey can potentially benefit from Google’s resources and expertise. Support and Benefits for AI Startups Participation in the AI Futures Fund offers several key advantages for selected startups. These benefits go beyond just financial investment: Early Access to Google AI Models: Startups can gain early access to cutting-edge AI models from DeepMind, giving them a competitive edge in development. Expert Collaboration: Founders have the opportunity to work directly with experts from both DeepMind and Google Labs, tapping into deep technical knowledge. Google Cloud Credits: Access to Google Cloud resources is crucial for AI development, and the fund provides credits to help startups scale their operations. Direct Investment: Some companies will receive direct venture capital investment from Google, providing essential funding for growth. A Google spokesperson clarified that the fund operates on a rolling basis, meaning there are no fixed application windows or deadlines. Opportunities are considered as they arise for companies aligning with the fund’s goals. While a specific fund size wasn’t disclosed, check sizes will vary based on the startup’s stage and needs. Early Success Stories and Application Details The AI Futures Fund has already seen participation from several startups, serving as early case studies. Examples include Viggle, a platform focused on meme creation, and Toonsutra, a webtoon application. These examples highlight the diverse range of applications the fund is interested in supporting. Startups interested in applying for the AI Futures Fund can begin submitting their applications starting May 12. Google’s Broader Commitment to AI Investment The AI Futures Fund is part of a larger pattern of significant commitments Google has made to advance AI technology and talent.

Prior to that, in September, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a $120 million Global AI Opportunity fund aimed at expanding AI education and training worldwide. Google.org also launched a $20 million generative AI accelerator program specifically for nonprofits developing AI tech. Google also operates its Google for Startups Founders Funds, which supports founders across various industries, including AI.

Stablecoins have become a “political hot potato” ahead of next month’s presidential elections, South Korean media outlets wrote on May 12. Aju Kyungjae quoted the Bank of Korea (BOK) as stating that it alone should have the legal authority to approve plans to launch a won-based stablecoin. South Korean Central Bank: Stablecoin Showdown Ahead? Koh Kyung-chul, the head of the BOK’s electronic finance unit, explained: “Stablecoins would have a significant impact on the implementation of central bank policies such as monetary policy and financial stability, as well as payments and settlements.” The Bank of Korea, in downtown Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Otraff [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The bank official added that the BOK should be involved from the “initial” stage. This will ensure that “any negative impact on central bank policy is minimized,” Koh said. Koh added that the BOK should also be granted input should lawmakers decide to create stablecoin-related legislation. The official explained: “Legislation design is important. This will help build a stable and sustainable digital payment ecosystem.” The BOK appears to be concerned that a won-pegged stablecoin could replace the demand for legal currency. This, it worries, could have a significant knock-on effect for monetary policy. Bank officials say they are aware that US dollar-pegged stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are already being used in place of the dollar in cross-border trade operations. The central bank has already spoken about stablecoins at length this year. In its payment and settlement report last month, the BOK warned: “Stablecoins can infringe upon monetary sovereignty and undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy. A careful review is necessary before they are approved.” Earlier this month, the BOK Governor Lee Chang-yong issued another stablecoin warning. The Governor said that USDT “and other stablecoins” would “likely bypass South Korean capital regulations and foreign exchange regulations.” Lee Chang-yong concluded that stablecoin regulation “is an urgent matter.” However, the presidential frontrunner and Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung recently claimed that South Korea “must create a won-based stablecoin market.” The DP leader spoke about KRW-pegged coins. He said that South Korea must “enter the stablecoin market quickly” or risk an “outflow of national wealth.” Seoul shares open higher on hopes for US-China trade deal #Kospi #Kosdaq #stocks #updates https://t.co/Tfr4Vw6HPx — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) May 12, 2025 ‘Terra Collapse Should Serve as a Warning’ Lee Jae-myung’s comments sparked a backlash from Lee Jun-seok, the candidate for the Reform Party. The latter accused the DP candidate of making “dangerous and experimental” economic promises. He also said that Lee Jae-myung had failed to learn the lessons of the calamitous collapse of the Terra ecosystem and its KRW-pegged stablecoin in May 2022. Lee Jun-seok said that his rival was “bandying plausible-sounding words” like “stablecoin” about “without understanding anything about the market.” Several Lee Jae-myung allies have jumped to the frontrunner’s defence. An ex-DP MP accused the Reform Party leader of failing to “familiarize himself with the basic concepts of global financial regulation.” South Korea’s ruling conservatives opted for a right-wing candidate as the official campaign for the presidential election kicked off https://t.co/Y0hXiJQ0SS — Bloomberg (@business) May 12, 2025 Should Lee Jae-myung win power on June 3, he and his party may find themselves at loggerheads with the BOK. The DP lawmaker Min Byung-deok last month unveiled a private member’s bill entitled the Digital Asset Basic Act (literal translation). Min’s bill stipulates that the regulatory Financial Services Commission, not the BOK, should be given the sole authority to approve stablecoin issuances.

LTC price has approached the final major resistance in its journey towards retesting the all-time high. Litecoin (LTC) price opened the third week of May 2025 in a bullish outlook, after rallying more than 23 percent last week. The veteran altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.77 billion, gained around 2.4 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $102 on Monday, 2025 during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which led to over $709 in net liquidations today, nearly $2 million involved LTC leveraged trades. Furthermore, Litecoin’s futures open interest surged over 9 percent in the last 24 hours to hover about $691 million at the time of this writing. Litecoin Records Robust Fundamentals As one of the top-tier altcoin that is secured through the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, the Litecoin network has attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors. According to on-chain data analysis, the Litecoin network continued to process over 1 million transactions per week, thus having processed over 25 million transactions year-to-date. Meanwhile, institutional investors, led by fund managers, continue to press to offer regulated Litecoin’s investment products such as ETFs and ETPs. Last week, Valor Inc., a digital asset management wing firm for DeFi Technologies, unveiled LTC’s ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. In the United States, several fund managers, led by Canary Capital, continue to pressure the U.S. SEC to approve Litecoin ETFs soon. LTC Price Eyes ATH Following a successful rebound from a multi-year rising logarithmic trend in the past few weeks, LTC price has approached a crucial liquidity zone of around $107. Since the Litecoin network undertook its third halving on August 2, 2023, LTC price has mostly consolidated below $107 to date. However, LTC’s macro-bullish momentum has gained significant traction in the recent past. In the weekly timeframe, LTC’s MACD line is almost crossing the Signal line amid growing bullish histograms. A consistent close above $107 will propel LTC price toward its all-time high in the subsequent weeks. However, a possible rejection at about $107 will lead to another correction towards the support level of about $81.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 23:30:08
44543781,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159657,1747092629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto.com Dubai Partnership: Pioneering Public Service Crypto Payments,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-com-dubai-payments/,"Get ready for a significant leap forward in how you interact with government services in one of the world’s most forward-thinking cities! The news is official: Crypto.com has joined forces with Dubai Finance (DOF) to enable cryptocurrency payments for public service fees. This isn’t just a technical integration; it’s a bold statement about Dubai’s commitment to embracing the future of finance and solidifying its position as a global hub for innovation and the digital economy. For anyone interested in the intersection of blockchain technology, government services, and major financial centers, the Crypto.com Dubai partnership is a game-changer. What Does the Crypto.com Dubai Partnership Entail? At its core, this collaboration is about making everyday interactions with government services more accessible and aligned with the evolving digital landscape. The partnership, announced via Dubai government media, leverages Crypto.com’s robust payment infrastructure to facilitate transactions using various cryptocurrencies. This means that residents, tourists, and businesses in Dubai holding supported digital assets will soon have the option to pay for a range of public services without needing to convert their crypto into traditional fiat currency beforehand for these specific payments. The key players are clear: Crypto.com: A major global cryptocurrency platform known for its exchange, wallet, and payment solutions. They bring the technical expertise and infrastructure to process crypto transactions securely and efficiently. Dubai Finance (DOF): The government entity responsible for managing Dubai’s financial affairs, including the collection of public revenues. Their involvement is crucial for integrating crypto payment options into the official payment systems. This isn’t merely an experiment; it signifies a strategic move by Dubai to integrate digital currencies into its operational framework, reflecting a broader vision for a cashless and digitally-driven economy. The focus is on providing convenience and choice while maintaining the necessary financial controls and transparency required for government transactions. Enabling Dubai Crypto Payments: A Step Towards Digital Maturity The ability to make Dubai crypto payments for public services marks a significant milestone. Historically, government payments have been one of the last frontiers for digital transformation, often relying on traditional banking systems or physical cash. By opening the door to cryptocurrency, Dubai is not only catering to the growing number of individuals and entities that hold digital assets but also streamlining payment processes. Consider the potential benefits: Increased Convenience: For crypto holders, paying directly in crypto eliminates the steps and potential fees associated with converting crypto to fiat. Efficiency: Digital payments, including crypto, can often be processed faster than traditional methods, potentially reducing administrative delays. Attracting Innovation: Offering crypto payment options reinforces Dubai’s image as a tech-friendly city, potentially attracting more blockchain companies and talent. Transparency (for some): While the end-to-end transparency of public finance is complex, the nature of blockchain transactions can offer a verifiable record of payment initiation. This move aligns perfectly with Dubai’s broader digital transformation agenda, which aims to make government services seamless, smart, and user-centric. Integrating Dubai crypto payments is a logical extension of this vision, pushing the boundaries of how citizens and businesses interact with public administration. The Vision Behind Crypto Adoption Dubai Dubai hasn’t been shy about its ambitions in the digital asset space. The emirate has actively sought to become a global leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency. This includes establishing regulatory bodies like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and creating special economic zones designed to attract crypto businesses. The crypto adoption Dubai strategy is multi-faceted, aiming to foster innovation, create jobs, and diversify the economy. Allowing crypto payments public services is a tangible outcome of this strategy. It demonstrates that the government is not just regulating the space but is also willing to adopt the technology itself. This sends a strong signal to the global crypto community that Dubai is serious about integrating digital assets into its financial ecosystem at a fundamental level. Key aspects of Dubai’s crypto vision include: Area Dubai’s Approach Regulation Developing clear frameworks (e.g., VARA) to provide certainty for businesses and investors. Infrastructure Encouraging the establishment of crypto exchanges, custodians, and service providers. Adoption Exploring use cases in real estate, tourism, and now, public services. Talent Attracting skilled professionals and entrepreneurs in the blockchain space. This partnership with Crypto.com is a concrete example of how Dubai is putting its vision for crypto adoption Dubai into practice, moving beyond theoretical discussions to practical implementation that impacts everyday life and business. How Will Crypto Payments Public Services Work in Practice? While the full technical details of the implementation are still emerging, the partnership suggests a streamlined process. Users are likely to interact with the existing government service portals or payment systems, where a new option for cryptocurrency payment will be presented. Upon selecting this option, they would likely be directed to a Crypto.com payment gateway or interface. Here’s a simplified potential flow: User accesses a Dubai government service portal to pay a fee (e.g., for a license renewal, utility bill, or fine). At the payment stage, the user selects ‘Pay with Cryptocurrency’. The system calculates the equivalent value of the fee in supported cryptocurrencies at the current exchange rate. The user is directed to a Crypto.com payment interface, possibly scanning a QR code or confirming via their Crypto.com app or wallet. The transaction is processed on the blockchain via Crypto.com’s infrastructure. Confirmation is sent back to the government portal, and the payment is registered. The specific cryptocurrencies supported will depend on the agreement and technical integration, but major ones like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Crypto.com Coin (CRO) are likely candidates. The partnership aims to make crypto payments public services as smooth and intuitive as possible, minimizing complexity for the end-user while ensuring the government receives the correct value in fiat or a stable equivalent. The Critical Role of the Dubai Finance Partnership The involvement of Dubai Finance partnership is absolutely critical to the success of this initiative. DOF is the custodian of the government’s financial systems and revenue collection. Integrating a novel payment method like cryptocurrency requires careful planning, technical integration, and adherence to financial regulations and reporting standards. DOF’s role likely includes: Defining which public services will accept crypto payments initially. Ensuring the correct calculation and reconciliation of crypto payments against fiat fee amounts. Managing the conversion of received crypto into fiat, if required, or holding it according to government policy. Integrating Crypto.com’s payment gateway securely into existing government financial infrastructure. Establishing accounting and reporting procedures for crypto transactions. This Dubai Finance partnership signifies government-level endorsement and integration, moving beyond private sector acceptance to official state-level adoption. It highlights the government’s trust in Crypto.com’s ability to handle these transactions reliably and compliantly within the regulatory framework VARA provides. Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits are significant, implementing crypto payments public services is not without its challenges: Volatility: The fluctuating nature of cryptocurrency prices requires robust mechanisms to ensure the government receives the correct fiat value at the time of the transaction. This is typically handled by the payment processor (Crypto.com) guaranteeing an exchange rate for a short window. User Education: Not everyone is familiar with using cryptocurrency. Clear instructions and support will be necessary to ensure broad accessibility. Regulatory Evolution: While Dubai has a framework, the global regulatory landscape for crypto is still developing, which could influence future policies. Technical Integration: Merging new payment systems with legacy government infrastructure can be complex. Security: Ensuring the security of transactions and user data is paramount. Addressing these challenges will be key to the successful and widespread adoption of this new payment option. The Crypto.com Dubai partnership will need to navigate these complexities carefully to build user trust and ensure seamless operation. Actionable Insights for Residents and Businesses For those in Dubai or planning to interact with its public services, this partnership presents new possibilities: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Dubai government channels and Crypto.com regarding which specific services will accept crypto payments and when the service goes live. Understand the Process: Familiarize yourself with how crypto payments via Crypto.com work to be ready when the option becomes available. Consider the Benefits: If you hold supported cryptocurrencies, evaluate whether paying public service fees directly offers convenience or other advantages for you. Watch the Trend: This move could pave the way for more businesses and services in Dubai to accept crypto, further boosting crypto adoption Dubai . This development isn’t just news; it’s a practical change that could affect how you handle everyday financial tasks in Dubai. Being prepared and understanding the implications is worthwhile. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Dubai and Crypto The partnership between Crypto.com and Dubai Finance to enable crypto payments public services is a landmark development. It’s a clear demonstration of Dubai’s proactive approach to integrating digital assets into its core financial infrastructure and executing its vision for crypto adoption Dubai . By facilitating Dubai crypto payments for essential services, the emirate is not only enhancing convenience for its tech-savvy population but also setting a precedent for other global cities. This Dubai Finance partnership with a major player like Crypto.com highlights the increasing maturity and real-world utility of cryptocurrencies. While challenges remain, the commitment shown by Dubai’s government is a powerful signal of the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. This is a pivotal moment, showcasing how innovative collaborations can push the boundaries of traditional finance and pave the way for a more digitally integrated future.

44544123,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159659,1747093224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breakthrough: SEC Chair Atkins Signals Pro-Crypto Regulatory Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-policy-shift/,"For years, the cryptocurrency industry in the United States has grappled with a regulatory landscape often described as uncertain, confusing, and primarily driven by enforcement actions rather than clear rules. This environment has created significant challenges for businesses and investors alike, stifling innovation and driving some activity offshore. However, a potentially transformative shift in the US crypto policy might be on the horizon, signaled by none other than SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Understanding the Shift in SEC Crypto Regulation In a significant announcement, SEC Chair Paul Atkins outlined a proposed new direction for the commission’s approach to digital assets. The core of this shift involves moving away from what has often been perceived as an ‘enforcement-first’ strategy towards a more predictable and transparent rule-based framework. This is a pivotal moment for SEC crypto regulation , suggesting a potential end to the era of ‘regulation by enforcement’ that has drawn considerable criticism from the industry and legal experts. The previous approach, while intended to protect investors, often left market participants guessing about how existing securities laws applied to novel digital asset structures. Companies frequently found themselves targeted by SEC enforcement actions without clear, pre-existing guidance on how to comply. This created a climate of fear and uncertainty, making it difficult for legitimate businesses to operate and innovate within the U.S. Chair Atkins’ comments, as reported by The Block, indicate a clear recognition of these issues and a commitment to addressing them head-on. The proposed rule-based approach aims to provide the clarity that the digital asset space desperately needs to mature and thrive under appropriate oversight. What Did Paul Atkins SEC Announcement Detail? Paul Atkins’ statement laid out several key areas where the SEC plans to implement changes and provide updated guidance. His remarks were critical of the past tactics employed by the commission, acknowledging the need for a more constructive engagement with the industry. Key points from his announcement include: Moving Away from Ad Hoc Enforcement: A clear intention to reduce reliance on enforcement actions as the primary method of regulation. This doesn’t mean an end to enforcement against bad actors, but rather a focus on establishing rules first. Criticism of Past Tactics: Explicit acknowledgment that the previous approach has been problematic and has not served the goal of fostering a well-regulated, innovative market effectively. Updating Guidance on Securities Classification: Providing clearer criteria and processes for determining whether a digital asset constitutes a security under U.S. law. This is perhaps one of the most contentious and uncertain areas currently. Reviewing and Updating Custody Rules: Addressing how digital assets should be held and managed by regulated entities, an area crucial for institutional adoption and investor protection. Revising Broker-Dealer Rules: Adapting existing rules for broker-dealers to accommodate the unique nature of digital assets and the technologies underpinning them. Supporting Innovation: A stated goal to support technological innovation within the digital asset space while simultaneously establishing clear standards. This comprehensive list touches upon the most pressing regulatory pain points identified by the crypto industry. By committing to update guidance in these specific areas, the Paul Atkins SEC seems to be signaling a genuine effort to build a regulatory framework that is both protective and pragmatic. Why is Crypto Regulatory Clarity So Crucial? The lack of clear rules has been a significant impediment to the growth and mainstream adoption of digital assets in the U.S. Without predictable regulations, businesses face immense legal and operational risks. Investors, both retail and institutional, are hesitant to engage fully in a market where the rules of the game are constantly shifting or unclear. Crypto regulatory clarity is essential for several reasons: Fostering Innovation: When companies understand the rules, they can design products and services that comply, encouraging investment and development within the U.S. Investor Protection: Clear rules provide a predictable environment, reducing opportunities for fraud and manipulation and ensuring investors understand the risks and legal protections available to them. Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions require regulatory certainty before committing significant capital to the digital asset space. Clear rules can unlock substantial institutional investment. Market Integrity: Defined standards for trading, custody, and market surveillance contribute to a more stable and trustworthy market. Competitiveness: Without clarity, the U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions that have established more welcoming regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Chair Atkins’ focus on providing this clarity through a rule-based approach directly addresses these critical needs. It suggests a potential path forward where the U.S. can harness the benefits of digital asset technology while mitigating the associated risks effectively. What Does a Rule-Based Approach to Digital Asset Rules Look Like? A rule-based approach means the SEC would proactively propose, solicit public comment on, and finalize specific regulations tailored to digital assets. This contrasts with the enforcement-first model, where the SEC primarily uses enforcement actions against companies or individuals to signal its interpretation of how existing laws apply. Under a rule-based system for digital asset rules , we might expect to see: Specific Rule Proposals: The SEC would publish detailed proposed rules outlining how digital assets should be treated under securities laws, what disclosures are required, how trading platforms should operate, and how custody should be handled. Public Comment Periods: The industry, legal experts, and the public would have formal opportunities to provide feedback on proposed rules, allowing for a more collaborative and informed regulatory process. Finalized Regulations: Based on comments and further consideration, the SEC would issue final rules that provide clear, legally binding standards for market participants. Guidance and Frameworks: Alongside rules, the SEC might issue interpretive guidance documents or frameworks to help the industry understand how to comply. This process is more transparent and predictable than relying on enforcement actions, which can be costly, time-consuming, and provide clarity only after a potential violation has occurred. Implementing comprehensive digital asset rules through this process would represent a monumental shift in the SEC’s engagement with the crypto sector. Challenges and Opportunities for US Crypto Policy While the prospect of a rule-based approach is largely welcomed by the industry, the path forward is not without its challenges. Crafting effective regulations for rapidly evolving technology is complex. The devil will be in the details of the actual rules proposed. Potential challenges include: Pace of Rulemaking: The traditional rulemaking process can be slow, potentially lagging behind the rapid development of the digital asset space. Content of Rules: The effectiveness of the shift depends entirely on whether the resulting rules are pragmatic, well-informed, and appropriately tailored to digital assets. Overly strict or poorly designed rules could still stifle innovation. Jurisdictional Issues: Digital assets often blur lines between different regulatory bodies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, etc.), requiring coordination across agencies. Political and Internal Dynamics: Shifting the approach requires consensus and commitment within the SEC and potentially navigating political pressures. Despite these challenges, the opportunity presented by this potential change in US crypto policy is immense. A clear, functional regulatory framework could position the United States as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting investment, fostering job creation, and ensuring robust investor protection within a predictable legal environment. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? For businesses and investors in the digital asset space, Chair Atkins’ announcement is a signal to stay engaged and prepared. While specific rules have not yet been proposed, the intention is clear. Monitor SEC Announcements: Pay close attention to official SEC statements, proposed rules, and requests for comment. Engage with the Process: If possible, participate in public comment periods on proposed rules. Industry input is crucial for developing effective regulations. Seek Legal Counsel: Continue to consult with legal experts familiar with digital asset law to understand current requirements and prepare for potential future rules. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the nuances of securities law as it may apply to digital assets and the potential implications of different regulatory approaches. This shift, if successfully implemented, could fundamentally alter the landscape for digital assets in the U.S., moving towards a future where innovation and regulation coexist more harmoniously. Conclusion: A New Dawn for U.S. Crypto Regulation? SEC Chair Paul Atkins’ announcement marks a potentially transformative moment for SEC crypto regulation . By advocating for a move away from ad hoc enforcement towards a clear, rule-based framework, the commission signals a willingness to address the long-standing calls for regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. While the details of future digital asset rules are yet to be seen, the commitment to providing updated guidance on crucial issues like securities classification, custody, and broker-dealer rules offers a glimmer of hope for a more predictable and supportive regulatory environment for US crypto policy . This shift, if executed effectively, has the potential to unlock significant innovation and investment, ultimately benefiting both the industry and investors by establishing clear, understandable standards for participation in the digital asset market. The journey towards comprehensive crypto regulatory clarity is far from over, but Chair Atkins’ statement suggests the SEC may finally be ready to take a different, more constructive path forward.

Investors and enthusiasts are keen to discover if these digital assets will lead the next big rally. This article delves into whether these memecoins have what it takes to ignite widespread enthusiasm and growth. PEPE Price Surge Hints at Short-Term Bullish Energy Pepe 's price climbed sharply over the last month with a 106.12% increase and a steep 77.04% weekly jump. The half-year change of 1.14% shows an extended period of subdued movement. Recent gains suggest that traders have reacted strongly in the short term, pointing to an emerging burst of interest after a period of quiet market activity. Current levels mark resistance near $0.00001 and a secondary push toward $0.00002, with support clearly seen at $0.000004. An RSI reading of 84.40 indicates that bullish momentum is intense, though conditions are stretched. Traders may look for opportunities to buy on dips within support while testing resistance cautiously, as the trend remains narrow and uneven despite recent surges. Dogwifhat's Rollercoaster: Short-Term Surge Meets Long-Term Decline WIF recent performance shows a near 200% monthly increase alongside a weekly jump of over 114%, while a six-month period witnessed a steep decline of about 63%. The price history reveals dramatic short-term rallies that contrast with longer-term downward pressure, highlighting significant volatility. Current trading sees prices moving between $0.39 and $0.80, with immediate resistance at $0.97 and a second resistance at $1.38, and firm support near $0.14. Bulls drive the surge, yet an RSI of 83 suggests overbought conditions. Lacking a clear trend, traders might consider cautious long entries near support and profit-taking near resistance. SPX6900 Experiences Significant Price Growth and Key Levels The past month marked a dramatic 69% surge, alongside a notable one-week increase of 62%. Over the last six months, a gain of 16% indicates a steady uptrend. Price movements have fluctuated between $0.41 and $0.68, showcasing significant volatility that has kept traders engaged and active in the market. Currently, SPX prices encounter resistance at $0.81 and a secondary level at $1.08, with support firmly established at $0.25. A high RSI nearing 73 and positive momentum suggest bullish pressure, though caution remains essential. Traders might look to enter near support while monitoring for pullbacks around resistance levels to capture potential short-term profit opportunities. Conclusion As market confidence grows, attention turns to PEPE , WIF , and SPX6900 . These coins have shown potential for driving a new rally. Each has distinct features that appeal to different investor groups. PEPE captivates with its playful theme, WIF attracts through its innovative approach, and SPX6900 offers unique incentives. Their combined momentum could fuel the next big surge in interest and activity. This sets the stage for a possible new phase of growth.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance has warned that a hacker has again hijacked its domain name system (DNS), sending users to a malicious website. In the second attack on its infrastructure in a week, the “curve.fi DNS might be hijacked. Don’t interact!” the team said in a May 12 warning to X. In a follow-up post to a user asking whether it was a hack or a hijack , the Curve Team said the website “Points to the wrong IP” when users try to visit. A DNS works like a directory that translates domain names into IP addresses. Source: Curve Finance The team also said in another update that the “Password is secure,” its two-factor authentication was set up a “long time ago,” and a question has been sent to the “registrar now.” ”While all smart contracts are safe, the domain name points to a malicious site which can drain your wallet! We are investigating and working on recovering the access. No sign of a compromise on our side,” Curve said . Source: Curve Finance Curve Finance was hit with a similar front end attack in August 2022 . In a post-mortem, the consensus was that the attackers managed to clone the Curve Finance website and reroute the DNS server to the fake page. Users who attempted to use the platform had their funds drained into a pool operated by the attackers. Cointelegraph has contacted Curve Finance for comment. Curve Finance potential front-end attack Onchain security firm Blockaid also detected unusual activity from the Curve website recently, warning users to stay away and avoid interacting for now. It could be a case of a “potential frontend attack,” according to the security firm, which is when hackers target the part of the website users interact with, such as the buttons, forms, or text on the site, to steal sensitive data. Source: Blockaid “If you’re connected, please refrain from signing transactions and avoid interactions with the DApp until the issue is resolved. We’re working closely with affected partners. More updates soon,” Blockaid said.

On May 5, a hacker took over its official X handle. “To clarify: the incident was limited strictly to the X account. No other Curve accounts were affected. No security issues were found on our side, no user funds were impacted, and there were no victims of phishing links that the hacker posted,” the team said in a follow-up May 6 post.

The firm added 7,976 ETH worth $18.9M, bringing total holdings to over 1 million ETH. Its Bitcoin trust now holds 614,639 BTC after buying 41,452 BTC in two weeks. BlackRock has filed an amendment to its S-1 registration for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), seeking to enable in-kind creation and redemption of ETF shares for its Ethereum ETF. This in-kind mechanism allows authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for Ethereum (ETH), bypassing the need for cash transactions. BlackRock Seeks In-Kind ETH Redemptions to Cut Costs and Track Price Efficiently The proposed in-kind process aims to enhance tax efficiency, reduce trading costs, and improve liquidity. By facilitating direct ETH transactions, the ETF can better track Ethereum’s market price and minimize capital gains taxes associated with asset sales. Currently, the ETHA ETF operates on a cash-based system, where ETF shares are created or redeemed using cash, necessitating the buying or selling of ETH in the market.

Early this year, an investigation from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike determined that PowerSchool – which operates a widely-used Student Information System (SIS) – witnessed a data breach affecting millions of US school kids. PowerSchool’s SIS software helps schools track students’ attendance, grades, addresses and oftentimes very specific personal information like Social Security numbers or health history. PowerSchool disclosed that “current and former students and educators” had their names, contact details, dates of birth, limited medical alert information, Social Security numbers and “other related information” compromised. Months later, state school leaders and employees from at least 20 North Carolina school systems have reported that hackers have attempted to extort them via threatening emails. The NBC-affiliated WRAL News reports that the extortion attempt asks for a payment in cryptocurrency in exchange for keeping the victims’ data secret. While PowerSchool says that the threat has been contained, cybersecurity expert Doug Levin said to “take that with a grain of salt.” Says Levin, “We also always encourage literally everyone, whether you’ve been caught up in this incident or not, to just freeze their credit records at the credit reporting agencies… It is a simple step that you can take to provide some measure of protection against financial fraud against yourself, should your information ever get exposed in a data breach like this one… Incidents have been happening more frequently. They’ve been more sophisticated. They have also been more significant in terms of their impact, whether you’re talking about money or amounts, or the sensitivity of data that has been released. And one of the things that school systems are doing now is also looking and asking questions of all of their vendors and third parties they do business with, like PowerSchool. There is certainly a trend right now that school systems are beginning to ask many more questions of their vendors and partners to ensure that they have strong cybersecurity in place, while school systems as well are shoring up their cybersecurity practices.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

44544749,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159714,1747094418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking AI Agents Reality: Even a16z VCs Debate Definition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/a16z-ai-agents-definition/,"In the fast-paced world of tech, especially the intersection of AI and potentially blockchain-backed applications, buzzwords come and go, often stretched thin until their meaning blurs. The current star player in this linguistic game is undoubtedly the term AI agents . Despite the massive investment flowing into this area, including from major players like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), there’s a surprising lack of consensus on what an AI agent actually is. What is the True AI Definition ? Even VCs Struggle It might sound counterintuitive, but even those deeply embedded in funding the next wave of AI struggle with a precise AI definition for agents. Three infrastructure investment partners at a16z – Guido Appenzeller, Matt Bornstein, and Yoko Li – explored this very question on a recent podcast. This firm, known for backing AI giants like OpenAI, is reportedly eyeing a substantial $20 billion fund for further sector investment, highlighting their belief in AI’s potential. Yet, despite this enthusiasm, captured in their view that AI copilots will become ubiquitous and some roles will be fully automated by AI agents , the definition remains fluid. Appenzeller noted a ‘continuum’ of products being labeled as agents, ranging from simple systems to ambitious human replacements. From Clever Prompts to Complex Systems: The Spectrum of AI Agents What’s being called an AI agent today covers a wide range: Simple Agents: Appenzeller described the most basic form as essentially a ‘clever prompt’ layered over a knowledge base. These systems take a human query and provide a pre-written or ‘canned’ response, similar to basic IT support chatbots. They perform a single, predefined task. Ambitious Agents: On the other end are systems aiming to replace human workers entirely. This vision requires something approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), needing to persist over long periods and work independently on complex problems. The reality, according to the a16z VCs and industry builders like Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, CEO of Artisan, is that getting this nascent AI technology to work reliably is challenging. Artisan, despite a viral ‘stop hiring humans’ campaign, still employs human staff, illustrating the current limitations. Major Hurdles in AI Development for True Agents Becoming a genuine human worker replacement faces significant technical obstacles in AI development : Persistent Long-Term Memory: Current models struggle to remember context across long interactions, a crucial requirement for complex tasks. Cost of Memory: Storing and accessing vast amounts of conversational history is computationally expensive. Eliminating Hallucinations: AI models can generate incorrect or nonsensical information. No one wants an employee, human or artificial, who fabricates data. These issues prevent current systems from acting truly autonomously and reliably over extended periods, which is necessary for complex roles. a16z ‘s Working Definition: What’s Possible Today? Despite the ambiguity, the a16z trio did arrive at a practical definition for what’s achievable now. Yoko Li described an AI agent as a reasoning, multi-step Large Language Model (LLM) equipped with a dynamic decision tree. This means an agent isn’t just a bot executing a single command. It must be able to: Make decisions about a task. Take autonomous actions based on those decisions. Examples include fetching data, deciding who to contact from a list, and drafting communications, or writing code and determining its placement. This capability goes beyond simple automation, showing a degree of agency, but still falls short of AGI. Can AI Technology Replace Humans Soon? The consensus among the a16z VCs is that while AI agents can automate specific tasks humans currently perform, similar to previous waves of automation, outright human replacement in most roles is not foreseeable with the current state of AI technology . Matt Bornstein emphasized that many jobs require human creativity and complex thinking that current agents cannot replicate. He expressed doubt that full human replacement is even theoretically possible in many creative or complex roles. However, he noted that the marketing rhetoric surrounding AI agents often overstates their current capabilities, contributing significantly to the confusion around their definition and potential. Conclusion: Navigating the Hype Around AI Agents The takeaway from the experts at a16z is clear: the term AI agents is currently a broad umbrella covering a wide spectrum of capabilities, and the most ambitious claims about human replacement are premature. The significant challenges in AI development , such as memory and reliability, mean that true, autonomous agents capable of handling complex roles like humans are still a distant prospect. Understanding the current limitations and realistic potential of AI technology is crucial for navigating the hype and making informed decisions about its adoption.

In the interview, Long described a noticeable and sudden shift in how U.S. banks approach blockchain technology and XRP. The video has drawn attention to Long’s remarks, suggesting that Bank of America’s leadership is eager to engage with Ripple’s technology. Monica Long reveals Bank of America’s CEO says, “We’re all in on #XRP .” Once BlackRock announces the XRP ETF, the FLOODGATES WILL BURST! #XRPHolders #XRPFamily pic.twitter.com/iiaeD7ejge — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) May 10, 2025 A Rapid Turnaround in Institutional Tone Long began by asking, “It feels like the floodgates are going to open this year, doesn’t it?” She noted that the change in sentiment happened quickly, following the rollback of SAB 121 , which had previously locked banks out of the crypto custody market. She also drew attention to the immediate positive reactions from major financial institution executives. She stated that Bryan Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, expressed they were “all in,” signaling a readiness to deepen involvement with Ripple’s solutions. The CEO recently spoke on Bank of America’s readiness to join the digital asset space , noting that it has been preparing for this shift. A Shifting Regulatory Climate Ripple’s history with major U.S. banks, including Bank of America, dates back to its early focus on messaging software and payment solutions. Long highlighted that although these institutions had once worked closely with Ripple, recent years brought growing regulatory uncertainty and what she called “hostility” toward digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 That environment appears to be changing rapidly. She noted that after the election, Ripple’s conversations with banking partners around stablecoin integration and transaction banking “changed overnight.” Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has helped the crypto market grow. Under his leadership, the SEC ended the war on crypto, which began under the former administration, and this shift has sent XRP to heights not seen since 2018. The SEC has also dismissed its lawsuit against Ripple and recently filed a motion asking the court to approve the settlement terms. The Post-Election Turnaround and Institutional Endorsement She emphasized the speed of this change and its impact on Ripple’s positioning in the financial sector. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has acknowledged this shift, attributing the renewed acceptance of cryptocurrencies to the “ Trump effect .” The post by BullRunners suggested that BlackRock’s involvement in the market through an XRP ETF would open the floodgates for XRP. While BlackRock has yet to file for an ETF, the company recently met with the SEC’s crypto task force to discuss ETF approval standards , suggesting it is interested in the market. Long’s comments reflect optimism that the barriers Ripple has faced are now being lifted, with major banks beginning to treat its products and XRP as viable components of the future financial system.

What’s notable is the movement of seasoned XRP and Cardano (ADA) holders quietly increasing exposure to this high-upside opportunity. Having already secured $8 million in early contributions, MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just benefiting from marketing—it’s building trust through structured phases, transparent mechanics, and increasing analyst attention. While ADA and XRP continue to range with little momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE offers an alternative with genuine upside and immediate relevance. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! The Current Status of XRP and Cardano in May 2025 Cardano (ADA) is holding a bullish structure with hints of an upcoming ETF, and a series of utility-based partnerships linked to its LAOS upgrade. Still, prices remain capped between $0.70–$0.72 , with major resistance at $0.81 and $1.17 unbroken. XRP , meanwhile, is sitting at $2.22 , grappling with uncertainty following ETF approval delays and tapering volume. Bloomberg still places an 85% probability on an eventual ETF, but the lack of short-term progress is nudging some holders to explore other options. Both remain quality assets—but the shift in capital shows growing appetite for high-reward entries like MAGACOINFINANCE . 3,000%+ Return Potential and Limited-Time 50% Token Bonus MAGACOINFINANCE currently presents one of the clearest high-upside setups available in 2025: Over 3,000% potential ROI from entry to target 50% bonus tokens available during this round Fixed 100 billion token supply , with 45% allocated to pre-sale Pricing and bonuses adjusting hourly as interest builds With no open-ended promises or drawn-out timelines, the token stands apart from typical hype-driven plays. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Positioned for 25x–35x Returns by Year-End Projections suggest MAGACOINFINANCE may reach its $0.007 listing target , implying 25x to 35x returns for early entrants—placing it high among 2025’s altcoin favorites. What reinforces this forecast? A major global marketing rollout is in motion Confirmed agency and influencer partnerships Exchange discussions are ongoing Instead of speculation, MAGACOINFINANCE is advancing through each milestone with precision. No wonder capital from XRP and ADA holders is flowing in. PRESALE SELLING OUT — TAP TO SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW! Analysts Say MAGACOINFINANCE Is a Strategic 2025 Entry For many analysts, MAGACOINFINANCE now represents the early-stage play for those who missed ETH or DOGE in their early days. Unlike ADA and XRP—still range-bound— MAGACOINFINANCE is in open price discovery, gaining attention from over 20,000 investors and establishing a real brand presence. The timing couldn’t be more critical. The 50% bonus is active—but won’t last much longer.

44545057,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159715,1747095015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price: Navigating the Crucial Dip Ahead of CPI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-cpi-dip/,"The cryptocurrency world often moves with lightning speed, and recent action around the Bitcoin price is a prime example. Just days ago, Bitcoin was pushing towards the $106,000 mark, showing strong upward momentum. However, the mood shifted, leading to a notable dip below $103,000, hitting approximately $102,388 on May 12th. This move caught the attention of many investors, raising questions about the market’s immediate future. Was this the start of a larger downturn, or just a temporary pause? Understanding the drivers behind this volatility is key for anyone navigating the current crypto market landscape. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Dip Ahead of the CPI Report? The primary catalyst cited for this recent downturn in the Bitcoin price was anticipation surrounding the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for release on May 13th. Here’s a breakdown of the factors at play: Pre-CPI De-risking: Investors and traders often become cautious ahead of major economic data releases like the CPI report . Unexpected inflation figures can significantly impact traditional markets (stocks, bonds) and, increasingly, the crypto market due to its growing correlation with macroeconomics. To mitigate potential negative surprises, many participants chose to reduce their exposure, selling off assets, including Bitcoin. Profit-Taking: After Bitcoin’s run-up towards $106,000, reaching levels not seen in some time, it was natural for some investors who bought at lower prices to take profits off the table. This selling pressure contributes to downward price movement. Algorithmic Trading: Automated trading systems are programmed to react quickly to market signals and news events. The impending CPI report likely triggered algorithms designed to reduce risk or take short positions, amplifying the selling pressure. This confluence of factors created a wave of selling that pushed the price down from its recent highs. Is This a Major Crash or Just a Bitcoin Correction? Market dips can be unsettling, but it’s crucial to differentiate between a healthy market correction and a full-blown crash or bear market. A Bitcoin correction is typically defined as a price decline of 10% or more from a recent peak. The move from near $106,000 to around $102,388 represents a drop of roughly 3.4%, which is relatively minor in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. This suggests the recent movement is more of a pullback driven by specific event anticipation rather than a structural breakdown of the market. Analysts quoted by The Block and other financial news outlets largely view this pullback as temporary. They point to the fact that the fundamental reasons people are investing in Bitcoin haven’t changed. While short-term price movements can be dictated by news cycles and trading sentiment, the long-term trajectory is often influenced by broader adoption and underlying network strength. What Does Institutional Adoption Tell Us About Bitcoin’s Strength? Despite the short-term price fluctuations, the underlying bullish fundamentals for Bitcoin remain robust. A key driver of this optimism is continued and growing institutional adoption . Large corporations and investment firms are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or offering crypto investment products to their clients. A prime example highlighted recently is MicroStrategy’s ongoing commitment. The company, led by Michael Saylor, announced another significant purchase, adding 13,390 BTC to their already substantial holdings. This consistent buying pressure from major players like MicroStrategy signals strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Why is institutional adoption so important? Increased Capital Inflow: Institutions bring significant capital, providing strong buying support. Validation: Their participation lends legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially encouraging other traditional investors. Long-Term Holders: Institutions often have longer investment horizons compared to retail traders, contributing to market stability by reducing short-term selling pressure. This trend of increasing institutional adoption provides a strong fundamental floor for the Bitcoin price , suggesting that dips are likely viewed by these large holders as buying opportunities rather than reasons to exit. How Does the CPI Report Impact the Crypto Market Going Forward? The actual release of the CPI report on May 13th will be closely watched. Here’s a look at potential scenarios and their implications for the crypto market : CPI Meets Expectations: If inflation figures come in as analysts predict, it could alleviate some market anxiety. This might lead to a relief rally as the de-risking pressure subsides and investors regain confidence. CPI is Lower Than Expected: A surprisingly low inflation number could be seen as positive, potentially reinforcing the narrative that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts sooner. This could be bullish for risk assets, including Bitcoin. CPI is Higher Than Expected: If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could signal that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer. This is generally viewed negatively for risk assets and could lead to further selling pressure in both traditional and crypto markets. Regardless of the immediate reaction, the CPI report is just one piece of the puzzle. The broader economic outlook, regulatory developments, and continued trends in institutional adoption will all play a role in shaping the future direction of the crypto market and the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways from the Recent Dip: The recent dip in Bitcoin price was largely preemptive selling ahead of the CPI report . This move is considered a temporary pullback or minor Bitcoin correction , not a crash, by many analysts. Strong underlying fundamentals, driven by increasing institutional adoption (like MicroStrategy’s purchases), remain bullish for the long term. The reaction to the actual CPI report will likely dictate short-term market movement. Understanding macro factors is increasingly important for navigating the crypto market . In Conclusion: A Temporary Pause, Not a Reversal? The recent dip below $103,000 for Bitcoin serves as a reminder of the market’s sensitivity to macroeconomic events and investor sentiment. However, by understanding the context – namely, the anticipation of the CPI report and the underlying strength provided by continued institutional adoption – the picture becomes clearer. The consensus among many analysts is that this is likely a temporary Bitcoin correction , a pause for breath, rather than a fundamental reversal of the bullish trend. As the market digests the latest economic data, attention will quickly shift back to the broader narrative of adoption, innovation, and Bitcoin’s position as a unique asset class within the evolving global financial landscape.

One key area of innovation is the development of stablecoins, digital assets pegged to stable references like fiat currencies. However, a significant aspect often overlooked in the stablecoin conversation is privacy. Enter Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson , who has recently hinted at exploring the concept of a privacy-focused stablecoin within the Cardano ecosystem. This idea, discussed on the eToro podcast, sparks intriguing possibilities for the future of digital cash and crypto privacy . Why is a Privacy-Focused Stablecoin on Cardano a Big Deal? Most stablecoins today, while offering stability, operate on public blockchains where transaction details are transparent. While transparency has its merits, it doesn’t always align with the need for financial privacy that many individuals and businesses require for everyday transactions. Think about using cash – it offers a level of anonymity that is currently lacking in the stablecoin space. Hoskinson’s exploration into a privacy-focused Stablecoin aims to bridge this gap. Here’s why this concept is particularly interesting for Cardano : Enhancing Utility: A privacy-preserving Stablecoin could significantly increase the utility of the Cardano blockchain for a wider range of transactions, including those where discretion is preferred. Setting a Precedent: If successful, Cardano could indeed become the first major ecosystem to deploy a widely adopted, privacy-centric Stablecoin , positioning it as a leader in this niche. Attracting New Users: Users and businesses prioritizing financial privacy might be drawn to the Cardano ecosystem specifically for this feature. The Current Stablecoin Landscape on Cardano It’s worth noting that Cardano already hosts stablecoins. The network currently supports approximately $31.5 million worth of stablecoins on its blockchain. While this is a growing figure, the introduction of a native, privacy-focused option could fundamentally change the dynamics and potential use cases for stable value on Cardano . Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Feature Typical Stablecoin (Public Chain) Potential Cardano Privacy Stablecoin Transaction Visibility Publicly visible Potentially obscured or zero-knowledge proof based Use Case Trading, DeFi, transparent payments Trading, DeFi, private payments, remittances Privacy Level Low (pseudonymous) High (closer to cash) What Does ‘Cash-Like Privacy’ Mean in Crypto? When Charles Hoskinson talks about ‘cash-like privacy’, he’s referring to the ability to conduct transactions without the details (sender, receiver, amount) being easily trackable by third parties on a public ledger. This doesn’t necessarily mean absolute anonymity, but rather a level of privacy that prevents mass surveillance of financial activity. Achieving this in a decentralized and compliant manner is a significant technical and regulatory challenge. Potential technologies to achieve this could include: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) CoinJoin-like mixing techniques Confidential Transactions Implementing these complex cryptographic solutions while maintaining the stability and auditability required for a Stablecoin is where the innovation lies. Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Privacy While the idea of a privacy-focused Stablecoin is exciting, it comes with substantial challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Privacy features often attract scrutiny from regulators concerned about illicit activities and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Developing a solution that balances privacy with regulatory requirements is crucial. Technical Complexity: Implementing robust privacy features without compromising security or scalability is technically demanding. Adoption: User adoption will depend on ease of use, trust in the privacy mechanisms, and integration into existing crypto and traditional financial infrastructure. Balancing Transparency: How to provide necessary transparency for audits or regulatory reporting while preserving user privacy is a delicate balance. What Could This Mean for ADA Coin? The potential impact on the ADA Coin , the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano network, is multifaceted. If a privacy-focused Stablecoin on Cardano gains traction, it could drive increased activity and utility on the network. This increased usage, potentially involving transaction fees paid in ADA Coin or staking associated with the stablecoin’s operation, could positively influence the overall demand and value proposition of ADA Coin . Moreover, successful innovation like this enhances Cardano’s reputation as a leading blockchain platform, potentially attracting more developers, projects, and users to the ecosystem, further benefiting ADA Coin holders. Actionable Insight: Stay Informed For anyone interested in Cardano , stablecoins, or crypto privacy , keeping a close watch on developments stemming from Charles Hoskinson’s comments is key. While currently just an idea being pondered, significant progress in this area could mark a major milestone for Cardano and the broader cryptocurrency space. Follow official Cardano channels and reputable crypto news sources for updates on this potential project. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Private Digital Cash Charles Hoskinson’s contemplation of a privacy-focused Stablecoin on Cardano represents a bold and forward-thinking approach to addressing a critical gap in the current stablecoin market. By aiming for ‘cash-like privacy’, Cardano is exploring ways to make digital value truly usable for everyday transactions where privacy is paramount. While the path forward involves significant technical and regulatory challenges, the potential benefits for the Cardano ecosystem, the utility of the ADA Coin , and the broader movement towards private digital cash are immense. This idea, if realized, could solidify Cardano’s position as an innovative leader in the blockchain space, pushing the boundaries of what a decentralized financial system can offer.

XRP Was Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle Earlier In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where XRP could be heading next based on a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Symmetrical Triangle, which forms when an asset consolidates between two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The top line of the triangle connects together successive lower highs in the price, and the bottom one higher lows. Like with other TA consolidation patterns, the former trendline is likely to provide resistance during a retest, while the latter one supports. A break out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. Naturally, an escape above the triangle is bullish, while a fall under it is bearish. As the price consolidates inside a Symmetrical Triangle, its range gets narrower with time, until it shrinks to a point at the apex. Thus, as the asset travels toward the end of the triangle, it can become more likely to find a breakout. The Symmetrical Triangle isn’t the only type of triangle that exists in TA. Two other popular variations are the Ascending and Descending Triangles, which emerge when one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis. As the names of these patterns already suggest, they involve consolidation toward a net upside and downside, respectively. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that XRP was potentially trading inside for years before a breakout: As displayed in the above graph, XRP was nearing the apex of this long-term Symmetrical Triangle last year, meaning a breakout was becoming probable. And indeed, with the bull rally during the last couple of months of the year, the coin managed to find a break above the pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver’s Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows Generally, breakouts resulting from a triangular pattern are assumed to be of the same length as the height of the triangle itself. Based on the height of this Symmetrical Triangle, a potential bullish target could lie at around $15 for the cryptocurrency. Naturally, this target would only hold if the trajectory that XRP is currently following is truly based on this Symmetrical Triangle. In the scenario that the pattern does end up being the governing one and the coin observes a bull run to this level, it would have seen an increase of more than 500% from the current price. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.45, up around 3% in the last seven days.

44545679,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159749,1747096854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive 250 Million USDC Minted: What This Means for the Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/250-million-usdc-minted/,"Big news just hit the crypto wire! According to data shared by the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , a staggering 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a small transaction; it’s a significant injection of stablecoin liquidity into the ecosystem. But what does this massive mint actually signify, and how might it impact the broader stablecoin market and the crypto world at large? Understanding the Basics: What is USDC and Why Does Minting Matter? Before we dive into the implications of this specific event, let’s quickly cover the fundamentals. USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin, which means its value is pegged to a stable asset, in this case, the U.S. dollar. It’s issued by Circle, a regulated financial technology company. The goal of stablecoins like USDC is to provide a digital dollar that can be easily moved on blockchain networks, offering stability in the often-volatile cryptocurrency landscape. Minting, in the context of stablecoins, refers to the creation of new tokens. When someone wants to convert U.S. dollars into USDC, they send the dollars to Circle or a partner, and Circle then ‘mints’ or creates the equivalent amount of USDC tokens on the blockchain. These new tokens are backed 1:1 by the dollars held in reserve. Conversely, ‘redeeming’ USDC means sending the tokens back to Circle to receive the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, which leads to the burning (destruction) of the USDC tokens. The fact that 250 million USDC minted indicates that there has been significant demand from entities or individuals looking to bring a large amount of U.S. dollars onto the blockchain in the form of USDC. Whale Alert Crypto: The Messenger of Big Moves The information about the 250 million USDC minted came to light thanks to Whale Alert . This service is widely followed in the crypto community because it tracks and reports large transactions on various blockchains, often involving significant amounts of cryptocurrency or stablecoins moved by ‘whales’ – large holders. While the ‘USDC Treasury’ isn’t a single wallet but rather represents Circle’s operational addresses for minting and redemption, Whale Alert’s reporting confirms the official creation of these new tokens by the issuer. Seeing a Whale Alert crypto notification for such a large stablecoin mint immediately grabs attention because it suggests substantial capital movement is either happening or being prepared to happen within the crypto ecosystem. Why Mint 250 Million USDC? Potential Reasons Behind the Massive Increase A mint of this size isn’t arbitrary. There are several plausible reasons why Circle might mint 250 million USDC minted at this time: Increased Demand: The most straightforward reason is that institutional clients, exchanges, or large investors have deposited $250 million with Circle to acquire USDC. This signals a desire to hold digital dollars for various purposes. Preparing for Redemptions: Although less common for a mint, Circle might proactively mint tokens to ensure sufficient operational float to handle expected redemptions smoothly, though minting is primarily driven by inflows. Strategic Allocations: Circle might be preparing these funds for strategic purposes, such as funding operations, making investments, or facilitating partnerships within the crypto or traditional finance space that require on-chain dollar liquidity. Exchange Inflows: Large amounts of newly minted stablecoins are often sent to cryptocurrency exchanges. This can indicate that investors are bringing capital onto exchanges, potentially to buy other cryptocurrencies. Yield Opportunities: With various DeFi protocols offering yield on stablecoins, institutions or large holders might be minting USDC to deploy it into these opportunities. Without direct confirmation from Circle, these remain potential explanations, but they cover the most common scenarios for such a large USDC supply increase . Impact on the Stablecoin Market and Beyond An injection of 250 million USDC minted has several potential implications for the stablecoin market and the broader crypto ecosystem: Increased Liquidity: More USDC means more digital dollars available on various blockchains, making it easier and potentially cheaper to trade between crypto assets, transfer value, and participate in DeFi protocols. Potential Buying Pressure: If the minted USDC is moved onto exchanges, it represents significant potential buying power. Traders and investors often use stablecoins as a gateway to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. A large influx of stablecoins can sometimes precede upward price movements in the market as this liquidity is deployed. Shifting Stablecoin Dominance: While Tether (USDT) remains the largest stablecoin by market cap, USDC is a strong second. Significant mints like this contribute to USDC’s overall supply and market share, influencing the dynamics between major stablecoins. Indicator of Capital Inflow: A large USDC mint is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that new capital (in the form of fiat dollars) is entering the crypto ecosystem rather than exiting it. The movement of this newly minted USDC will be closely watched by traders and analysts using services like Whale Alert crypto to try and predict where this liquidity might be deployed. Considering the Challenges and Nuances While a large mint can signal positive sentiment and increased activity, it’s important to consider the nuances: Centralization: USDC, like most stablecoins pegged to fiat, is centralized. Its issuance and reserves are controlled by Circle. This means users rely on Circle’s solvency, transparency, and compliance with regulations. Regulatory Environment: Stablecoins are under increasing scrutiny from regulators globally. The rules governing their issuance, reserves, and usage are still evolving, which could impact their future operations. Purpose of Funds: The minted funds might not necessarily be used for buying crypto. They could be intended for operational expenses, payroll, or held as reserves on exchanges. Tracking the movement of the funds reported by Whale Alert crypto is key to understanding their ultimate purpose. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do? As a crypto participant, seeing a large mint like 250 million USDC minted can be informative. Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports from services like Whale Alert and crypto news outlets to track large movements. Monitor On-Chain Data: If you’re comfortable with blockchain explorers, you can try to follow where this newly minted USDC is sent. Is it going to exchanges? DeFi protocols? Unknown wallets? Assess Market Sentiment: A large stablecoin mint can be interpreted as a sign of potential buying pressure, but combine this signal with other market indicators before making investment decisions. Understand Stablecoin Risks: Remember that even stablecoins carry risks, including issuer risk and regulatory risk. Understand how USDC works and its reserve structure. This significant USDC supply increase is a data point in a complex market. Use it to inform your understanding, not as a sole basis for trading decisions. Conclusion: A Significant Boost to USDC Supply The minting of 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury, as reported by Whale Alert crypto , is a noteworthy event. It signifies substantial capital inflow into the digital asset space, driving a significant USDC supply increase . While the exact deployment of these funds remains to be seen, such large movements typically point towards increased demand for stablecoin liquidity, potentially fueling activity within the stablecoin market , exchanges, and DeFi protocols. Keeping track of these on-chain signals provides valuable insight into the flow of capital within the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Recently, a significant development – the US-China trade agreement – captured global attention. While often viewed through the lens of traditional markets, its potential impact on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin , is a subject of intense analysis. An interesting perspective has emerged, suggesting this particular trade deal might be more immediately beneficial for the Stock Market than for digital assets like Bitcoin. Understanding the US-China Trade Deal’s Immediate Impact The core of the analysis, as reported by Cointelegraph, centers on the direct economic mechanisms at play. The US-China Trade Deal involved lowering import tariffs. For publicly traded companies, especially those with significant exposure to international trade, reduced tariffs can translate almost directly into several key advantages: Increased Sales: Lower import costs can make goods cheaper for consumers, potentially boosting demand. Improved Profitability: Companies save money on imported components or goods, widening profit margins. Reduced Uncertainty: A trade agreement can ease fears of future tariff hikes or trade disruptions, encouraging business investment and consumer spending. These factors create a fertile ground for the Stock Market , where company performance and future earnings potential are primary drivers of value. Stock prices often react positively and quickly to news that directly enhances the business environment. Why Bitcoin’s Reaction Differed From the Stock Market Unlike the direct line connecting tariff reduction to corporate bottom lines, the impact on Bitcoin is less immediate and more nuanced. The analysis points to prevailing Macroeconomic Conditions as the primary reason for the pause in Bitcoin’s strong upward trajectory, which had been targeting levels like $105,000. While a stable global economy is generally positive for all assets, the specific benefits of a trade deal focused on traditional goods and services flow more directly into equity markets first. Scarce assets, such as gold and Bitcoin, often act as alternative stores of value or hedges against inflation and economic uncertainty. A reduction in trade tensions, while positive overall, can sometimes reduce the immediate appeal of these ‘safe haven’ or uncorrelated assets, at least in the short term. An example cited is the price of gold, which reportedly fell 3.4% after the announcement of the tariff agreement, illustrating this dynamic. Positive Undercurrents: The Rise of Bitcoin ETF Inflows Despite the macroeconomic headwind from the trade deal seemingly favoring stocks initially, the analysis highlights significant positive developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. Between May 1 and May 9, a substantial $2 billion flowed into US spot Bitcoin ETF products. This is a crucial data point for several reasons: It demonstrates continued, strong demand for Bitcoin. ETFs are a popular vehicle for traditional investors, including large funds and wealth managers. Significant inflows often signal increasing Institutional Investment interest. This inflow of funds from institutional players is widely regarded as a bullish signal for the price of Bitcoin. It suggests that sophisticated investors are allocating capital to the asset, providing a strong foundation of demand independent of the day-to-day swings influenced by traditional macroeconomic news like trade deals. The Significance of Institutional Investment for Bitcoin The growing trend of Institutional Investment entering the Bitcoin space through regulated products like ETFs is a transformative force. Unlike retail investors, institutions often deploy much larger sums of capital and tend to have longer-term investment horizons. Their participation adds legitimacy, liquidity, and stability to the market. The $2 billion inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETF s within a little over a week is a testament to this ongoing trend and provides a counter-narrative to the idea that macro events like the US-China Trade Deal are the sole determinants of Bitcoin’s price action. Looking Ahead: Why $100,000 Might Be a Floor, Not a Ceiling Based on the strength indicated by these substantial institutional inflows via Bitcoin ETF s, the analysis suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s price stability. While the Stock Market may have enjoyed a more immediate boost from the trade deal, the underlying demand demonstrated by institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin products provides significant support. The analysis concluded that it is unlikely that Bitcoin will fall below the $100,000 mark, underpinned by this consistent buying pressure from large players. In essence, the situation presents a dual perspective: traditional macro events like trade deals can provide tailwinds for equities, but the internal dynamics of the crypto market, particularly the surge in Institutional Investment facilitated by vehicles like the Bitcoin ETF , are building a strong case for Bitcoin’s long-term value and potentially setting higher floors for its price.

The move signals Adams’ renewed focus on digital finance and economic innovation as he works to reposition his administration following months of legal scrutiny. Adams names crypto advisors, announces NYC’s first digital finance summit Speaking at a press conference at Gracie Mansion on May 12, Adams tapped two new advisors, including June Ou, founder of the blockchain-focused firm Figure, and Richie Hecker, a tech investor an d Tr action and Scale CEO. The two will help the city consider how to use cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 technologies for the common good and economic growth. “We are focused on the long-term values of these technologies for our city and its people, not chasing memes or trends,” said Adams, adding that New York City is open for business to those i n cr ypto, blockchain, Web3, or fintech space. Adams has a history of being bullish on crypto. When elected Mayor in 2022, he promised to accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin . At that time, he noted, “Many people laughed at me—and all I can say is, who’s laughing now?” he said, echoing his words from December. He said that the industry is now growing, and since then, the number of crypto and blockchain startups that have made New York City home has spiked. His 2023 financial disclosure revealed that he owned some Bitcoin, somewhere between $5,000 and $54,999, although he suggested it was worth more later in 2024 The Mayor also revealed that the city’s first-ever crypto summit will be held on May 20, just two months after President Donald Trump held a similar event at the White House. Its goal is to gather innovators, investors, and policymakers to shape the future of digital finance in NYC. Adams noted that New York is emerging as a serious contender to California’s Silicon Valley in crypto innovation. He also touted blockchain technology’s potential to expand financial inclusion, particularly for communities historically excluded from traditional financial systems. Adams’ crypto push follows surprise dismissal of federal corruption case Adams’ crypto announcement came just days after a major legal cloud was lifted. A federal corruption case against him was formally dismissed in April. The charges, which were related to illicit donations he allegedly received from the Turkish government, had been followed for months. To the surprise of many, however, the US Department of Justice, reportedly at the behest of Trump-appointed officials, dismissed the case. It was dismissed “with prejudice,” which bars it from being reopened. Court documents revealed serious questions about how the case was handled. US District Judge Dale Ho pointed out that the dismissal “smacks of a bargain” between Adams and federal authorities. He suggested that concessions around immigration policy may have influenced the decision. Controversy continues against the Mayor, with Adams denying ever committing any crime and no charges against him ever filed. DOJ under Trump shuts down Adams corruption case Adams met President Donald Trump at the White House on May 9. He thanked Trump for his assistance in his 2024 campaigns. The meeting occurred just days before Adams announced crypto advisors, creating buzz over the content of his meeting with Trump. Some critics suspect there may also be a connection between the dismissal of the case and a change of political attitude on the part of the Mayor. Adams, who was a Democrat, has more recently hewed more closely with Trump on a variety of topics, especially immigration and policing. He even ran for election as an independent, jilting the Democratic Party. The Mayor has denied any quid pro quo and claims the meeting was a “policy dialogue.” But the timing has fueled speculation. Why announce new crypto advisors just days after meeting Trump and weeks after a corruption case gets thrown out? When asked if there was any connection between the events, the Mayor’s office did not respond. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Pepe Coin, a meme supported coin, is riding a wave of whale accumulation, with 24 trillion tokens bought in 2025 alone. Meanwhile Mutuum Finance (MUTM), being a DeFi lending platform, is charting through its presale, collecting $8,000,000 and selling out more than 455 million tokens to 9,700 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is 70% filled with each token going for $0.025 in its fourth presale phase indicating strong demand. With both projects reaching a market cap of $50 billion, what one is most explosive in returns? Let’s break it down. Pepe Coin’s Meme-Fueled Surge Pepe Coin is coming back with heft, trading today at $0.00000817 after reclaiming a $0.00000760 support. Whale wallets have ballooned 20% this year, and that adds 24 trillion tokens that speak volumes of confidence. Technical indicators are releasing bullish signals: a cup-and-handle pattern is emerging, looking to $0.00001465, while Stochastic RSI suggests strong upward momentum. Open interest is $396 million; 52.78% long, which is market optimism. Yet, Pepe Coin faces hurdles. Resistance is at $0.0000090 and a group of EMAs around $0.00000814 – $0.00000918 may slow its ascent. To reach a $50 billion market cap, Pepe Coin would require enormous price jump, the current value would have to increase by thousands. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hitting through its presale, phase 4 is now at $0.025 per token. Investors are pouring in having raised $8,000,000 selling 455 million tokens to 9,700 holders. The phase is 70% over, and the phase five will be 20% more of the price, that is a price of $0.03, at the current rate buyers are going to get a quick gain before the next level. The price of project listing in tokenomics is set to be $0.06; phase 4 investors will therefore reap 140% return. Taking it further, analysts estimate that an investment on the current price will have an ROI of 9,900% after launch at a price of $2.50. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just getting hype. its lending model enables users to borrow and earn passive income through mtTokens which earn interest over time. With the buy-and-distribute system, platform revenue finds its way into token buybacks and increases demand. The team is already concluding a Certik audit, the result of which will be soon released on social media thus reaffirming trust in the system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is looking to engage their customers and recently they launched a dashboard that they use to display the top 50 token holders. These leaders get bonus tokens for having their places and a brilliant decision to reward loyalty and provoke a competition. While Pepe Coin thrives on viral momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility, ensuring stability as it scales. Its structured presale, with prices climbing each phase, creates urgency—phase 4’s rapid sell-out underscores the FOMO driving investors to act now. Portfolio Multiplication Showdown Pepe Coin’s meme mania rally could blow up big if it gets a $50 billion market cap, but on the way there, volatility is the name of the game. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with the back bone of DeFi and amid growth in presale leads to a more forthcoming path. An approximate $50 billion market cap would multiply MUTM’s value exponentially especially with early investors at $0.025. Its 140% listing return and future 9900% post launch escalation position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as great competition.

Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is taking steps forward with a new AI-powered testnet. But in the middle of these stories, Unstaked is quietly showing what AI in crypto can truly look like. While Dogecoin aims for a move toward $3.94 and Cardano continues testing AI scalability, Unstaked is building AI with actual use. Its AI agents are not just included for attention, they are designed to deliver impact across major platforms. People watching the top-performing crypto projects are beginning to recognize the gap between AI as a headline and AI as a working system. That difference is gaining traction fast: Unstaked has already raised $4.5 million during its presale, including $1 million in a single day, clear proof of growing interest in its practical approach. Dogecoin (DOGE) Forecast: Possible Push Toward $3.94 Dogecoin has once again surprised the market by rebounding 38% from $0.138. This rebound has sparked optimism, with analyst Kevin predicting a possible move toward $3.94. His forecast relies on Fibonacci extension levels, pointing to a golden pocket zone that has previously led to major rallies. Based on this analysis, if DOGE holds its strength, a move to $1.10 in the mid-term may also be possible. A look at the log chart shows a potential 740% upside. With favorable macro factors in play, the coin could go even further. Still, Dogecoin’s price is largely influenced by public attention rather than core project strength. Cardano (ADA) Trials AI for Blockchain Speed Cardano is making waves with its new AI-based testnet called the “Face Melting Net” (FMN). This platform brings in thousands of AI agents to simulate fast and complex trading environments to test how well Cardano handles large data flows. Charles Hoskinson says this could move Cardano ahead in blockchain scalability. The purpose of the FMN testnet is to increase Cardano’s transaction handling capability using these AI simulations. Developers can launch decentralized apps on the testnet to see how well the system performs under heavy use. If all goes well, it may boost Cardano’s place as a strong, scalable blockchain. Still, the focus here is mainly on testing features. The AI agents run in a closed setup, and their effect in real-life use is not yet confirmed. Unstaked’s AI Tools Deliver Real Value, Backed by $4.5M in Presale In a space where AI is often thrown around for attention, Unstaked stands apart with working AI features. It doesn’t just attach AI for marketing, its agents are designed to function and deliver across real platforms. These tools will go live after the presale ends and the project launches, ready for action on Telegram, X, and later, Discord. Unlike the limited use seen in Cardano’s testnet, Unstaked’s AI agents interact with users, assist in content sharing, answer questions, and handle digital tasks. Every move they make is recorded on-chain, making all activity traceable and clear. Rewards are based on actual work done, not just promises. Users are active participants in Unstaked’s system. They can set the roles and targets for their AI agents and guide their strategies. As these agents perform better, their owners gain more $UNSD, turning AI into a tool for real progress and visible results. Unstaked is not using AI for show, it’s using it for function. These agents are built for real use, giving people control over useful digital tools. While others talk about what AI might do, Unstaked is ready to make it happen when the presale ends. Unstaked’s practical approach has already captured major attention. The project is now in Stage 9 of its presale, priced at $0.00823, with a planned launch price of $0.1819, giving early buyers the potential for a 2,700% return. That promise of both function and reward has fueled strong interest: Unstaked has raised $4.5 million so far, including $1 million in a single day, making it one of the most watched crypto presales in the current market. Final Say! Dogecoin may still surprise with another price jump, and Cardano is clearly working on speed and scale. But in a market full of talk, Unstaked shows what working AI really looks like. Its agents are not stuck in a test system, and they are more than a headline trick. For those following the top-performing crypto projects , Unstaked brings something else to the table: AI that works, rewards that reflect effort, and features launching after the presale finishes. As other projects test and promote, Unstaked is close to launching a working AI system, a vision that has already attracted $4.5 million in presale funding.

As blockchain and artificial intelligence combine, projects blending both are becoming hot topics. Well-known coins like Hedera (HBAR) and Litecoin (LTC) still provide steady returns, but a newcomer is capturing attention. Web3 ai goes beyond simple tokens by offering working tools and a growing platform from the start. Priced at only $0.000331, $WAI tokens offer early buyers a chance for strong gains as the project grows. If you are searching for the top trending crypto pick of 2025, this comparison aims to guide you toward the best options. Web3 ai: Could This AI Token Be the Top Trending Crypto of 2025? Web3 ai is breaking through in 2025 as a project that delivers value early. Instead of waiting for future updates, Web3 ai plans to launch with 12 AI-powered tools including auto-trading bots, price prediction systems, scam detectors, and portfolio managers. These tools use machine learning and neural networks to analyze blockchain data, market movements, and social trends. The result is faster and clearer trading signals for users facing unpredictable market conditions. The $WAI token is now in stage 3 of its 50-stage presale at $0.000331. It will list at $0.005242, offering a possible 1,747% return for early buyers. With every stage, the price increases, rewarding those who join early. Web3 ai stands out for its plan to offer paid upgrades and its deflationary burn system to manage supply. Even though staking will not be used, the project has focused on making its token valuable as AI keeps changing crypto trading. Many now see Web3 ai as a strong candidate for the top trending crypto in the months ahead. Hedera (HBAR): Can This Hashgraph Coin Defy the Odds? Hedera (HBAR) trades near $0.178, down 3.4 percent in the past day. Short-term holders may worry, but many see long-term value in Hedera’s hashgraph network and growing ecosystem. Price forecasts for May 2025 suggest movement between $0.156 and $0.195. A bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart hints at a slow push higher. Risks remain. Signs of a death cross and weak support levels make timing important. Even so, Hedera’s partnerships and unique technology place it in the conversation for top trending crypto picks for those who value scalability and strong network design. Litecoin (LTC): Can the Original Altcoin Make a Comeback? Litecoin (LTC), often called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, is trading at around $86 after dipping 1.2 percent in 24 hours. Market watchers still expect an upward path in May, with price targets between $49.86 and $105.91. An average near $74.87 suggests a possible return of about 25 percent. LTC’s position above both the 21- and 50-day moving averages points to more momentum ahead. As one of the longest-standing cryptocurrencies, Litecoin holds a place as a top trending crypto choice for those preferring stability. It may not offer the excitement of newer coins, but its low fees, reliability, and wide exchange support make it a steady part of any crypto strategy. The Top Trending Cryptos to Follow Right Now The maturing crypto market demands more than fast price moves. Finding the top trending crypto options now means focusing on usefulness, new ideas, and staying power. Hedera continues to grow with its forward-looking design, and Litecoin keeps its role as a trusted older name. Web3 ai brings something different. Priced at $0.000331, with a listing plan at $0.005242, it gives early backers a strong chance in 2025. With 12 AI-powered tools launching after token release, Web3 ai is firmly on the list of top trending crypto assets to watch closely.

Microsoft is set to host its annual Build developer conference next week, running from May 19 to 22. This event is a key date for developers and tech enthusiasts alike, and this year, the spotlight is firmly on artificial intelligence. Given the rapid pace of AI development, expectations are high for significant announcements across Microsoft’s vast ecosystem, from cloud services to consumer software. At last year’s Build, we saw exciting steps like the integration of Copilot into Microsoft Teams, the introduction of Copilot+ AI-powered PCs, and even Windows Volumetric Apps for Meta Quest headsets. This year, the focus is likely to deepen, particularly concerning AI integration into core Microsoft products. The keynotes and sessions will be available online for free, making it accessible for everyone to tune in and see what’s next. What to Expect at Microsoft Build 2025 The upcoming Microsoft Build conference is poised to be a pivotal event, showcasing the company’s latest advancements, especially in the realm of AI. Following price adjustments for many software products last November, including Windows 365, Office 365, and Microsoft 365, Microsoft is likely to unveil new AI-powered features designed to add significant value and justify these changes. Here are some key areas where we anticipate major announcements: Deeper Copilot AI Integration: Copilot, Microsoft’s generative AI assistant, is expected to be a central theme. We could see it woven more deeply into various Microsoft software offerings, benefiting both individual users and large enterprises. Windows AI Capabilities: Significant upgrades are anticipated for Windows, potentially giving Copilot on Windows more ‘agentic’ functionality. This could allow the AI to perform everyday PC tasks autonomously, streamlining workflows and improving user interaction with the operating system. Azure AI Hardware: Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, is crucial for powering AI workloads. Rumors suggest a potential announcement regarding a successor to the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator chip, possibly dubbed ‘Maia 2’. Custom AI silicon is vital for efficient and cost-effective cloud AI services. Alternative AI Models: Reports indicate Microsoft is exploring using alternative AI models from companies like xAI, Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek for Copilot, potentially signaling shifts in its AI strategy beyond its primary partnership. New Internal AI Models: Microsoft is also rumored to have developed its own family of competitive AI models, internally known as MAI. Build could be the platform where these models are unveiled and potentially offered via an API, competing directly in the AI model market. Diving Deeper into Copilot AI Advancements Copilot AI is set to take center stage at Build. The expected enhancements point towards a more capable and integrated AI assistant. One of the most intriguing possibilities is the addition of ‘agentic’ features within the Windows client. This could mean Copilot moving beyond simply answering questions or generating text to actually performing actions on your PC. Imagine asking Copilot to organize your files, adjust system settings, or complete multi-step tasks with a single command. References found by leaker TestingCatalog suggest an ‘Action button’ feature is in development, specifically designed to trigger these automated tasks. Beyond Windows, expect Copilot AI to become more deeply embedded in the Microsoft 365 suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) and potentially expand its capabilities within Microsoft Teams and other enterprise tools. These integrations aim to boost productivity and creativity for users across different applications. Powering the Cloud with Azure AI Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform is the backbone for many of its AI services, including Copilot. To handle the increasing demands of AI training and inference, specialized hardware is essential. The potential announcement of a ‘Maia 2’ AI Accelerator chip, a custom-designed silicon for Azure, highlights Microsoft’s commitment to building its own infrastructure optimized for AI workloads. Partnering with manufacturers like Marvell for production indicates a move towards greater control over its AI hardware supply chain. Improved Azure AI capabilities, fueled by advanced chips, mean faster processing, lower costs, and more powerful AI services available to developers and businesses globally. Enhancing User Experience with Windows AI Features The integration of AI directly into the Windows operating system is a significant trend. Windows AI features, powered by Copilot and potentially new underlying models, aim to make the PC experience more intuitive and efficient. The rumored ‘agentic’ capabilities are a prime example, allowing the OS to anticipate needs and perform actions proactively. This could range from simple tasks like summarizing documents to more complex operations involving multiple applications. These advancements are part of Microsoft’s broader strategy to position Windows as an AI-first platform, leveraging local processing power alongside cloud-based AI to deliver responsive and intelligent experiences. The Future of AI Integration Across Microsoft Microsoft Build 2025 is expected to provide a clear vision for the future of AI integration across the company’s entire product portfolio. From consumer-facing tools like Windows and Microsoft 365 to the enterprise power of Azure and Dynamics, AI is set to become a fundamental layer. The potential introduction of Microsoft’s own MAI models, offered via API, could signal a strategic shift, positioning Microsoft not just as a consumer of AI models but also as a provider, competing in the foundational model space. This widespread AI integration aims to create a more connected, intelligent, and productive ecosystem for developers and end-users alike. In conclusion, Microsoft Build 2025 is shaping up to be a landmark event focused heavily on AI. We anticipate major announcements regarding the evolution of Copilot AI, significant upgrades to Windows AI features, and advancements in Azure AI hardware like the potential Maia 2 chip. The conference will likely highlight Microsoft’s strategy for deep AI integration across its products and services, aiming to deliver enhanced capabilities and drive innovation in the developer community and beyond.

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1. Dogecoin's (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year. According to CoinGecko , DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins). The memecoin’s market strength has been coupled with strong onchain insights. Data from CryptoQuant noted that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over 90 days, has been ""taker buyer dominant.” It indicates more aggressive buying than selling, a pattern last seen in November 2024, leading to DOGE’s breakout rally of 385% to $0.48 in Q4, 2024. DOGE spot taker CVD. Source: CryptoQuant Similarly, the long-term holder net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL), which tracks unrealized profits or losses for DOGE holders with a lifespan of at least 155 days, recently crossed 0.5 for the first time since March 1, 2025, turning to optimistic or “belief” sentiment. A NUPL above 0.5 means most holders are in profit, signaling confidence and a reduced likelihood of selling.

The Trump administration was billed as the first pro-crypto US government, and Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached an all-time high of $106,000. Despite this, the first quarter of the year has been characterized by stumbling financial markets in the face of impending trade wars and global political instability. Crypto, which has broadly positioned itself as a hedge against such concerns, has struggled in-step with traditional markets too. You might also like: Mass crypto adoption requires transparency and education | Opinion Some may argue that this is a sign crypto isn’t meeting the tantalizing use case for cryptocurrency: a decentralized alternative that operates 24/7, unbound by the decisions of any single government, fund, or corporate actor. But while crypto has also struggled in-step with traditional markets, it has also shown resilience, on an upward trajectory in Q2, amid BlackRock’s investment in tokenized futures, and a multitude of emerging crypto ETF products. However, we can concede that rather than taking full advantage of this moment, the uncomfortable truth is that crypto is still stuck in the blocks. Despite the clear product-market fit, today’s ecosystem remains a playground for enthusiasts and fund managers, with more proofs-of-concept than actual scalable infrastructure that you could reasonably expect the average Joe to use. Global DeFi is a long way off. Crypto isn’t ready Consider the scale of what’s at stake: the top five global asset managers oversee $30 trillion in assets. If they tokenized just 10% of their portfolios, crypto’s current market cap would double overnight, transforming the industry from a niche experiment into the backbone of mainstream finance. The question is how to onboard such a wealth of capital. Up until now, we have had institutional experimentation: hedge funds swooping in for fast gains with minimal capital. This is not real adoption; it’s still just “playing.” In crypto’s supposed breakthrough year, the industry has been passing time with memecoin mania and neatly packaged ETFs, endless speculative trading fueled by retail hype. It should have been building for mass adoption; it is imperative to not just encourage institutions to onboard, but ordinary people, too. For DeFi to become mainstream, it needs retail investors who can act independently of institutional capital, with their vast numbers depegging it from the whims of policy and elite capital markets. If crypto fails to do this, or turns to the task too late, we will simply be left with “alt-Fi”: a speculative market for the same old investors to trade on a new generation of tech. The talk of a return to fundamentals is promising; it squares us back with the original goal of building a unified network capable of seamlessly tokenizing, managing, and programming global assets. Within such a structure, not only would institutions lend the weight of their liquidity, but billions of everyday users could finally access a financial system without friction, gatekeeping, or mediation. By focusing on onboarding users to intuitive interfaces, backed up by hyperscalable L1s and robust infrastructure, DeFi could build the foundation for mainstream adoption and move past enthusiastic experiments towards a refuge from increasingly volatile global markets. The road to success So, how do we get there? DeFi needs three things to reach the critical inflection point for mass adoption: a UX that can streamline complex actions into manageable, intuitive systems, a backend that can sustain the demands of a global user base, and a legislative landscape that can enable innovation to flourish. Utility The biggest obstacle to mass adoption is currently UX. DeFi’s complex interfaces, or even lack of interfaces, make it unusable at times for a non-specialist user. Many premier asset holders are unable or unwilling to maximize their portfolio, with complex bridges, staking, and swap mechanisms acting as both a barrier to trust as well as ability. Interventions with AI-based projects that act upon users’ expressed goals (“swap assets cheaply”), and wallets with human-readable transactions instead of cryptic hashes, will make DeFi as intuitive as PayPal, and drive user onboarding to the moon. And once billions can engage without friction, demand will force infrastructure, both technical and legislative, to catch up fast. Infrastructure But of course, DeFi needs the pipes to work. It is not enough to build usable interfaces: the backend has to support them. When billions of users arrive, DeFi has to be ready. Next-gen L1s like Solana ( SOL ) and Aptos ( APT ) claim thousands of transactions per second, but Solana’s struggles under high demand during the $TRUMP episode exposed limits to both testing and scaling. Testing should be undertaken in real-world conditions with accurate transaction metrics like swaps per second (SPS). Increased focus on scaling solutions like state sharding and parallel processing will boost throughput while preserving decentralization. These innovations are necessary if we are going to get to true scalability: one million SPS is the goal. This is where we need to be to support DeFi at the global scale. Inflection point These impending UX and L1 improvements are just the lock gates opening: once intuitive systems and scalable networks are in place, capital will arrive in floods. The premise of DeFi isn’t a hard sell; everyone knows TradFi is only serving the few. The future of finance, a universal asset layer, needs accessible systems for everyday users and reliable infrastructure for the big players to act. This applies to the legislature as much as infrastructure. The legislative sandboxes recently announced for crypto exchanges in the US are fundamentally important: when demand improves, DeFi will reach an inflection point, one that it must be ready for, and the legislative trial period will have to be over; systems must already be in place to support it. Conclusion The current economic turbulence could be the catalyst crypto needs, making blockchain’s value proposition increasingly compelling. Yet without scalable solutions ready to handle massive capital inflows, this opportunity could slip away: the inflection point is looming. However, once the capital and user base are there, and the safety nets are in place, the dominoes will fall. Investors and institutions will have the confidence they need to enter the market in a meaningful way, and their customers soon after. But to get there, L1 innovators must prioritize fundamentals now, crafting systems for institutions and everyday users, or DeFi will miss this historic wave. Following a roadmap for intuitive UX, hyperscalable L1s, and legislative clarity, DeFi can build the unified network it promised and avoid the trap of “alt-Fi” that lies waiting in the wings.

44546356,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159754,1747098656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Crypto Regulation: Alarming Warning on Blockchain Favoritism,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-regulation-warning/,"The world of finance is constantly evolving, with new technologies pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Among these, blockchain stands out, promising revolutionary changes to everything from payments to asset settlement. But as Blockchain in Finance gains traction, regulators face complex questions. At a recent SEC crypto roundtable, a significant SEC Warning was issued by Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, cautioning against the potential pitfalls of regulators appearing to favor specific technologies like blockchain. This sparked a lively debate, highlighting the ongoing tension between fostering innovation and maintaining regulatory neutrality in the face of burgeoning Financial Technology . Understanding the Core Debate: SEC Crypto Regulation and Neutrality The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a crucial role in overseeing financial markets, protecting investors, and maintaining market integrity. As digital assets and blockchain technology have grown, so too has the complexity of SEC Crypto Regulation . The fundamental challenge for the SEC, and regulators globally, is how to apply existing securities laws to novel technologies and assets, or whether new frameworks are needed. Commissioner Crenshaw’s comments cut to the heart of a critical regulatory principle: neutrality. Regulatory neutrality suggests that rules should apply equally to all market participants and technologies performing similar functions, without favoring one over another. The concern raised by Crenshaw is that if the SEC, through its actions or statements, appears to actively promote or endorse blockchain technology specifically, it could compromise this neutrality. This could inadvertently create an uneven playing field, potentially disadvantaging established or alternative technologies, or even newer innovations that might emerge later. Her perspective contrasts with others, including SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce, who have publicly acknowledged the potential benefits and market efficiencies that blockchain technology could bring to Traditional Finance . This divergence of views within the commission underscores the difficulty in navigating the integration of cutting-edge Financial Technology into long-standing financial systems. Why the SEC Warning Matters for Traditional Finance and Beyond Commissioner Crenshaw’s SEC Warning isn’t just about theoretical regulatory principles; it has practical implications for how Blockchain in Finance develops. If regulators are perceived as pushing for blockchain adoption, it could: Influence Market Behavior: Companies might feel pressured to adopt blockchain even if it’s not the most suitable or efficient solution for their specific needs, simply to align with perceived regulatory direction. Stifle Competition: Favoring one technology could discourage innovation in alternative distributed ledger technologies or entirely different technological approaches to financial problems. Create Regulatory Arbitrage: It could lead to situations where regulatory treatment is based on the underlying technology rather than the function being performed or the risks involved, potentially creating loopholes or undue burdens. Impact Investor Perception: If the SEC seems to favor blockchain, it might inadvertently lead investors to believe blockchain-based projects are inherently safer or more legitimate, regardless of individual project risks. Maintaining neutrality allows the SEC to focus on regulating the *activity* or *function* (e.g., issuing securities, operating an exchange, providing custody) rather than the specific *technology* used to perform it. This technology-agnostic approach is often considered the gold standard for regulators dealing with rapid technological change. Exploring the Potential of Blockchain in Traditional Finance Despite the regulatory caution, the potential benefits of integrating Blockchain in Finance are significant and are precisely why figures like Chair Atkins and Commissioner Peirce highlight its promise. The appeal lies in blockchain’s core characteristics: Efficiency: Streamlining processes like clearing and settlement, reducing reliance on intermediaries, and enabling near-instantaneous transactions. Transparency: Providing a shared, immutable ledger that can increase visibility and auditability for certain types of transactions. Cost Reduction: Lowering operational costs associated with traditional financial infrastructure, reconciliation, and manual processes. Increased Speed: Accelerating transaction times compared to multi-day settlement cycles in some traditional markets. Tokenization: The ability to represent real-world assets (like real estate, art, or stocks) as digital tokens on a blockchain, potentially increasing liquidity and fractional ownership. Major financial institutions are actively exploring these possibilities. Projects involving the tokenization of bonds, the use of distributed ledgers for interbank payments, and the exploration of digital currencies by central banks (Central Bank Digital Currencies – CBDCs) are all examples of how Traditional Finance is engaging with this new Financial Technology . The Balancing Act: Innovation vs. Investor Protection under SEC Crypto Regulation The challenge for the SEC is finding the right balance. How can they facilitate the responsible adoption of potentially beneficial technologies like blockchain without compromising core regulatory principles or creating new risks? This is the central tension in the ongoing debate around SEC Crypto Regulation . Regulators must grapple with several factors: Identifying Securities: Determining which digital assets or blockchain-based products constitute securities under existing law (like the Howey Test). Market Integrity: Addressing risks like market manipulation, fraud, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in nascent technologies. Investor Protection: Ensuring adequate disclosures, preventing scams, and providing recourse for investors in a complex and often opaque market. Interoperability: Considering how new blockchain systems will interact with existing Traditional Finance infrastructure. Commissioner Crenshaw’s point is that focusing too narrowly on *promoting* blockchain itself might distract from these fundamental regulatory responsibilities. The focus, from her perspective, should remain on the regulated activities and ensuring they meet required standards, regardless of the tech stack used. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Future of Blockchain in Finance For businesses operating or seeking to operate with Blockchain in Finance , and for investors looking at this space, the SEC’s internal debate offers key insights: Focus on Function, Not Just Technology: When developing or evaluating blockchain projects, understand the regulatory implications based on the *function* the project performs (e.g., offering an investment contract, facilitating trading) rather than assuming blockchain status provides a regulatory pass. Compliance is Paramount: Assume that existing securities laws and regulations likely apply, even if the technology is new. Engage with legal counsel familiar with both financial regulation and blockchain. Watch Regulatory Developments Closely: The SEC’s approach to SEC Crypto Regulation is still evolving. Pay attention to speeches, enforcement actions, and proposed rules. Understand the Risks: Be aware of the technological risks (smart contract bugs, network vulnerabilities) and market risks (volatility, liquidity) specific to blockchain-based systems. The differing opinions within the SEC are not necessarily a sign of dysfunction, but rather a reflection of the complex and novel issues presented by Financial Technology . It highlights the rigorous debate happening behind the scenes as regulators try to formulate a coherent approach. Examples of Blockchain Exploration in Traditional Finance While regulatory clarity is still developing, Traditional Finance institutions are not waiting on the sidelines. Here are some areas where Blockchain in Finance is being actively explored or piloted: Area of Finance Blockchain Application Potential Benefit Payments Cross-border payments, interbank settlements Faster, cheaper transactions Securities Settlement Tokenized assets, atomic settlement Reduced counterparty risk, faster settlement Trade Finance Digitizing letters of credit, supply chain finance Increased transparency, reduced fraud Asset Management Tokenization of funds, fractional ownership Increased liquidity, broader access These examples demonstrate the tangible interest in leveraging blockchain’s capabilities, even as the regulatory environment, shaped by discussions like the one prompting the SEC Warning , continues to take shape. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Finance and Technology Commissioner Crenshaw’s caution serves as a vital reminder that as we embrace new Financial Technology , the foundational principles of regulation must remain paramount. While Blockchain in Finance offers exciting potential for efficiency and innovation within Traditional Finance , the path forward requires careful consideration of regulatory neutrality, investor protection, and market stability. The ongoing dialogue within the SEC and among regulators globally is crucial. It’s not about stifling innovation but ensuring that it occurs within a framework that safeguards the financial system and those who participate in it. The future of SEC Crypto Regulation will likely continue to be shaped by these debates, striving to find the delicate balance between harnessing the power of technology and upholding the integrity of financial markets.

Ever wondered if the Big Apple could become a major player in the digital asset space? Well, it looks like New York City is making a serious move to position itself as a global NYC crypto hub . Mayor Eric Adams is leading the charge, actively calling on Crypto companies NYC to set up shop and contribute to the city’s technological future. Eric Adams Crypto Vision: Building a Hub New York City Mayor Eric Adams isn’t shy about his ambition to transform the city into a leading center for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Speaking at a press briefing, Mayor Adams emphasized his desire to attract innovative crypto firms NYC to the city, aiming to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and keep New York at the forefront of the global financial landscape. His vision involves more than just attracting businesses; it’s about fostering an ecosystem where crypto innovation can thrive alongside traditional finance. This move signals a clear intent from the city’s leadership to engage with the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, acknowledging its potential impact on the economy and society. Announcing the First NYC Crypto Summit As part of this ambitious push, Mayor Adams also announced plans for the city’s first-ever NYC Crypto Summit . Scheduled for the following week after his May 12th announcement, the summit is designed as a crucial platform for dialogue and collaboration. The goal? To bring together city officials, regulators, and leaders from the cryptocurrency industry to explore how they can work together effectively. Think of it as a brainstorming session on a grand scale. Topics likely on the agenda include: Integrating blockchain technology into city services. Understanding and refining New York crypto regulation . Identifying opportunities for job creation and talent development in the crypto sector. Discussing the challenges and opportunities for Crypto companies NYC . The summit represents a proactive step by the city to understand the needs of the industry and signal its willingness to engage directly with stakeholders. Navigating New York Crypto Regulation: The BitLicense Question While Mayor Adams is enthusiastic about the potential of becoming a NYC crypto hub , he also acknowledges the complexities, particularly concerning regulation. New York State has some of the strictest rules in the country for cryptocurrency businesses, notably the BitLicense requirement. This license, mandated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), has been a point of contention within the industry, with some firms finding it overly burdensome and costly. Mayor Adams reportedly expressed both support for the need for regulation to protect consumers and maintain stability, and caution regarding the impact of overly strict rules on innovation. Finding the right balance is key. How can New York protect its residents and financial system while still being an attractive place for crypto firms NYC to operate and grow? This delicate balance is a major challenge that the city, and likely the NYC Crypto Summit , will need to address head-on. Attracting Crypto Companies NYC: Benefits and Challenges So, why would Crypto companies NYC choose New York? The city offers undeniable advantages: Talent Pool: Access to a vast pool of financial, technical, and legal talent. Financial Capital Status: Being at the heart of global finance provides unparalleled networking and partnership opportunities. Infrastructure: Robust technological and physical infrastructure. However, challenges remain: Regulatory Environment: The strict New York crypto regulation , including BitLicense, can be a deterrent. Cost of Doing Business: New York is an expensive city, which can impact operational costs for startups and established firms alike. Competition: Other states and cities are also actively trying to attract crypto businesses with potentially more favorable regulatory climates. Mayor Adams’ call and the upcoming NYC Crypto Summit are clear signals that the city is ready to tackle these challenges and work towards creating a more welcoming environment. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Digital Future Mayor Eric Adams’ initiative marks a significant moment for New York City’s engagement with the cryptocurrency world. By openly inviting Crypto companies NYC and announcing the first NYC Crypto Summit , he is taking concrete steps towards realizing the vision of a leading NYC crypto hub . While the path involves navigating complex issues like New York crypto regulation , the commitment to collaboration and innovation demonstrated by the mayor is a positive sign for the future of digital assets in the city. The success of this endeavor will depend on effective dialogue, balanced policymaking, and the willingness of both the city and the industry to work together to overcome obstacles and capitalize on the immense potential that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology offer.

It comes around nine months after Anchorage introduced a stablecoin rewards program for institutions holding the PayPal USD ( PYUSD ) stablecoin. Mountain Protocol’s USDM to wind down As part of the acquisition, Mountain Protocol said it would begin an “orderly wind-down process” for USDM, which operates as a yield-bearing stablecoin. Mountain Protocol said it ceased minting the stablecoin on May 12 but noted that USDM rewards will remain active for another 30 days. After that, the reward rate will be set to 0% APY. The stablecoin issuer’s customers can redeem their USDM through the firm’s platform, while other USDM holders are encouraged to swap the stablecoin for other tokens on exchanges. Related: ‘Dark stablecoins’ could emerge as regulations tighten Mountain Protocol’s Ethereum-based USDM is not to be confused with Mehen Finance’s USDM stablecoin, which runs on the Cardano network. Mountain Protocol’s USDM saw considerable success shortly after launching in late 2023, rising to a $155 million market cap by March 2024, according to RWA.xyz . However, its market cap has since fallen below $50 million. RWA.xyz estimates there are around 10,820 USDM holders.

Traditional finance giants are integrating tokenized assets into their operations. Regulatory clarity is crucial for unlocking global capital markets through tokenization. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to deepen its engagement with crypto regulation through its fourth Crypto Task Force roundtable, held today at 1 p.m. ET. This session, titled Tokenization: Moving Assets Onchain, spotlights the merging of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This aims to explore how blockchain-based tokenization is reshaping capital markets and asset management strategies. The event features SEC Chairman Paul Atkins’ keynote and discussions with leading voices from both legacy financial institutions and crypto-native firms.

There will be background checks that need to be completed before the investor’s attendance is confirmed. “The first Competition is officially over,” the project posted to X . “If you were in the top 220 on the leaderboard , ch eck the email you signed up with for details on the Dinner with President Trump as soon as possible. There will be background checks that need to be completed before your attendance is confirmed.” This development was the culmination of Trump’s weekslong promotion of the contest, which has drawn allegations that he is using his position to enrich his family business while opening himself up to foreign influence. The contest was stratospheric upon the meme coin’s introduction in January 2025, quickly drawing traders and Trump fans. The coin reached an all-time high of $75 once before dropping to around $12.63 recently. Participants gambled around $148 million in an attempt to finish in the top 220. Only a few million dollars were spent to score a place at the dinner table with Trump. Lawmakers attack Trump’s pay-to-play crypto strategy Trump’s crypto enterprise has drawn criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs, and even the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential conflicts of interest and allegations of corruption . The contest to dine with the president has intensified those concerns, creating a bidding war for direct access to the Head of State. Senator Richard Blumenthal , De mocrat of Connecticut, has written a letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company behind the coin, asking for answers. He claims possible conflicts of interest and violations of federal law. Blumenthal said the event was not just another one of those whacky crypto promotions but something that raised serious ethical concerns. The dispute is particularly heated because some of the largest investors of the meme coin are said to be from overseas. Reports indicate d that many wallets were making massive purchases via offshore crypto exchanges unavailable to US users. This raised questions about money from overseas gaining special US access to the president of the US. Critics have voiced concerns that the event could be skirting campaign finance regulations by offering valuable access to Trump in return for financial contributions—albeit through unconventional means rather than traditional campaign donations. Still, the Trump campaign and the businesses connected to it say they abide by all rules. A spokesman said the president’s crypto assets are in a trust managed by his children and are separate from campaign operations. TRUMP coin reacts to NFT rewards and market surges The $TRUMP cryptocurrency was created in mid-January and boasts a market capitalization of over $2bn after months of investors buying into the heavily promoted coin. A Trump family-linked company and another firm own a majority of the coins. The TRUMP meme coin project is teasing an additional reward beyond the dinner — digital collectibles. The project announced that everyone who kept the same number of tokens as they had at the end of the contest would receive a Trump Diamond Hand limited edition NFT, which is described as very special and rare. This news led to another surge in price, with some market watchers reporting a 71% rise in TRUMP’s price on their terms upon announcement. Yet, the token is still extremely volatile. Crypto analysis company Chainalysis said 58 TRUMP meme coin wallets have more than $10 million in earnings per wallet. But there’s also been a downside to the buzz. CNBC reported that some 764,000 wallets are underwater on the token. The TRUMP coin was among the meme-inspired political tokens that proliferated in a wave of speculation launched by Fight Fight Fight LLC. It builds off the momentum of Trump’s recent effort to court younger voters and digital-first supporters, but it also underscores just how murky the world of crypto-politics can be.

A ZKsync-related X account posted on May 13, confirming the accounts for ZKsync and Matter Labs were compromised, warning users not to interact after the accounts shared links to a fake airdrop in an apparent phishing scam. Other X users had warned the ZKsync X account was compromised. Source: pseudo The hacked ZKsync and Matter Labs then both posted a fake statement claiming ZKsync was under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and that the Treasury Department could impose sanctions on the platform. Matter Labs communications head Lynnette Nolan confirmed to Cointelegraph that the now-deleted X post “is not legit” and both accounts are now “fully back in the control of the team.” “Shoutout to the zksync hackers. Instead of dropping a token and stealing a few bucks they decided to scare the living shit out of onchain degens,” crypto startup g8keep co-founder Harrison Leggio, who goes by “Pop Punk,” posted to X. Source: Harrison Leggio The fake statement was seemingly aimed at crashing the price of the platform’s self-titled token, ZKsync ( ZK ), which has fallen around 2% in the last hour amid the X account breach, according to CoinGecko. The SEC has investigated crypto companies in the past, and many of these firms have chosen to publicly disclose when they’ve been investigated by the regulator. The SEC has stopped many of its probes under the Trump administration, with Crypto.com, Immutable, OpenSea and RobinHood Crypto, among others, confirming the agency had ended investigations. ZK is down 6.4% over the last day to trade at around 7 cents, cooling from a nearly 38.5% rally it’s enjoyed over the past week. Related: US prosecutors want 2 years for SEC X account hacker Matter Labs’ Nolan said the firm was looking into how the X accounts were breached, and believed it was via “compromised delegated accounts,” which allow users limited access to an X account, allowing them to post on its behalf. Two hacks in as many months It’s the second compromise of ZKsync-controlled platforms since April. On April 15, an attacker breached the admin account of ZKsync’s airdrop distribution contract and used a function to mint 111 million unclaimed ZK tokens, worth approximately $5 million at the time. The hack happened amid the platform handing out 17.5% of ZK’s supply to ecosystem participants. The attacker later returned 90% of the stolen tokens , agreeing to keep 10% as a bounty.

A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40× margin. At Bitcoin’s current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It’s also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain. Many gamblers are shorting $BTC with high leverage! 0x51d9 opened a $93M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $105,690. 0x5D2F opened a $44M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $112,660.https://t.co/WcW1u4FdWz… pic.twitter.com/pAf1LEMnZp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 Second Whale Holding At Crossroads Another account took a $44 million short at $103,494.40, again using 40× cross margin. Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it’s wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin’s climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40× margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains.

As retail interest spikes and high-utility projects take the spotlight, a few names are rising above the noise. BlockDAG, Cold Wallet, and Dragoin are leading the charge with real-world use cases and eye-popping ROI potential. From BlockDAG’s viral mobile mining to Cold Wallet’s zero-knowledge privacy features, and Dragoin’s fantasy-driven play-to-earn experience, these aren’t just tokens, they are ecosystems in motion. Each one is carving out a distinct niche while delivering serious value beyond hype. With presale prices still within reach but climbing fast, the time to move is now. These projects are not waiting for the spotlight! 1. BlockDAG ($BDAG): Mobile Mining Powers a $237M Presale Surge BlockDAG is setting the pace in the presale coin market, combining real traction with a product users can touch. Its X1 mobile mining app is turning heads fast, racking up over 1 million users who are already mining straight from their smartphones. No complex rigs, no cloud subscriptions: just tap, mine, and grow. That accessibility is giving BlockDAG (BDAG) the kind of viral momentum most projects can only dream of. The numbers speak for themselves. The presale has officially crossed $237 million, with 20.1 billion BDAG coins sold and Batch 28 now active. A limited-time price of $0.0019 runs until May 13, while the current batch price is already $0.0262. Early adopters from Batch 1 are sitting on a jaw-dropping 2,520 percent ROI, and the momentum is still building. As BlockDAG heads toward major exchange listings and continues scaling its mobile user base, it is no longer just a presale opportunity. It is the standard by which every other launch is being measured. 2. Cold Wallet ($CWT): 4,900 Percent ROI and Real Privacy in Your Pocket Cold Wallet is shaking up the presale meme coin space with a mission that cuts through the noise, real privacy, real control, and no compromises. While other projects chase trends, Cold Wallet is delivering institutional-level security to everyday users. Its wallet acts like cold storage, blocking data leaks, trackers, and IP exposure right out of the gate. With zero-knowledge proofs baked in, users can trade, stake, and interact with DeFi without revealing a single detail about their wallets or activity. But it is not just about protection. $CWT is at the core of a growing ecosystem, powering governance, gated access, and long-term incentives designed to reward serious holders. Now in Stage 4 of its presale at $0.00743, Cold Wallet is eyeing a projected 4,900 percent ROI by launch. For early participants, the value play here is hard to ignore. 3. Dragoin ($DDGN): Where Memes, Dragons, and 6,700 Percent ROI Collide Dragoin brings fantasy flair to the presale meme coin world, blending Game of Thrones vibes with on-chain gameplay. Built on Ethereum, it features a Telegram-based play-to-earn game where users battle with dragons and earn $DDGN tokens. With a renounced smart contract and real utility, it is more than just meme hype, it is a gamified ecosystem built for engagement. Now in Stage 4 with tokens priced at $0.000044, Dragoin projects a 6,700 percent ROI at launch. Unsold tokens will be permanently burned, adding real scarcity. For those chasing high upside with storytelling and strategy, this one delivers. What The Future Holds The window is closing fast on these top presale coin contenders. BlockDAG is scaling at full speed with its viral X1 mining app and massive presale success. Cold Wallet is raising the bar for crypto privacy, and Dragoin is turning heads with its fantasy-fueled, play-to-earn model. Each one brings something different to the table, but all three are backed by traction, transparency, and time-sensitive pricing. Whether you’re hunting for a 100x breakout or a presale coin with real-world utility, these projects are showing up while others stall. Miss them now, and you might be watching from the sidelines as they take off.

The price of XRP climbed back above $2.61 for the first time since March 6th, marking a strong recovery for the digital asset. However, at the time of writing, XRP has slipped back to the fourth position. At the same time, market experts have noticed a positive change in XRP’s price charts. Over the past few months, XRP’s price was affected by a bearish divergence, which kept its growth limited. But in recent days, this pattern seems to have ended. The 3-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP has now moved above its previous levels, suggesting that the coin is gaining strength and could continue moving upwards. XRP Price Analysis: Signs of a Bullish Breakout On the daily chart, XRP is trying to break above a key resistance level around $2.45 to $2.46. However, to confirm a breakout, it needs to close a daily candle above this line. If it succeeds and manages to cross above $2.58 to $2.59, it could mean a major bullish trend. If that happens, XRP might not only rise in the short term but could also continue to perform well over the next few weeks or even months. On its way up, the price could face some hurdles around levels like $2.77, $2.95, $3.15, and $3.30. $5 In Sight? Some analysts suggest we may already be in a direct bullish phase, with the price aiming straight toward the $5 mark. Either way, as long as support holds, the focus remains on higher prices. In the short term, XRP may continue to stretch upward, with a new micro target zone set between $2.77 and $2.97. This could mark the next area of interest for traders looking for bullish confirmation.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 02:10:49

With strong fundamentals, technical strength, and surging community interest, these coins are fast becoming must-watch plays for traders and investors. XRP: Riding Legal Wins and Institutional Demand After Ripple’s own legal battle against the U.S. in a ruling victory, XRP has captured many headlines. SEC. XRP Trading Above $2.21 Sees Whale Accumulation. According to data from Santiment, XRP whale accumulation has reached extreme levels. Moreover, large whale holders now control over 12% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. Analysts are looking at price targets of $3, $4.85, and perhaps $6.22. XRP’s future is looking good. Although it is a little volatile in the short term, it may likely reach Ethereum’s market cap if it runs at the current pace for a couple of weeks. Kaspa (KAS): Underrated Gem With BlockDAG Innovation Kaspa is gaining recognition as one of the top proof-of-work networks in the market. The KAS price forecast shows strong support around $0.55, and there is resistance near $0.083. Thus, the price is likely to push towards $0.11 later in the year. For Q3 and Q4 monthly prediction remains positive, the high volume of trading is consistent and also a growing developer ecosystem. Analysts keep an eye on Kaspa as a potential dark horse in the next bull cycle. Solana (SOL): Technical Powerhouse on the Rise Solana is making a comeback, currently trading at $169.43, after easing from the April dip to $115. The technical indicators are suggesting that buyers are in control. It has an RSI of 73.70, MACD crossover is bullish, and the price action is above the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Experts in the industry are aimed at a target price range of $180–$200 in the short term and can even rise to $350–$370 in the long term, should momentum and ecosystem growth continue. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Contender As the crypto market prepares for its next wave, XRP, Kaspa, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as key contenders to lead the charge. Together, they reflect the perfect mix of established strength and emerging opportunity — making them top picks for the next altcoin cycle.

Trading at $2.43, there are a few reasons why XRP is rallying. . One of the biggest factors is a new bill being discussed in Missouri called House Bill 594. If it passes, it would let people in the state deduct all capital gains taxes from profits made on things like Bitcoin and XRP. That means if someone makes money trading these, they won’t have to pay taxes on those profits — and that’s huge news for crypto investors in the U.S. XRP Adoption Continues to Rise in 2025 Another reason is that more people are holding XRP than ever before. So far in 2025, the number of XRP holders has gone up by 11%, showing growing interest in the coin. On top of that, XRP is now being accepted as a payment method on the travel booking site Travala.com. That means people can use XRP to book hotels and flights, giving it more real-world use. The Ripple team is also making progress on the technology side. XRP is being integrated with Cosmos and building something called EVM sidechains, which basically makes it easier for different blockchains to connect and work together. Plus, Ripple’s custody service now supports a new system for safer storage called shared MPC wallets. They’re also doing well in the tokenization space — that’s where real-world assets like property or stocks are turned into digital tokens on the XRP Ledger. Lastly, on the price prediction side, analyst Ali Charts said that if XRP can break out of its current chart pattern, it might jump as high as $15. Right now, technical indicators like RSI and stochastic RSI are showing bullish signals, hinting that a breakout could be coming soon.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 02:57:18

Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading – an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‘relatively flat’ despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum’s case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH’s new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Insanely Undervalued’ As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking – Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC’s trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 – including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). At press time, ETH trades at $2,555, up 3% in the past 24 hours.

The latest move brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 6,796 BTC. Details From The Latest Buy The development was shared by CEO Simon Gerovich on X. He revealed that the firm has bought 1,271 BTC at a price of $102,119 per coin. In total, Metaplanet has spent around $608.2 million on Bitcoin so far, with an average cost of $89,492 per coin. The company measures its progress using BTC Yield, a key metric that shows the percentage increase in Bitcoin held per fully diluted share. Between January and April 2025, Metaplanet has already hit a 170.0% BTC Yield year-to-date. The Tokyo-listed firm’s accumulation strategy has picked up speed in recent months. Just days before the latest buy, it had purchased 555 BTC on May 7. In April, it made four separate buys, adding up to 18,586 BTC. March was even busier, with six Bitcoin purchases totaling 18,925 BTC. Notably, each was larger than the one before. To fund its Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet has relied on bond issuance and stock acquisition rights. Its most recent fundraising effort, the 13th Series of Ordinary Bonds, secured $25 million on May 7. With 6,796 BTC now in its reserves, the outfit is 68% of the way toward its 2025 goal of 10,000 BTC. Its broader ambition is to accumulate 21,000 BTC, equivalent to about 0.1 percent of the flagship cryptocurrency’s total supply. Following the latest announcement, Google Finance data shows that the company’s shares rose by 4.96% in the last 24 hours, and is trading at ¥550.00. Metaplanet’s Performance Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has led to frequent comparisons with Strategy. Blockstream CEO Adam Back has argued that the company’s approach is even outperforming its rival’s. In a May 10 X post , Back referenced a metric called “months to modified NAV cover,” which tracks how quickly Bitcoin gains can offset a company’s net asset value. According to him, Metaplanet achieved a two times return on its Bitcoin position in just three months, while it took Strategy 19 months to reach similar results. He also noted that the former’s modified NAV is increasing 3.8 times faster. Based on this growth, the CEO suggested the firm’s share price could rise from 533 yen to 1,340 yen. Meanwhile, CEO Simon Gerovich recently pointed out that the company now holds more Bitcoin than El Salvador. In a post on X, he remarked: “From humble beginnings to rivaling nation-states, we’re just getting started.” El Salvador currently ranks as the sixth-largest nation-state holder of the cryptocurrency, with 6,714 BTC valued at around $642 million.

Firms such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy have bought more Bitcoin ( BTC ) this year than any other category of investor, with overall corporate holdings growth totalling 157,000 BTC, worth around $16 billion at current prices, according to Bitcoin investment firm River. Strategy makes up 77% of the group's growth, the firm reported on X on May 12, before adding that it's not just big companies. “We’re seeing businesses across all industries sign up to River. They’re aligned with Bitcoin and how it can change their future,” the firm noted. The next largest category after corporations was ETFs, which have grown their net Bitcoin by 49,000 BTC, or $5 billion worth, reported River. Following that were governments with around 19,000 BTC in growth, and retail traders or individuals had seen a decline of 247,000 in Bitcoin holdings this year, it reported. Change in BTC ownership in 2025. Source: River Overall, there has been a 154% growth in business ownership since 2024, the firm stated, breaking things down by business category for its own clients. It revealed that finance and investment firms are the largest buyers of the asset, with 35.7% of the total, followed by tech firms on 16.8%, professional and consulting companies accounted for 16.5%, and the remainder were real estate, non-profits, consumer and industrial, healthcare, and energy, agriculture, and transportation firms. Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: Bloomberg There have been several large corporate purchases recently, with Strategy scooping up a whopping 13,390 Bitcoin for $1.34 billion and Metaplanet adding a further 1,241 BTC to its treasury, which surpassed that of El Salvador on May 12. Newcomers to the Bitcoin market in 2025 include video streaming platform Rumble, which made its first purchase in March, Hong Kong construction firm Ming Shing, and Hong Kong investment firm HK Asia Holdings Limited. At least twelve public companies bought Bitcoin for the first time in Q1 2025, reported Bitwise in April. The firm added that the amount of Bitcoin held on the books of publicly traded companies rose by 16% for the period, with more than 95,000 Bitcoin added to corporate portfolios for the period. Is Bitcoin becoming deflationary? These big corporate purchases of the asset will put pressure on the supply and demand since supply is finite, and miners can only produce 450 coins per day, say analysts. CryptoQuant CEO and market analyst Ki Young Ju said Strategy is accumulating Bitcoin at a faster rate than total miner output, giving the asset a -2.3% annual deflation rate. Meanwhile, author Adam Livingston recently said that Strategy is synthetically halving Bitcoin by outpacing miner supply through high demand.

After careful verification and review of original sources, we can confirm — these rumors are completely false . Where Did the Meme Coin Rumor Start? The speculation began when Ran Neuner , founder of Crypto Banter , posted on X that a Truth Social meme coin could be launching within 72 hours. He compared it to the already existing “TRUMP” meme coin on the Solana network, triggering widespread discussion about a potential Trump-led crypto push. This claim rapidly gained attention across social media platforms, amplified by users and communities eager for new meme coin opportunities. Influencers React, But Denials Follow Crypto influencer Wendy O responded to the speculation by calling the idea “silly,” suggesting that if Truth Social wanted to support a coin, it could simply stick with the existing TRUMP token. Shortly after the rumor picked up steam, it was debunked by both Donald Trump and the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project, which is officially backed by the Trump family. WLFI and Trump Set the Record Straight WLFI issued a firm denial on X, stating: “There is no new Trump crypto project. WLFI is the only DeFi project backed by the Trumps. Anyone else pushing fake tokens is just a scammer trying to take advantage of people.” — Source: World Liberty Financial on X Donald Trump also issued a statement confirming that there is no truth whatsoever to the meme coin claims. He warned users to be cautious about fake information circulating online. What’s Real and What’s Not? Here’s what is actually verified: Truth Social is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and is listed on Nasdaq. Earlier this year, Trump launched two meme coins: TRUMP and MELANIA , both of which have declined in value. WLFI is the only officially Trump-backed crypto project. There is no new Truth Social meme coin being launched. This viral meme coin rumor is baseless and has been publicly denied by all credible parties involved.

Which is The Top Trending Crypto Set to Explode in 2025!",https://thecoinrise.com/chainlink-xmr-tao-or-blockdag-which-is-the-top-trending-crypto-set-to-explode-in-2025/,"In today’s fast-moving crypto space, finding real innovation is key. As the race to join the top 10 heats up, projects like Chainlink, Monero, and Bittensor are pushing resistance levels. Meanwhile, a rising name, BlockDAG is gaining attention with a mix of tech strength and low entry cost. While LINK and TAO aim for breakout moments, BlockDAG is making waves during its presale. It’s getting noticed for its Ethereum-ready tech, successful CertiK audit, and a firm deadline on its limited-time $0.0019 entry, ending May 13. This article dives into four contenders that stand out in the crowd. From solid price charts to forward-thinking architecture, here’s why BlockDAG could soon become one of the top trending crypto projects heading into 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $238M Raised with Massive ROI Potential Ahead BlockDAG is building a strong case for the top trending crypto title. With over $238 million raised and more than 20.1 billion coins sold, it’s creating waves ahead of its exchange debut. Its current $0.0019 offer is valid only until May 13. The launch price is set at $0.05, giving early buyers a chance at a 2,520% return. What makes BlockDAG stand out isn’t just the numbers. It’s fully EVM-compatible, making it easy for Ethereum developers to migrate apps. The CertiK audit is already complete, giving the project added credibility. With over $7 million in miner sales and 17,440 units sold, community support is clearly growing. BlockDAG’s roadmap includes up to 10 exchange listings and strong ecosystem plans. Its X1 Miner App has already crossed one million users. Backed by scalable infrastructure, the project blends accessibility with performance. Some experts even suggest it could reach $1 in the future. If you’re looking for a top trending crypto before it launches, BlockDAG might be the one to watch. The limited-time price won’t last long, and missing it could mean missing out on a big player in the making. 2. Chainlink (LINK): Testing the Next Breakout Zone Chainlink (LINK) is now priced near $17.31 after a brief dip. Though it has seen some weakness, it remains a leader in decentralized data solutions. Analysts are watching its key resistance at $15.10–$15.25. If LINK breaks through, the next target is $16.80. As one of the top trending crypto projects in the oracle space, it continues to expand real-world use. With strong developer support and rising adoption, Chainlink is still a strong pick. It has the potential to rise again in market rankings and stay relevant as crypto matures. 3. Monero (XMR): Privacy Coin With Fresh Momentum Monero (XMR) is back near $344.26 and posted a 4.42% rise in just one day. Known for privacy features, it’s now facing a key level that could trigger more gains. If XMR clears $312.96, it could aim higher. Some long-term projections place its price between $344 and $575 by 2030. As privacy returns to focus, XMR could climb back into the top trending crypto charts. Monero continues to lead the privacy space. Its value proposition stays strong as demand grows for secure and anonymous transactions. 4. Bittensor (TAO): AI and Blockchain in One Package Bittensor (TAO) trades at around $359.16 and is gaining traction among AI-focused crypto fans. The growing AI trend has helped push TAO into the spotlight. Experts see TAO possibly hitting $748 this year, and long-range forecasts place it above $1,200 by 2030. It’s now viewed as one of the most innovative platforms merging AI and blockchain. With that unique edge, Bittensor stands a real shot at joining the list of top trending crypto projects. If it sustains momentum, TAO could be a long-term player in both AI and Web3 spaces. Final Take: A New Leader in the Top Trending Crypto Race The crypto world is watching closely as BlockDAG, Chainlink, Monero, and Bittensor shape up for the next wave of market attention. Each has a unique edge, but BlockDAG’s mix of tech, strong backing, and limited-time pricing puts it ahead. The $0.0019 entry window ends May 13. After that, prices climb toward $0.05. With over $238 million raised and growing user activity, BlockDAG stands out in the search for the top trending crypto of 2025. This isn’t just another presale, it’s a signal. BlockDAG is creating the kind of structure that could dominate the next crypto cycle. The post Chainlink, XMR, TAO, or BlockDAG?

With 12 AI-powered tools, including real-time trading assistants, portfolio optimizers, risk management systems, and scam detectors, Web3 ai equips traders with actionable insights to make informed decisions quickly. Currently in presale Stage 3 at $0.000331, $WAI is set to launch at $0.005242, offering early investors the chance for a potential 1,747% return. While BNB and DOGE show promise, Web3 ai stands out for its tangible utility. Its suite of AI tools helps traders make data-driven decisions, not just follow market sentiment. As the crypto market matures, platforms with real-world applications like Web3 ai may offer more sustainable growth in the long run. Can Dogecoin Break $0.24 and See Price Surge? Dogecoin (DOGE) has bounced back to around $0.1862, marking a 2.3% daily gain and showing signs of renewed bullish momentum. This rise comes after a period of consolidation, with analysts eyeing the $0.24 resistance level as a key hurdle. If DOGE breaks through this level, it could open the door to major gains, potentially reaching $0.93, a 600% jump from where it stands now. Technical indicators back up this optimistic view. The formation of an ascending triangle suggests increasing pressure for a breakout, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains comfortably below overbought levels, signaling room for more upside. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has also shown a bullish crossover, reinforcing the positive sentiment. Market conditions are also fueling DOGE’s potential. With higher trading volume and more buzz on social media, investor interest is clearly on the rise. Historical trends show that DOGE has seen major rallies in the past after similar setups. If DOGE can hold support above $0.18 and break $0.24, the next targets could be $0.50 and even $0.93. BNB Bounces Back as Overhaul Sparks Confidence Binance Coin (BNB) has bounced back from a low of $598 after Binance announced updates to its listing and delisting standards on April 26, 2025. These changes are designed to improve transparency and regulatory compliance, which could attract more trusted projects to the platform. As a result, investor confidence has risen, reflected in BNB’s recent price movement. Technical indicators show support at $598, with resistance around $610. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests BNB might be nearing overbought territory, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) points to recent bullish momentum. The updated standards could boost BNB’s utility and demand within the Binance ecosystem. However, market conditions can shift quickly, so traders should watch these key levels closely to gauge BNB’s next move.

The price is now correcting gains from $2.650 and testing the $2.420 support zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.4350 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if there is a close above the $2.550 resistance. XRP Price Dips To Support XRP price remained supported above the $2.250 level and started a fresh upward wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.350 and $2.40 levels. The bulls pushed the price above the $2.50 resistance zone to set the pace for more gains. Finally, it tested the $2.650 zone. A high was formed at $2.6560 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $2.50 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.3310 swing low to the $2.6560 high. However, the bulls are active above $2.40. The price is now trading above $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.4350 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.4950 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.550 level. The next resistance is $2.600. A clear move above the $2.60 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance or even $2.7450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.4350 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.40 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.350 support. The next major support sits near the $2.320 zone.

The agreement, formalized during the Dubai fintech Summit on May 12, is part of Dubai’s cashless strategy, which hopes to foster the city’s transition to “a fully digital, cashless society,” by introducing “a new digital payment channel across its official platforms,” the Dubai Department of Finance (DOF) said on May 12. Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets . The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF. Amna Mohammed Lootah, director of digital payment systems regulation, stated that Dubai’s plan is for 90% of financial transactions across the public and private sectors to be powered through cashless methods by 2026. “We are confident that this milestone will significantly accelerate the advancement of the Dubai Cashless Strategy,” she said. The DOF didn’t specifically mention which crypto it would start accepting, but did say the payments could be made using “stable cryptocurrencies,” possibly indicating stablecoins will be allowed. A trio of major Abu Dhabi institutions, including the Emirate’s sovereign wealth fund, announced on April 28 a plan to launch a new dirham-pegged stablecoin. Duiba’s strategy hopes to spark fintech sector expansion The city’s cashless strategy was first announced in October 2024. At the time, the DOF said 97% of all government payments in 2023 were already digital. The strategy has also been predicted to add at least 8 billion dirhams ($2.1 billion) to the economy, according to the DOF, fuelled by the development of financial technology services and the accelerated expansion of Dubai’s fintech sector. Ahmad Ali Meftah, executive director of the central accounts sector at DOF, said in a statement the government is still actively developing a regulatory framework that “fosters innovation while ensuring the highest standards of security and efficiency” in digital financial transactions. Ahmad Ali Meftah (left) said the government is still working on a crypto regulatory framework. Source: Dubai Department of Finance Dubai is considered a crypto-friendly city. The emirate hosted the Dubai edition of Token2049 between April 30 and May 1 this year.

The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha’s analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance’s BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world’s largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin’s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin’s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

According to Curve Finance, hackers hijacked its domain name system (DNS), sending users to a malicious website. Curve Finance argued that the smart contracts were unaffected In an X post, Curve Finance warned users not to engage with its platform, saying, “The “curve.fi DNS might be hijacked. Don’t interact!” Later, in response to another X user’s query on whether it was a hack or hijack, the DeFi protocol explained that their website directs users to the wrong IP, a malicious site that could drain users’ wallets. However, the firm later confirmed that their smart contracts and password were safe. The Curve team also stated that the two-factor authentication had already been set up, and a query had been sent to the registrar. While they are still investigating the attack and working to regain control of their DNS, they claimed there saw no compromise on their side. Blockaid, an onchain security platform, also noticed unusual activity and alerted users to avoid the Curve website. It warned of a possible front-end attack on the website and asked users to cease all interactions with the application and not to sign any transactions until an official all-clear sign is given. Multiple DeFi projects are said to have been impacted by the incident, including Convex Finance and Resupply — which lean on Curve’s data feeds. The platforms were plagued with service pitfalls and operational disruptions after the event. Both teams have assured users that their central infrastructures have been safe so far; however, they also recognized that services depending on Curve will continue to be affected until the domain is completely recovered. DNS hijacking is a cyberattack where attackers manipulate the Domain Name System to redirect users to malicious sites. In this case, attackers could trick users into interacting with fraudulent versions of Curve’s platform. Security experts and users have flagged this as a strong reminder of the risks associated with DeFi frontends. Unlike decentralized smart contracts, web frontends remain vulnerable to traditional attacks such as DNS hijacking. Projects linked to Curve, including Convex, have emphasized that while their backends are unaffected, users should avoid signing transactions or interacting with dApps tied to Curve during this period. Curve Finance explained it is working with affected partners to mitigate the breach. A probe is currently ongoing, and more information will be released soon. This situation highlights the need for DeFi protocols to focus more heavily on front-end security. Recent DeFi hacks reflect that the front end remains an exposed vector despite decentralized architectures. Curve Finance has been a target of hacker attacks Curve Finance’s official X account was also hacked last week, on May 5. Fortunately, the breach was quickly controlled, with the team verifying that only their social media handle was compromised. No user assets were lost, and an investigation continues. The incident was one in a series of similar attacks. On May 2, Tron DAO’s X account was compromised earlier this month . UK Member of Parliament Lucy Powell’s X account was also taken over to advertise a scam token dubbed “House of Commons Coin (HOC).” Curve Finance has not been without its run-ins with hackers, with one other incident in particular in 2022. At the time, it was revealed that attackers had breached the firm’s website and even taken control of its DNS server, which directed innocent clients (and their transactions) to dodgy endpoints. Per blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, the perpetrators made off with $570k worth of ETH, which was processed through the FixedFloat exchange before being laundered quickly.

Yat Siu, the firm’s executive chair, told the Financial Times that an announcement could come soon, and that Animoca is examining several shareholding structures. He added that the listing would not hinge on market conditions. Animoca Brands has built its reputation on blockchain-based gaming and digital asset investments. The group backs major players such as OpenSea, Kraken and Consensys, and has spearheaded projects in play-to-earn gaming. According to the FT, Hong Kong crypto investment company Animoca Brands is planning to go public in New York. Co-founder Yat Siu said that the Trump administration's relaxed regulation of crypto assets provides a ""unique opportunity"" to enter the world's largest capital market.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 13, 2025 Animoca Gains Competitive Edge Abroad as US Rules Thaw The company raised funds through multiple rounds in 2022, reaching a private valuation just under $6b. Since then, both equity prices and digital asset values have rebounded significantly. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s pledge to make the country a hub for digital assets has attracted firms like Deribit and driven Bitcoin above $100k since November. Trump’s move away from his predecessor’s enforcement actions has thawed a climate that under Joe Biden saw dozens of lawsuits against crypto firms. Siu said the earlier clampdown had cooled US innovation and given overseas companies such as Animoca an edge. A year ago, Animoca would not have considered a US listing, but now it is “a very important part of the roadmap”. Crypto Peers Plot US Listings in 2025 Animoca first floated the idea of returning to public markets last year after its 2020 delisting from the Australian exchange following governance and cryptoasset status concerns. Since then, it has expanded advisory services and grown its investment arm to include stakes in more than 500 companies. In the year ending December, Animoca reportedly generated $314m in revenue and $97min EBITDA, its core operating profit. It also holds nearly $300m in cash and stablecoins plus over $500m in digital assets. Several crypto firms are eyeing US listings in 2025 as markets recover and regulators ease rules. Circle , the issuer of USDC stablecoin, Kraken , Ripple, Gemini and Peter Thiel-backed Bullish have all been linked to potential IPO plans. Going public would give them fresh capital, bolster transparency and credibility and attract investors who might otherwise avoid holding digital assets directly.

The social media platform is owned by the Trump Media & Technology Group, with US President Donald Trump owning a majority stake in the company. “There’s no truth whatsoever about Truth Social launching a memecoin. Don’t be fooled by false information people are circulating,” Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Donald Trump, stated on X. Truth Social denies rumors that it is launching a memecoin. Source: Truth Social The rumors started circulating after influencer Ran Neuner, who hosts the Crypto Banter podcast, tweeted that a Truth Social token will be launched within the next 72 hours and that it appears to be backed by a similar team involved with the launch of the TRUMP token. Cointelegraph reached out to Neuner to find out more about the source of the claim, but did not receive a response by the time of publication. Trump is no stranger to memecoins and crypto plays The US president is known for his pro-crypto stance and has launched his own TRUMP token, while first lady Melania Trump launched a MELANIA token. However, Trump has found himself amid controversies after announcing that the top tokenholders of the TRUMP token will be invited to a special gala dinner on May 22. The move drew criticism from many, including many US senators, who had previously demanded that Trump be impeached for launching the TRUMP token.

Analysts are closely watching k ey support and resistance levels that could help understand the meme coin’s next big move. Dogecoin is currently down by more than 7% and is trading at $0.22 at the time of writing. Dogecoin’s Recent Price Action Since the April 7th bottom, Dogecoin has formed a clear three-wave move to the upside. While some initially speculated it could turn into a five-wave bullish structure, current price behavior leans more toward a diagonal pattern, making a completed five-wave scenario unlikely for now. The price recently reacted to a resistance zone identified in previous analyses, confirming the market’s sensitivity to these technical levels. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch The market is now poised for a B-wave correction, with several crucial support zones in play: Primary Support Range: $0.15 to $0.199 Intermediate Support Levels: $0.169 to $0.183 Analysts warn that if this pullback is indeed a B-wave, it must hold the $0.15 level to preserve the long-term bullish structure. A decisive drop below this threshold would weaken the scenario, increasing the risk of a deeper correction. What’s Happening Next? The recent rally into the target zone has likely completed a wave A within the larger ABC corrective pattern. A B-wave bounce could be forming soon, with traders advised to monitor resistance between $0.235 and $0.255. A clear breakout above this range would indicate stronger bullish momentum, while failure to do so may signal a setup for a final C-wave decline toward the support levels. Analyst Outlook: Correction Now, Opportunity Later For now, Dogecoin appears to be completing the initial leg of its B-wave correction. Once this bounce occurs, analysts expect a subsequent C-wave decline to follow, potentially offering fresh buying opportunities near support. Unless Dogecoin decisively breaks above the Sunday high of $0.26, this corrective structure remains the base case scenario, the analyst explained.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 05:25:44

Tether’s USDt Hits $150 Billion Milestone as Stablecoin Demand Accelerates Globally Tether’s USDt, the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has officially surpassed the $150 billion mark for the first time, cementing its dominance in the global stablecoin market and reinforcing the accelerating demand for crypto-pegged fiat alternatives. This historic milestone was reached on May 12, reflecting over 36% year-over-year growth in USDt’s circulating supply. The surge in adoption has been particularly pronounced since November 2024, coinciding with the re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, which many in the industry interpret as a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. USDt’s market cap growth over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) At its current market capitalization, Tether accounts for 61% of the total global stablecoin market, according to CoinMarketCap data. The next closest competitor, Circle’s USDC, holds nearly 25% market share. Combined, the two account for the lion’s share of the rapidly expanding digital dollar economy that is underpinning much of today’s crypto trading volume. As the leading stablecoin, USDt plays a crucial role in providing liquidity across exchanges and DeFi platforms, often acting as the base trading pair for countless cryptocurrencies. Its growing dominance is seen by analysts as a key indicator of broader market engagement and institutional inflows into digital assets. Tether’s growth is also occurring against a backdrop of rising demand for digital cash. According to recent figures from Dune and Artemis, the number of active stablecoin wallets has jumped from 19.6 million to 30 million over the past year—an increase of more than 50%. Fueling the Next Crypto Cycle? Industry insiders, such as CoinFund managing partner David Pakman, argue that a $1 trillion total stablecoin supply could serve as a foundational catalyst for the next major crypto rally. Stablecoins like USDt offer the essential infrastructure for traders and institutions alike, providing price stability, low transaction friction, and access to decentralized markets. Despite its global footprint, Tether has remained relatively absent from the United States due to regulatory constraints. That could soon change. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino reportedly revealed that the company is planning to launch a new US-focused dollar-backed stablecoin aimed specifically at the domestic market. Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Ardoino emphasized that the US version of the stablecoin would be distinct from the existing international USDt product. This move comes as US lawmakers increasingly signal support for comprehensive crypto legislation, potentially opening the door to regulated stablecoin issuers. CNBC reports that Tether is ramping up its lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., as Congress deliberates over several competing proposals, including the highly scrutinized STABLE Act. The bill, introduced by House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil, seeks to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. Pushback Against the STABLE Act However, the STABLE Act has faced stiff criticism from within the crypto policy community. Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Timothy Massad expressed concerns during a February hearing of the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad delivers remarks at a House committee meeting (Source: GOP Financial Services ) Massad warned that the bill “poses far too much risk of weak state standards” and criticized its “inadequate review process.” He emphasized the lack of ongoing federal oversight as a major flaw, suggesting the act fails to provide the regulatory clarity and robustness needed for a rapidly growing sector like stablecoins. Tether’s potential re-entry into the US market would mark a significant shift in the stablecoin landscape, particularly if it successfully navigates the evolving legislative environment. Tether’s $150 billion milestone is more than just a number—it’s a testament to the increasing mainstream acceptance of stablecoins and the evolving role they play in global finance. With nearly two-thirds of the stablecoin market under its control and expansion plans in motion, Tether is poised to remain a central force in the crypto economy. As regulatory clarity emerges and adoption accelerates, USDt’s trajectory could signal not only the future of stablecoins but also the broader integration of decentralized finance into everyday economic activity. BIS: $600B in Cross-Border Crypto Payments Driven Largely by Speculation, But Remittances Also Fuel Growth In related news, a new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has revealed that global cross-border cryptocurrency payments reached a staggering $600 billion in Q2 2024, underscoring the rapidly evolving role of digital assets in international finance. The report, published on May 8, attributes the bulk of these flows to speculative investment motives, yet also highlights growing utility in remittances, especially in countries facing inflation or high transfer costs. $600 Billion in Crypto Cross-Border Transactions The BIS study focused on flows involving the world’s four largest crypto assets by utility in payments: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). According to the data, these four tokens collectively facilitated over $600 billion in cross-border transactions during the final quarter observed in the study, Q2 2024. Cross-border crypto asset flows by quarter (Source: BIS) “Our findings highlight speculative motives and global funding conditions as key drivers of native crypto asset flows,” the BIS stated. These motives are closely tied to risk-on sentiment in major financial markets and a growing alignment between digital asset behavior and traditional capital markets. The report added that while large-volume transfers are generally investment-driven, “low-value transactions in Bitcoin and stablecoins often point to real-world use cases,” particularly in the remittance sector. The BIS researchers drew clear links between macroeconomic shifts and digital asset movements. Tighter global funding conditions—such as rising interest rates or liquidity squeezes—have historically constrained investor appetite for risky assets, and the report found that cryptocurrencies are now moving in tandem with these broader financial trends. “This indicates increasing interconnectedness between cryptoassets as speculative assets and mainstream finance,” the BIS emphasized, noting how traditional market shocks increasingly ripple into the crypto economy. Crypto-specific risks—such as platform hacks, regulatory crackdowns, and token volatility—also significantly shape cross-border crypto flows, amplifying their speculative nature. The BIS has previously warned that the growing entanglement between DeFi, centralized finance, and retail investors could create new vulnerabilities within the global financial system. Stablecoins and Bitcoin Support Real-World Transfers Despite the dominance of speculative capital, the BIS report draws attention to a parallel trend: the growing use of stablecoins and Bitcoin in everyday cross-border payments. According to the BIS, high remittance costs imposed by legacy financial institutions are driving users—particularly in developing nations—to adopt cryptocurrencies as an alternative. “Higher opportunity costs of fiat currency usage, such as high inflation, spur bilateral cross-border transactions in both unbacked cryptoassets and stablecoins,” the BIS noted. The report highlights how inflationary pressures in sender or receiver countries often correspond with spikes in crypto transaction volumes. Moreover, crypto enables faster and cheaper money movement, especially in corridors plagued by limited banking infrastructure. This makes Bitcoin and stablecoins like USDT increasingly popular in peer-to-peer remittance markets and informal economies. The study also provided a breakdown of major players in cross-border crypto activity. The United States and the United Kingdom collectively accounted for around 20% of the global cross-border payments made with Bitcoin and USDC. For Ether-based payments, the figure was even higher—close to 30%. Meanwhile, in the stablecoin space, Russia and Turkey emerged as significant players. Together, they accounted for over 12% of cross-border transactions conducted using Tether (USDT), the most widely used stablecoin globally. These regional insights suggest that while Western countries dominate speculative flows, emerging markets increasingly rely on cryptocurrencies for functional purposes like value preservation and remittances. BIS Raises Caution on Crypto’s Growing Impact The report’s release follows a broader warning from the BIS in April 2025, where it cautioned that cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) had “reached a critical mass” in both capital and participants. BIS officials said the expansion poses potential threats to financial stability, especially if unregulated growth continues in jurisdictions with weak oversight. While crypto proponents argue that digital assets democratize access to financial tools, the BIS continues to stress the risks of unchecked speculation and uneven regulatory frameworks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-13 05:30:00

The San Francisco-based crypto exchange will replace Discover Financial Services in the S&P 500 on May 19, according to the release. “Thank you to everyone who made it possible for a crypto company to join the S&P 500 for the first time in history,” the firm stated on X. As the saying goes… “First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then they add you to the S&P 500.” …or something like that. — Coinbase ️ (@coinbase) May 12, 2025 Coinbase Stock Jumps The S&P 500 is a coveted index for large companies opening up their stock to a broader investor base. It also provides exposure to passive funds that track the benchmark and actively managed funds that may have limitations on where they can invest. Coinbase, the first major cryptocurrency company to go public in 2021, managed to report a profit for the last quarter, which is a requirement for inclusion in the S&P 500. “This milestone represents what the true believers, from retail investors to institutional investors to our employees and partners, knew all along. Crypto is here to stay,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong . He added two further thoughts: “Crypto is about to be in everyone’s 401 (k)” pension fund, and his goal is that in 5 to 10 years, “getting into the COIN50 index will feel as good as this.” Two other thoughts: 1.

However, the firm’s shares have had a tough year, falling 41% since the beginning of 2025 as the Trump administration’s trade tariffs have torn through stock markets. The S&P 500 climbed 3.2% on Monday as the recovery from its early April slump continues, but the index remains down 37% since the beginning of this year. Disappointing Q1 Last week, Coinbase reported a disappointing first quarter, citing a fall in crypto prices alongside the broader market, due to tariffs and economic uncertainty. The crypto exchange reported a net income of $65.6 million, down from $1.18 billion a year earlier. However, revenue was up 24% to $2.03 billion from $1.64 billion in the same period a year ago.

Here are the Details,https://timestabloid.com/big-xrp-holders-are-buying-from-retails-here-are-the-details/,"Orderflow and market microstructure analyst Dom (@traderview2) recently shared a chart tracking cumulative volume delta (CVD) on XRP, segmented by trade size. The chart, covering data from May 6 to 10, revealed a sharp divergence between large and small order flows. Trades in the 10,000–50,000 XRP range led all categories with roughly 7.5 million XRP in net buying. Orders exceeding 50,000 XRP, followed by more than 4 million XRP in net buying. In contrast, orders between 100 and 1,000 XRP saw over 31 million XRP in net selling, with the 1,000–10,000 range showing net sales of 7.4 million XRP. The pattern indicates that larger traders have accumulated XRP recently while retail-sized orders exited. Dom suggested that retail investors have exited because of recent price struggles, while the whales who influenced the price dip are accumulating. I am now tracking aggregated net flows per trade size on $XRP There's been an interesting dynamic over the last few days Orders between 10k-50k $XRP have seen the strongest net buying along with orders over 50k (see color legend) All while orders between 100-1k and 1k-10k have… pic.twitter.com/fqqpeaeGzB — Dom (@traderview2) May 10, 2025 Retail Selling Rises Sharply Net selling from smaller orders became more pronounced beginning May 8, according to the chart. The 100–1,000 and 1,000–10,000 XRP buckets both moved lower on the CVD scale as the price likely advanced. Meanwhile, the two largest buckets—10k, 50k, and >50k—moved steadily upward, indicating strong buying interest from higher-volume traders during the same window. This trend has been going on for some time, as another prominent analyst recently drew attention to whale activity over the past month, where these Investors accumulated 900 million tokens between early April and early May. According to the chart, the smallest trade sizes, 0–100 XRP and 100–1,000 XRP, showed only modest or negative net flow, with the 0–100 range logging just 1.6 million XRP net purchases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Who is Selling XRP? Proponents in the community have consistently advised investors to hold their XRP and not lose these valuable tokens to institutions like BlackRock that are allegedly trying to accumulate them . WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman), a well-respected community member, inquired whether these large orders might be exchange-generated rather than genuine institutional flows. Dom replied that while the data cannot directly identify counterparties, such orders are “very unlikely to be from the exchanges themselves,” and were more likely driven by retail or institutional actors. While the chart does not reveal intent, the size breakdown offers insight into the movement patterns of different classes of market participants. The growing gap between the behavior of small and large traders could reflect varying strategies or access to information. If this whale accumulation continues, it may influence short-term market structure and price stability. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a May 12 judgment , High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin ( BTC ) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics. His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court. The court highlighted how this strategy was part of a pattern of abusing the legal system to assert false claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto . “It is apparent that Dr Wright had substantial financial backing from the start of his campaign, and his defamation claims were deliberately unequal battles,” said Judge Mellor. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) brought the claim in 2021, seeking negative declarations and injunctive relief because of the threats Wright had made against its members, including crypto blogger Peter McCormack and Magnus Granath (aka Hodlonaut). His defamation claims “put each man through five years of personal hell,” Mellor wrote, adding that allegations were “part of a deliberate strategy whereby Dr Wright and his backers sought to establish the claim [that Dr Wright was Satoshi] by unequal contests.” COPA is a nonprofit community formed to encourage the adoption and advancement of crypto technologies and to remove patents as a barrier to innovation. Justice Mellor says Wright put defendants through personal hell. Source: bailii.org Related: Crypto group COPA launches bid to stop blockchain ‘patent trolls’ The threats its members received “were having a serious chilling effect on development and innovation in the cryptocurrency industry,” said Judge Mellor. “Dr Wright’s actions have not only affected the individuals he has sued,” he continued. “They have also caused significant disruption to innovation in an important technology industry.” Craig Wright slapped for contempt of court Last March, the British High Court ruled that Craig Wright was not the author of the Bitcoin white paper, did not operate under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and was not involved in the creation of Bitcoin. In July, Wright issued a legal disclaimer on his website, emphatically stating that he was not the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. In December, the Australian computer scientist was given a one-year suspended sentence in the United Kingdom for contempt of court. Wright has also filed libel lawsuits against Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back during the almost decade-long “faketoshi” saga.

On Monday, he officially announced the city’s first-ever NYC Crypto Summit, which will be held on May 20. The goal? Nothing short of making New York the crypto capital of the world . NYC, the Crypto Capital of the World Speaking at a press conference , Adams stood beside major players in the blockchain space, including June Ou from Figure and Richard Hecker from Traction and Scale. Together, they made it clear, NYC wants to lead the next big wave of digital finance. Adams explained that blockchain technology could help bring more people into the financial system, especially those who’ve been left out for years. “My mission is to ensure that New York leads in innovation,” he said. “And crypto is part of that future.” Adam further noted that the event will bring together crypto companies, regulators, and city leaders to discuss the future of digital assets. Key topics include the idea of a state-owned Bitcoin reserve and new rules for crypto businesses. While the plans sound bold, some critics worry that New York’s strict regulations might hold the city back. Adams’ Crypto Journey He reminded everyone of his own history with digital assets back in 2022, he took his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which at the time raised eyebrows. Now, he says, the crypto world is booming, and New York is seeing a huge rise in startups joining the scene. What makes this move more interesting is the political backdrop. Adams has decided to run as an independent in the upcoming election, skipping the Democratic primary due to a past corruption probe that was recently dropped. Some believe his support for crypto could help him win over the same groups that backed Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. No Hype, No Memes — Long-Term Vision But Adams made it clear — this isn’t about hype or meme coins. He wants real innovation and clear but fair regulations. He said New York shouldn’t overregulate and risk losing the chance to lead. “The Empire State should be building empires,” Adams said. “And crypto is where we start.” Adams is trying to attract crypto companies by promising easier rules in New York. He also suggested the city might create a Bitcoin Reserve law, similar to one in New Hampshire. With the upcoming summit, NYC is hoping to become more than just a financial hub, it wants to be the center of the crypto revolution.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 05:52:18

The 90‑day pause on new tariffs was reached in Geneva, Switzerland. CNBC reports that a social‑media account tied to national broadcaster CCTV said, “China’s firm countermeasures and resolute stance have been highly effective.” The Trump administration had increased duties on many Chinese goods to 145 %. Under the new plan, those duties now fall to 30%. China will cut most of its tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. On the Weibo platform, the hashtag “#USChinaSuspending24%TariffsWithin90Days” had about 420 million views by Monday afternoon. The tag uses a 24% figure found near the top of the joint statement from the two governments. One user, who goes by Chun Feng Yi Ran, wrote, “Our ancestors didn’t cave in. Why should we give up what we have?” The post drew thousands of likes. China offers duty relief but keeps a tight grip on rare earth minerals Beijing is also using the deal to show it is a steady trading partner, even while foreign companies often speak of “promise fatigue.” Many firms note that Chinese cooperation can fade once talks end. This time, China and the United States agreed to build a “consultation mechanism” so officials could maintain discussions about trade and other monetary issues. The steps take effect on Wednesday, though Beijing has already offered tariff breaks to some companies inside China. The government also vowed to “adopt all necessary administrative measures to suspend or remove the non‑tariff countermeasures.” These steps include easing the stricter export limits on rare‑earth minerals that Beijing set in its last round of actions. These minerals are essential to many U.S. industries. Yet the message on metals was mixed. On Monday the Commerce Ministry promised to keep fighting rare‑earth smuggling for national‑security reasons, and said that “foreign entities” were partly to blame for problems in the market. Worldwide investors have reacted positively to the US-China trade deal Stock markets jumped on Monday after the two capitals announced the pause, calming worries that the trade fight would keep dragging on the global economy. Chinese officials say they never bent during talks. Before the Geneva meetings, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, “We will resolutely safeguard our legitimate interests and uphold international fairness and justice.” On Monday the Commerce Ministry called the pact an “important step,” but also urged Washington to “completely correct its unilateral tariff practices.” U.S. officials are also calling it a “historic trade win” for the United States. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that both sides plan to meet again in the next “few weeks” to work toward a “more fulsome agreement.” Rory Green, head of China research at TS Lombard, said the result plays well at home. “In China, this is viewed as a big win,” Green said . “The U.S. is a ‘paper tiger’ and Xi successfully forced Washington to treat China as an equal. [China was the] only country that retaliated and the only negotiations that occurred in a third country.” Green thinks the 20% fentanyl tariffs will be removed “fairly easily,” pointing out that Beijing has stepped up drug control. But new risks remain. Washington is still proceeding with sector‑specific tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and other high‑tech fields that matter to China’s long‑term plans.

According to the latest report prepared by the Citi Institute's “Future of Finance” think tank, with the improvement of the regulatory environment, stable value digital assets will begin to be used in many areas, from payment systems and international money transfers to banks' short-term liquidity management. Stablecoins are digital assets whose value is typically pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. But according to Citi’s analysis, these assets are now moving beyond being just “tokenized cash” for crypto investors. Over the next five years, they could replace some domestic and foreign currency reserves, as well as become part of short-term liquidity portfolios held in banks. If yield-generating stablecoin types are developed, these assets are also expected to be used in term deposit accounts and individual money market funds. Related News: Exchange Analysts Reveal: Bitcoin Bull Is Back - Here's the Report Ronit Ghose, Global Head of Future Finance at Citi Institute, made the following statement on the subject: “We are talking about the integration of stablecoins into the mainstream economy. For example, stablecoins can provide a cash counterpart to tokenized financial assets or can be used as a means of payment by SMEs and large companies. The dollar and, to a lesser extent, the euro have global reserve currency status. Stablecoins make it easy and low-cost for people around the world to hold dollars or euros.” *This is not investment advice.

This triggered an 8% drop in ZK’s price. Matter Labs confirmed the breach stemmed from “compromised delegated accounts” and quickly regained control. Meanwhile, Curve Finance was also hit with another DNS hijack that rerouted its official domain to a malicious site capable of draining user funds, prompting warnings from security firm Blockaid. This followed a similar DNS attack in 2022 and a recent hijacking of Curve’s X account just last week. Separately, the US government is pushing for a two-year prison sentence for Eric Council Jr., who helped hack the SEC’s X account in January of 2024 to post false Bitcoin ETF approval news. ZKsync Faces Second Major Security Breach The official X accounts of Ethereum Layer 2 network ZKsync and its developer Matter Labs were compromised in the early hours of May 13, and the hackers were spreading false claims that the platform was under investigation by US regulators. The compromised accounts shared links to a fake airdrop in an apparent phishing attempt and posted a fabricated statement suggesting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating ZKsync and that the Treasury Department might impose sanctions on the platform. ZKsync confirmed the breach through a related X account and warned users not to engage with any posts or links. Matter Labs’ head of communications, Lynnette Nolan, clarified that the posts were not legitimate and assured the public that both accounts were now securely back under team control. She added that the breach may have been executed through “compromised delegated accounts,” which have limited posting privileges on behalf of the main accounts. After the incident, the price of ZKsync’s native token, ZK , dipped by approximately 2% in an hour and was down 8% on the day, trading around $0.07. This drop happened despite the token enjoying a strong rally of nearly 35% over the past week. ZK’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Crypto community members, including g8keep co-founder Harrison Leggio , took to X to comment on the unusual nature of the hack, and pointed out that the attackers opted to spread fear instead of directly stealing funds. This is the second major breach tied to ZKsync over the past few months. On April 15, a hacker gained access to the platform’s airdrop distribution contract and used an admin function to mint 111 million unclaimed ZK tokens, which were worth around $5 million at the time. That attacker later returned 90% of the tokens, but held on to 10% as a bug bounty. Curve Finance Hit by DNS Attack Again Curve Finance, a well known decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, also recently issued an urgent warning after its domain name system (DNS) was reportedly hijacked for the second time in a week. In a post that was shared on X on May 12, the Curve team warned users not to interact with the site, as the DNS was rerouting visitors to a malicious page designed to steal funds. This DNS manipulation means that while the official domain name is being used, it is actually pointing to a different IP address under the control of the attackers. The Curve team confirmed that the website was not technically hacked but was instead pointing to an incorrect IP address due to DNS tampering. They reassured the community that internal security measures like passwords and two-factor authentication were still intact and that the issue appeared to stem from the domain registrar. The team contacted the registrar to address the breach and regain full control. Importantly, Curve also clarified that while the DNS is compromised, its underlying smart contracts are safe and have not been affected. This latest incident is very similar to a previous attack Curve suffered in August of 2022, where attackers cloned the website and redirected the DNS to a lookalike page that drained users’ wallets. The DeFi protocol warned that the current malicious domain is capable of similarly draining funds from users who unknowingly interact with it. On-chain security firm Blockaid corroborated the warning, and labelled the situation as a potential front-end attack. Blockaid advised users to avoid signing any transactions or engaging with the DApp until the matter is resolved. They also confirmed that there is ongoing collaboration with Curve and affected partners to mitigate the threat. This is the second time in just one week that Curve faced a major security issue. On May 5, the protocol’s official X account was hijacked . However, Curve later clarified that the social media breach was isolated and did not affect other accounts or lead to any confirmed financial losses. That incident followed a broader trend of high-profile X account takeovers, including Tron DAO and even UK Member of Parliament Lucy Powell , whose accounts were compromised to promote scam crypto tokens. The Curve Finance team continues to investigate the DNS breach. Feds Seek Prison Time for SEC X Account Hacker Meanwhile, the US government recommended a two-year prison sentence for Eric Council Jr., the person who helped hijack the SEC’s X account to post a false announcement about the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a filing that was submitted on May 12 in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, prosecutors urged Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of Council’s actions, which briefly disrupted financial markets in January of 2024. Council pleaded guilty to being part of a coordinated scheme that used a SIM swap attack to gain unauthorized access to the SEC’s official social media account. The fake message posted through the account falsely claimed that spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, which caused the price of Bitcoin to jump by more than $1,000 before SEC Chair Gary Gensler issued a correction . The official approval came a day later, but the fake announcement already rattled markets and drew widespread attention. Prosecutors described the attack as a “sophisticated fraud scheme” involving forged identification documents, fraudulent behavior at telecommunications stores, and coordination with co-conspirators in the US and overseas. They believe that Council’s actions merit a serious sentence due to the deliberate and far-reaching nature of the fraud. Council’s court appearance is scheduled for May 16. The case unfolds against the backdrop of leadership changes in the Department of Justice, where President Donald Trump appointed interim US Attorneys in several key jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia. While the impact of these appointments on crypto-related prosecutions are still uncertain, it has raised many questions about the future direction of digital asset enforcement.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|ZK|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-13 06:05:07

Jenner had escaped a class-action lawsuit from buyers of her self-titled memecoin, Caitlyn Jenner (JENNER) after California District Court Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. said in a motion filed on May 9 that it was “sufficient to conclude that all nine causes of action are deficient” and sided with Jenner in dismissing the suit in its entirety for failure to state a claim. He allowed the class group to amend its suit, which must be filed by May 23, but warned it had “to be more focused and judiciously pleaded” than the original. A lawyer for the class group, Fitzgerald Monroe Flynn PC partner Jack Fitzgerald, told Cointelegraph it was “pleased the Court recognized we may be able to state some claims against the defendants, and intend to amend and press forward with the case.” Jenner and her manager, Sophia Hutchins, were sued in November by a group that bought the JENNER token and accused them of having “fraudulently solicited financially unsophisticated investors” to the token, which they alleged was an unregistered security. Lee Greenfield, a UK citizen, was added as the lead plaintiff in January and claimed he lost over $40,000 buying JENNER. But the court found, for a start, that claims of securities law violations couldn’t stand as it wasn’t alleged that his JENNER buys took place in the US, as the law requires, and gave “scant details” about the purchases. The court didn’t allow the class to swap its lead for a US-based member, adding it must report by May 16 on how the suit will proceed (highlights added for emphasis). Source: PACER Court dismisses all claims by JENNER tokenholders In all, Judge Blumenfeld dismissed a further eight claims the class group brought in an amended complaint filed in February, which included accusations that Jenner and Hutchins either made misleading statements, sold unregistered securities, or committed various fraud. Judge Blumenfeld said the suit failed to allege that Jenner sold the token through a prospectus that contained an untrue statement, as “Greenfield admits that the $JENNER tokens were not sold through a prospectus.” The court also tossed a common-law fraud accusation, saying the complaint alleged omitted information and noted various X posts by Jenner “stating that she would continue to support the tokens,” but it did not identify which of the statements related to the fraud claim. The group also accused Hutchins of aiding and abetting Jenner’s allegedly fraudulent conduct, but Judge Blumenfeld said that claim failed as the complaint “does not adequately allege any viable fraud claim.” In a footnote, Judge Blumenfeld said Jenner and the class group disputed whether the JENNER token was a security, but he was not going to decide at this stage as the “securities claims fail on other grounds.” Related: Top TRUMP whales hold $174M in tokens ahead of dinner with US president “Because the determination of whether the tokens are securities is fact-dependent and may be affected by an amended pleading, the Court declines to resolve that issue at this stage and instead assumes without deciding that the tokens are securities subject to the federal securities laws,” he wrote. JENNER first launched in May 2024 via Pump.fun on the Solana blockchain but was soon embroiled in controversy after Jenner and other memecoin launching celebrities claimed collaborator Sahil Arora scammed them. Jenner relaunched the token on Ethereum, which the class group claimed tanked the value of the original Solana token, but gave Jenner the benefit of collecting a 3% fee on every transaction. JENNER has lost essentially all its value since launch. CoinGecko shows its market value has crashed to around $58,775 from a June 3 peak of nearly $7.5 million. The token has seen just $61.10 worth of trading volume over the last day.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Canberra during a May 12 press conference that Charlton would be the new assistant minister for science, technology and the digital economy , working with Tim Ayres, the minister for industry and innovation. Ayres and Charlton will administer policies and programs promoting advancements in emerging technologies, science, technology, innovation and the digital economy, according to Albanese. Charlton has shown strong support for the industry in the past. During a speech to parliament last November, he pushed for a balanced regulatory framework that encouraged industry growth. Cryptocurrency is shaping the future of finance. Governments must support a balanced framework that encourages growth while ensuring security and trust. Let’s embrace the opportunities of a digital economy! #Cryptocurrency #Innovation @DECAustralia pic.twitter.com/av8L2DA72g — Andrew Charlton (@Charlton_AB) November 27, 2024 Speaking to Cointelegraph, Jason Titman, CEO of Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, said Charlton’s appointment is “unequivocally good news for crypto in Australia,” and he expects the “blockchain industry is cheering.” “Andrew has a deep understanding of blockchain, coupled with a genuine belief in its potential to support the Australian economy,” Titman said. Along with the new assistant treasurer, Daniel Mulino, Titman says he hopes Charlton “ fast tracks legislation around digital assets,” because the industry has been waiting for “six or seven years for legislative clarity.” Australian crypto industry continues to grow Vakul Talwar, head of the Australian arm of crypto exchange Crypto.com, said in a statement sent to Cointelegraph that Charlton’s appointment is a sign of the growing importance of the digital economy. Since the previous election in 2022, Talwar says the “industry has grown significantly,” and it’s important in the current term of Parliament to “ensure that as the digital economy continues to merge its way into traditional finance, appropriate regulations are in place.” Around 31% of Australian adults own or have owned crypto, which is roughly 6.2 million people, April 4 data from crypto exchange Independent Reserve shows , up from 28% last year. Roughly 6.2 million out of Australia's more than 26 million population have owned or still own crypto. Source: Independent Reserve Edward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at Australian crypto platform MHC Digital Group, said that Charlton has long recognized the importance of fostering a constructive and innovative financial ecosystem. “His specific support for digital assets and recognition of blockchain technology’s transformative potential, alongside the need to regulate it quickly and appropriately, should help Australia keep pace with the rapidly evolving global regulatory landscape,” Carroll said. At the same time, Damian Kassabgi, CEO of industry advocacy group Tech Council of Australia, said in a May 12 statement that the addition of “digital economy” to the ministry position is a “strong signal of the Government’s commitment to this critical area of future growth for jobs.” Related: Industry calls for urgent crypto law reforms after Australian election The reelected center-left Labor Party proposed a new crypto framework on March 21 , regulating exchanges under existing financial services laws and has promised to tackle debanking. Meanwhile, in August 2022, it also initiated a series of industry consultations to draft a crypto regulatory framework .

Pepe, Pepeto, Dogwifhat, Bonk or Floki?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meme-coin-season-is-back-ready-to-ride-which-meme-coin-should-i-buy-now-pepe-pepeto-dogwifhat-bonk-or-floki/,"Seasoned crypto traders like to say the biggest gains come from spotting a token before it becomes a headline. Investors who bought Pepe, Dogwifhat, Bonk, or Floki during their earliest days watched prices jump more than 1,000 percent. With sentiment rising again, attention is shifting to presale projects that still trade for fractions of a cent. At the front of that line sits Pepeto, now available for just $0.000000128. The token arrives with no transaction fees, cross‑chain movement, and plans for rapid listings. Backers argue that a low first price, plus real utility, creates the best ground‑floor opening of 2025. Pepeto Presale Sparks Interest by Positioning Itself as a Meme Token Infrastructure Project Most meme coins fade once the first buzz wears off, but Pepeto is building tools that keep traders around. Central to the plan is a zero‑fee exchange that will list both new arrivals and well‑known names such as Shiba, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Floki, and Pepe. The project also promises multi‑chain support, letting users move assets without outside bridges. By pairing the light‑hearted pull of a meme with practical features, the coin aims to do more than rely on humor alone. Pepeto copies Pepe’s full supply with 420 trillion tokens, but tries to improve the trading experience that often frustrates small buyers. Backers describe the strategy as mixing timing, usefulness, and broad access, cornerstones that helped earlier winners break out in earlier cycles Rumors and Value Align as Pepeto Presale Heads for Tier 1 Listing Talk in Telegram rooms and on X is adding fuel. Posts claim a former Pepe founder, removed before that coin’s release, is now shaping Pepeto to restore ideas dropped in a rush to launch. Screenshots said to be early Pepe drafts circulate as supporting evidence, although none of these claims have been verified. Whether true or not, the story has boosted presale momentum. Traders watch for signs that the token could enter a major exchange soon; project spokespeople have hinted at a Tier 1 listing that would expand reach and firm up price discovery. Some holders of higher‑valued tokens, including Solaxy, Bonk, and even Pepe, have begun shifting funds, saying upside on those coins looks limited after steep climbs. The presale is nearing its end ahead of exchange listings. Investors can still grab $PEPETO at $0.000000128 via pepeto.io . Payment options include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card payments through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Don’t miss your chance before listings open!

This funding comes through a stock purchase agreement with a British Virgin Islands-based investor, aimed at building a long-term crypto reserve. The company plans to hold these digital assets as part of its treasury operations, signaling strong confidence in the future of cryptocurrencies . Why This Matters GDC’s move to add Bitcoin and TRUMP tokens to its balance sheet highlights its push toward decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain adoption, aligning with a broader trend of public companies integrating crypto into their financial strategies. This shift also supports GDC’s digital business focus, particularly through its subsidiary AI Catalysis, which operates in the livestreaming e-commerce space. Facing Financial Pressure Despite this crypto push, GDC is currently facing financial challenges. The company reported a $14.1 million net loss for 2024, a slight improvement from the previous year’s $14.3 million loss. In addition, Nasdaq issued a warning stating that GDC failed to meet the required $2.5 million stockholders’ equity. The company now has 45 days to submit a plan to regain compliance or face the risk of delisting. CEO Sees It as a Strategic Leap Chairman and CEO Xiaojian Wang said the company’s crypto pivot is intentional and aligned with market shifts. He believes this strategy will boost GDC’s balance sheet and unlock new growth opportunities. “We’re confident this will drive long-term value for our shareholders,” Wang said, emphasizing the company’s belief in blockchain as the future of finance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : NYC Mayor Eric Adams Wants New York City To Be The Crypto Capital , Critics Push Back Not everyone’s convinced. Crypto analyst Eva Lenoir criticized the move, saying Bitcoin isn’t meant to be a “toy for the elites.” She compared the investment to “a warship sailing with paper sails,” questioning the logic of mixing political tokens like TRUMP with serious treasury assets. Meanwhile, GDC’s $300 million crypto push is one of the boldest moves by a public company in recent months. While it shows faith in crypto’s future, the inclusion of politically tied tokens adds a layer of controversy to an already high-risk play. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

XRP is currently testing a high-volume profile level at $2.40, a strong barrier that, if cleared, could open the door to $2.80 and even retest the all-time high at $3.40. However, if momentum fades, a pullback toward $2.00—aligned with the 200-day EMA—is likely, with $1.63 acting as the final support zone. Technical indicators support a bullish outlook: the MACD has made a bullish crossover, AO histograms are positive, and the RSI sits at 62, showing strong momentum without entering overbought territory. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also reflects increased capital inflow, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Beyond price movement, XRP’s on-chain activity has notably improved. Source: XRP Scan Data from XRPScan shows that average transactions per ledger jumped from 58 to 98 in just five days, indicating higher user engagement and network usage. While this uptick aligns with growing optimism, XRP’s price trajectory still hinges on broader market conditions and the outcome of Ripple’s legal situation. XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

On one occasion, Timeboost pulled in $45.9K in a single day, which—if the same amount occurred every day for a year—would yield $16.7 million. That number is significant not just because it’s some kind of record for a system on Ethereum, but also because it shows how Arbitrum is increasingly getting adopted and how the mechanism could work to change the way systems on Ethereum and other networks deal with transactions. A Swift Rise: $100K in 4 Days Over the last four days, Timeboost has generated $100K in revenue, bringing its total revenue to $300K. This fast growth signals that it’s becoming a much more important part of Arbitrum’s economic infrastructure. Launched as a novel transaction ordering policy, Timeboost serves, in part, to stop the network spam that threatens to bog down Ethereum and its layer-2 solutions. But it also makes for an interesting MEV-boosting system when placed alongside other Arbitrum components. Timeboost on @Arbitrum reached a new ATH in daily revenue yesterday at $45.9k, translating to an annual revenue of $16.7M. This achievement boosted Timeboost's revenue by $100k in just 4 days, bringing its total lifetime revenue to $300k. For those unfamiliar, Timeboost is a… https://t.co/Oz0WgMnLqa pic.twitter.com/MVLDsshwjH — Entropy Advisors (@EntropyAdvisors) May 12, 2025 For activity, Arbitrum, which is leading as a Layer 2 rollup, has seen Timeboost become a vital piece of its revenue model. Since early May, the mechanism has accounted for over 50% of the total revenue (REV) of the network, a clear signal of both its effectiveness and its popularity among users and developers. How Timeboost Works: A More Deterministic Blockchain Timeboost signifies quite a change in how transactions are put in order on Layer 2 networks. Up to now, transactions were usually organized based on which ones paid the highest fees—an arrangement that let MEV bots do their thing and extract profits through well-known and brazen methods like front-running and sandwiching. Timeboost, though, makes it much harder for those bots to do the kind of work that keeps them employed. With Timeboost, the first step is to ensure that transactions are timestamped the instant they are sent to the sequencer. This mechanism for ordering transactions deterministically means that later transactions can’t leapfrog earlier ones simply by offering higher fees. Consequently, the incentives for MEV bots to manipulate transaction order are dramatically reduced. In essence, Timeboost offers all participants, especially users who don’t have the technical sophistication or capital to compete with aggressive MEV strategies, a more transparent and equitable playing field. While this system might reduce the total revenue from activities related to MEV, it makes the overall environment more predictable and thus more beneficial for the ecosystem as a whole—especially for developers of applications that are sensitive to and/or dependent on the timing of certain events. Comparisons Across the L2 Landscape As Arbitrum’s Timeboost model is gaining traction, other Layer 2 solutions—like Base and Optimism—have taken a more conventional route. On these networks, priority fees make up 80-90% of revenue with MEV still playing a central role. This contrast illustrates a philosophical and practical difference in how Layer 2 platforms are balancing the trifecta of user experience, decentralization, and revenue generation. Timeboost inherently restricts its exposure to MEV. This could foster a long-term prevalence of Timeboost among validators and sequencers who are less profit-maximizing and more network-friendly. If that happens, it could lead to a more robust, spam-resistant, and user-trust-retaining network. And that might lead to sustainable growth. Since early May, Arbitrum's Timeboost has accounted for over 50% of REV. Priority fees on Base and Optimism typically comprise 80-90% of REV, but Timeboost's lower susceptibility to MEV may limit its prevalence. This is because txns are timestamped upon submission to the… pic.twitter.com/Q1577r4e48 — Marc Arjoon | Blockworks Research (@marcarjoon) May 6, 2025 Encouraging users not to reorder transactions or engage in sniping is a step toward making transaction mechanisms more ethical and user-friendly. Timeboost is designed to do just this, in part because it might make users benefit more from the transaction mechanisms themselves, and in part because behaviors like transaction reordering tend not to be very nice. Of course, like any new model of doing things, this could also be a model that other layer 2s or networks could look at and learn from. Conclusion Timeboost’s latest achievements are more than a financial milestone—they’re another step toward smarter, fairer transaction systems in the blockchain scaling world. As Arbitrum generates more revenue while keeping its network safe from MEV manipulation, Layer 2s everywhere may be paying attention. Whether you think of Timeboost as a future standard or an Arbitrum-specific innovation, its principles and near-light-speed growth make it a harbinger of the future of decentralized infrastructure.

BGB is rated across five criteria: 1. Technical architecture 2. Security system 3. Tokenomics 4. Ecosystem development 5. Overall performance and utility This evaluation strongly affirms that Bitget is very much on track to establish BGB as a reliable, secure, and utility-driven token within the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. With a market capitalization now surpassing $5.6 billion , BGB ranks 26th globally among all crypto assets listed on CoinMarketCap, marking a new high for the exchange-native token. Security First: Strong Foundations and Third-Party Assurance Bitget’s overall strategy is built on four cornerstones: security, compliance, technology, and user trust. Security remains one of the cornerstones of Bitget’s strategy and is evidently reflected in both the platform and its native token. According to the TokenInsight report, one of the standout features of BGB is its rigorous security framework. BGB’s smart contract has undergone a full audit by CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm, and passed with recognition, reinforcing confidence in its codebase and vulnerability resistance. In addition to ensuring the security of smart contracts, Bitget focuses on maintaining the safety of user assets by being transparent and implementing protective measures. The exchange puts out proof of reserves every month, which allows for a reliable look at their backing of assets and actual solvency. This is alluded to in the opening lines of their white paper. Their PoR looks good; they should keep it up. Further strengthening this safety net is Bitget’s protection fund, which at present holds in excess of $600 million in assets. This fund is meant to provide users extra assurance in the event of unforeseen incidents, bringing Bitget in line with some of the loftiest industry standards for customer protection. A Solid Token Model and Growing Ecosystem One of the key areas highlighted in TokenInsight’s rating is the strong design of BGB’s token model. Unlike many exchange tokens that primarily serve as trading fee discounts or speculative instruments, BGB has been strategically integrated into the broader Bitget ecosystem. It plays a central role in platform governance, staking, trading incentives, and exclusive campaign participation. This multi-utility design boosts BGB’s immediate significance and protracted worth in the real world. Its means of circulation and distribution are managed with care, and even a touch of finesse, to achieve the most effective balance between usability and inflationary dampeners. The latter, in the case of BGB, involves both ecosystem-driven demand (that is, BGB being necessary for and used in various parts of the Beyond Global ecosystem) and deflationary measures (the most important of which is “token burning”). Bitget has extended its ecosystem by incorporating BGB into several DeFi partnerships, NFT initiatives, and user engagement efforts, shooting utility well past the core exchange arena and demanding much more than its previously cozy valuation. Adding to the token’s appeal is the fact that these initiatives appear to be generating real-world utility that is diversifying the use cases for BGB, thus rallying much more demand than its valuation could have reasonably anticipated just a few months back. Market Performance and Future Outlook BGB has achieved a market cap of over $5.6 billion. It has now surged to the 26th largest cryptocurrency in the world, according to CoinMarketCap data. This stellar ascendance reflects rising investor confidence, increased utility, and broader adoption of the Bitget platform. TokenInsight’s rating of BGB comes with a “stable outlook,” which suggests that the analysts expect BGB to keep performing at a high level. With this “stable outlook,” TokenInsight is basically saying that Bitget has strong platform and community building, as well as resilience in maintaining safe operations, to the point where BGB is unlikely to drop even in a bearish market. With the crypto industry’s current regulatory landscape, tightened scrutiny has come to the space from various quarters. For Bitget, however, regulatory oversight might not work out as unfavorable, given its transparency initiatives. Bitget has implemented a model of transparency that would be the envy of many centralized crypto exchanges. For starters, it provides what can only be termed as a robust proof of reserves on a monthly basis. Conclusion Bitget Token has received a significant recognition for its technical robust framework and developing utility. It has an ‘A’ rating from TokenInsight, under which three fundamental criteria are assessed: Technology – Refers to the underpinning blockchain (mainnet or sidechain), smart contracts, and overall security infrastructure. Tokenomics – Encompasses the economic model, including how well it aligns incentives for different stakeholders and the overall utility it provides. Ecosystem – Considers the overall market cap and the evolving business model (and regulatory compliance) of the core team. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a recent post on X, he pointed out striking similarities between XRP’s current price action in 2025 and its behavior in 2017, shortly before its historic rally. The side-by-side chart shows XRP from 2017 and 2025, each time nearing a convergence between the price, the 50-day simple moving average (white line), and the 200-day simple moving average (blue line). The price hovered near a neckline level before a sharp breakout in both cases. In 2017, once XRP’s price crossed above that level, it recorded gains of 50x within a few months, reaching its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. THE MOST INSANE #XRP BUY SIGNAL IS FLASHING! But nobody seems to care…. pic.twitter.com/YjZYYmN4fR — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 11, 2025 Price Compression Mirrors Pre-Breakout Structure Steph linked to an Instagram video where he expanded on his analysis. While some analysts believe XRP has broken away from the 2017 fractal , Steph is Crypto argues that the current formation reflects a nearly identical structure, noting that the asset is trading very close to the neckline of the previous autumn high. In 2017, the breakout occurred shortly after the price interacted with this key area, which was again tested in 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The image shows a 2017 breakout beginning in early December, just after the price crossed the 50-day moving average. The 2025 chart, as of May, shows XRP consolidating around the same type of structure, with prices hovering near $2 and moving averages continuing to trend upward. The asset already tested the moving average, but the breakout was not decisive enough to kickstart a surge. However, this setup suggests that more tests could give XRP the momentum it needs for the next bull run. $100 Target Tied to Historical Fractal Steph further suggested that XRP’s price could potentially exceed $100 this year if history repeats with similar momentum. Another well-known analyst shared a similar analysis some months ago, showing XRP repeating its 2017 price movements and suggesting that the asset will climb to $100 . XRP is currently trading at $2.36, and a 50x increase would send the digital asset to $118, a new all-time high, and a level many never thought possible. Market Reaction Remains Muted Despite the bold prediction and visual evidence presented, Steph said, “Nobody seems to care.” The current sentiment in the XRP community remains cautious due to recent consolidation, and the broader market’s attention is focused elsewhere. This trend suggests many investors will miss out on life-changing profits, as experts have previously predicted that 95% of investors will lose money during XRP’s next bull run.

According to a recent report by the Financial Times, the crypto investment firm is preparing to release an announcement “soon” regarding its plans to list in New York . The company’s executive chair, Yat Siu, said the listing is not going to depend on market conditions. “I think going public is a way to tell the world that ‘hey there’s a business that is in crypto that isn’t doing the typical crypto stuff,” said Siu. Last year, Animoca Brands did not think a U.S. initial public offering would be in the cards, said Siu. However, the move is now considered to be “a very important part of the roadmap.” This is largely due to the regulatory shift presented by the Trump administration, which has adopted a much more welcoming approach to the crypto industry and blockchain technology. “It’s a unique moment in time. I feel like it would be one heck of a wasted opportunity if we didn’t at least try,” said Siu. Animoca Brands previously raised $6 billion in a series of funding rounds since as early 2022. The company’s investment portfolio includes major crypto companies, including OpenSea , Kraken and Consensys Coincidentally, Kraken has also been considering the possibility of a U.S. listing this year or in early 2026, said Siu.

Under the Biden administration, financial regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission launched dozens of lawsuits against crypto companies in the U.S., namely Binance, Coinbase, Ripple and more. Siu said this wave of anti-crypto lawsuits hindered innovation in the U.S. markets, pushing many overseas crypto companies to avoid the U.S entirely. However, now the political climate has presented international crypto and blockchain-based companies with a “unique opportunity” and a competitive edge. “Normally we’d be fighting with some giant or something. It’s the biggest market, so we should go there, right?” said Siu. According to the report, Animoca Brands has accumulated around $97 million in from revenues of $314 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the 2024. The firm also has nearly $300 million in cash and stablecoin and $538 million invested in cryptocurrency reserves. In March 2025, Animoca Brands collaborated with Sony’s blockchain, Soneium, to launch a new decentralized digital identity system called Anime ID, which will be spearheaded by Anime Foundation contributor San FranTokyo.

While Scaramucci shared both the fund's performance and his predictions about the future of cryptocurrencies, he also made remarkable evaluations about stablecoin regulations and altcoin ETFs, which are on the agenda in Washington. CRPT does not invest directly in digital assets, but in stocks of companies integrated into the crypto ecosystem. “This fund was created four years ago, at a time when there were no Bitcoin ETFs, to offer our clients an investment vehicle with a high correlation to Bitcoin,” Scaramucci said. The SkyBridge manager noted that some consulting companies still have difficulty investing in Bitcoin. Stating that Bitcoin losing its correlation with classic technology stocks over time and starting to act like gold is an important threshold, Scaramucci commented, “When Bitcoin reaches one billion wallets from 300 million wallets, its volatility will decrease and more institutional investors will enter. This will create a positive cycle.” Related News: What Will Happen to the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Going Forward? Analysts Share Their Short-Term Expectations According to Scaramucci, the big question is: Is Bitcoin an investment or an asset class in its own right? If it were simply an investment vehicle, a market cap of $1-3 trillion would be reasonable. But if it were an asset class like gold, a market cap of $20 trillion could be targeted. Scaramucci, who also evaluated the stablecoin bill in the US Congress, said that this law is important for the country to maintain its financial leadership: “Companies that issue stablecoins hold a huge amount of US Treasury bonds. Tether owns more bonds than Japan and Germany. Therefore, clarification of regulations is critical for both the market and the state.” Scaramucci said the restrictions on the Trump family may not be constitutionally possible, but called for transparency to avoid political controversy. Sharing his views on altcoins, Scaramucci particularly focused on Solana. “There is a Solana ETF called SolQ on the market, and as SkyBridge, we have invested in this ETF and we find Solana’s staking feature quite attractive,” he said. Scaramucci also said that other projects like Avalanche and Polkadot also have ETF potential, but Solana stands out at the moment. *This is not investment advice.

Not only does the Layer 1 blockchain continue to impress with its weekly surge in activity, but it has also recorded a third consecutive week with an all-time high for its decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume: a staggering $35.6 billion , which translates to a $25.9 million haul for the Solana network. Solana is capturing an increasing market share, as seen with its most recent token sales and user growth figures. Solana is seeing a lot of interest from not only developers building on Solana but also from the communities of these developers. With these interesting metrics, not only is there interest from the token perspective, which leads to price acceleration, but also from a technical perspective because people seem to enjoy using the products that are built on Solana. DEX Volume Skyrockets as SOL Gains Market Share Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) undertakings have, of late, been quite prosperous, with the entire assembly of weekly volume climbing to around 35.6 bios, which is clearly the highest that DEXs have been seen in a while, over two months, to be precise. This clearly space showcases the chain’s DApp undertaking that is DeFi and the liquidity that is therein. Solana weekly DEX volume closed at a 9-week high of $35.6b, driving weekly REV to $25.9m SOL-USD volume share increased from 27% to 38% week over week The chain sustained ~1190 TPS over the week pic.twitter.com/94ibUroG3J — Dan Smith (@smyyguy) May 12, 2025 A key point from the week was the increasing strength of the SOL-USD trading pair. The share of volume for this pair jumped from 27% to 38% in just seven days, showing that it is not just a momentum token but one commanding renewed investor interest and higher confidence in Solana’s native token. As traders look for a DEX-friendly chain to trade on, Solana is rapidly becoming one of the options they are considering. The increasing trading activity isn’t taking place in isolation. It’s part of a broader trend of migrating to platforms based on Solana. DeFi users—previously firmly planted in Ethereum and other Layer 1 ecosystems—are starting to move their assets to Solana. They’re doing this in search of performance and user experience that’s better than what they found in those Layer 1 ecosystems. Unmatched Throughput and Network Reliability At the technical level, Solana keeps distinguishing itself from rival blockchains with its unmatched throughput. Last week, the Solana network kept a steady average of around 1,190 transactions per second (TPS). This high throughput is one key factor that lets such large volumes be handled with minimal latency or congestion. Another is that the TPS is stable over time. Overall, the network utilization is quite high. Many other blockchains struggle with increased usage, but Solana is different. Its architecture—an unusual arrangement of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS)—allows it to scale with demand, rather to the convenience of dApp users, one might say. Even when the weekend before the Catalan Christmas was especially busy, with lots of people using both the Ensemble and Enjambre dApps, every user of either dApp enjoyed seamless access with no degradation in service. So how did Solana do this? Solana consistently exceeds the performance benchmarks set by other smart contract platforms. This means it is handling more activity and doing so more efficiently. Why is this important? Because it positions Solana as the top destination for developers and liquidity providers to build and expand in the decentralized finance, or DeFi, space. Cross-Chain Flows Strengthen Solana’s Ecosystem A very significant signal showing how much Solana has grown and how much attention it is getting is the amount of assets being bridged into the network. In the past week alone, more than $120 million was bridged from other networks to Solana. Of that amount, over $70 million came straight from Ethereum, which has always been the base layer for DeFi. REPORT: Over $120 million bridged from other chains to @Solana in the last 7 days. (This includes over $70 million from Ethereum to Solana alone) pic.twitter.com/rTI9O4KYCd — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 12, 2025 People are taking a chance on Solana’s infrastructure and growth potential as they move their assets from Ethereum. Instead of staying mired in slow and expensive transactions, they are migrating to the cross-chain capital growth of Solana and its alternatives. And as more value moves into Solana and capitalizes on its decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity, the DEXs, yield farms, and other parts of its ecosystem become more liquid and attract even more activity. These changes indicate a larger market transition. Users are now requesting better efficiency, scalability, and cost savings in their DeFi transactions. Solana has popped up as a leading contender to provide all three of these elements. Its offering puts it in place as not just a DEX volume contender but also as a figure defining the future landscape of decentralized finance. Conclusion In the blockchain sector, Solana is making a mark with record DEX volume, an increase in revenue, a growing market share in trading pairs, and an impressive technical performance. Assets and users migrating from other ecosystems to Solana are an increasing part of its user base, and aside from the DeFi projects it already has on the go, the ecosystem’s competitive advantages are now becoming evident.

On May 12, the DeFi platform issued a warning on X, alerting users that “curve.fi DNS might be hijacked” and advising against any interaction. The incident involves the DNS of Curve’s official website being rerouted to a malicious front end. In a frontend hijack , attackers compromise the user-facing layer of a website, including interface elements like buttons, forms, and scripts, to intercept user inputs or trick them into authorising malicious transactions. Visiting the compromised domain could lead users to connect wallets and unknowingly give attackers access to their funds. In a follow-up update, Curve Finance clarified that while Curve’s smart contracts remain secure, the domain now “points to the wrong IP.” According to the Curve team, the platform’s two-factor authentication remains secure, and a support request has been submitted to the domain registrar to recover control of the DNS.

In an X post, Zhang pointed out that the hijack involved little more than a drainer link embedded in a clickable screenshot. The hackers barely even tried.

In August 2022, attackers exploited a similar vulnerability, but at the time, over $570,000 worth of crypto assets were siphoned before the issue was contained. Binance froze over $450,000 after the attacker attempted to move assets through its exchange, while Fixed Float recovered around 112 ETH. Curve later changed its DNS provider and advised users to revoke approvals linked to the compromised domain. The incident also appeared to weigh on market sentiment, with CRV, the native token of Curve DAO, down over 7% in the past 24 hours when writing. The latest DNS hijack comes just days after Curve Finance’s X account was compromised. On May 5, a hacker briefly took control of the platform’s social media handle, using the account to post phishing links. The incident was quickly contained, and Curve later clarified that no user funds were affected. “No security issues were found on our side, no user funds were impacted, no victims of phishing links which the hacker posted. All Curve systems remain fully operational,” Curve Finance wrote in a May 6 X post . Similar attacks have targeted X accounts of several other crypto projects and public figures in recent weeks, often to spread phishing links or promote scam tokens.

This increase in activity has pushed Base’s weekly revenue to $1.2 million, marking a notable moment in its journey as a major player in the Layer 2 ecosystem, which has become increasingly competitive. Base weekly DEX volume closed at a 9-week high of $7.4b, pushing weekly REV to $1.2m. Volume increases were relatively uniform across trading pairs Base continued its scheduled gas increases by jumping to a 35 mgas per second target, and now sustaining around ~120 TPS pic.twitter.com/cpR4abWdsV — Dan Smith (@smyyguy) May 12, 2025 The larger decentralized exchange (DEX) market also saw a sudden and steep rise in activity, with the average spot trading volume over the week reaching $75 billion—up an enormous 50% week over week. And once again, just about half of that volume—around 45%—was processed on Solana. Where Solana is Dominant in Decentralized Trading. Last week, DEX spot volume was $75B, increasing 50% week-over-week About 45% of this volume was on Solana. Memecoin trading was the largest trading pair category at 37%. @PancakeSwap was one of the biggest gainers, jumping from 10% to 15% of total DEX volume. pic.twitter.com/HLtTdUOjUM — Sharples (@0xSharples) May 12, 2025 Uniform Growth and Performance Upgrades on Base In contrast to a few other networks, where a few dominant pairs drive volume growth, decentralized trading this past week on Base showed relatively uniform activity across all pairs. There wasn’t one or two narratives that traders seemed to be super focused on in order to drive the price of pairs up. Instead, it looked like a lot of different kinds of traders, concentrated in a lot of different kinds of assets, were interacting with and diversifying within the protocol. Simultaneously with the increasing use of Base, the team continued to implement its planned upgrades to the underlying infrastructure. The network moved from an average gas target of 30 million gas per second to 35 million gas per second, and now sustains a throughput of approximately 120 transactions per second (TPS). This upgrade is part of Base’s overarching strategy to improve scalability and network performance. Base is evolving not just in user engagement but also in its technical capacity to meet rising demand—efficiently. This is indicated by two things: 1. A combination of increasing transaction volume and better throughput. 2. A user base rich in digital wallet engagements. Comparative Performance: Base Lags in Revenue Efficiency Although there is favorable momentum, Base still is behind the other significant networks when measured by total revenue (REV) as a share of DEX volume. A recent comparison of revenue efficiency among Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base found that Solana and Ethereum are the clear leaders, while Base trails behind them, with Arbitrum landing at the bottom of the comparison. Here is Total REV as a percentage of DEX volume for Solana, Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum Solana and Ethereum hover in the same general area, Base falls lower, and Arbitrum the lowest Historical I have measured this by only using ""Ordering fees"" (Includes priority fees, auction… pic.twitter.com/9VqiDXZJL6 — Dan Smith (@smyyguy) May 12, 2025 The revenue gap could indicate structural differences in the way these networks capture value. Although Base displays healthy transaction levels, it has yet to prove it can convert that into protocol-layer revenue. Three possible explanations come to mind for why Base remains in “fire sale” mode, allowing folks to transact on its layers for little or no cost: It’s possible that this is a temporary state of affairs, driven either by lower amounts of “gas” being charged in the Ethereum ecosystem or by the fact that Base just really isn’t trying to juice the kind of “monetization opportunities” (e.g., charging for access to its layers) that other kinds of networks are more aggressive about. Yet, the reduced revenue-to-volume ratio might also be construed as an attractive, user-friendly feature, suggesting that users can transact in large quantities without encountering hefty charges. For a network trying to enlarge its base and keep users around, that’s not a downside. Marketwide Trends: Solana Leads as Memecoins Dominate Looking at the overall market, Solana came out far ahead in trading volumes on decentralized exchanges last week, with roughly 45% of the $75 billion total. This shouldn’t be too surprising, considering that Solana is the fastest and cheapest major crypto network to use these days, and that seems to be what’s attracting retail traders. But the actual mechanics of the DEX market are a lot more complicated than that. The recent surge in growth has been mainly because of a shift toward community-driven, speculative assets that crypto users are driving up in the emerging market. Solana and the Layer-2 network Base have benefited from this, as both are able to support the kind of rapid, high-frequency trading that speculators on assets love to do. One standout in the DEX landscape was PancakeSwap, which saw its market share rise from 10% to 15% week over week. The surge positions PancakeSwap as one of the top gainers in the DEX space, suggesting that ecosystems outside of Ethereum and Solana are still competitive and capable of attracting user attention. Conclusion Base’s record-setting week in DEX volume and ongoing technical upgrades show that it is evolving into a serious contender in the Layer 2 landscape. While revenue efficiency still trails behind more mature chains, the network’s scalability improvements and steady trading growth point to a promising trajectory. As overall DEX volume continues to rise and memecoin mania drives user engagement, networks like Base are poised to play an increasingly important role in the decentralized future.

Atkins declared “a new day at the SEC,” pivoting away from regulation by enforcement toward creating clear regulatory frameworks through proper rulemaking processes. In order for the US to be the “crypto capital of the planet,” the Commission must “keep pace with innovation and consider whether regulatory changes are needed to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets,” he said. “Policymaking will no longer result from ad hoc enforcement actions.” Chairman Paul Atkins’ remarks at the Crypto Task Force roundtable on tokenization: The topic of this afternoon’s discussion is timely as securities are increasingly migrating from traditional (or “off-chain”) databases to blockchain-based (or “on-chain”) ledger systems. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 12, 2025 Issuance, Custody, and Trading Atkins compared the migration from traditional to blockchain-based securities to the digital revolution in the music industry. He suggested it could transform securities markets through enhanced liquidity, automation, and novel applications. There were three main focus areas at the roundtable : issuance, custody, and trading. He acknowledged that few crypto assets have used registered offerings, and is committed to developing clearer guidelines and potentially new registration exemptions for token issuers. The regulator also plans to provide more options for crypto custody, including revisiting “qualified custodian” requirements and potentially allowing self-custody solutions. Thirdly, Atkins was supportive of broader trading options, including “super apps” that combine securities and non-securities trading, and modernizing Alternative Trading System regulations. “In the past few years, the SEC first pursued what I call the ‘head-in-the-sand’ approach – perhaps hoping that crypto would go away,” he said before adding: “Then, it pivoted and pursued a shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later approach of regulation through enforcement.” Square Peg in Round Hole He referenced dated forms such as the S-1, which may not apply to crypto, adding, “We cannot encourage innovation by trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.” Atkins, who took the helm of the SEC in April, concluded: “I am eager to coordinate with colleagues in President Trump’s Administration and Congress to make the United States the best place in the world to participate in crypto asset markets.” The final roundtable titled “DeFi and the American Spirit” is scheduled for June 9. Earlier this month, the SEC and Ripple agreed on a $50 million settlement that ends the five-year legal battle that was instigated by the previous administration as one of its first moves in its war on crypto.

The fund chose accumulation in its own wallets, withdrawing ETH from exchanges. After withdrawing, the new ETH can once again be used in decentralized protocols to mint wrapped tokens, or as a staking asset. Most of the ETH held in the known Abraxas Capital wallets is in various wrapped forms, suggesting highly active DeFi usage. Abraxas accumulated nearly $400M in ETH in the past three days alone, signaling confidence in the asset.

Abraxas also used Bitfinex and Compound to increase its ETH positions or borrow stablecoins. | Source: Arkham Intelligence Abraxas tested a smaller transaction, sending 2.94K ETH to the Compound Bulker wallet. After that, the fund sent another $5M in USDC to Bitfinex. The fund’s biggest holding is AWETH , the Aave version of wrapped ETH. The wallet holds over 107K AWETH. Lido’s WSTETH is the second-biggest holding of 71.41K tokens. The wrapped versions suggest Abraxas is deeply involved with the Ethereum ecosystem, and is unlikely to quickly sell. Whales turn bullish on ETH The big question for ETH is whether it would achieve its promised breakout to a higher price range, or even a price record in 2025.

Signs of whale buying also appeared in March and April, as whales were seeking to lower their average entry price for ETH. At the same time, some holder were either taking profit , or abandoning ETH after breaking even. Ethereum has increased its on-chain activity in the past days, but returned to a relatively low baseline of gas prices. The Pectra upgrade is yet to show its full effect, but for now, gas for regular transactions is back at $0.08, while swap prices are down by 90% from peak times, to $1.34. Ethereum carries $61.13B in total value locked, returning to the levels from February. Lido and Aave have the strongest monthly gains, increasing their total value locked by 49% and 40%, respectively. Ethereum may expect more staking after the Pectra upgrade, as whales will be allowed to lock 2,048 ETH in one deposit.

With bullish forces, it came right back above the high volume profile level in mere days and is rising more with multiple optimistic factors. As of now, the only hurdle is $0.85, which also aligns with the falling channel’s upper border. Once it clears that hurdle, then it might retest the supply level at $1.10 by May 2025.

The cumulative long leverage positions (marked with red color) are indicative of bulls’ tremendous interest in pushing the ADA price higher in May 2025. ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: Coincrap Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

44557846,https://nulltx.com/?p=149542,1747122655,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin Surges Past $100K as Institutional Accumulation Accelerates,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-surges-past-100k-as-institutional-accumulation-accelerates/,"Last week, the cryptocurrency market reached a historic threshold as Bitcoin broke through the much-anticipated $100,000 mark for the first time. The price rally has spurred a new wave of bullishness among investors and institutions, with record outflows from exchanges and all-cash purchases of substantial amounts of BTC by major corporate holders. This collective behavior across almost all types of Bitcoin investors suggests a mounting accumulation phase—one that increasingly looks, in the eyes of many, like a confidence buildup in the cryptocurrency’s long-term store-of-value narrative. As Bitcoin crossed $100K last week, exchange flows turned negative. Over $550 million was withdrawn on Friday alone, signaling strong accumulation pressure. pic.twitter.com/oiLHmwZ5IQ — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 12, 2025 Exchange Outflows Signal Strong Accumulation As Bitcoin attained a price well above $100,000, on-chain data signaled a distinct change in flows to and from exchanges. On Friday, more then $550 million worth of BTC was moved off of centralized exchanges, an action that is almost universally interpreted as accumulation. These large withdrawals are only done when the investor is in for the long haul and is moving his or her assets to cold storage. Investors, both retail and institutional, seem to think the rally will keep going, and the latest data from trading platforms push the narrative into clearer focus. How so? The weekly net exchange flows into trading platforms turned negative. That means way more Bitcoin was moved onto trading platforms from wallets, as compared to the reverse. Historically, when bearish exchange flows happen during a bullish rally, it has aligned with continued upward price action. MicroStrategy Deepens Its Bet on Bitcoin Once again at the forefront is MicroStrategy, the U.S.-based business intelligence firm that has become a Bitcoin mega-holder. Last week, it announced a fresh purchase of 13,390 BTC, spending approximately $1.34 billion at an average price of $99,856 per coin. This latest buy reaffirms MicroStrategy’s aggressive acquisition of Bitcoin, even as the price of the asset appears to be reaching a new all-time high. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 13,390 $BTC ($1.34B) at an average price of $99,856 last week. #Strategy currently holds 568,840 $BTC ($59.08B), with an average buying price of $69,287 and an unrealized profit of $19.66B. https://t.co/ftbyrbNB96 pic.twitter.com/tpGyfvAten — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 After this newest buy, MicroStrategy is swimming in Bitcoin—568,840 of them, to be exact. They’re worth around $59 billion right now, and the price that MicroStrategy has paid to acquire its trove divides out to $69,287 per coin. So yes, if these Bitcoin never returned to the under-$20,000 prices they sported a year ago, this is a phenomenally profitable move for MicroStrategy. And it’s a move, by the way, with no parallel in the history of public companies. MicroStrategy’s unyielding dedication to Bitcoin as a principal treasury reserve asset has become one of the mainstays of its corporate identity. Its nearly daily purchases of Bitcoin serve as a beacon influencing market sentiment. Each new buy bolsters the image of Bitcoin as a strategic, long-term investment. Metaplanet Joins the Bitcoin Bull Run Following closely in the institutional race is Metaplanet, a publicly listed Japanese investment firm that has been making moves to call itself Asia’s answer to MicroStrategy. Metaplanet announced last week that it had added another 1,241 BTC to its balance sheet, spending $125.3 million at an average price of $100,967 per coin. That’s not far behind the 15,000 BTC MicroStrategy holds. Metaplanet( @Metaplanet_JP ) bought another 1,241 $BTC ($125.3M) at $100,967. Metaplanet currently holds 6,796 $BTC ($613.3M), with an average buying price of $90,243. https://t.co/LRlXDODQYc pic.twitter.com/o34vsOXJEB — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 By acquiring Bitcoin, Metaplanet has now surged to a total of 6,796 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $613.3 million. The company’s average cost basis for the purchase is just over $90,000, which means that Metaplanet is currently sitting on some unrealized gains that have profit written all over them. Measured in Satoshis, it is not as much as what MicroStrategy has, but in Asian financial markets, Bitcoin is starting to be treated like a real asset. The company’s focus on Bitcoin has not just boosted its international profile; it has also made it a player in the almost conspiratorial-sounding Bitcoin-as-hedge narrative that is gaining currency. Conclusion When Bitcoin surged above $100,000, the hype and hope surrounding it had almost turned it into a ridiculous yoke. But it could be that institutional investors really have settled into a perspective of trying to “understand” the asset. MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, two firms that have amassed Bitcoin, were brought up here as examples. I remember the course those firms have taken with regard to Bitcoin. Such developments suggest that Bitcoin is now much more than a simple speculative asset. Compared to just a few years ago, it is increasingly being seen as a strategic store of value. This is, of course, the vault where all the value is stored—institutional or otherwise—that has made Bitcoin anything but dead since its birth over a decade ago.

For now, though, it’s the sunshine and lollipops version of events that has both equity and digital asset markets on a broad-based rally. Bitcoin crept up to $104,100, continuing its tortoise-like move toward steady recovery, while Ethereum blasted past the $2,500 mark, the first appearance for it above that line in the last few weeks. The rest of the altcoin market seems to be joining the party, with at least a few tokens appearing to stage a comeback with double-digit percentage gains among them. Meanwhile, global stock indices have turned green as investor sentiment has appeared to be shifting quite solidly toward much safer, more stable territory. BREAKING: US & China are mutually stating that an agreement has been reached, with more details to come later Monday. Bitcoin ($104.1K) has mildly climbed, and altcoins are surging with Ethereum now all the way back above $2,500. Stock markets are reacting positively, with… https://t.co/SEmz0gwR2e pic.twitter.com/nNLYgH7bEJ — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 12, 2025 Crypto Markets React Swiftly, Ethereum Leads the Charge Even though the announcement did not immediately cause Bitcoin’s value to rise substantially, it did seem to inject some life back into the altcoin market—at least for a day. Of the major Bitcoin alternatives, Ethereum appeared to get the biggest boost. Its price surged to a level that most market-watchers see as important: above $2,500. Even better for Ethereum, it is now fully back to where it was before last month’s market meltdown. The trading volume on decentralized exchanges and crypto derivatives markets is rising sharply. It was 48% up compared to Q2 2021 when looking at the dollar value, according to my calculations based on data from The Block. We’re now at an annualized trading volume of $517 billion. Unlike centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges allow users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer. They utilize smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements, to facilitate transactions. And while trading cryptocurrencies on a decentralized platform might sound like a bad idea, it is actually the preferred option for many retail traders and some institutional ones as well. The larger altcoin market is reflecting moves in Ethereum. Why? Trader sentiment indicates that two factors are behind this sudden altcoin momentum: reduced macroeconomic uncertainty and potential trade policy easing. And while it might be too soon to break out the party hats, many traders are interpreting the current altcoin action as a sign that we might be done with the recent “risk-off” sentiment. Wall Street Joins the Rally, Tariff Relief Anticipated Weekend headlines also stirred strong reactions in the conventional markets. Stock indices in the U.S. and Asia opened higher, with futures suggesting much the same for the Monday trading session. The underlying hope is that the headlines coming out of the trade talks will be confirmed with a meaningful agreement that includes some provisions for reducing or eliminating variety of tariffs that have long encumbered exporters and importers in both countries. For months, tariffs have served as a significant market headwind. They have been especially tough on sectors tied to global trade, like manufacturing, technology, and agriculture. The very notion now of those anchors being lifted is pushing investors into a wave of optimism. Yet, numerous analysts and experienced traders are advising caution. Even though both countries have declared that a deal has been struck, many suspect the White House is referring to something much less formal and enforceable than an actual deal—an agreement in principle, rather than in practice. Caution Urged Ahead of Official Confirmation In spite of the excitement, market players are being urged not to get ahead of themselves. Analysts emphasize the waiting game that is now in play, with all eyes trained on official word from President Trump in the very early hours of Wednesday here in the U.S. Until those remarks are in—and provide clarity on the nature of the agreement, with even the precise wording being important to some—the whipsaw potential for markets remains. Financial markets have a long-standing history of reacting in both directions to headlines, especially when it comes to trade talks between the U.S. and China. The situation often unfolds like this: 1. A rumor comes out that negotiations are going well—markets rally. 2. The actual news comes out, and it’s a little bit lackluster—markets sell off. 3. Then, subsequent details from the actual negotiations come out, and they’re tepid at best—markets flail about. 4. Finally, in step 4, the markets realize that the negotiations aren’t really going anywhere, and we start to see some sustained selling. If the pact does, indeed, lower duties or furnish obvious economic impetuses for both exporters and importers, then we could very well be looking at a market that is in an extended bullish phase. But in the absence of actual confirmation, we would advise traders to be on the safe side and manage risk more closely than they might under usual conditions—especially in the kinds of positions that are likely to be highly speculative. Conclusion The announcement of the U.S.-China trade agreement has been met with an overwhelmingly positive initial market reaction—particularly in the cryptocurrency markets and equity prices. But for traders and investors who live and die by the tick, this is a moment to be cautiously optimistic. And why is that? Because we still don’t know much about what was actually agreed upon, and what it all means. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

By May 12, 2025, the ecosystem had surged well past the $2 billion mark to a total market cap close to $2.55 billion. Within the ecosystem, the value of all virtual AI agents had climbed by almost 12% in just a couple of days to a number that now sits very close to the $2.6 billion mark. This momentum drove Virtuals to recover a strong 29.79% of sector-wide mindshare, consolidating its leadership in the rapidly changing world of AI-powered agents. Virtuals Gains Market Share and Momentum as $VIRTUAL Price Climbs At the front of the pack was $VIRTUAL, the foundational asset of the Virtuals ecosystem, which rocketed 13.31% over the past 24 hours to hit a price of $2.1577. This vigorous price action underscores a fresh wave of investor faith in the project’s long-term payoff and the expanding usefulness of its burgeoning league of AI agents. The metrics for mindshare also showed a nice increase. Virtuals now commands 15.85% of the total AI-agent market attention, up by 0.544% from the previous day. The increase in market share is only one of the many positive indicators we see from this recent survey. It not only signals strong sentiment but also hints at the sector’s ongoing consolidation around a few leading projects, with Virtuals clearly at the forefront. This latest rally is especially meaningful when viewed in the context of the market as a whole. The Virtuals market was already on its way to being a robust destination in the digital economy, but this weekend’s moves take that momentum to the next level. The virtual economy is developing a robust ecosystem of deeply interactive and seamlessly interoperable modular AI agents—that is, just plain awesome artificial intelligence—and developers, investors, and users from across the digital economy are being sucked into it. Virtual’s total ecosystem market capitalization has now reached $2.55 billion, which signals continued growth across not just the core protocol but third-party agent integrations as well. It’s a strong position for the network to be in, arguably the central hub within the larger AI-agent space—representing about one-third of the entire sector. Microcaps Surge as Agent Innovation Fuels Expansion While the Virtuals soaked up all the attention, there was a handful of small-cap agents that were actually getting things done and, as a result, were growing like crazy. The top small-cap gainer was H1DR4, which, in a wild 24 hours, saw its market cap soar by 65.6% (this guy could be a top-10 contender before long based on what we see from him). Following closely behind in growth was AURA, which in 24 hours saw its market cap jump up by 62.58%. And TRUST, another small-cap agent, saw its market cap increase in a big way too (50.14% gains in 24 hours). Virtuals Daily Update | May 12th 2025 Catch up on one of the most impactful weekends in the @virtuals_io ecosystem in under 2 minutes… pic.twitter.com/OymgqVx0p8 — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 12, 2025 The top five are rounded out by NYKO (@niyoko_agent) and MUSIC (@MusicByVirtuals), which respectively gained 45.08% and 38.59%. These are substantial moves, and they speak to how not just flagship protocols but a whole range of projects within the AI agent landscape are seeing some serious upward momentum. Every one of these agents showcases a distinctive instance of what can be done within the Virtuals framework. Their use cases are pretty varied, too, and span from hyper-personalized media delivery (MUSIC) to ultra-reliable coordination tools (TRUST) and even some pretty advanced decision-making agents (H1DR4 and AURA). It’s wild to think that PRECISION, our most recent network extension, has already generated the sharpest price increases of any tool we’ve released to date. This diversified uptrend is taken as a sign of the market maturing. In past cycles, when we saw artificial intelligence tokens gaining value, the performance was often led by a few standout projects. These days, if you look in on the AI coin space, it’s hard to find many AI tokens that aren’t doing well. Conclusion Virtuals has become the clear leader in the AI-agent market following a weekend of tremendous growth. With a rising market cap and increasing mindshare, not to mention top-performing microcap agents, Virtuals is showing us what leadership looks like in this new digital frontier. As more developers and users enter the AI-agent space, all eyes will be on Virtuals to see how it continues to shape the rapidly expanding sector’s trajectory.

New data shows that the cryptocurrency exchange commands an astonishing share of USD Tether (USDT) transfers occurring on the TRON blockchain—a share that far eclipses all of its competitors combined. According to the data, Binance controls an average of 60% of all USDT activity happening on TRON—a blockchain that’s become an important part of the digital tether infrastructure. The data was revealed by the analytics platform Dune. Binance Rules Supreme in TRON USDT Transfers! Binance is dominating the crypto landscape, controlling, on average, 60% of all USDT transfers on the TRON blockchain compared to all other exchanges combined! What’s more, Binance moves approximately +$600M USD in USDT daily… pic.twitter.com/Qln7vFXapB — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) May 11, 2025 To further make the point, Binance has about $600 million in daily transfers, when compared against all of the USDT activity happening on the TRON blockchain; its competitors add up to only around $10 million daily, which constitutes 60% of what happens on TRON itself. Binance’s USDT Activity Outpaces All Competitors TRON’s blockchain has developed into one of the most popular networks for stablecoin transactions, largely due to its low fees and fast confirmation times. Indeed, of all the blockchains backing Tether’s USDT, TRON is usually the one processing some of the highest daily volumes. But inside the TRON ecosystem, Binance isn’t just a participant; it’s the undisputed leader. Sixty percent of all TRON-based USDT transfers are from or to Binance addresses, showing that the exchange has become the key on- and off-ramp for crypto traders, institutional clients, and liquidity providers all over the world. With that many transfers going through Binance’s wallets, what happens if the wallets become inaccessible, either because of a hack or an internal decision to suspend? And are those 60% portion of transfers going through accessible wallets, or the other 40% that don’t require the use of USDT in order to get something done, going to be accessible when I want in or when I want out? These extremely high levels of transactional activity give us clues about market behavior. When we see all this stablecoin pouring into exchange addresses, it can only mean one thing: There’s an awful lot of trading in the offing. That might be an uptick in trading demand, what we in the business like to call capital reallocation (sort of like trading your action figures with your buddies when you were 10 years old), or just getting ready for some big high-profile token swaps. Institutional Confidence and Liquidity Powerhouse Binance’s dominance stems from a blend of scale, infrastructure, and trust. The platform’s capacity to effectively manage the movement of billions of dollars in assets each day, across a multitude of networks and regulatory jurisdictions, has, in fact, made it the go-to place for not just professional traders but also institutional investors. Furthermore, its deep pools of liquidity and strong backing for stablecoins—including smooth incorporation of TRON USDT—allow traders to carry out orders with next-to-no slippage and greatly heightened efficiency. This plays right into our current positive feedback loop: The more liquidity Binance has, the more it makes sense for traders to trade there, which frankly is what makes it the epicenter of digital asset activity these days. Binance’s infrastructure for moving capital quickly and securely is relied upon largely by high-frequency trading firms, over-the-counter desks, and international arbitrageurs. The platform’s dominance in TRON USDT transfers reflects more than a mere user preference; it underscores Binance’s structural role in the crypto market—that of maintaining stability and liquidity. Shaping the Future of Stablecoin Utility With the stablecoins, such as USDT, becoming ever more entwined in the digital economy, the implications of Binance controlling their movement are serious. This is particularly the case because stablecoins are used, beyond trading, for payments in the digital economy, and for much else, with cross-border remittances being a prime example. TRON has emerged as a network of choice thanks to its efficiency, making it a prime choice for the use cases of these stablecoins. Likewise, if you are moving USDT within the TRON ecosystem, you are using it with the Tron network’s major stablecoin gatekeeper—Binance. The size of Binance’s business is likely to influence stablecoin policy conversations around issues of regulation, transparency, and cross-chain compatibility. Its market share means it is at the very first row in the intersection of crypto innovation and global finance. This level of dominance raises questions about decentralization, competition, and resilience. If one entity controls the majority of public blockchain transactions, it creates a dependent, and therefore vulnerable, system. Should that entity experience either kind of stress, the blockchain is likely to experience problems. Conclusion Binance is not just ahead of its rivals in the stablecoin sector; it has no close competitors. On a recent day, the exchange accounted for $621,688,813 in TRON-based USDT transactions. Its closest rival, Coinbase, handled just $976,898. And when it comes to USDT transfers across all blockchain platforms, Binance again towers over the competition. Its $626 million in daily USDT transactions means it is transferring more value across the world than the use of dollars, euros, or any fiat currency that moves across the SWIFT Network.

The stability comes despite a fresh warning from BlackRock, which flagged quantum computing as a long-term risk to Bitcoin’s cryptographic security in its latest iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) filing. The firm notes that future advancements in quantum technology could theoretically compromise digital asset security, though the risk remains distant. “While rare today, these disclosures are a prudent part of ETF documentation,” said analysts, adding they’re meant to prepare investors for evolving threats. This is the first time BlackRock has included quantum computing risks in its ETF literature, a move that reinforces the firm’s transparency. We have been waving the quantum threat flag for years, building the world’s first quantum-resistant, EVM-compatible hybrid blockchain while others dismissed the threat as distant sci-fi.

With this move, Metaplanet becomes the largest public Bitcoin holder in Asia and the 11th-largest globally. Large-scale acquisitions like this tend to reinforce market confidence, offering price support and signaling growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Technical Setup: Bitcoin Holds Trendline Support Bitcoin price prediction stays bullish as BTC’s action is showing technical resilience. The $100,772 level marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement from the recent $95,828–$105,716 rally. Combined with the upward trendline and 50-period EMA at $102,640, this area forms a strong base of support.

If BTC holds above support, a breakout toward $105K remains on the table. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.64M as 73% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is quickly gaining traction, recently surpassing $5.64 million in funds raised as it approaches its $6.69 million presale target. Priced at $0.00251 per token, BTCBULL has positioned itself as more than just another meme coin, offering real utility through flexible, high-yield staking that has captured investor interest. Flexible Staking Model Attracts Yield-Hungry Investors BTCBULL’s staking model is designed to appeal to those seeking high yields without sacrificing liquidity. Investors can currently earn an estimated 73% APY without the constraints of lockup periods or exit penalties, making it an attractive choice in a volatile market. This flexibility allows investors to remain agile, responding to market shifts without being locked into long-term commitments.

This approach has resonated with yield-focused investors, particularly as the 2025 crypto cycle heats up. With less than $1.05 million remaining before the next price hike, the presale window is closing fast, creating a sense of urgency among potential investors.

With @Uniswap hitting a major milestone of $3 Trillion in all-time volume, they've cemented their place as the biggest DEX in the space. This is an amazing feat, and I wonder how fast the next Trillion would come if Ethereum had a meme season just liek the one we've seen on… pic.twitter.com/3Y6z7U3lwV — King Crypto (@iam_kingcrypto) May 12, 2025 On May 12, the achievement was confirmed by Uniswap founder Hayden Adams and established the platform for sure as the top decentralized exchange in terms of trading volume. Uniswap, which officially launched in 2018, has been one of the major forces in DeFi. It has developed the AMM technology and is now used as a trading protocol on DeFi systems far more than any other alternative. Uniswap itself is a decentralized trading hub, but in terms of total value locked, it is far ahead of any other similar protocol. Daily Volume Stays Strong as Market Share Remains Solid At present, somewhere around $3 billion in trades are assigned to Uniswap each day. This isn’t just some kind of fancy statistic; it’s an impressive figure that speaks not only to the impressive liquidity of this new-style on-chain automated market maker (AMM) but also to how relevant it still is in an industry that seems to change every week. Uniswap is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about DEXs, and this exchange has a noteworthy 23% market share in this sector. The all-time volume of $3 trillion is more than just a symbol; it stands for billions of distinct transactions carried out sans the reliance on centralized middlemen. This volume wasn’t just thrown together overnight; it reflects years of actual development, a fair amount of our-kitchen-sink experimentation, and not inconsiderable community participation—all apparently happening on the frontlines of DeFi innovation. UNISWAP HITS $3 TRILLION IN ALL-TIME VOLUME @Uniswap has become the first decentralized exchange (DEX) to exceed $3 trillion in trading volume, as confirmed by founder @haydenzadams on May 12. It has a daily trading volume of around $3 billion and holds a 23% share of the… pic.twitter.com/YPWUtABf47 — Neel (Crypto Jargon) (@Crypto_Jargon) May 12, 2025 Uniswap’s protocol has been deployed across various blockchain networks, such as the Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks including Arbitrum and Optimism. This cross-chain expansion enables the protocol to sustain high transaction throughput and low user costs, giving it a far larger addressable market than almost any other DeFi protocol. UNI Token Still Lags Despite Protocol Success Uniswap enjoyed devastating success at the level of the protocol; however, at the present time, its native token, UNI, very much is not valorizing at the market level. Right now, UNI trades nearly 84% below its all-time high. This is very much a disconnect. It is also an instance of a much broader story in DeFi. And that story is this: protocol usage and token valuation are just not moving in tandem. Certain analysts believe that UNI’s low price may indicate wider concerns over DeFi governance, revenue capture, and upcoming regulations. Yet, some people see the current situation as a silver lining—arguing that DeFi tokens are simply at a low point in the cycle and that the Uniswap protocol will sooner or later lead to a proportionately valuable token. Even so, UNI stays one of the most broadly held and identified governance tokens in the crypto sector, and its long-term prospect is directly associated with the sustained development of Uniswap’s protocol and governance framework. Legacy of Innovation in a Changing Crypto Landscape Uniswap has transformed from a small trading venue into a trillion-dollar trading platform. Some factors that contributed to this success are open-source innovation and the power of decentralized finance. From its launch in 2018, Uniswap has attracted billions in liquidity, multiplied several times over, and become a market staple. As stated in our previous chapter, Uniswap seems to have found rendezvous near the founding pillars of both DeFi and Ethereum. What makes Uniswap different is not just its trading volume but its cultural and technical clout. It has made popular the concepts of liquidity pooling, permissionless token listing, and decentralized market-making—ideas that have since become industry standards. As cryptocurrencies continue to develop and move toward widespread acceptance, platforms such as Uniswap provide proof that decentralized technologies can work quite well without centralized control. Some community members have begun to ponder how soon Uniswap could hit, say, the next trillion in trading volume. Ethereum FOMO has already sent its gas fees to new highs, and a Solana-level surge in ETH meme coins could easily impel Uniswap to fresh volume peaks. Why not? Conclusion Crossing the $3 trillion trading volume mark is not just a win for the Uniswap protocol; it is a win for DeFi. It illustrates that decentralized infrastructure can compete with, and even exceed, centralized alternatives when it comes to scale, reliability, and user engagement. This milestone in the evolution of crypto showcases much of what long-term, community-driven growth, innovation, and resilience in the face of change can yield.

Traders across the region walked away from early gains after fresh fears over president Donald Trump’s trade decisions began creeping in. According to Reuters, the rally that kicked off after a 90-day truce between the US and China failed to hold. Wall Street’s Monday surge didn’t carry over. European futures pointed lower. Chinese stocks stayed flat. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures slid during the Asian session. Trump’s temporary pause in tariff hikes wasn’t enough to convince the markets that anything permanent was on the table. Asia turns cautious despite tariff reductions The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index outside Japan dropped 0.2%, right after hitting a six-month high earlier that same morning. Fitch Ratings laid out the numbers. The US effective tariff rate fell to 13.1% after the announcement—down from 22.8% before—but that’s still much higher than the 2.3% average seen at the end of 2024, and the highest since 1941. The market was already tense after Trump launched his tariff campaign back in early April. Since then, investors have been pulling money out of US assets and moving to safe havens like the yen, the Swiss franc, and gold. Trump’s new terms reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, and China agreed to cut tariffs on US imports from 125% to 10%. That sounded like progress on paper, but it didn’t move the needle in the markets. The sense was that this was a tactical pause, not a resolution. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1.67%, clearly reacting to the weak confidence. Over in Japan, the Nikkei jumped more than 2%, reaching its highest level since February 25. But even that spike wasn’t enough to convince people the situation was improving. Traders shift attention to inflation after trade pause Investors are now waiting to see what actually happens once the 90-day trade pause expires. But even before that, eyes are locked on US inflation numbers expected later on Tuesday. Those figures could have an impact on where the Federal Reserve goes next with rate policy. Matt Simpson, a senior market analyst at City Index, explained the thinking. “Should we be treated to another set of soft CPI figures, it could allow traders to refocus on Fed policy and the potential for cuts, and take some steam out of the dollar’s rebound,” Simpson said . Right now, traders have walked back their rate cut expectations. At the peak of trade panic in April, they were betting on more than 100 basis points of cuts. That’s now down to just 56 basis points for the rest of the year. US Treasury yields backed that up. The 2-year yield hit 3.9873%, and the 10-year was at 4.4512%, both sitting near one-month highs during Tuesday’s early trading session. That tells you people aren’t rushing into bonds the way they were last month. In crypto, bitcoin stayed steady at $102,676, sitting above the $100,000 level it passed last week. No big moves in that space despite the broader market weakness. Traders weren’t using bitcoin as a flight-to-safety asset on Tuesday. On the commodities side, oil prices dipped slightly after climbing to a two-week high on Monday when the trade agreement was first announced. As for gold, prices bounced back a bit after dropping 2% the day before. Investors who briefly dumped safe havens returned as confidence in the trade deal fell apart.

This recent movement saw ETH breaking through some key resistance levels, with the asset vaulting up from right around $1,800 to as high as we saw it go to—$2,580. That said, the sharp upward movement has kind of bumped into a wall at the $2.58K mark—an area where there seems to be a decent amount of on-chain activity signaling that investors might be taking some profits. ETH appreciated by over 40% in the past week, bringing the percentage of addresses in profit back above 60%, compared to just 32% one month ago pic.twitter.com/mwtsp6Px3g — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 12, 2025 Rapid Rise Fueled by Low Supply Concentration At first, Ethereum’s surge over $1,800 was supported by a supply void—there was a relatively low concentration of ETH held between $1.8K and $2.5K. This low-density zone allowed the price to move rapidly with little in the way of resistance. Thus, ETH crab walked upward with twin forces of good old greed and the sheer force of numbers. What does this all add up to? This upward trajectory, however, began to lose momentum near the $2.58K level. On-chain data shows that approximately 1.3 million ETH was held at or around that price point. As the price approached this zone, that figure dropped to about 1 million ETH, indicating that a number of holders began to redistribute their assets at or near their cost basis. This suggests that a wave of profit-taking is currently preventing further upward movement. The pressure on sales around $2.58K shows an investor base that is cautious. Many of these investors saw the recent surge in prices as just that—an opportunity to exit or reduce exposure in a not-so-bullish market. This activity implies that while the sentiment seems to be bullish, a true breakout is being contested by some investors because of rising macro uncertainty and mixed signals in the market. $ETH’s sharp move above $1.8K to $2.5K was aided by the low supply concentration in that range. The rally stalled near $2.58K, where ~1.3M ETH was held. As price approached this level, supply there fell to 1M -indicating distribution near cost basis as holders exited:… pic.twitter.com/ngpBoarrVU — glassnode (@glassnode) May 12, 2025 Profitability Rises as Investor Sentiment Shifts The recent rally has not only boosted Ethereum’s price but has also returned a substantial number of holders to profitability. As the latest data show, more than 60% of Ethereum addresses are now profitable—up sharply from just 32% a month ago. This is a significant turnaround in investor sentiment, especially after a prolonged period of rumination earlier this year. And of course, it also increases the number of people potentially talking up and using Ethereum. The incentive to liquidate positions, especially those bought on previous dips, has for many been this first return to profit since the bear market began. It also highlights the not-so-average influence of cost basis on trading behavior. Traders seem to be in a much better mood when trading from a positive cost basis instead of a negative one. Nonetheless, the increase in profits also suggests that Ethereum could now reap the rewards of renewed long-term holder confidence, a group that looks increasingly unrattled by recent price volatility. If Ether can continue this current price upswing and, over the next several days and weeks, manage to consolidate above a number of key technical levels (which, as is often the case in these kinds of discussions, will be interpreted by some as good news and by others as potentially bad news), is there any reason not to think that the outlook for ETH could improve? Support Floor Established Between $2,060 and $2,420 Even though there’s resistance at $2.58K, Ethereum is underpinned by a sturdy support floor that might buffer it against future volatility. On-chain data indicate that the support zone most critical to Ethereum’s health is between $2,060 and $2,420. Within this price band, more than 69 million ETH is held across around 10 million unique addresses. A robust foundation for price stability exists in this zone because of the accumulation that has taken place. In the event of a correction in the price of ETH, strong buying interest will probably materialize within this range to provide support and set the price up for another upward move. The most important support floor for #Ethereum is between $2,060 and $2,420, where 10 million wallets hold over 69 million $ETH ! pic.twitter.com/dyyHAlAd6I — Ali (@ali_charts) May 12, 2025 Yet, actions taken by investors will be affected by the overall state of the market, by how macroeconomics is faring, by what sort of regulatory actions their governments are taking, and by how much institutional interest there is. Spot ETF Outflows Indicate Institutional Hesitancy Surprisingly, even with ETH climbing, Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net outflows. From May 5 to May 9, these ETFs had outflows of $38.15 million. Their recent pattern of outflows, against the backdrop of ETH’s strong performance, appears to suggest that institutional investors are now a bit more cautious on Ethereum. If anything, it’s retail investors who seem to be more optimistic about Ethereum at the moment. The outflows from the ETF might show that profit-taking is in effect, or they might demonstrate institutional reassessments of risk or even of recent short-term market conditions. Of course, it may just be that some market segments aren’t as bullish on ETH as others are. During last week’s trading days (May 5–9), Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded $934 million in net inflows, marking the fourth consecutive week of inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw $38.15 million in net outflows for the week. https://t.co/Yanotfbotb — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 12, 2025 The point here is not really to guess the causes of the drops in total assets under management. It’s to recognize that any outflows from a product as potentially impacting price as an ETF clearly have AUM-centric institutional sentiment behind them. As Ethereum gives way to the levels it currently trades at, the question is whether it can hold above its support floor and, in time, push up and past the resistance it has encountered just beneath $2.58K.

With SWIFT facilitating over $150 trillion annually in cross-border payments, this marks a pivotal shift in institutional finance. BREAKING: SWIFT CONFIRMS CRYPTO GOES LIVE 11/2025 SWIFT processes $150T+/yr. Settlement Place = DLT Wallet Cash Account = DLT Wallet Network Fees = Gas Oracles = Trusted Pricing UTI = Tokenized Tx Sequencing Implications for $XRP / $HBAR & Utility Networks pic.twitter.com/Fdbvg4tGWk — King Solomon (@IOV_OWL) May 12, 2025 New Standards Enable Direct Blockchain Compatibility SWIFT’s 2025 standards upgrade introduces major infrastructure-level changes that accommodate blockchain technology. According to Solomon, the updates include support for blockchain wallet addresses as places of settlement and cash accounts, implementation of crypto-style gas fees, use of trusted oracles for smart contract pricing, and nonce-based tracking for sequencing tokenized transactions. These changes apply to legacy MT formats and the ISO 20022-based MX formats, ensuring that traditional and modern financial messaging systems align with distributed ledger infrastructure. XRP’s Increasing Relevance While multiple networks stand to benefit, Solomon stressed the significance of this development for utility-driven ecosystems, particularly XRP. Ripple’s longstanding vision of using XRP as a bridge asset for compliant cross-border payments aligns with SWIFT’s new direction. He described platforms like the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Hedera as foundational to the new financial infrastructure, noting that they work with governments, banks, and Fortune 500 companies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The ISO 20022 alignment of platforms within these ecosystems allows them to integrate more easily into updated financial systems. With SWIFT now recognizing blockchain-native constructs and offering fields for token identifiers and CBDC support, networks like XRP are no longer on the periphery of innovation. They are positioned as core elements in global finance. Institutions are Ready for Adoption Solomon also noted the broader context of institutional readiness. HederaCon earlier this year featured SWIFT’s Alyssa DiCaprio, who spoke about building digital public infrastructure and reducing financial fragmentation. Her presence and discussions between SWIFT and key blockchain players indicate growing institutional collaboration with distributed ledger platforms. Solomon also referenced BlackRock’s recent outreach to the SEC to discuss tokenization frameworks, staking, and digital asset products. The scale of institutional engagement is significant, and with over $21 trillion managed through its Aladdin platform, BlackRock’s movement toward tokenized finance reinforces the scope of what SWIFT’s upgrade could unlock. Real Integration, Not Speculation The SWIFT MX and MT 2025 documents confirm that blockchain integration is no longer aspirational. Wallet-based settlement, smart contract oracles, token sequencing, and DLT interoperability are being built into the global messaging infrastructure. For XRP and similarly positioned utility networks, this is not hype—it’s the infrastructure shift they were designed for.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, backed by Peter Thiel, has partnered with the Government of Gibraltar and the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission to create the regulatory framework for clearing and settling crypto derivative contracts. In a Tuesday press release , the exchange said it wants to bring the same level of risk management and oversight seen in traditional markets to the crypto space as there is currently “no regulation that specifically addresses the clearing needs of the crypto industry,” pointed out Tom Farley, CEO of Bullish. “While Central Counterparties have become more robust in other asset classes, this initiative will bring that same robust risk management and regulatory oversight to the crypto clearing space that EMIR & Dodd-Frank brought to traditional derivatives markets.” Tom Farley The framework could allow certain cryptocurrencies to be used as collateral and settlement currency, though the press release doesn’t list which ones. It also expands which institutions can hold collateral, which Bullish says will boost market participation and trust. The new model introduces a regulated clearing house that is separate from the exchange itself in an effort to increase transparency and reduce risks for market participants.

Brendan Blumer’s Block.one launched Bullish in 2021, backing the exchange with $10 billion in funding.

For the week ended May 9, digital assets saw a total of $882 million in inflows, which brings the year-to-date (YTD) total for 2024 to a stunning $6.7 billion. The vast majority of this week’s capital influx—$867 million—went directly into Bitcoin, reinforcing its dominant position in the crypto investment landscape. Ethereum, by contrast, recorded a modest $1.5 million in inflows; investor caution around the second-largest digital asset seems to be ever-present. CoinShares reports $882M in digital asset inflows last week, the fourth straight week, bringing 2024 YTD total to $6.7B. Bitcoin led with $867M, while Ethereum saw just $1.5M. U.S. crypto ETFs have now reached $62.9B in cumulative inflows. https://t.co/AHt0QEXBhN — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 12, 2025 This is a demand surge, especially funneled through U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), that has sent cumulative inflows into these investment vehicles soaring. As of May 9, total cumulative inflows into U.S. crypto ETFs had reached $62.9 billion; and, by and large, the BTC part of the ETF still seems to be catching fire. (That’s despite, or perhaps in part because of, the closer-than-usual ETF approval timeline path outlook.) The total amount of Bitcoin held across U.S. spot ETFs now stands at around 1.175 million BTC. That’s just around 6,500 BTC shy of the all-time high of 1.182 million BTC held across U.S. spot ETFs. Moreover, in total inflow terms, this recent rally in the BTC price has completely offset any earlier outflows across this space. As of May 9, the total amount of $BTC held across US spot ETFs was approximately 1.175M BTC. This is just ~6.5K BTC below this metric's ATH of 1.182M $BTC . Recent inflows have now offset earlier outflows, signaling renewed demand strength for BTC: https://t.co/sBGkzJKI9V pic.twitter.com/BhG2Yh1l6O — glassnode (@glassnode) May 12, 2025 ETF Demand and First-Time Buyers Fuel the Rally Key catalysts for Bitcoin’s upward momentum have been ETF inflows. From May 5 to 9, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $934 million in net inflows. This was the fourth week in a row that inflows had happened, making it look like something of a big relief rally. Or it was at least investors pouring fresh capital into what increasingly seems like a two-step crypto recovery. During last week’s trading days (May 5–9), Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded $934 million in net inflows, marking the fourth consecutive week of inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw $38.15 million in net outflows for the week. https://t.co/Yanotfbotb — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 12, 2025 In addition to the information regarding ETF data, blockchain analytics provide a clearer picture of what the newly emerging market entrants are up to. An item of note: the “First-Time Buyers RSI” (Relative Strength Index), which gauges demand from first-time Bitcoin buyers, not only held steady at 100 (the peak reading) for the entire week but also managed that feat in the context of some fairly obvious downside price action. Demand from first-time buyers is as strong as it ever gets. Yet, not all sentiment indicators suggest that the upside is clear and free. The “Momentum Buyers RSI” is still very much subdued and murky, at around 11. This RSI reading suggests that market makers and short-term traders have yet to fully re-engage with this market. Speculation is weak and getting weaker, despite the attractive price action that’s been booking new highs. $BTC Supply Mapping shows sustained strength in new demand. First-Time Buyers RSI has held at 100 all week. But Momentum Buyers remain weak (RSI ~11), and Profit Takers are rising. If fresh inflows slow, lack of follow-through could lead to consolidation: https://t.co/vHqbU4hrPt pic.twitter.com/Ghqynb296Y — glassnode (@glassnode) May 12, 2025 Miners in Profit, But Caution Looms The upswing in the market has also brought profits to Bitcoin miners. They earned more than $10.37 million in profits just last week, according to the latest data. With stable network hash rates, healthy inflation in transaction fees that are steadily contributing to revenue, and a sector that appears to be in solid shape, Bitcoin mining seems to be reinforcing the overall bullish backdrop. #Bitcoin $BTC miners have realized over $10.37 million in profits! pic.twitter.com/QbDQSUF0PG — Ali (@ali_charts) May 12, 2025 Nevertheless, increasing profit-taking appears to be underway, most visibly from holders with a longer-term orientation. On-chain indicators have detected a swelling number of wallets that seem to be moving their assets to exchanges, seemingly the precursor to cashing in their recent profit. This uptick in realized profit could apply some short-term downward pressure on the market; if the market wasn’t rangebound, we might’ve called this a pullback. Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory may hinge on the balance between new capital flowing into the space and existing holders cashing out. Total holdings in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin are just shy of record levels. And cumulative inflows into U.S. crypto ETFs have now crossed $63 billion. Yet, without the space attracting new major interest and inflows from ETF momentum traders, it is possible the Bitcoin rally could morph into a sideways consolidating pattern. Looking Ahead The crypto market is growing. Investor behavior was initially a function of what investors thought about crypto itself. Now, it’s increasingly molded by three big things: 1. The inflation and interest rate backdrop. 2. Regulatory clarity. 3. The degree to which big institutions are getting involved. Inflows into Bitcoin-related ETFs are coming in steadily now, and the recent strength from fresh buyers is a good look for Bitcoin. But honestly, we’re a bit on edge, watching to see how long this runs without anything to come along and mess it up. Should inflows continue to be robust, Bitcoin might be situated to take another run at the all-time high price level. Alternatively, if demand weakens and profit-taking amounts to what some are calling “mopping the floor,” then the market may return to a consolidation phase awaiting a next catalyst. Currently, Bitcoin is firmly in the spotlight. It is propped up by institutional demand. It is underscored by a strong fundamental story. And it is closely watched by both optimists and skeptics.

US CPI Data On the Horizon—Will Bitcoin (BTC) Price Drop below $100K or Rise Back to $105K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Soon after the US-China trade war eased and a 90-day pause came into effect, the crypto markets experienced massive relief from the bearish influence. The Bitcoin price surged past $100K and formed highs above $105K, which raised the possibility of the start token marking a new ATH. Meanwhile, the CPI data, which is expected to be released soon, has spread shock waves across the markets. The tokens, including Bitcoin, have been displaying huge volatility since the early trading hours and are experiencing a rise in selling pressure. In the times when the BTC price is just 6% away from its ATH, will it resume its upswing to form new highs? The BTC price and the entire market are consolidating ahead of the data, as they do each time, but this has not remained for a long time. The Truflation shows 1.68% inflation, while the FED expects 2.4%. If in case, the CPI confirms the rates, then the crypto markets are expected to explode. This data is expected to show the first clear signs of inflationary impacts from President Trump’s tariffs. In such a scenario, the BTC price could probably rise above the corrective phase and reclaim the lost highs. The BTC chart is pointing towards the growing bullish influence on the token. Ever since the price has surged above the 200-day MA, the possibilities of a Golden Cross have been more prominent. On the other hand, the RSI has reached the upper threshold for the first time since November 2024. Just before this, the token underwent a Golden Cross, which resulted in a 60% upswing. Now that the technicals have reached similar levels, another bullish crossover between the 50/200-day MA could propel the BTC price towards new highs, probably beyond $115K. On the other hand, the CME gap between $91,970 and $92,730, which has formed recently, may raise some concerns, as the price has been addressing all the gaps lately. Therefore, the next rejection could be huge, which may drive the BTC price below this range, while the rebound may be based on the strength of the bulls, as the liquidity has already accumulated around this range. Hence, it would be interesting to watch the next course of action of the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally in May 2025.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 08:07:27

Dogecoin loyalists meet their match as Lightchain AI’s $19.6m presale signals a powerful new player in crypto’s next big wave. Table of Contents Collective power of Dogecoin’s community Lightchain AI: Shaping the future of blockchain Millionaire maker of 2025? Cryptocurrency investors are always searching for the next big opportunity, and the competition between Dogecoin and Lightchain AI is heating up. Dogecoin, a popular memecoin with a devoted fanbase, continues to be a go-to choice for many in the crypto space.

He argues that the meta blockchain will post data on any chain, such as Ethereum, Celestia, or Solana, and use a specific rule to merge data from all the chains into a single order history. The entrepreneur noted that the blockchain would also let apps or users choose the cheapest data availability layer at any given time rather than sticking to just one. Yakovenko said that making data availability cheap makes everything else cheap, highlighting bandwidth as the key constraint. He believes it could be a significant development for rollups, aggregators, or any app dealing with lots of cross-chain activity. There should be a meta blockchain. Post data anywhere, Ethereum, celestia, Solana, and use a specific rule to merge data from all the chains into a single ordering. This would actually allow the meta chain to use cheapest currently available DA offer. — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) May 12, 2025 He said it can publish data across various blockchains, including on Ethereum , Celestia, and Solana, and use a specific rule to merge the data from all the chains into a single ordering. Anatoly believes it would allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer. He acknowledged that MetaTX posted to Solana would include the last observed block from ETH and Celestia, ensuring consistent sequencing. According to him, the data would then be merged into a single sequence using specific rules to leverage the most cost-effective data availability services. “Simple way to do this would be for the tx to reference the latest block headers from the potential DA layers. So MetaTX posted to Solana would include the last observed block from eth and celestia. This would mean it is guaranteed to be ordered after eth and celestia txs.” – Anatoly Yakovenko , Co-Founder of Solana. A developer named Belac responded with his spin on the proposed blockchain. He wondered if the meta chain was a P2P node/seeker network, like a torrent system that stores multi-chain data in chunks, and people earn by seeding historical blocks. He argued whether that could solve the history problem and make the whole thing community-run. Toly didn’t really feel that direction and replied that it was totally different from what he was proposing. He also added that the point is just to use a globally agreed-upon merge rule and not run any network alone. Yakovenko acknowledged that the meta blockchain will help devs write once, post anywhere, and still get a single clean history while picking whichever chain has the best data deal at the moment. Projects are already experimenting with mix-and-match setups in today’s modular blockchain world, including one for execution, another for data, and maybe even another for consensus. Toly emphasizes flexibility in L1 protocols There is no reason to build an L2. L1s can be faster, cheaper, and more secure. They aren’t slowed down by a glacially moving L1 data availability stack, or have to compromise security with complex fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs. https://t.co/Ov3YAfz9U4 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 Solana co-founder acknowledged that underlying Layer 1 (L1) protocols should be sufficiently flexible to allow applications to compete in their business operations. He argued that they will pursue such strategies if applications can drive business growth through differentiated priorities. Toly also noted that if an L1 hinders their growth, they will likely migrate away from it. He mentioned that the concept is straightforward, adding that preventing applications from trying ideas they believe could aid growth, even if deemed bad, may encourage them to leave the L1. On-chain data from Nansen showed that Solana had the highest number of active addresses among public blockchains over the past week, with 24.26 million. Onchain Lens also reported on Monday that a major whale or institution had unstacked 103,040.6 SOL, valued at $17.7 million, after a month of dormancy. According to the analytics firm, the whale still retains a substantial holding of 3,369,634 SOL, worth approximately $584.09 million. At the time of publication, Solana is exchanging hands at $171.57, a 3.89% drop in the last 24 hours. The digital asset has jumped 88% in four weeks from under $100 to now trading above $170.

Liquidation Wipes Out $500M appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market started the week on a high, with Bitcoin climbing above $102,000 during the Asian session following news of a 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China. However, the bullish momentum didn’t last. As the New York session opened, Bitcoin sharply pulled back, hitting an intraday low of $100,700 and wiping out most of its early gains. Traders turned cautious ahead of key macro events, particularly the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set to be released Tuesday. Macro concerns are driving the market now, and all eyes are on the June Fed meeting,” says Jeff Mei ( @jeffmeiofficial ), COO at #BTSE , in response to Monday’s $500M crypto liquidation. A temporary U.S.-China tariff truce may have eased equities—but it’s cooled #crypto ’s risk-on… — BTSE (@BTSE_Official) May 13, 2025 Crypto Liquidations Shake the Market The sudden drop triggered over $500 million in long liquidations across the crypto market. Bitcoin futures alone saw nearly $200 million wiped out , while Ether followed with $170 million, according to Coinglass. Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a major liquidation risk zone, noting that if Bitcoin fell to $102,700, it could trigger up to $1.45 billion in forced liquidations. He also warned that Bitcoin’s chart structure is beginning to resemble its 2021-22 cycle, a breakout followed by a steep decline, raising concerns of a repeat crash. Altcoins Take a Hit The dip wasn’t limited to Bitcoin. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) both fell around 7%, while Solana (SOL), XRP, and BNB lost 5%–6%. This sharp reversal comes just days after Ethereum rallied 40%, and Bitcoin briefly broke $104,000 amid massive short liquidations. US-China Tariff Rollback The cooling risk appetite appears linked to the U.S.-China tariff rollback. While the agreement helped stock markets, it tempered the aggressive speculative trading that had driven crypto’s recent rally. Futures open interest fell by $1.2 billion across major exchanges, showing that traders rapidly exited leveraged positions. Next Stop: The Fed Market watchers now turn to June’s Federal Reserve meeting. BTSE COO Jeff Mei says the Fed’s tone will be key, a dovish shift could stimulate economic activity and potentially give crypto another lift. But until then, investors remain cautious, bracing for more volatility. In short, optimism has quickly turned into caution, and Bitcoin’s latest dip is a fresh reminder of how fragile rallies can be in today’s macro-driven crypto environment.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 08:16:13

According to El-Erian, although markets may see some relief in the short term in light of global economic uncertainties and geopolitical developments, the road is not smooth and will be quite bumpy. El-Erian, who pointed out that economic activity will increase in the next 90 days thanks to the trade truce between the US and China, stated that this situation may be temporary and many uncertainties still continue. Regarding the expectations of the FED to cut interest rates, he made the following assessment: “The possibility of a rate cut has decreased and has been postponed in time.” Related News: What Will Happen to the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Going Forward? Analysts Share Their Short-Term Expectations El-Erian noted that despite the decline in what economists call “soft data,” “hard data” remains strong, creating mixed signals. He predicted that the U.S. economy will slow down somewhat and inflation will increase, but a sudden jump in unemployment is not expected. He said that companies are avoiding making major decisions, and layoffs may therefore be limited. The program also discussed the effects of trade wars on reshaped supply chains. El-Erian said that companies are no longer acting with a “China + 1” model, but with a “China + 2 or 3” strategy, which could encourage investment in the U.S. However, he said that for this to happen, the U.S. administration needs to provide clarity on trade policies. Finally, regarding the global economic outlook, El-Erian said, “We are moving between two possibilities: one is economic fragmentation, the other is a stronger US within a fairer trading system. Right now, the second scenario looks a little more likely, but it's still a 50/50 situation.” *This is not investment advice.

In a May 12 statement, GDC and its subsidiary, AI Catalysis, announced entering into a common stock purchase agreement with a British Virgin Islands limited liability company to sell up to $300 million of its common stock. The proceeds from the stock sale will be used to fund the firm’s crypto treasury, which will include purchases of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. “Under this initiative, and subject to certain limitations, GDC intends to allocate a significant portion of the proceeds from any share sales under the facility to the acquisition, long-term holding, and integration of crypto assets into its core treasury operations,” the company said in the announcement. GDC described the strategy as a move to align with the broader “decentralization transformation.” GDC stock price, 1-year chart.

The stock offering was announced over a month after the firm received a noncompliance warning from Nasdaq related to its stockholders’ equity. The notice indicated that the firm reported stockholders’ equity of only $2,643, well below the minimum requirement of $2.5 million. The firm was given until May 4 to submit a plan to comply with the listing requirements. If accepted by Nasdaq, the compliance plan will allow up to 180 days from the notification period to comply with the requirements.

Shiba Inu’s massive transaction spikes signal whale interest. Pepe Coin’s technical rebound hints at a breakout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project, is raising millions in its presale, driven by a lending model that promises stability. These coins, each distinct, are poised to challenge Ripple (XRP) with their momentum. Investors are watching closely as these underdogs carve paths to growth, fueled by market dynamics and strategic designs. Shiba Inu’s Transaction Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is stirring the crypto market with a colossal 6.7 trillion token transfer in a single day marking a weekly peak. This surge recorded on May 9, 2025 points to large holders or institutions quietly accumulating. Trading at $0.0000135 SHIB is testing resistance at $0.0000140 a level it has struggled to breach for months. A break above could propel it toward the 200-day EMA at $0.000016, bolstered by rising volume. Yet, SHIB’s reliance on whale activity leaves it vulnerable to sudden shifts, unlike more structured projects. This momentum, while promising, needs sustained buying to outpace Ripple (XRP). Pepe Coin’s Technical Rebound Pepe Coin (PEPE) is clawing back from a low of $0.00000760, now trading at $0.00000817 as of May 8, 2025. A cup-and-handle pattern is forming, with a potential breakout target of $0.00001465 if it clears the $0.0000090 resistance. Whale accumulation, up 20% this year with 24 trillion tokens added, fuels optimism. Open interest at $396 million, with 52.78% long positions, reflects market confidence. However, PEPE’s meme-driven volatility contrasts with Ripple’s established network, making its outperformance a gamble unless technicals hold firm. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its utility focus, offers a sharper contrast. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention in its fourth presale phase, 70% filled at $0.025 per token. Having raised $8,000,000 and sold over 455 million tokens to 9,700 holders, the project’s demand is undeniable. The opening phase at $0.01 sold out swiftly, and phase 4’s price reflects a steady climb. Phase 5 looms with a 20% price hike to $0.03, offering current buyers a 20% gain. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with results soon to be shared on social platforms, boosting transparency. A new dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens, adds urgency to join the ranks. Mutuum’s DeFi Angle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart with its lending and borrowing platform, enabling passive income through mtTokens. Depositors receive tokens like mtETH for ETH, accruing interest over time. A buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers, ensuring constant demand. The tokenomics project a listing price of $0.06, delivering a 140% ROI from the current $0.025. Analysts see a post-launch surge to $2.50, a 9,900% ROI, driven by DeFi adoption. Unlike SHIB and PEPE’s speculative spikes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility, positioning it as a stronger contender against Ripple (XRP). Racing Ahead of Ripple Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) ride waves of market sentiment, but their volatility pales against Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s calculated growth. SHIB’s whale-driven surges and PEPE’s technical patterns lack the structural depth of Mutuum’s DeFi model. With phase 4 nearing its end, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors face a narrowing window to secure tokens at $0.025. The crypto market rewards foresight, and these three coins, especially Mutuum Finance (MUTM), signal potential to eclipse Ripple (XRP). Explore these projects now to join the ascent.

The platform issued a direct statement on May 12 via its official account, making it clear that the claims were unfounded. “Contrary to rumors, Truth Social is not launching a memecoin,” the platform stated . The message was echoed by Donald Trump Jr., who posted on X, “There’s no truth whatsoever about Truth Social launching a memecoin. Don’t be fooled by false information people are circulating.” Notably, Trump Jr. is the eldest son of the U.S. President Donald Trump, who owns a majority stake in the media group. The rumors began after Ran Neuner, host of the Crypto Banter podcast, tweeted that a “Truth Social token” was expected to launch within 72 hours. Neuner also suggested that the same team behind the TRUMP token was involved. Trump’s History with Tokens Fuels Speculation Despite the denial, some believe the rumors gained traction due to Trump’s existing involvement in crypto-related ventures. The president has launched his own TRUMP token, and First Lady Melania Trump introduced the MELANIA token , further fueling public curiosity about the Trump family’s interest in digital assets. Recently, Donald Trump sparked controversy after announcing that the top holders of the TRUMP token would be invited to a gala dinner on May 22. The announcement drew criticism, particularly from U.S. senators, some of whom had previously called for Trump’s impeachment over his involvement in launching the token. Adding to the tension, a Bloomberg report suggested that many of the largest TRUMP token holders are likely based outside the United States. This development has prompted concerns from lawmakers over potential foreign influence and lack of transparency. Data shows that 220 wallets hold more than 13.7 million TRUMP tokens, with a total value of around $174 million at the time of reporting. TRUMP Token Still Volatile The TRUMP token, which reached a high of $73.43 in January, has since fallen more than 80%. Despite the decline, the token has seen a recent uptick, gaining nearly 14% in the past week and currently trading at $12.52, according to CoinGecko. Wallets referencing names like “Sun” and “elon” have raised eyebrows, with many speculating about connections to Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk—both known Trump supporters.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles – Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors’ sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that “technically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.” However, “until that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.” According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range’s lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level “to turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.” Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break – $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC’s lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest “doesn’t need to happen at all,” as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. “But in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC’s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,” he concluded.

In a May 13 announcement , Tether said its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt), has been listed on Thai exchange Maxbit. According to an X announcement by Maxbit, the platform is the first in Thailand to offer a “tokenized gold pair backed by physical gold.” Launched in January 2020, Tether Gold is a gold-backed digital asset with a market cap of $802 million, with each XAUt representing ownership of one troy ounce of gold. Thailand greenlighted stablecoins like Tether USDt in March Tether Gold’s entrance in the Thai cryptocurrency market follows other notable stablecoin-related regulatory developments in the country.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.12 Market cap $1.12B Trading volume $1,301,169,643.82 Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $1.31 24-hour low $1.07 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 28.53% 50-day SMA $0.5140 14-Day RSI 75.40 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $1.354 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF faces rejection at $1.3 TL;DR Breakdown WIF is down 3.39% today. WIF is trading well above the 20-day SMA. The rally looks healthy, although it is slowing down. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF uptrend slows, but buyers remain in the market WIF is taking a breather after a sharp rally, down 3.39% today (May 13) to around $1.11. The price is still well above the 20-day SMA at $0.697, signaling a strong uptrend. However, two red candles suggest slowing bullish momentum and possible short-term profit-taking. WIF uptrend slows, but buyers remain in the market Technically, the MACD is still bullish with widening lines and green histogram bars, confirming upward momentum, though it may be peaking. The OBV (On-Balance Volume) continues climbing, indicating solid buying interest remains. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF struggles below resistance at $1.238 WIF remains in an uptrend but is currently cooling off after reaching the upper Bollinger Band at $1.238. The price has pulled back slightly to $1.110. Short-term candles show reduced bullish momentum and some indecision. WIF struggles below resistance at $1.238 The CMF is positive at 0.08, indicating continued capital inflow, while the MFI sits at 65.53 — near overbought but not extreme. These levels support a healthy pause rather than a reversal. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7113 BUY SMA 5 $0.7106 BUY SMA 10 $0.6529 BUY SMA 21 $0.6243 BUY SMA 50 $0.5140 BUY SMA 100 $0.5857 BUY SMA 200 $1.3541 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5789 BUY EMA 5 $0.5219 BUY EMA 10 $0.4727 BUY EMA 21 $0.4677 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.5803 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.9150 BUY EMA 200 $ 1.3635 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is consolidating after a strong rally, currently holding above key support at $1.00. Indicators show healthy buying pressure, and momentum remains bullish, although slowing. A breakout above $1.15 could push the price toward $1.30, while a drop below $1.00 may signal a deeper correction. The $1 level will be critical for WIF. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1 by the end of 2025 and about $3 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

WLFI is the only DeFi project backed by the Trumps.” Don’t be fooled. There is no new Trump crypto project. WLFI is the only DeFi project backed by the Trumps.

Both the memecoins have tanked since then, with TRUMP and MELANIA trading at 12.77 and 0.374 at press time. The Official Trump token has shown strength with 17% surge over the past week, and 49.7% gains on the monthly chart, according to coinmarketcap data. However, the daily trading of TRUMP memecoin is down by nearly 10%, the data revealed. Upon launch of the token early this year, TRUMP surged to a staggering $80, before losing 85% of its value in March .

Now, a new contender has emerged—one that doesn’t just challenge Ethereum’s legacy but completely outpaces it with a futuristic protocol that’s built to withstand even quantum threats. Meet Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the project redefining transaction speed, mining access, and blockchain architecture for the next decade. Ethereum’s PoS is Solid, But No Longer Enough Ethereum’s move to Proof-of-Stake cut energy use and enabled scalability, but it still struggles with slow finality, high validator costs, and future quantum risks. Bitcoin Solaris addresses these issues with its Helios Consensus Protocol—a hybrid system that outperforms Ethereum and adds protection against next-gen computing threats. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris and Its Quantum-Resistant Core Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another fast chain—it’s a full ecosystem rooted in two layers of power: Proof-of-Work (PoW) for hardened security, just like Bitcoin. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for blistering speed and decentralized efficiency. This blend allows Bitcoin Solaris to achieve 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and an unmatched 2-second finality, over 500% faster than Ethereum. What’s more, Bitcoin Solaris is built with quantum resistance in mind. Its cryptographic design is engineered to withstand the risks posed by future quantum computers—a conversation Ethereum has yet to resolve. And yes, all smart contracts have been independently audited , ensuring trust at the foundation of every feature. Bitcoin Solaris: Simple Mining, Real Rewards. Mining That Anyone Can Do — From Their Phone Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t stop at speed. It’s democratizing mining entirely through its upcoming Solaris Nova App, which allows users to mine directly from their smartphones. No expensive rigs. No technical setups. Just: One-click mining from iOS, Android, or any device. Smart resource management for battery life and thermal efficiency. Built-in wallet and in-app guides to onboard beginners in minutes. Whether you’re a power user with a GPU farm or someone with just a phone, you can earn BTC-S with zero equipment costs. Staking Meets Flexibility To fuel liquidity and growth, Bitcoin Solaris introduces liquid staking through sBTC-S tokens. When you stake BTC-S: You receive 1:1 sBTC-S tokens in return. These can be used in DeFi apps, lending platforms, and yield strategies. You maintain full liquidity—no lockups, no downtime. This unique staking model makes BTC-S both a high-yield asset and a flexible financial tool. Helios: The DeFi Engine Behind the Ecosystem The Helios system powers the decentralized apps and infrastructure of Bitcoin Solaris: Lightning-fast DEXs with ultra-low slippage Cross-chain bridges with Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum Secure lending and yield farming protocols And as Crypto Legends recently explored in a dedicated review, Bitcoin Solaris is rapidly gaining momentum among developers, investors, and early adopters alike. Presale Opportunity: Time-Limited and High Potential The Bitcoin Solaris presale isn’t just live—it’s nearing its end. This is one of the shortest, most focused ICOs in the market. Current Phase: Phase 3 Price: $3 Next Phase: $4 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 13% With a total runtime of just 90 days and a scheduled launch on July 31, 2025, the window to get in early is rapidly closing. Investors are already eyeing the potential for 1,900% returns, with minimal capital and maximum upside. And with access to the private beta of the Solaris Nova App already rolling out, this isn’t just hype—it’s happening. Join the community now and mine your first BTC-S before the world catches up. Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris isn’t chasing Ethereum—it’s building what Ethereum should’ve been. With 500% faster finality, mobile-first mining, and the Helios consensus protocol, it’s faster, safer, and more inclusive for all. Backed by audited contracts, a live presale, and future-ready tech, Bitcoin Solaris turns users into investors and investors into wealth builders. It’s more than a coin—it’s a quantum-ready ecosystem built for everyone. Why Work for Money When BTC-S Can Work for You?

QCP: US-China Tariff Ceasefire Increases Risk Appetite, Ethereum Emerges as Strong Competitor According to QCP’s latest market analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have stabilized around $103,000 and $2,400, respectively, after experiencing brief pullbacks. Despite the decline, Ethereum has performed relatively strongly, thanks to the increasing demand for ETH options and optimism surrounding the Pectra update. Notably, Bitcoin’s dominance has fallen below 63%, a sign that capital could be shifting to altcoins, with Ethereum predicted to benefit the most in the short term. Volatility Decreasing, ETH Gaining Momentum QCP reported that market volatility has generally cooled, with Bitcoin’s short-term implicit volatility (IV) falling by more than 5 points. At the same time, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often seen as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” fell to 18, reflecting investors’ general confidence. “The relative strength of ETH, combined with increasing options demand and the successful Pectra upgrade, sets the stage for Ethereum to become a core allocation asset in the next phase of the market cycle,” QCP wrote. The firm emphasized that current macro conditions, including easing geopolitical tensions and improving global liquidity, have created a more favorable environment for risky assets, especially in the crypto sector. As Bitcoin consolidates and its dominance weakens, market participants are closely watching Ethereum and other high-potential altcoins for leadership in the next wave of upside. *This is not investment advice.

BTFD’s May 27 Launch is Loading—Top 5 Meme Coins to Buy and Hold With DOGE and PONKE You Can’t Ignore,https://timestabloid.com/800-gains-btfds-may-27-launch-is-loading-top-5-meme-coins/,"What’s scarier—missing the next moonshot or watching whales scoop up your bags while you wait on “the right time”? As meme coins flip from punchlines to profit machines, seasoned investors and new degens alike are loading up on high-utility tokens with serious upside. But timing? That’s everything. With whales flooding into meme coin presales and staking platforms pumping 90%+ APY, the meme market isn’t just heating up—it’s entering a full-blown gold rush. That brings us to BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a project with an addictive P2E game, 200% bonus codes flying off the shelves, and predictions of up to 8900% ROI. The coin’s in Stage 15 of its presale at just $0.0002, and by the time the final stage hits, the window will slam shut—May 26 at 23:59 UTC. This is the last dip before the bulls charge in on May 27. If you’ve been waiting for your golden shot, it might’ve just kicked the door wide open. Let’s dig into the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold right now. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Bulls Are Loading Up Before the May 26 Deadline Ever played a game that pays you in real crypto? That’s not just a dream—it’s BTFD’s P2E game, and it’s live, earning players real $BTFD rewards with every level smashed. This isn’t a gimmick. BTFD has turned gameplay into a money-making machine with on-chain rewards, wallet integration, and a community-centered Bulls Squad leading the charge. And with a 200% bonus still up for grabs using the code LAUNCH200, investors are seeing 3x tokens for every dollar they spend. Let’s break down the math: A $5000 investment at Stage 15 buys you 25 million BTFD coins at $0.0002. Apply the LAUNCH200 bonus? Boom—you now hold 75 million BTFD. When this launches at $0.0006, your stack’s worth $45,000—that’s a clean 800% ROI. But if BTFD hits its moonshot price of $0.006, as analysts whisper? You’re sitting on $450,000. Backed by Ethereum, powered by a live staking platform offering 90% APY, and juiced by a referral program handing out 10% extra tokens to top ambassadors, BTFD isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s surfing it like a pro. Over $6.8 million raised, 73 billion coins sold, and 12,100+ holders strong—the herd is stampeding in. Want to triple your haul and still get in before launch? Here’s how: Head to the BTFD site Connect your wallet. Enter LAUNCH200 in the bonus field and click Apply. Choose how much you want to buy. Confirm and lock in your presale tokens. Why’s BTFD in this list of the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold? Because it’s got whales circling, a game that prints tokens, and a final stage ticking down fast. 2. Brett (BRETT) – A Smug Bet With Growing Power Brett’s got that smug aura—and for good reason. Inspired by Matt Furie’s artwork (the genius behind Pepe), Brett took meme culture and made it smarter, sassier, and slicker. The community’s been rabid, and it’s climbing into every trending thread with cult-like commitment. What’s interesting? Brett’s not just a vibe anymore—it’s building partnerships and hinting at its own mini metaverse. Why is Brett here? Because it’s one of the few meme tokens turning legacy meme art into scalable crypto culture—and degens can’t resist it. 3. Ponke (PONKE) – The Degenerate’s Favorite Mascot If you know, you know. Ponke’s rise wasn’t fueled by hype—it was pure personality. With community updates delivered in broken memes and Twitter posts that feel like inside jokes, Ponke created a tribe that’s as loyal as it is unhinged. Recently, its devs teased integrations with Solana dApps and announced long-term staking plans. Why’s Ponke listed among the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold? Because it mastered the meme-metaverse bridge—and its crew doesn’t sell, they just wait and party. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Forever King With Fresh Momentum It would be criminal not to include DOGE, the godfather of meme coins. What started as a joke now sits on the front pages of global finance every time Elon Musk breathes on X (formerly Twitter). The latest buzz? DOGE developers are working on a cross-chain payment plug-in. Combine that with recurring Tesla rumors and long-term adoption potential, and DOGE continues to prove it’s more than nostalgia. Why does DOGE make the cut? Because it’s still the most recognized meme coin on the planet—and whales love a familiar playground. 5. Sudeng (HIPPO) – A New Beast Awakens HIPPO is the silent chaos agent in this list. While other meme coins scream for attention, Sudeng’s strategy has been slow, calculated, and extremely memeable. With a growing Asian fanbase and constant hints about AI integrations, HIPPO isn’t sleeping—it’s hibernating. And that’s what makes it dangerous. Why’d HIPPO sneak into the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold? Because sometimes the quietest memes are the ones building the biggest bags behind the scenes. Final Thought: What If You Missed the Last 8900% Gainer? Think about this: if you’d grabbed Shiba Inu early with a modest $500, you’d be sipping cocktails in Bali right now. But here’s the kicker—those kinds of gains don’t show up every day. BTFD Coin is sitting in Stage 15, the price is $0.0002, and if projections hold steady, you’re looking at $0.006 post-launch. That’s a jaw-dropping 8900% ROI —and you’re still early. You’ve got until May 26 at 23:59 UTC to make a move before Stage 16 kicks in and the price locks in. Don’t forget—you can triple your token count with the LAUNCH200 bonus code right now. Plus, if you’ve got friends, influencers, or a Telegram group, the referral program can turn your hustle into extra BTFD. Earn 10% of every purchase made using your code (if you make the top 20 leaderboard by month’s end). Crypto’s moving fast. Meme coins are no longer the clowns of crypto—they’re sitting on thrones made of community, utility, and raw hype. And right now, the top 5 meme coins to buy and hold have one thing in common: momentum. So ask yourself—will you wait for charts to pump or buy the dip before it launches? Claim your 3x tokens before May 26. Don’t sit this out again.

BTFD Coin is widely considered the hottest meme coin presale currently live, with a 200% bonus and Stage 15 nearing its end before a major launch on May 27.

In a statement on May 12, the company said the deal would lead to increased adoption of stablecoins by institutions. According to the announcement , Anchorage has signed a definitive agreement with Mountain Protocol and now awaits regulatory approval and customary closing conditions to finalize the deal. It said: “We are excited to announce that Anchorage Digital has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Mountain Protocol, the Bermuda Monetary Authority regulated company behind the USDM stablecoin.” With the deal, Anchorage Digital will integrate Mountain Protocol technology, the team, and its licensing framework to expand its stablecoin capacities. The company noted that the stablecoin sector is seeing massive growth and wants to position itself to allow institutions to participate. Anchorage already offers a stablecoin reward program for institutions holding the PayPal PYUSD stablecoin and is one of the partners in the Global Dollar Program. Thus, it sees the acquisition as another step in its long-term stablecoin strategy. The company CEO, Nathan McCauley, also echoed this. McCauley said: “By acquiring Mountain Protocol, we are taking a significant step forward in supporting institutional stablecoin adoption and advancing a new era of safety, security, and regulatory compliance in the global digital asset ecosystem.” Meanwhile, Moutain Protocol CEO Martin Carrica added that the deal represents a landmark achievement in the crypto industry. He noted that the company’s stablecoin expertise, plus Anchorage Digital infrastructure and regulatory backing as the only crypto bank in the US combined, will make for a formidable team to meet growing stablecoin demand. The announcement did not disclose any financial details about the deal, even though it noted that Mountain Protocol recently completed an $8 million series A funding with Multicoin Capital as the lead investor. Mountain Protocol to sunset USDM With the acquisition, Mountain Protocol has now disclosed plans to wind down its USDM stablecoin. The stablecoin issuer stated that the process will be smooth and transparent, starting with the end of the new USDMtoken minting on May 12. However, all other features are expected to remain for a while. The USDM rewards will be available for 30 days, after which it drops to 0%, and users can start redeeming their USDM already. USDM market cap (Source: Defillama) According to the firm, primary customers can redeem their stablecoins through the Mountain Protocol Platform, while others simply swap USDM for other tokens through exchanges. The stablecoin only has a market cap of $35 million, according to Defillama, a significant decline from its peak of around $150 million. Stablecoin sector continues to attract interest and investments Meanwhile, the deal highlights the growing interest in stablecoins among investors globally, leading to acquisitions such as this in the space. With stablecoins offering a faster and more cost-effective way to transact, experts believe the industry has massive potential. According to Citi , the stablecoin sector, which is worth over $240 billion presently and dominated by Tether USDT and Circle USDC, could be worth $3.7 trillion by 2030. The report added that stablecoin issuers could become the biggest holders of US Treasuries. Given the potential, many firms ranging from crypto-native and fintech firms to traditional financial institutions are considering venturing into the space. A recent report from the Financial Times claims that asset manager Fidelity wants to launch its own stablecoin, which is already in the advanced testing stages. The sector has also seen multiple deals recently, with Stripe acquiring stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for $1.1 billion at the start of the year and Circle recently buying tokenization startup Hashnote. Hashnote is the issuer of the $1.3 billion yield-bearing USDY token. While deals continue to be made, the future of US stablecoin legislation is currently hazy, with the Stablecoin Bill in the Senate failing a procedural vote a few days ago.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin and Pepe are surging with massive trading volume, but it’s Remittix’s real-world utility and red-hot presale that may steal the spotlight next. Table of Contents Dogecoin volume surges as bulls take control Pepe shows strength with growing community support Remittix presale gains momentum with real-world utility Conclusion Dogecoin and Pepe are on fire right now, with their volume skyrocketing and driving big gains in the market. Investors are hyping up the huge momentum behind these memecoins and it’s clear that they’re leading the way in market action. But it’s not just them, Remittix, a new presale token, is also on the run here. As investors flock to these hot assets, Remittix is perhaps the best option. Why? The presale is heating up fast, already raising $14.9m and attracting increasing numbers of users. Let’s see how each of these three coins is standing today. Dogecoin volume surges as bulls take control Dogecoin ( DOGE ) just blew past the $0.20 resistance and things are heating up fast. According to analysts, the breakout above $0.19 came with some serious volume and bullish momentum. The RSI is overbought and the MACD is still pushing upward, both pointing to more gains ahead. Source: Coinmarketcap Right now, DOGE is holding strong at $0.22 support and the breakout from a falling wedge that’s been forming since February is a big deal. Add to that the data from CoinGlass: open interest up 18%, now at $2.17 billion, and $11 million in shorts just got wiped out. That short squeeze gave DOGE an extra boost. Trading volume is through the roof, up 74%, sitting at $4.5 billion. It’s clear the bulls are back. Pepe shows strength with growing community support PEPE is on a serious run right now, up 104% in the last 30 days. That’s a massive spike and it looks like this frog is hopping back into the spotlight. While big names like DOGE and SHIB still dominate the memecoin scene, PEPE’s predictions are now starting to outpace both, even though it has a much smaller market cap. Source: Coinmarketcap Right now, PEPE sits at a $5.5 billion market cap, which is actually a big part of the appeal. Traders love the fact that it’s still got room to grow, unlike some of the more saturated memecoins. That lower cap gives it a better shot at pulling off major gains. Technicals are also on PEPE’s side. Analysts are watching a bullish breakout pattern that’s been forming for a while and if momentum holds, PEPE could be heading toward a $10 billion market cap soon.

It’s a PayFi project that lets people send fiat money across borders straight from their crypto wallets. Basically, it works like MoneyGram or Western Union, but cheaper, faster and way more efficient. That real-world utility is what’s got everyone talking. Instead of just being another crypto with hype, Remittix solves an actual problem, making cross-border payments easy for both users and businesses. And as more people continue to catch on, the demand for RTX is expected to go crazy. So far, over 30,000 investors have already jumped in, with $14.9 million raised and over 534 million RTX sold. The presale price is currently $0.0757, up 400% since launch. Some are calling $1 a realistic target and if that happens, early buyers could be looking at 10x gains. Conclusion Dogecoin and PEPE are pumping hard, showing major strength, but Remittix is the one that could explode next.

Even the world of outdoor exploration is getting a significant AI upgrade. AllTrails, a widely popular outdoor navigation app, is introducing a new top-tier membership called “Peak,” packed with advanced features, most notably innovative AI Smart Routes . This move highlights how AI Technology Adoption is reshaping user experiences in unexpected places. Exploring AllTrails’ New AI Smart Routes The centerpiece of the new Peak membership is its powerful AI-driven routing capability. Forget static maps; this feature allows users to create their ideal trail from scratch or dynamically modify existing ones. Using AI, the app can intelligently adjust routes based on user preferences. Want a shorter hike? Less steep? Or perhaps a path optimized for scenic views? The AI Smart Routes feature can analyze data and generate tailored paths to meet these specific needs, offering a truly personalized outdoor experience. Beyond Navigation: What Other AI Powered Features Are Included? The AI integration in AllTrails Peak extends beyond just route planning. The membership includes several other AI Powered Features designed to enhance safety and enjoyment on the trail. Real-time trail condition forecasts: Get updates on temperature, precipitation, and snow depth, essentially bringing detailed weather analysis directly into the app. Future updates will even include ground conditions like mud or gravel. Alerts: Stay informed about factors like air quality and mosquito activity. Trail traffic heatmaps: See which trails are crowded and when, helping users choose quieter paths or find routes with more people for safety. This feature leverages data from millions of users, similar to how other popular mapping services predict business levels. Outdoor Lens: A fascinating AI tool that lets users identify trees, plants, and flowers simply by pointing their phone’s camera at them. This adds an educational and interactive layer to exploration. The Value of a Premium App Membership: Is AllTrails Peak Worth It? Priced at $80 per year, the Peak membership sits above AllTrails’ existing free (Base) and Plus tiers. While Base offers fundamental maps and community reviews, and Plus adds offline access, wrong-turn alerts, and 3D previews, Peak targets the most dedicated outdoor enthusiasts. This Premium App Membership provides exclusive access to the cutting-edge AI features mentioned above, along with other benefits like enhanced offline map downloads (Offline Area) and the new Points of Interest feature (also coming to Plus/Base). It represents a significant investment for users but promises a substantially richer and more informed hiking or biking experience powered by advanced technology. Why AI Technology Adoption Matters in Consumer Apps The integration of AI into an Outdoor Navigation App like AllTrails is a clear indicator of a broader trend. AI Technology Adoption is rapidly accelerating across various consumer applications, moving from niche tools to enhancing everyday experiences. This isn’t just about convenience; AI can provide deeper insights, personalize services, and automate complex tasks, whether it’s suggesting optimal routes based on conditions, identifying flora, or predicting traffic. Understanding this trend is crucial as AI continues to permeate different digital landscapes, potentially influencing everything from how we manage our finances to how we interact with decentralized applications in the future. AllTrails has been a dominant player, even earning iPhone App of the Year in 2023. However, major tech players like Apple have increasingly added robust outdoor features to their native mapping services, creating significant competition. AllTrails’ launch of the Peak membership and its focus on sophisticated AI Powered Features can be seen as a strategic response. By offering truly unique and advanced capabilities powered by AI, AllTrails aims to provide compelling value that differentiates it from built-in mapping solutions and retains its core base of active users. The rollout begins with select members in the coming weeks, with global availability expected by June. The debut of AllTrails’ Peak membership, featuring revolutionary AI Smart Routes and a suite of other AI Powered Features , marks a significant evolution for the popular Outdoor Navigation App . It showcases the growing importance of AI Technology Adoption in enhancing user experiences across various domains. While an $80 annual fee positions it as a Premium App Membership for serious enthusiasts, the innovative use of AI to personalize routes, provide real-time data, and even identify nature elements demonstrates the exciting potential of artificial intelligence in making our interactions with both technology and the natural world more intelligent and engaging.

Well, that’s certainly true for Pi Network’s native token, which crashed hard in the past several hours. Nevertheless, some analysts remain optimistic, indicating that this is just the necessary correction before another massive leg up that can take it above $2. The cryptocurrency market rarely remains boring for long, as there’s always some altcoin that waits to produce massive price volatility. In the past week, that honor belongs to Pi Network’s cryptocurrency. PI stood within a consolidation range at around $0.6 up until the end of the previous business week, when the team behind the project hinted about a major development coming on May 14. Whether it was the hype around that or the overall market resurgence, it doesn’t really matter, but the reality is that PI’s price skyrocketed by almost 200% to yesterday’s peak at around $1.7. This became its highest price tag in well over a month. But nothing really goes in a straight line all the time. PI proved that to be correct today as its price slumped hard by over 35% at one point and even dipped below $1 briefly. Although it has recovered to $1.12 as of now, it’s still more than 25% down on the day. This massive decline comes amid a relatively negligent token unlock of fewer than 8 million PI. For comparison, the number is set to shoot up to over $13 million on several occasions in the next month. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko Despite this correction, analysts remain optimistic about PI’s future price performance , as technical observers somewhat anticipated this price drop to $1 support . Moon Jeff continues to back the asset and noted that today’s crash means that tomorrow’s announcement could have already been priced in. Nevertheless, the popular X commentator believes if the news is “great,” it could pump the price higher to above $2. $PI is already priced in for the news. Now waiting for the news. If the news will be great we will pump up higher.

It’s a big deal for crypto. Now, the focus is on what Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said next. After celebrating, Armstrong used the spotlight to drop a set of bold predictions about the future of crypto and they’re too big to ignore. From 401(k) plans to a new kind of index that could rival the S&P 500 itself, Armstrong’s vision has everyone wondering: is this where crypto’s truly headed? Let’s break it down. Armstrong’s Big Crypto Forecasts (and Why They Matter) Armstrong made two major predictions that grabbed headlines: One , he believes crypto will be “part of 401(k)s and retirement plans.” Right now, most retirement portfolios barely touch crypto – if at all. But Armstrong sees a future where digital assets sit right alongside stocks and bonds in long-term savings plans. Two , he says the Coinbase COIN50 Index could be “as important as the S&P 500 in 5-10 years.” The COIN50 tracks 50 top-performing, highly liquid crypto assets. If Armstrong’s right, being part of that index might one day be the crypto version of entering the S&P. And that’s a major badge to show that you’ve “made it”. Why the Market Is Ready to Listen Just today, Coinbase replaced Discover Financial in the S&P 500. It’s a huge moment, not just for the company, but for crypto’s credibility in traditional markets. COIN shares jumped more than 7% in OTC trading following the news and index funds tracking the S&P are now expected to scoop up Coinbase stock. So, Armstrong is making these predictions from a position of real momentum. Looking Ahead: Armstrong’s 10-Year Crypto Vision Zooming out, these bold predictions fit neatly into a bigger roadmap. Armstrong’s vision is to turn Coinbase into the “app store for crypto” – a one-stop shop where users can interact with everything from tokenized money markets to on-chain real estate and securities. “In five- to 10 years, our goal is to be the number one financial services app in the world across those customer segments because we believe that crypto is eating financial services, and we are the number one crypto company,” Armstrong stated. He made it clear there’s no intention of going backward into traditional finance. “We want to look forwards and skate to where this opportunity is going,” Armstrong added – which is a nod to the rapid tokenization of asset classes like real estate, money market funds, and debt instruments. And with stablecoins playing a key role in that future, Armstrong has even bigger plans for USDC – calling it a “stretch goal” to make it the top stablecoin in the world. If his track record holds, these might just be early signs of where finance is headed.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 09:53:33

Historically, companies added to the index have seen a sharp rise in demand, driven by ETF inflows and broader investor attention. With the crypto sector growing rapidly, this move could signal the beginning of more digital asset firms entering mainstream markets. The listing comes at a time of rising momentum in crypto, sparking speculation that more institutional bridges are forming. What Coinbase’s Inclusion Means for the Market Coinbase will replace Discover Financial Services on the S&P 500 following Discover's acquisition by Capital One. The decision places one of the most recognized cryptocurrency companies inside an index dominated by the largest U.S. firms, including tech and financial powerhouses. As the saying goes…“First they ignore you.Then they laugh at you.Then they fight you.Then they add you to the S&P 500.”…or something like that. — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) May 12, 2025 The announcement came after market close on Monday. COIN shares jumped around 10 percent in after-hours trading, following a 4 percent rise earlier in the day. Sentiment was already improving as trade war fears eased, and the index news added more fuel to the rally. While Coinbase stock is still down about 27 percent over the last six months, it has recovered over 17 percent in the past month, not counting the post-announcement surge. S&P 500 inclusion brings immediate benefits. Index-tracking funds must now allocate capital toward COIN, increasing volume and visibility. Institutional investors who only buy S&P-listed stocks may also turn their attention to the exchange. Coinbase’s weight in the index may be small, but the symbolic value is substantial. It reinforces the notion that crypto is becoming a structural part of global finance. The move is a strong signal that more crypto-linked companies could follow, opening doors to higher legitimacy, stronger capital flows, and long-term demand for the broader digital asset space. Best Crypto to Buy Now with Crypto Adoption Going Mainstream Solaxy Solaxy is a Layer 2 protocol that connects Ethereum and Solana, built to simplify how users move assets between the two networks. It focuses on speed, lower fees, and practical staking rewards. Instead of asking users to navigate complicated bridges or use multiple wallets, Solaxy enables direct cross-chain interaction with minimal friction. Transactions are processed using its native token, SOLX, which also serves as the access point for staking pools offering consistent returns. The utility of SOLX is rooted in how it drives both participation and movement across networks. With Solana gaining attention for its transaction speed and Ethereum still holding dominance in DeFi, a project that builds a technical bridge between them holds immediate relevance. As digital asset adoption gains ground through events like Coinbase entering the S&P 500, protocols like Solaxy could become vital infrastructure for users who operate across multiple chains. Brace for interstellar travel! 🛸34 Million Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/bW1wHrZtZY — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 9, 2025 It has already raised upwards of $34 million, a feat that is impressive in this market space where meme-based utility tokens rarely get this level of traction. Its staking pools have attracted steady demand, and the team has prioritized functionality over branding. The project remains active in expanding support to wallets and DeFi apps that require smooth multi-network integration. If user flows continue to increase between major blockchains, Solaxy stands to benefit as a system that removes excess steps and rewards users for participating in the process. BTC Bull BTC Bull is tied to one idea. It tracks Bitcoin's upward milestones and rewards holders based on predefined price levels. This structure creates a clear reason to hold the token. When Bitcoin reaches a new target, BTC Bull reduces its supply and distributes airdrops. That reward system is aligned with real market events rather than speculation. It gives the project a built-in sequence of outcomes, each one tied to Bitcoin's actual movement. This is not a Bitcoin derivative. BTC Bull exists independently but is structured to move with Bitcoin’s success. The token is currently available through presale and has passed its audit. Each supply burn and airdrop is fully transparent and publicly verifiable. No complex staking. No vague timelines. Just clear triggers based on price history. The timing of this token’s structure is significant. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 has added weight to Bitcoin’s place in global finance. Projects like BTC Bull that use this momentum to build direct incentives for long-term holders may gain from the renewed interest in Bitcoin's path to new highs. Investors who want a simple yet event-driven model without relying on hype cycles are already watching BTC Bull for its clarity and pacing. SUBBD SUBBD creates a token-based system for creators to control access and engagement around their content. Using the $SUBBD token, creators can gate content, build member layers, and reward their audiences without relying on third-party platforms. Unlike advertising models or passive tipping, SUBBD lets fans participate directly through on-chain interactions tied to actual access and utility. Tools on the platform include private publishing modules, content scheduling, audience segmentation, and token rewards. These systems are active, with new features in rollout that allow for smarter audience targeting. Holding $SUBBD is not just a show of support. It provides access to exclusive posts, events, and creator perks. The structure encourages community development while avoiding dependency on platform algorithms. SUBBD’s endorsements have also come from top creators like 99Bitcoins , who mentioned it to be a top project worth considering in one of their dedicated videos. The crypto market’s credibility received a boost with Coinbase entering the S&P 500, reinforcing the trend of decentralized models going mainstream. SUBBD fits into this shift by offering a practical way for creators to leave behind restrictive monetization rules and build directly through tokenized engagement. It does not rely on aesthetics or empty branding. It is built for a specific use case that already exists, but without the friction or profit-sharing that limits creators on traditional platforms. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token supports a crypto application designed for full control and multichain access. It works as part of a self-custody wallet that allows users to store, send, swap, and stake assets across more than sixty networks. The wallet includes built-in tools for tracking presales, using a native decentralized exchange, managing portfolio allocations, and reviewing market trends in real time. The token, BEST, acts as a key to unlock premium features. It allows early access to high-demand presales, higher staking yields, and token-gated insights. It also supports user participation in certain iGaming benefits and community rewards. All actions within the app that involve advanced access or curated data require BEST to be held or used, which adds value to the token beyond passive holding. Recent developments like Coinbase entering the S&P 500 have made institutional investors look again at infrastructure-based projects that serve actual utility. Best Wallet fits into that category, offering tools that reduce the number of apps needed to trade, research, and store crypto assets. The fact that it is mobile-first, with advanced encryption and direct chain support, gives it a practical use case in a space that often focuses on abstract concepts. The token is not just a branding tool. It supports a product people can use daily. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe is structured around a functioning AI agent with a public digital presence. It operates independently by analyzing trends, reacting to market activity, and offering real-time responses across social platforms. The project is not positioned as a tool for entertainment. It is a system for sentiment monitoring and engagement, with token-gated access to deeper analytics. The token, MIND, grants holders permission to use advanced features. These include early detection of market mood shifts, visibility into trending memecoins, and predictive models based on online behavior. Users are not just given raw data. They receive responses generated by the AI itself, filtered through preset logic that mimics investor instincts and social timing. The relevance of such a project has grown as digital assets move into more traditional spaces. Coinbase being accepted into the S&P 500 is part of a larger shift where data, attention, and behavioral signals become tradeable assets. MIND of Pepe captures that direction by building a digital profile that evolves with its environment. Its purpose is to give traders a tool that tracks the invisible layer of the market—the one shaped by emotion, volume surges, and sudden waves of interest. The more people engage with crypto socially, the more useful this system becomes. Conclusion Coinbase joining the S&P 500 has triggered renewed interest in crypto from both institutional and retail investors. Trading volumes are rising, demand for functional tokens is increasing, and several assets have already seen price movement in response to broader market developments. With crypto steadily entering mainstream channels, tokens offering practical use and early access features are gaining traction. Based on current conditions and investor interest all around, the projects listed above could be some of the most well-placed for consideration right now, especially for investors looking for presale projects with high potential in the mid-term.

Recently, XRP enthusiasts have been buzzing about a potential breakout , fueled by key signals from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI). According to a recent post by JD , a popular crypto analyst on X, the last time these two indicators flashed simultaneously, XRP experienced a remarkable fivefold increase within two months. This assertion has sparked widespread excitement within the XRP community, with traders and investors keenly monitoring market conditions to see if history might repeat itself. #XRP (UPDATE!) – Last time XRP 5x w/in 2-months when: 1. MACD changed to Green 2. SRSI cross above 80 (green line). *GASP*! We just crossed! ""IF"" SRSI stays above 80 next few closes, I expect BREAKOUT to ALL TIME HIGH! (Patreon/Discord updated weekly!) RT for updates!… pic.twitter.com/Cfi0M7gbur — JD (@jaydee_757) May 13, 2025 Understanding the Indicators: MACD and SRSI To fully appreciate JD’s analysis, it’s essential to understand the significance of the two technical indicators involved. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset’s price. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it’s a bullish sign. In JD’s recent post, he pointed out that XRP’s MACD has changed to green, indicating that buying momentum is currently outpacing selling pressure. This change is often interpreted as a potential signal for upward price movement. Equally important is the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI), which combines the concepts of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator. The SRSI is particularly useful for identifying overbought and oversold conditions. When the SRSI (likely referring to RSI) crosses above 80, it may signal overbought conditions, yet also indicates strong upward momentum. JD’s excitement stems from the fact that XRP recently crossed this critical threshold, and if the SRSI remains above 80 over the next few closes, he anticipates a potential breakout toward an all-time high. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Context: Lessons from the Past JD’s cited historical precedent lends credibility to his optimism. When these dual signals last appeared, XRP surged 5x in two months, driven by positive sentiment and technical confirmation. While past performance isn’t a guarantee, the current alignment of indicators has traders speculating about another potential rally. Market Sentiment and Broader Context While technical signals are undeniably influential, it’s important to consider the broader market context.XRP’s price is influenced by technical patterns and news about Ripple’s ongoing legal battles with the SEC. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as inflation data, interest rate decisions, and overall sentiment in the crypto market play critical roles. XRP is currently riding a wave of optimism , fueled by hopes of Ripple’s potential regulatory progress. Risk Factors and Strategic Considerations Although the technical setup is undeniably intriguing, traders should be cautious. Relying solely on technical indicators without considering fundamental analysis can be risky. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, which can lead to sudden and unpredictable market shifts. JD has cautioned that the SRSI needs to stay above 80 in the next few trading sessions for a breakout to be confirmed. Therefore, while optimism is warranted, it should be tempered with prudence and risk management. JD’s recent analysis has reignited hope among XRP investors, drawing attention to the historically significant signals of MACD turning green and SRSI crossing above 80. If these indicators maintain their current stance, XRP could be on the cusp of a major breakout. However, given the crypto market’s unpredictable nature, traders must remain vigilant, continuously assess market conditions, and employ sound risk management strategies. The coming weeks will undoubtedly be critical in determining whether XRP can replicate its previous fivefold surge.

According to Bloomberg consensus, the forecasts stand at 2.4% YoY for headline CPI and 2.8% for core , with monthly inflation (April) estimated at 0.3% for both. While pinpointing the true inflation drivers remains challenging, any significant deviation from expectations—either higher or lower—could meaningfully impact yields and market sentiment , especially considering current technical conditions in the bond market. May 13, 2025 10:11:29 UTC Will US CPI Report Today Trigger Market Rally? The U.S. CPI data is set to be released today at 8:30 AM ET , and markets are on edge. The year-over-year inflation rate is expected to come in at 2.4% , matching last month’s figure. However, this CPI print could be a turning point. The U.S. economy is already showing signs of weakness, with Q1 GDP in the negative and growth slowing. If inflation comes in higher than expected, it could confirm stagflation —a scenario where inflation rises while economic growth declines—considered one of the worst outcomes for markets. This would likely delay rate cut hopes and trigger a pullback in stocks and crypto . On the flip side, if CPI is cooler than expected, it would signal easing inflation pressures and potentially fuel a strong rally in risk assets. While Polymarket traders expect CPI at 2.4%, real-time inflation data from Truflation sits at 1.68% , suggesting the possibility of an undershoot. One surprise in today’s CPI can move everything—from stocks to crypto to bonds . May 13, 2025 10:08:06 UTC CPI Index US : Stagflation Fears Loom as Crucial US CPI Data Set to Drop Today Today’s CPI data release at 8:30 AM ET is one of the most crucial events for the market this week. The expected YoY CPI is 2.4% , the same as last month. While the recent US-China trade deal has cleared much of the market uncertainty, one major concern still looms— stagflation , a scenario where inflation rises while economic growth weakens. With Q1 GDP already negative , a higher-than-expected CPI could confirm these stagflation fears. On the other hand, a lower-than-expected CPI would ease those concerns and could trigger a strong market rally . May 13, 2025 10:05:37 UTC CPI Data Expectations Today The biggest event of the week is here— the US CPI data is set to release today at 8:30 AM ET , with market expectations holding at 2.4% , the same as last month. If the CPI comes in higher than expected, it could trigger a short-term bearish reaction as it may delay interest rate cuts, which is negative for risk-on assets like crypto. If the data matches expectations, markets may still rally due to existing bullish momentum. However, a CPI below 2.4% would be the most bullish outcome, likely fueling a strong pump in Bitcoin and altcoins as it increases the chances of rate cuts this year. May 13, 2025 09:50:33 UTC What Time is CPI Released? The April US CPI data will be released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on May 13, 2025, at 8:30 A.M.

In the US, Coinbase is set to join the S&P 500, thanks to growing mainstream acceptance of crypto. Despite considering a Bitcoin-heavy treasury strategy like Michael Saylor’s, Coinbase opted for a more risk-conscious approach. It still holds nearly 9,500 BTC and is expanding through a $2.9 billion acquisition of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit. Dubai Moves Closer to Cashless Future with Crypto.com Dubai recently took a major step toward becoming a fully digital economy by partnering with crypto exchange Crypto.com to use cryptocurrency payments for government services. The agreement was signed during the Dubai Fintech Summit on May 12 and is a key part of the city’s “cashless strategy,” which aims to transition Dubai into a completely digital and cashless society. (Source: Government of Dubai ) According to the Dubai Department of Finance (DOF), the initiative will introduce a new digital payment channel across all official government platforms. Once operational, residents and businesses will be able to pay for government services using cryptocurrencies through Crypto.com’s digital wallet infrastructure. These crypto payments will be converted into UAE dirhams before being deposited into DOF accounts. While the specific cryptocurrencies accepted have not been named, the DOF explained that the system will support “stable cryptocurrencies,” which indicates that stablecoins like USDT or USDC may be among the accepted options. This comes at a time when Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund and other local institutions announced the upcoming launch of a dirham-pegged stablecoin. Dubai’s cashless strategy was first introduced in October of 2024, and by that time, 97% of government-related payments were already digital. The goal now is to have 90% of all financial transactions—across both the public and private sectors—occur through cashless methods by 2026. This digital push is expected to add at least 8 billion dirhams ,or approximately $2.1 billion, to Dubai’s economy, driven by fintech development and expanding digital service offerings. The government is also in the process of developing a regulatory framework that is designed to support financial innovation while maintaining robust security and efficiency standards. As part of its broader digital ambitions, Dubai also piloted a project to tokenize real estate on the blockchain to help cement its status as a crypto-friendly city. Some other jurisdictions, including New York State, are also exploring the use of cryptocurrency for public payments. Coinbase to Make S&P 500 Debut Other crypto exchanges are also making big moves. In fact, Coinbase is set to make history as the first cryptocurrency company to be included in the Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) index. The announcement was made on May 12 by S&P Global, which confirmed that Coinbase will officially join the index on May 19, replacing Discover Financial Services. Discover was recently acquired by Capital One Financial Corp, opening the door for the crypto exchange to take its place in the prestigious index. The S&P 500 is one of the most widely tracked benchmarks in the financial world, and it represents 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. As a market-cap-weighted index, it gives greater influence to firms with larger valuations like Microsoft and Apple. While Coinbase will likely be among the bottom 400 companies in terms of weight, it will still benefit from automatic buying by index funds and exchange-traded funds that replicate the S&P 500. This mechanical demand already started to impact Coinbase’s stock price, which jumped 10.94% in after-hours trading to $229.9, according to Google Finance . The firm’s market cap also rose to $52.8 billion, capping off a 4% gain earlier in the day. Coinbase stock price (Source: Google Finance ) Coinbase chief financial officer Alesia Haas called the inclusion a major milestone, not only for the company but for the broader cryptocurrency industry, because iit signals growing mainstream acceptance. The crypto exchange now joins other Bitcoin-exposed companies in the index, like Tesla and Block Inc., both of which have made large investments in digital assets. While Coinbase now meets the requirements for inclusion, other crypto-focused firms are still on the sidelines. Strategy, which is very well known for aggressively acquiring Bitcoin, was considered a potential S&P 500 candidate but reported a $4.2 billion net loss in Q1 2025 . This disqualified it under the index’s profitability requirement. Despite this, Strategy does meet other criteria like being listed on a major US exchange, generating a majority of its revenue domestically, and having a market cap above $18 billion. Overall, Coinbase’s successful entry is a huge moment for crypto in traditional finance. Coinbase Passes on All In Bitcoin Bet Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that the company actually considered adopting a Bitcoin-heavy investment strategy similar to that of Michael Saylor’s Strategy on multiple occasions over the past 12 years but ultimately decided against it. In a May 9 video call with Bloomberg, Armstrong said that the idea of allocating a large portion of Coinbase’s balance sheet into Bitcoin was discussed internally. However, the company opted for a more cautious path, due to concerns that such a move could compromise its cash position and jeopardize the exchange’s core business. Armstrong explained that the decision was based on a conscious assessment of risk. Alesia Haas added that the firm also wanted to avoid appearing as if it were in direct competition with its own customers by placing heavy bets on specific cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, Coinbase still has several crypto positions, and recently acquired an additional $153 million worth of digital assets, primarily Bitcoin, according to its first-quarter earnings report. Currently, the firm holds 9,480 BTC, which is valued at approximately $988 million, making it the ninth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) While Coinbase took a conservative approach compared to firms like Strategy, the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption continues. Over 100 public companies, 40 ETF issuers, 26 private firms, and 12 governments worldwide have reported holding Bitcoin . In addition to its investment strategy, Coinbase is expanding its presence in the crypto derivatives market through a landmark acquisition. On May 8, the company announced a $2.9 billion agreement to acquire Deribit, one of the largest crypto derivatives platforms globally. The acquisition is the biggest corporate deal in the crypto sector to date and is expected to greatly enhance Coinbase’s reach in the derivatives market, where it previously operated mainly through its Bermuda-based platform. Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024 and currently has around $30 billion in open interest.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-13 10:00:00

Michael Saylor’s Strategy announced the purchase of an additional $1.34 billion in Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to 568,840 BTC. At the same time, healthcare company KindlyMD completed a merger with newly formed Nakamoto Holdings — led by Trump crypto adviser David Bailey — to create a Bitcoin-native treasury firm supported by $710 million in financing. Michael Saylor’s Strategy Buys $1.34B in Bitcoin as BTC Surges Past $100K, Hitting 568,840 BTC in Holdings Bitcoin advocate and Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has doubled down on his Bitcoin conviction yet again. Between May 5 and May 11, Saylor’s firm, Strategy, purchased an additional 13,390 BTC for approximately $1.34 billion as Bitcoin’s price broke above the $100,000 threshold for the first time in history. The details of the acquisition were revealed in a Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 12. The average purchase price for the latest Bitcoin haul stood at $99,856 per coin, just under the newly reclaimed psychological mark of $100,000, which BTC surpassed on May 8. Following the latest purchase, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings now amount to 568,840 BTC, acquired at a total cost of approximately $39.4 billion. The firm’s average acquisition price sits at $69,287 per coin. Strategy's holdings are now valued at more than $58.29 billion — representing a gain of over $18.8 billion on paper. Strategy Bitcoin buyers over time (Source: SaylorTracker ) This 2.4% increase in Strategy's Bitcoin holdings further cements its position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, far ahead of public and private companies alike. Strategy Hits 2025 Bitcoin Yield Target Ahead of Schedule Michael Saylor took to X on May 12 to announce that the company had successfully reached its previously stated Bitcoin yield target for 2025. The Bitcoin yield — a proprietary metric used by Strategy to reflect the performance of BTC holdings relative to the company’s diluted share count — climbed to 15.5% following the latest acquisition. The firm had set a 15% BTC yield target for 2025 after posting a staggering 74% yield in 2024. With that milestone now met in early May, Strategy has raised its full-year yield target to an ambitious 25%. Despite Strategy's bullish performance and confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, the move has drawn fresh criticism from long-time Bitcoin skeptic and gold advocate Peter Schiff. Responding to Saylor’s announcement on X, Schiff warned that the rising average purchase price could backfire if Bitcoin undergoes a sharp correction. “Your next buy will likely push your average cost above $70,000,” he wrote, adding that a drop in BTC’s market price could push it below Strategy’s breakeven level. “Not good considering how much you borrowed to buy the Bitcoin,” Schiff warned. “When you sell, small paper losses will become huge real losses.” His remarks refer to Strategy’s leveraged approach to accumulating Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the company disclosed plans to raise up to $42 billion in equity and an additional $42 billion in fixed-income offerings — essentially doubling its capital raise target from previous rounds — to continue funding Bitcoin purchases. Coinbase Steers Clear of Saylor’s Aggressive Model While Schiff’s critiques are often seen as alarmist within the crypto community, even some crypto-native firms appear to be exercising caution. A recent report by Bloomberg revealed that Coinbase, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has internally discussed adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy similar to Strategy’s — but opted against it multiple times. The reason? Risk concentration. As Coinbase executives reportedly concluded, overly aggressive Bitcoin buying introduces significant balance sheet exposure that could backfire in a bear market, especially when leverage is involved. Strategy’s latest purchase sheds light on a growing divide in how institutions view Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. For some, like Saylor, it is the ultimate store of value — a scarce, deflationary hedge against fiat currency devaluation. For others, it remains too volatile and speculative to serve as a reliable corporate asset. Nevertheless, the results so far have been difficult to ignore. With BTC above $100,000 and Strategy’s BTC holdings deeply in profit, the company’s bold strategy has, at least for now, validated its conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. KindlyMD Merges with Nakamoto Holdings to Create Bitcoin Treasury Powerhouse with $710M in Backing Meanwhile, in a landmark move that shows the growing convergence of healthcare and crypto finance, healthcare services provider KindlyMD has announced its merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin-native holding company spearheaded by David Bailey — a prominent crypto adviser to US President Donald Trump. The merger, revealed on May 12 , marks the birth of a new kind of company: a publicly listed Bitcoin treasury vehicle with ambitions to build a global ecosystem of BTC-native firms. The combined entity aims to become a leader in Bitcoin-centric capital markets, integrating BTC into a wide variety of financial instruments, including equity, debt, and preferred shares. The website of the new Nakamoto company (Source: Nakamoto ) A Bold Mission to Bitcoinize Global Balance Sheets According to Bailey, Nakamoto Holdings’ broader vision is to create a worldwide network of Bitcoin treasury companies that offer compliant, transparent market exposure to BTC. The firm seeks to replicate and build upon the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. Long-term, the firm aims to extend beyond Bitcoin accumulation and into media, advisory, and financial services to catalyze Bitcoin utility and mass adoption. The merger places Bitcoin at the heart of the company’s financial structure, with plans to grow BTC held per share — a metric closely monitored by Bitcoin-forward companies like Strategy. Shares of KindlyMD will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker “KDLY” until the deal is finalized. Following the completion of the merger, the newly combined company will be renamed and begin trading under a new ticker that reflects its Bitcoin -first identity. The boards of both Nakamoto Holdings and KindlyMD have unanimously approved the transaction. However, the deal still requires shareholder approval from KindlyMD to proceed. Upon closing, the new firm will inherit all prior business relationships and obligations of Nakamoto Holdings — including its marketing partnership with BTC Inc., the publisher of Bitcoin Magazine and organizer of the annual Bitcoin Conference. Massive $710M Financing Package to Accelerate BTC Strategy In a clear signal of institutional support, the deal includes $710 million in financing, divided into two main components: $510 million in gross proceeds from a private placement in public equity (PIPE), priced at $1.12 per share. The placement includes a mix of common stock and pre-funded warrants issued by KindlyMD. $200 million in gross proceeds from the sale of senior secured convertible notes, maturing in 2028. The capital raised will be used to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin and fund the development of new BTC-native financial instruments. The financing is expected to close in tandem with the merger itself. David Bailey has made no secret of his admiration for Michael Saylor’s approach to building a Bitcoin treasury. Like Saylor’s Strategy, the new company will use equity and debt offerings to finance Bitcoin purchases — but with a greater emphasis on integrating BTC into global capital markets through diverse, exchange-listed products. By merging the healthcare-focused infrastructure of KindlyMD with Nakamoto Holdings’ crypto-first strategy, the new entity represents a novel fusion of traditional industry and digital asset finance. Bitcoin’s Institutional March Continues This merger adds momentum to a broader institutional trend that has seen Bitcoin increasingly embraced as a core balance sheet asset. While MicroStrategy continues to set the benchmark with over 568,000 BTC in holdings, newcomers like Nakamoto Holdings are entering the market with ambitious capital-raising and acquisition plans. Bailey’s close ties to the Trump administration also raise the possibility that this merger could serve as a template for other publicly listed companies to pivot toward BTC-based treasury strategies — particularly if a second Trump term fosters more favorable crypto regulation. If shareholder approval is secured and the merger finalizes, the new company will become one of the few publicly listed firms with a Bitcoin-first mandate, supported by significant institutional capital and strategic relationships across the crypto industry. With $710 million ready to deploy, a growing Bitcoin price above $100,000, and political winds increasingly blowing in Bitcoin’s favor, KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings may be positioned to become a central player in Bitcoin’s institutional expansion.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-13 10:00:00

Well, it turns out that wasn’t the SEC speaking, at least not initially. It was a hack, and now the person responsible is facing serious consequences. U.S. prosecutors are pushing for a two-year prison sentence for the individual who pleaded guilty to the SEC hack that briefly rocked the market. The Anatomy of the SEC Hack and the Fake Bitcoin ETF News Let’s break down what happened. On January 9, 2024, the official X (formerly Twitter) account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posted a message that sent shockwaves through the financial world: it claimed the agency had approved several spot Bitcoin ETF applications. This was a monumental development that the crypto market had been anticipating for years. As you can imagine, the price of Bitcoin reacted instantly, jumping significantly on the news. However, the excitement was short-lived. Within minutes, it became clear something was wrong. SEC Chair Gary Gensler quickly tweeted from his personal account that the agency’s official account had been compromised and the post was false. The market, which had just soared, immediately corrected, demonstrating the significant impact of the fake news. This incident wasn’t just a simple unauthorized tweet; it was a deliberate act with clear intent to manipulate the market based on highly sensitive, market-moving information. The real approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs did come the very next day, making the timing of the hack particularly audacious and disruptive. Who Was Behind It? Introducing Eric Council Jr. Federal prosecutors have identified Eric Council Jr. as the individual responsible for this digital intrusion and the subsequent fake announcement. Council Jr. has since pleaded guilty to charges related to the hack. This plea is a significant step in the legal process, acknowledging his involvement in the scheme. According to reports, Council Jr.’s actions were part of a larger criminal enterprise. The SEC hack wasn’t an isolated incident but rather connected to a broader pattern of fraudulent activity. This context is crucial because it suggests a level of sophistication and planning beyond a simple prank or isolated act of vandalism. How Was the SEC Account Compromised? Understanding the SIM Swap One of the key technical details revealed about the SEC hack is that it involved a SIM swap attack. So, what exactly is a SIM swap? What it is: A SIM swap, or SIM hijacking, is a type of account takeover fraud. How it works: Criminals trick a mobile carrier into transferring a victim’s phone number to a SIM card controlled by the attacker. The goal: Once the attacker controls the phone number, they can intercept calls and, crucially, text messages, including two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The connection to the hack: Many online services, including social media platforms like X, use SMS-based 2FA or password recovery methods tied to a phone number. By gaining control of the phone number associated with the SEC’s X account, the attacker could potentially bypass security measures and gain access. This method highlights a significant vulnerability, even for high-profile organizations. While SMS-based 2FA is better than nothing, it’s considered less secure than app-based authenticators or hardware security keys, precisely because of the risk of SIM swap attacks. The Legal Consequences: Why Prosecutors Seek a Severe Sentence The U.S. Department of Justice is taking this case very seriously. They have recommended a two-year prison sentence for Eric Council Jr. This recommendation is based on the severity of the crime, the market disruption it caused, and the fact that it was part of a larger fraud scheme. Key factors influencing the sentencing recommendation likely include: Factor Impact in this case Market Disruption The fake announcement caused immediate, albeit temporary, volatility in the Bitcoin price and confusion across global financial markets. Public Trust Hacking the account of a major financial regulator like the SEC erodes public trust in official communication channels and regulatory bodies. Method Used (SIM Swap) Indicates a deliberate and somewhat sophisticated method to bypass security. Part of Broader Scheme Suggests a pattern of criminal behavior, not an isolated mistake. Guilty Plea While admitting guilt can sometimes lead to a reduced sentence, the prosecution’s recommendation shows they view the crime as significant regardless. The recommended two-year sentence reflects the view that this was not a minor offense but a serious crime with tangible consequences for financial markets and regulatory credibility. The final decision on sentencing will be made by a judge, with Council Jr.’s sentencing hearing currently scheduled for May 16. Lessons Learned: Enhancing Crypto Security and Regulatory Communication The SEC hack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent challenges in maintaining robust digital security, especially for entities that hold significant influence over markets. For individuals and institutions alike, the incident underscores the importance of adopting stronger security practices. For organizations like the SEC, this means reviewing and upgrading security protocols for all official communication channels. Relying solely on SMS-based 2FA is clearly risky. Implementing stronger forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as hardware tokens or authenticator apps, is critical. Regular security audits and employee training on phishing and social engineering tactics are also essential. For the broader crypto ecosystem and its participants, the event highlights the need for caution and verification. Market participants should always seek confirmation from multiple reliable sources before acting on sudden, market-moving news, especially when it originates from a single social media post. The incident also raises questions about how regulatory bodies communicate critical information. While social media is a fast way to disseminate news, perhaps official press releases or website announcements should remain the primary, most trusted source for major regulatory decisions like Bitcoin ETF approvals. Ultimately, enhancing crypto security involves a multi-layered approach, combining technical safeguards with user education and verification protocols. Summary: Accountability for the SEC Hack The legal pursuit of Eric Council Jr. for the SEC hack and the fake Bitcoin ETF announcement underscores the serious consequences of cyber crimes that impact financial markets. By using a SIM swap attack as part of a larger scheme, Council Jr. caused real disruption and confusion. Prosecutors are seeking a significant two-year prison sentence, reflecting the gravity of the offense and its potential to undermine trust in regulatory communications and market stability. As the crypto world continues to evolve, incidents like this serve as crucial reminders of the ongoing need for vigilance and robust crypto security measures across all levels.

Stablecoin issuer Tether is bringing its gold-backed token, Tether Gold ( XAUT ), to Thailand through a new listing on Maxbit, a local crypto exchange launched as a joint venture with SET-listed PTG Energy, the company said in a press release on Tuesday. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino called the move a “significant milestone” as demand grows for users “increasingly seeking resilient, asset-backed solutions.” “We are pleased to see XAUT listed on Maxbit, marking a significant milestone as the first platform to offer access to our gold-backed digital asset in Thailand.” Paolo Ardoino You might also like: CryptoQuant CEO: Dark stablecoins will likely emerge, here’s why Per Tether’s attestation report , the company holds 246,523.33 ounces of gold, totaling more than 7.7 tons.

At the same time, she signed into law a regulatory measure to prevent fraudulent transactions through digital currency ATMs. Hobbs turned down Senate Bill 1373, which sought to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund for the state to manage and hold digital currencies already seized through legal proceedings or received via legislative appropriations. “ Current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars ,” Hobbs wrote in a veto letter addressed to Senate President Warren Petersen. Governor Katie Hobbs letter vetoing two Senate Bills. Source: Arizona Legislature Last week, the Arizona governor vetoed Senate Bill 1025, titled the “Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act.” would have allowed the state to invest up to 10% of treasury surplus and retirement fund assets in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Hobbs was not up for subjecting taxpayer-backed funds and retirement portfolios to the risks of crypto market fluctuations. Crypto payment bill blocked The other halted proposal was Senate Bill 1024, a law that could allow Arizona state agencies to accept cryptocurrency as payment for fines, taxes, and fees. The bill included provisions that required the offices to partner with vetted crypto service providers, but Hobbs reiterated that it still posed too much exposure to financial instability. Arizona lawmakers advanced all three measures in an effort to embed digital assets into state operations, but the governor is hesitant to commit public resources or processes to the “still-evolving” technology. Arizona now joins at least nine other US states that have formally rejected similar legislative efforts to create public sector Bitcoin reserves, according to Bitcoin Laws data. Crypto ATM oversight signed into law Governor Hobbs gave her approval to House Bill 2387, a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency kiosks and ATMs across the state. Under the new law, operators of cryptocurrency kiosks and ATMs are now required to display fraud warnings in multiple languages to alert all users about potential scams. Moreover, receipts issued at these kiosks must now include specific transaction details, such as the transaction hash and the wallet address involved. The details are required by law enforcement to expedite investigations of fraudulent activities. Lastly, operators are required to keep detailed records of every transaction and follow all anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. As reported by Cryptopolitan last Wednesday, the governor signed House Bill 2749, which was brought forward by House Commerce Committee Chairman Jeff Weninger, and updates Arizona’s unclaimed property statutes to include digital assets. Previously, the state would liquidate any unclaimed crypto into fiat currency. Now, the law allows Arizona to hold unclaimed digital assets in their original crypto status. Louisiana non profit organization advocates for protection from crypto scams In other related news, non-profitable organization AARP Louisiana is backing House Bill 483, sponsored by State Rep. Mark Wright, meant to protect crypto holders against crypto-related scams, particularly those targeting senior citizens. The Louisiana proposal places a $3,000 daily transaction limit on crypto ATM users and mandates a 72-hour delay before any transaction is processed. This “cooling-off” period could help fend off common scammers that pressure victims into sending money quickly. “ There’s a need to get ahead of the technology and have protections in place, ” said Denise Bottcher, state director of AARP Louisiana, during a Press Club of Baton Rouge event on Monday. “ Fraud is growing at an alarming rate, and sadly, older adults are often the target .” Bottcher said the organization wanted a lower transaction threshold, but could “live with” the $3,000 figure with the mandatory delay.

COIN shares’ extended session rally, which amounts to 9.34% by press time on Tuesday and has taken equity from its latest closing price of $207.22 to $226.57, is even threatening to invalidate the already-bullish Wall Street 12-month COIN forecasts. COIN stock one-day price chart with May 13 pre-market. Source: Google The analysts represented on the stock analysis platform TipRanks see Coinbase as a moderate ‘buy’ on average , with 11 positive recommendations, 12 neutral experts, and no ‘sell’ ratings. The cautiously positive outlook is also evident in the price targets, with Canaccord assigning the highest, $400, on May 9 and the lowest predicting a fall to $169. Most interestingly, however, is the average price target. As it stands at $255.10, it would have taken a 23.11% rally to be met at the time the evening bell rang on May 12. At press time on May 13, it is a mere 12.59% away. COIN stock analyst consensus. Source: TipRanks The situation with the average forecasts also highlights an important aspect of the COIN stock analyst forecast: it is relatively out of date given the latest developments. Analysts revise COIN stock price target By press time on May 13, five revisions had been issued after the latest momentous developments, such as the trade talks between the U.S. and China, Bitcoin ’s establishing itself above $100,000 with some firmness, and Coinbase’s imminent joining of the S&P 500 benchmark index . On May 12, both Rosenblatt Securities and Needham reaffirmed their previous ‘buy’ ratings, with the former confirming the price target at $260 and the latter lowering it from $330 to $270. Compass Point changed its recommendation from ‘sell’ to ‘neutral’ on the same day while sticking to its $195 forecast for COIN shares. Both Barclays and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) confirmed they remain ‘neutral’, although both raised the price target. In Barclays’ opinion, Coinbase stock is set to climb to $202 in the coming 12 months, and not to $169 as previously predicted. On the other hand, Goldman sees COIN rallying to $209 instead of $189.

This significant rise is due to the ongoing drawdown of the Treasury General Account (TGA), essentially the U.S. government’s savings account. Because the debt ceiling has been hit, the government can’t issue new debt. So instead, it’s dipping into its TGA funds to finance spending, which injects liquidity into the financial system, much like quantitative easing (QE). Liquidity Injection in Play Despite this massive liquidity push, risk assets like stocks and crypto haven’t responded strongly. Crypto Analyst Tomas says that while this flood of cash boosts bank reserves and should, in theory, support asset prices, other factors, like geopolitical tensions, inflation worries, and uncertainty around U.S. fiscal policy, are keeping investors cautious. Two Speedbumps Ahead Federal Reserve Liquidity set to rise in coming weeks So what's the latest with Fed liquidity? I haven't done an update in a while. We are still in the middle of a ""liquidity upswing"" that started in early 2025. This is due to an ongoing draining of the Treasury General… https://t.co/FUXcHLUY8z pic.twitter.com/bCVZzU21zO — Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets) May 12, 2025 Analysts say we’re currently in a phase where more money is flowing into the financial system, which is called a “liquidity upswing.” But this flow won’t be smooth the whole way. Back in April, there was a bump in the road when people paid their taxes. That money went back into the government’s account (called the TGA), which pulled cash out of the system, kind of like money being taken out of circulation for a while. Another dip in liquidity is expected around mid to late June. That’s because: Companies will pay their quarterly taxes, which again fills up the government’s account and pulls money out of the market. Banks will be adjusting their balance sheets for the end of the quarter, and that may lead them to park more money in safe places through a tool called the “Reverse Repo”, which also removes cash from circulation temporarily. These things could cause a short-term slowdown in liquidity. But overall, since the government is still spending from its savings (and not issuing new debt because of the debt ceiling), the amount of cash in the system is likely to keep rising, at least until a new debt deal is made. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : CPI Report Today LIVE: U.S Inflation Report Release, CPI Data Expectations and FED News , What Happens When the Debt Ceiling Is Lifted? Once a new debt ceiling agreement is made, the situation will reverse. The Treasury will need to quickly replenish the TGA, meaning a wave of new debt will hit the market. This could drain liquidity from the financial system and pressure asset prices. Furthermore, he expects the “X-date”, when the U.S. government officially runs out of cash, to land sometime in August. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently warned that Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling by mid-July to avoid a funding crisis, especially since lawmakers are set to go on recess. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

BarriC emphasized that these price points might materialize sooner than many anticipate, igniting enthusiasm and skepticism among investors and analysts alike. A growing faction of crypto enthusiasts shares BarriC’s bullish outlook, anticipating significant growth for XRP. This optimism is often rooted in XRP’s potential to revolutionize cross-border payments and ongoing legal developments. However, while some share BarriC’s bullish outlook, others urge caution, highlighting the challenges and uncertainties inherent in such ambitious forecasts. The FOMO for $XRP will escalate when we start seeing prices like – $10 $XRP $20 $XRP $100 $XRP $1,000 $XRP And all those prices points for #XRP will happen a lot sooner than people think — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 12, 2025 Analyst Perspectives on XRP’s Potential Several analysts have weighed in on XRP’s future, offering a spectrum of predictions. Javon Marks, a crypto analyst, has suggested that XRP could reach between $15 and $18, citing bullish market patterns and technical indicators. He also alluded to the possibility of XRP surpassing $100, based on historical market behaviors and logarithmic scale analyses. Similarly, analyst Moonshilla discussed the path to a $100 XRP, noting that such a surge would require a significant increase in market capitalization, potentially challenging Bitcoin’s dominance. He emphasized that for XRP to reach this level, Bitcoin would need to rise substantially, suggesting a tightly correlated growth trajectory between the two cryptocurrencies. Matthew Brienen, COO of CryptoCharged, expressed a highly optimistic view, proposing that XRP could attain prices between $100 and $1,000 within the next decade. He based this projection on XRP’s utility in remittance payments and its ability to facilitate rapid, low-cost global transactions. Factors Influencing XRP’s Trajectory The potential for XRP to achieve such high valuations hinges on several critical factors: Regulatory Developments: The outcome of Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a pivotal determinant. A favorable resolution could bolster investor confidence and facilitate broader adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adoption by Financial Institutions: XRP’s integration into banking systems and use in cross-border transactions could significantly enhance its utility and demand. Reports suggest that many Japanese banks are considering adopting XRP for global payments, which could catalyze price appreciation. Market Dynamics: The overall health of the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin’s performance, plays a crucial role. Analysts like Moonshilla have highlighted the interdependence between XRP’s growth and Bitcoin’s market trajectory. Skepticism and Caution Despite the optimistic projections, some experts urge caution. Achieving a $1,000 price point would necessitate a market capitalization that surpasses the total value of many global economies, raising questions about feasibility. Moreover, XRP’s total supply and the absence of a burn mechanism could exert downward pressure on its price, making such high valuations challenging to sustain. BarriC’s assertion that FOMO for XRP will escalate at price milestones of $10, $20, $100, and $1,000 has reignited discussions about the cryptocurrency’s future. While some analysts and investors share this bullish sentiment, others highlight the significant hurdles that must be overcome. As the market evolves, XRP’s trajectory will likely be shaped by regulatory outcomes, institutional adoption, and broader market trends.

For those tracking the intersection of tech innovation and its broader market implications, including the crypto space which often leverages cutting-edge AI, understanding the nuances of AI progress is crucial. A recent report from Epoch AI, a non-profit AI research institute, suggests that the rapid improvements seen in certain advanced reasoning AI models might not be sustainable at their current pace. Are Reasoning AI Models Hitting a Wall? The core finding from Epoch AI indicates that the AI industry may struggle to achieve massive performance gains from reasoning AI models for much longer. The analysis points to a potential slowdown in progress as soon as within a year. This comes after a period where models like OpenAI’s o3 have shown significant leaps, particularly on benchmarks involving complex tasks like math and programming. These models excel by applying more computational power to problems, though this comes at the cost of increased processing time compared to conventional models. Understanding Reasoning Models and Reinforcement Learning How are these advanced models developed? The process typically involves two main stages: Initial Training: A conventional model is first trained on vast datasets. Reinforcement Learning: A technique is then applied where the model receives feedback on its attempts to solve difficult problems. This feedback loop helps refine its reasoning abilities. Epoch AI notes that while frontier labs like OpenAI have scaled up computing for the initial training, the reinforcement learning stage hasn’t historically received the same massive allocation. However, this is changing. OpenAI reportedly used about 10 times more computing power for o3 compared to its predecessor, o1, with Epoch speculating much of this went into reinforcement learning. OpenAI researchers have also indicated future plans to prioritize reinforcement learning with even more computational resources. The Epoch AI Analysis: Scaling Limits Despite the increased focus on reinforcement learning, the Epoch AI analysis suggests there’s an upper bound to how much computing can effectively be applied to this stage. Josh You, the author of the analysis, highlights the difference in current scaling rates: Performance gains from standard AI model training are currently quadrupling annually. Performance gains from reinforcement learning are growing tenfold every 3-5 months. You predicts that the progress from reasoning training will likely converge with the overall frontier AI progress by 2026. The analysis acknowledges making assumptions and drawing on public statements from AI executives, but it strongly argues that scaling reasoning models faces challenges beyond just computing power. Challenges for the AI Industry The possibility that reasoning AI models may reach a limit in the near future is a significant concern for the AI industry . Companies have invested enormous resources into developing these complex models. Beyond the computational scaling issues highlighted by Epoch AI, other factors could impede progress, including high overhead costs associated with research and development. You writes, “If there’s a persistent overhead cost required for research, reasoning models might not scale as far as expected.” He emphasizes the importance of tracking rapid compute scaling closely, as it’s a potentially very important ingredient for progress in these models. Furthermore, studies have already pointed out significant flaws in these models, despite their power and expense, such as a tendency to “hallucinate” or produce incorrect information more often than some simpler models. Conclusion: What This Means for Future AI Progress The Epoch AI analysis provides a valuable perspective on the potential trajectory of AI progress , particularly concerning advanced reasoning capabilities. While breakthroughs continue to happen, understanding potential bottlenecks, whether computational or research-related, is vital for setting realistic expectations and directing future efforts within the AI industry . The rapid gains from reinforcement learning that have fueled recent progress may slow as they hit scaling limits, potentially requiring new fundamental approaches to continue the pace of innovation in reasoning AI models .

This could indicate that holders are rushing to sell the token amidst fears of the price dipping lower. The recent drop in prices could lead to traders “panic selling,” which could push prices even lower while trading volume goes up alongside selling pressure. Most recently, the Pi Network team hinted at a major announcement scheduled to take place on May 14. The post shared on May 8 only described it as an “ecosystem announcement. Not only that, the timing of the announcement also coincides with the upcoming Consensus 2025 Summit, where Pi’s founder is scheduled to speak.

In early April, he noted the significance of the Fibonacci level at the $2.222 price, identifying it as an important technical marker. In a recent update, he emphasized that XRP is on the way to $3.3330 after surpassing the crucial levels at $2.2222 and $2.3620. The digital asset is trading at $2.54, up 7.7% from the previous day. This rise aligns with Dark Defender’s projections and adds momentum to the analyst’s longer-term price targets. The $3.333 level, while just below XRP’s multi-year high of $3.39, many see it as a realistic short-term objective given the recent technical and fundamental developments. Good Morning, Legends! #XRP is on the way to the $3.3330 Fibonacci Level. You have experienced how important $2.2222 and $2.3620 were, and precisely addressed! Have a wonderful week ahead. Cheers, Dark https://t.co/4zAI1AsoDc — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) May 12, 2025 Regulatory Shift Strengthens Market Sentiment One of the catalysts behind XRP’s current momentum is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) latest filing in its case against Ripple. The SEC has requested court approval for its settlement agreement that would reduce the originally proposed $125 million penalty to $50 million. The settlement also seeks to remove the permanent injunction that barred Ripple from selling XRP tokens to institutional investors. The end of the lawsuit is a major victory for Ripple, XRP, and the XRP army. The legal clarity it brings has restored confidence in the market, contributing to renewed investor interest in the token. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently stated that this development has unlocked the U.S. market .

U.S. President Donald Trump recently revealed a new trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom, a move that had a positive impact on the global markets. Trump’s administration has previously been praised for its pro-crypto stance, and many in the crypto industry view his policies favorably. The trade deal announcement has heightened expectations that additional initiatives may follow, further supporting digital assets like XRP. The Path to $3.333 Dark Defender’s emphasis on Fibonacci levels, especially those at the $2.222 and $3.333 prices, has excited the XRP army, as this short-term surge could kickstart a greater climb to higher targets. XRP’s price is currently rising fast, and while resistance near the all-time high remains a consideration, the combination of favorable technical indicators, regulatory developments, and current position momentum positions the asset for further gains.

The company revealed Monday that it had signed a purchase agreement with an investor based in the British Virgin Islands to support its crypto treasury initiative. “This is a deliberate strategy that reflects both current industry trends and our unique strengths,” said Xiaojian Wang, Chairman and CEO of GD Culture, in the company’s announcement. GD Culture Joins Strategy and Metaplanet in Adding Bitcoin to Treasury The firm follows in the footsteps of companies like Strategy and Metaplanet, which have added Bitcoin to their treasuries in recent months. However, GD Culture’s aggressive pivot into crypto comes amid mounting financial pressure. In April, Nasdaq issued a warning to the company for failing to meet the minimum $2.5 million stockholders’ equity requirement. GD Culture reported equity of just $2,643. The company has until May 4 to submit a compliance plan to Nasdaq, which could grant it up to 180 days to regain compliance while continuing to trade under the ticker GDC. With a market capitalization of $28 million and reported net losses of $14 million in 2024, the announcement raised concerns over potential shareholder dilution and the feasibility of executing such a large-scale crypto acquisition.

Formerly known as Code Chain New Continent Limited and TMSR Holding Company Limited, the firm now operates through two subsidiaries: AI Catalysis in the U.S. and Shanghai Xianzhui Technology in China. Previous business ventures have included coal processing and iron ore trading. As of publication, Bitcoin trades near $102,500, while Trump Coin sits at $12.60, down 9% over the past 24 hours. GD Culture’s stock closed at $2.51 on Monday, after briefly spiking to $8.18 following the announcement, according to Nasdaq data. Public Companies Ramp Up Bitcoin Exposure Public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin. This includes plans to sell an additional $21 billion in common stock, following the full utilization of a prior program approved in October. In addition to equity sales, Strategy has also expanded its debt issuance target from $21 billion to $42 billion, with $14.6 billion still available under the current authorization. On Monday, Metaplanet also expanded its Bitcoin treasury, acquiring an additional 1,241 BTC for approximately 18.4 billion yen ($126 million). The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 6,796 BTC, currently valued at over $706 million. This trend reflects a broader institutional interest in Bitcoin. During the first quarter of the year, publicly listed firms collectively grew their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% , indicating continued confidence in the asset despite persistent market volatility.

But those who got in early had a distinct advantage; an advantage that’s now available again, but with a new contender: OpenFundNet . As the presale launches, it’s time to take a close look at why OpenFundNet’s early-stage investment is the best opportunity for today’s investors compared to the beginnings of XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano. Overview of Platforms When it comes to crowdfunding and crypto, platforms like XRP , Kaspa, and Cardano each brought a unique value proposition to the table. XRP, with its fast transactions and scalability, disrupted cross-border payments. Kaspa, focusing on high throughput and scalability, positioned itself as a solid solution for decentralized finance. Cardano has carved out its niche as a blockchain with a focus on sustainability, security, and smart contracts. However, OpenFundNet stands apart. It doesn’t just rely on one core feature; it merges blockchain technology with decentralized crowdfunding. Unlike traditional platforms like Kickstarter or Juicebox, which primarily focus on donations or rewards-based funding, OpenFundNet offers a revolutionary validator-driven system that ensures project credibility before funding is even released. This creates a more reliable, transparent, and trust-based environment that today’s crowdfunding ecosystem desperately needs. Fees and Accessibility One of the main reasons why traditional platforms like Kickstarter and Juicebox are often criticized is their high fees. Kickstarter, for instance, takes a 5% commission on all funds raised, which eats into the creator’s budget, and fees can escalate when processing payments. This means less money goes to the projects that need it most. Juicebox, while a better alternative, still faces similar issues in terms of scalability and long-term sustainability. OpenFundNet, on the other hand, takes a revolutionary approach by eliminating fees entirely. There’s no commission on funds raised, meaning every dollar you donate or invest goes directly to the project. Additionally, because OpenFundNet operates on a blockchain, it offers complete transparency and significantly lower costs compared to traditional platforms. This is a big win for both project creators and backers, making it far more accessible than its competitors, who are still mired in outdated fee structures. $OFNT Token Sale | Buy $OFNT Now! Community and Governance XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano each represent centralized or semi-centralized solutions, which, while effective in their respective niches, don’t fully embrace the power of community governance. For instance, Cardano has a decentralized governance model, but the decision-making process is still often influenced by a few key players. Kaspa and XRP also lean towards more centralized control, with decision-making largely resting in the hands of a small team or organization. In contrast, OpenFundNet embraces a truly decentralized approach, where token holders have voting rights on key platform decisions. The governance system is designed to be completely community-driven, meaning decisions such as platform upgrades, project funding models, or rule changes are decided by the very people who participate in the ecosystem. This level of decentralization is the backbone of OpenFundNet’s long-term success, providing transparency and accountability in ways that other platforms can’t. Token Use and Rewards XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano have their own tokenomics models, all designed to fuel the success of their respective blockchains. XRP’s token serves as the bridge currency for cross-border payments, while Kaspa focuses on scalability, and Cardano aims to power decentralized applications and smart contracts. OpenFundNet, however, takes token use to the next level by implementing a dual reward system. Backers receive rewards in the form of OpenFundNet’s native tokens for supporting projects, while validators earn tokens for evaluating the legitimacy of those projects. This reward mechanism creates an incentive for everyone in the ecosystem to remain engaged, ensuring both short-term and long-term growth. Additionally, the platform’s deflationary tokenomics, which include burning tokens and penalties for inactive validators, help maintain the value of the token over time. Security and Trust While XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano are all known for their blockchain security, the crowdfunding space often lacks proper validation systems, leaving backers exposed to scams, failed projects, and other risks. This is a significant concern for many investors and backers alike. OpenFundNet solves this issue with its validator-based model, where only verified and trusted validators can assess projects before they are funded. This ensures that the projects are credible and trustworthy before a single token is exchanged. By involving both validators and backers in the evaluation process, OpenFundNet significantly reduces the risk of fraud or failed projects. In addition, the platform’s full transparency via blockchain allows users to track the project’s journey in real-time, ensuring trust from the start. Growth Potential and Future Plans Looking at the early days of XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano , each of these projects had their own roadblocks and hurdles to overcome. XRP faced regulatory scrutiny, Kaspa is still working on mainstream adoption, and Cardano’s slow and methodical approach to development has been both praised and criticized. However, each of these projects has achieved considerable success due to their strong technology and early backing. OpenFundNet, however, is different. With its innovative crowdfunding model, zero fees, and validator-driven ecosystem, it has the potential to explode as more people seek decentralized funding alternatives. The presale is your chance to get in on the ground floor of a project that is just starting to gain traction. As the platform scales, the demand for its native token will rise, and those who invest early will be well-positioned to reap the rewards of the ecosystem’s growth. Why OpenFundNet’s Presale Could Be the Next Big Thing When you look at the presale opportunities of XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano, it’s clear that each project had its own hurdles to overcome, but the long-term gains for early investors were undeniable. XRP broke down barriers in cross-border payments, Kaspa is pushing the envelope with scalability, and Cardano continues to be a powerhouse in decentralized applications. However, the decentralized crowdfunding space has always lacked a truly innovative, accessible, and fee-free platform that combines trust and transparency, until now. OpenFundNet presents a unique presale opportunity that offers significant growth potential and the chance to be part of a project at its early stages, just like XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano were in their beginnings. With its validator-driven system, low fees, dual rewards, and decentralized governance, OpenFundNet is set to disrupt the crowdfunding space while bringing long-term value to investors who get in early.

44565123,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159838,1747136413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,ZKsync Crypto Regulation Scare: Protocol Pulls Statement Amidst Scrutiny,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/zksync-crypto-regulation-scare/,"Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever feel like you blink, and something wild happens in the Web3 world? Well, buckle up, because the popular Ethereum scaling protocol, ZKsync, just gave us a moment of intrigue. The project recently removed an official statement posted on its X (formerly Twitter) account. What was the statement about? It claimed the protocol was under investigation by U.S. authorities. Yes, you read that right – a potential Crypto Regulation probe! What Exactly Happened with ZKsync’s Statement? The core of the story is the swift appearance and disappearance of a post on ZKsync’s official X account. This post explicitly stated that the project was facing an investigation by U.S. regulatory bodies. The concern reportedly stemmed from issues related to zkEVM-based applications that were accessible to users within the United States. Here’s a quick breakdown: The Claim: ZKsync announced it was under U.S. regulatory investigation. The Reason (Reported): Concerns over accessibility of zkEVM apps to U.S. users. The Action: The post announcing the investigation was quickly removed. This move immediately raised eyebrows across the crypto community. Why announce such a significant development only to take it down shortly after? Was This Related to a Security Incident? Adding another layer of complexity to this unfolding situation is the timing of the deleted post relative to a brief security incident. According to reports, ZKsync’s X account experienced a compromise just before or around the time the regulatory statement appeared. During this apparent hack: The compromised account was used to promote a fraudulent ZK token airdrop. This malicious post was live for about 15 minutes before being taken down. The proximity of the security breach and the deleted regulatory statement is certainly curious. It leads to speculation: was the regulatory statement itself a result of the hack? Or was it a legitimate (but perhaps prematurely posted) statement that was then confused or complicated by the security incident? ZKsync has not yet provided a clear explanation for the removal of the regulatory statement, leaving the community to ponder the connection. Understanding ZKsync and zkEVM To fully grasp the potential implications of a regulatory investigation, it helps to understand what ZKsync is and the technology it uses, particularly zkEVM . ZKsync is a leading Ethereum Scaling solution. Ethereum, while revolutionary, faces challenges with transaction speed and cost due to network congestion. Scaling solutions, often called Layer 2s (L2s), aim to solve this by processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) and then posting a summary back to L1. ZKsync utilizes a technology called ZK-rollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups). Here’s the simplified idea: Thousands of transactions are bundled together off-chain. A cryptographic proof (a Zero-Knowledge proof) is generated, verifying that all transactions in the bundle are valid, without revealing the details of each transaction. This proof, along with a minimal amount of data needed to update the state on Ethereum, is posted to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly reduces the data posted to Ethereum, leading to faster and cheaper transactions. Now, what about zkEVM ? This is a specific type of ZK-rollup that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is the computational engine of Ethereum, where smart contracts live and execute. EVM compatibility is crucial because it allows developers to easily port existing Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) to the L2 without having to rewrite their code. This makes ZKsync’s platform highly attractive for developers and users alike, enabling a wide range of dApps, including DeFi protocols, NFTs, and more, to run on a scalable network. Why Would Crypto Regulation Target a Scaling Protocol? The mention of a potential U.S. regulatory investigation, especially concerning accessibility to U.S. users, touches upon a sensitive area in the crypto space: jurisdiction and compliance. Regulators globally, and particularly in the U.S., are grappling with how to classify and oversee decentralized technologies. Key questions include: Are the tokens associated with protocols considered securities? Are the protocols themselves operating as unlicensed money transmitters or exchanges if U.S. persons can access them? How is control and decentralization assessed in the context of regulatory oversight? While ZKsync is a scaling technology, the applications running on its zkEVM layer could potentially fall under regulatory scrutiny depending on their nature (e.g., offering trading, lending, or investment opportunities). If U.S. persons can access these applications without the necessary registrations or compliance checks in place, it could raise red flags for agencies like the SEC or FinCEN. The deleted statement’s reference to “zkEVM-based applications accessible to American users” suggests that the focus of the potential investigation might be on the dApps deployed on ZKsync’s network and their user base, rather than solely on the underlying scaling technology itself. This highlights the complex challenges L2s face as they strive for decentralization while navigating varied and evolving global regulatory landscapes. Navigating the Challenges: Regulation and Web3 Security The ZKsync incident underscores two major challenges facing the broader Web3 ecosystem: Crypto Regulation and Web3 Security . Regulatory Headwinds: Protocols operating globally must contend with different rules in different jurisdictions. What is permissible in one country might be restricted in another. Ensuring that applications are not improperly accessible to users in regulated markets like the U.S. is a significant undertaking, often requiring complex geo-blocking or identity verification measures, which can sometimes feel antithetical to the permissionless ethos of Web3. Security Vulnerabilities: The X account compromise highlights that even established projects are targets for malicious actors. Social media accounts, while seemingly peripheral, are critical communication channels. A breach can be used to spread misinformation (like fake airdrops or, potentially, fake regulatory news) leading to user losses and reputational damage. This emphasizes the need for robust security practices not just for smart contracts and protocol infrastructure, but for all associated digital assets and communication platforms. Projects building on Ethereum Scaling solutions like ZKsync must therefore prioritize both compliance strategies and comprehensive security measures to protect themselves and their users. What Does This Mean for Users and the Ecosystem? For users of ZKsync and other L2s, this incident serves as a reminder to be vigilant: Verify Information: Always double-check official announcements, especially those involving regulatory issues or token distributions, across multiple trusted sources. Be Wary of Airdrops: Fake airdrops are a common scam vector. Never connect your wallet to suspicious sites or share your seed phrase. Understand Regulatory Risks: Be aware that the regulatory status of crypto projects and applications is still evolving, which can introduce uncertainty. For the broader ecosystem, this event is a learning opportunity. It highlights the delicate balance projects must strike between innovation, accessibility, and compliance. It also reinforces the critical need for robust Web3 Security infrastructure and practices across all layers – from the core protocol to associated social media accounts. Conclusion: Unpacking the ZKsync Enigma The ZKsync saga, involving a deleted statement about a U.S. regulatory probe and a coinciding social media hack promoting a fake airdrop, is a microcosm of the challenges facing the Web3 space today. It underscores the increasing pressure from Crypto Regulation , the complexities of offering decentralized services globally via technologies like zkEVM , the ongoing battle for Web3 Security , and the importance of secure communication channels for Ethereum Scaling solutions. While the exact reasons for the statement’s removal remain unclear, the incident serves as a stark reminder that as crypto adoption grows, so does the scrutiny from regulators and the attention from malicious actors. Projects and users alike must remain informed, cautious, and committed to building a more secure and compliant future for decentralized technology.

However, after the tensions eased following the talks between the US and China over the weekend, Goldman Sachs updated its forecasts. At this point, Goldman Sachs increased its 2025 growth forecast for the US economy by 0.5 points to 1 percent, citing the calming of the US-China trade war and recent developments. It lowered the 12-month recession probability to 35 percent. The bank also revised its expectations for a Fed rate cut, postponing the rate cut expectation to December instead of July. At this point, Goldman Sachs said it expects a total of three rate cuts from the Fed in 2025 and 2026. It estimated one of these in December instead of July, and the remaining two for March and June of next year. The bank had previously forecast three rate cuts for this year. As is known, the US and China agreed on Monday to reduce customs duties for 90 days. Accordingly, the US reduced the customs duty on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China reduced the customs duty on products imported from the US from 125% to 10%. *This is not investment advice.

However, the group’s legal team has pledged to revise and refile the lawsuit by the court’s May 23 deadline. California District Court Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. ruled that all nine claims—including securities violations and fraud—were “deficient,” citing vague arguments and a lack of concrete details about token purchases. Lead plaintiff Lee Greenfield, a UK citizen who claimed losses of over $40,000, failed to establish that his token transactions occurred within U.S. jurisdiction, weakening the case’s foundation under federal securities laws. Despite the dismissal, Judge Blumenfeld granted the plaintiffs permission to amend the complaint , though he cautioned the new filing must be “more focused and judiciously pleaded.” Room for Lawsuit Refile The plaintiffs initially accused Jenner and her manager Sophia Hutchins of fraudulently promoting memecoins to “financially unsophisticated investors.” They alleged misleading social media statements and a failure to disclose key details about the token’s structure and risks. However, the court found that the complaint failed to link any specific promotional statements to fraudulent intent. Additionally, the judge rejected claims that Jenner violated securities laws by selling unregistered securities through a prospectus. As the complaint itself acknowledged, no prospectus was involved in the token sale. Allegations of common-law fraud also failed due to a lack of direct misstatements or omissions tied to the token’s promotion. Importantly, the court did not rule on whether the JENNER token is a security under U.S. law, noting that decision would require more factual development—possibly in the amended complaint. JENNER Collapse Undermines Investor Trust JENNER launched on the Solana blockchain in May 2024 via Pump.fun but quickly courted controversy. Jenner claimed she had been deceived by known memecoin collaborator Sahil Arora, prompting a relaunch of the token on Ethereum. The plaintiffs argue this switch wiped out the original token’s value, while the celebrity collected a 3% fee from Ethereum-based transactions. Since its brief moment of hype, the token has all but vanished from the market. According to CoinMarketCap, JENNER’s market cap has plummeted from a peak of nearly $7.5 million in June 2024 to just $58,775 today. Trading volume has dropped to a mere $61.10 in the last 24 hours, underscoring the token’s dramatic fall from grace .

Our Pepe price prediction for 2025 is a maximum price of $0.000035 In 2030, we expect the Pepe price to touch $0.0258. The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty. This causes fluctuations in PEPE prices as they oscillate in search of a solid support level to initiate a recovery. Considering investing in Pepe crypto? Explore our Pepecoin price prediction from 2025 to 2031. We offer an in-depth analysis of the anticipated price movements for the PEPE coin.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00001542, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00001614. PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00001275, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00001066. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe up today? Pepe’s price gained buying demand around the recent low and broke above immediate Fib levels. As a result, buyers pushed the price toward the high of $0.000014. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000015 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040.

Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

In a video update, the pseudonymous analyst tells his 211,000 YouTube subscribers that the monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests Bitcoin’s bull market will continue and that the flagship crypto asset may soar close to half a million dollars. The RSI is a momentum oscillator used to determine whether an asset is oversold or overbought. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 typically indicating that an asset is overbought, while readings below 30 suggest that it is oversold. Says PlanB, “In my opinion, from now on, we’ll see new all-time highs, so that would be $110,000 and higher, followed by more monthly close all-time highs. Usually, those all-time highs, they’re not alone. They come in groups. Now, if we look at RSI, the relative strength index, currently it’s at 66, and that’s around the average RSI level of 65, the dark area here, the black area. And it has been around that average for more than a year now. In my opinion, how I read this chart is that Bitcoin spent a couple of years below that average of 65 and from now on, it will stay one or more years above the 65 average.” Source: PlanB/YouTube The analyst believes the RSI will hit at least 80 for several months this cycle based on historic precedent, potentially increasing Bitcoin by 290% of its current value. “In fact, I think we will see 80-plus RSI months again, at least four of them, just like in the bull markets in 2021, in 2017 and in 2013. So I think we will see those high RSI numbers again – at least four times. And those high RSI numbers are associated, of course, with high monthly returns, monthly returns of over 40% per month. So if we have from the current level of on average $100,000, four months of 40% that would bring us already in the $400,000 area.” Bitcoin is trading for $102,558 at time of writing, down 1.6% in the last 24 hours.

According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&P 500’s 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100’s 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.” The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled. The Nasdaq Composite is flat, the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell nearly 4%, and even gold (typically a safe haven) briefly hit $3,500 per ounce before pulling back to a 5.75% gain, Galaxy Digital analysts wrote in a May 12 note. However, they noted that Bitcoin surged 11% over the same period, reinforcing its evolving role as a macro hedge amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty. The Nasdaq Composite Index has been in the red over the past six months. Source: Nasdaq Related: Bitcoin illiquid supply hits 14M BTC as hodlers set bull market record Bitcoin’s correlation with major indexes declines The analysts noted that Bitcoin still maintains elevated 30-day correlations with major indexes, around 0.62 with the S&P and 0.64 with the Nasdaq. However, its beta has declined, signaling that investors may be treating it less as a high-risk asset and more as a long-term allocation. “Bitcoin as a non-sovereign asset means an investor doesn’t need the full faith or tax basis of a nation to support the integrity of the asset,” said Chris Rhine, head of liquid active strategies at Galaxy. Galaxy said that the recent investor behavior mirrors what was observed during the 2018–2019 US-China trade tensions when Bitcoin rallied amid rising global uncertainty. Hank Huang, CEO of Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that surging ETF inflows and Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin purchases are helping reshape Bitcoin into a digital version of gold, less tied to equities. “As institutions deepen liquidity, volatility drops, making Bitcoin a cornerstone for portfolios,” Huang added. Institutions view Bitcoin as hedge Meanwhile, Galaxy’s OTC trading desk said the market posture is “tactically cautious but structurally constructive,” marked by disciplined leverage and low hedging stress. With 95% of Bitcoin’s total supply already mined and growing interest from institutions, ETFs and even governments, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital store of value. “Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics are solidifying its place as a mature digital store of value,” said Ian Kolman, co-portfolio manager at Galaxy. On April 25, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s head of thematics and active ETFs, said there has been a long-term trend in which countries have been reducing their reliance on dollar-based reserves in favor of assets like gold and, increasingly, Bitcoin. He noted that geopolitical fragmentation is fueling demand for uncorrelated assets, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed alongside gold as a safe-haven asset.

The all-cash acquisition values WonderFi at 36 Canadian cents per share, a 41% premium over its closing price prior to the announcement. “WonderFi has built a formidable family of brands serving beginner and advanced crypto users alike, making them an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada,” said Johann Kerbrat, SVP and GM of Robinhood Crypto, in the official announcement. Robinhood, a popular commission-free brokerage platform, has been looking to expand its international footprint for some time and struck a deal to acquire cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp last year. The latest acquisition will help it win over Canada-based customers. Toronto-listed WonderFi owns and operates Bitbuy and Coinsquare, two leading domestic crypto platforms in the Canadian market.

New York Mayor Eric Adams announced that he’s hosting the city’s first-ever official crypto summit next week, which he said will bring together public officials and crypto industry innovators. In an April press release announcing the event, Adam’s office described the summit as “coming on the heels of the White House Digital Asset Summit in March.” “We’re going to attract world-class talent, provide opportunities for underbanked communities, and make government more user-friendly,” Adams postulated. “We are focused on the long-term values of these technologies for our city and its people, not chasing memes or trends.” Specifically, the New York mayor mentioned the positive impact of crypto and blockchain on the city’s underbanked population, who have historically faced obstacles to traditional means of saving resources. Adams then reaffirmed his goal of making New York City a crypto hub, saying at the press briefing that he would work with tech and crypto companies and create a friendly environment to help them succeed in the city. “My goal remains the same as it was on day one as mayor: making New York City the crypto capital of the globe,” Adams asserted. His statements echo similar promises from President Donald Trump, who has often said he wants to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Earlier this year, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration directed prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to dismiss corruption charges against Adams. The judge dismissed the charges with prejudice. Adams and Trump have been close since January, when Adams traveled to Florida to meet with the president at Mar-a-Lago. Adams’ History With Crypto Eric Adams has long been a supporter of crypto assets, describing himself as crypto-friendly even before assuming office as New York mayor. Adams recalled converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum, and people laughed at him for making such a move. “All I can say is, who’s laughing now?” he quizzed, adding. “We’re seeing how this industry is growing, and since then, the number of crypto and blockchain startups that have made New York City home has skyrocketed.” The New York mayor, however, believes that while the crypto industry views mass adoption as inevitable, balanced regulation is needed that is strong enough to protect investors but not so stringent that it impedes innovation and growth. “Our state should embrace the crypto and blockchain-friendly environment we have in New York City,” he quipped. “The right regulations can provide safety, but overregulation could hurt the industry — and we don’t want that.” Meanwhile, Adams is currently running for reelection in the 2025 mayoral election.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|new york,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-13 11:55:30

KindlyMD Secures $710 Million In Funding According to CNBC, the newly merged entity has secured a substantial financial boost, raising $200 million in convertible debt and an additional $510 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal. Investors in the PIPE are purchasing shares at $1.12 each, while the convertible notes will convert at a premium price of $2.80. Notably, these notes are zero-coupon for the first two years, allowing investors a unique opportunity to benefit from future growth.

Yesterday, I raised almost $200 million.” The funding round has attracted over 200 investors, including prominent names such as Actai Ventures, Arrington Capital, and Van Eck. Individual backers include notable figures in the cryptocurrency world, such as cryptographer Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, and former Coinbase executive Balaji Srinivasan. A ‘Transformational Transaction’ For Bitcoin Integration Constantine Karides, chair of Reed Smith’s Crypto & Digital Assets Group and lead counsel on the deal, characterized the merger as a “transformational transaction.” Karides noted that Bitcoin’s rise as a treasury asset is a natural progression, reflecting a broader trend in capital markets toward innovative transaction structures that embrace blockchain technology. The merger’s implications are particularly intriguing given KindlyMD’s existing mission to address opioid addiction. Bailey emphasized that his team sought a “right vehicle” to take Nakamoto public, and KindlyMD’s leadership was already enthusiastic about bitcoin. “What KindlyMD will look like in the future will be different than what it looks like today,” he stated. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Plans are in place for a rebranding of the combined company, which will also change its ticker symbol from “KDLY.” The vision is to build a global network of bitcoin-focused businesses, with KindlyMD’s healthcare operations gradually taking a smaller role. However, Tim Pickett, CEO of KindlyMD, assured stakeholders that the clinics would continue to prioritize treating opioid addiction and providing patient-focused care. “This merger represents a strategic leap for KindlyMD, allowing us to expand our mission,” Pickett said. Pickett also expressed confidence that the partnership with Nakamoto, which brings deep expertise in Bitcoin strategy and treasury management, will drive long-term value for shareholders. Trading at approximately $102,260, BTC’s price has recorded a notable 8% surge in the weekly time frame, hovering just 6% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in the first quarter of the year.

In a significant move for the Asian market, particularly concerning South Korea crypto adoption and governance, a major political player has signaled a serious intent to engage with the sector. The Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), a prominent political force in South Korea, has officially announced the formation of a dedicated digital asset committee. This committee is being established as part of their preparations for the upcoming presidential election, highlighting the growing importance of digital assets as a policy consideration on the national stage. This step indicates that Korean digital assets are no longer a niche topic but a key area requiring focused political attention. Why is a DPK Crypto Committee Important for Korea Crypto Regulation? The establishment of the DPK crypto committee underscores the increasing recognition by mainstream political parties of the impact digital assets have on the economy, technology, and society. As South Korea boasts one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency adoption and trading activity globally, developing clear and effective Korea crypto regulation is paramount. A dedicated committee within a major party provides a structured approach to tackling the complexities involved. According to reports, the committee is structured to ensure comprehensive coverage of the digital asset landscape. It is divided into two primary subgroups: Industrial Growth and Innovation: This subgroup will likely focus on how to foster the development of blockchain technology and digital asset businesses within South Korea. Their aim would be to identify opportunities for economic growth, job creation, and technological advancement driven by the digital asset sector. Supporting Policy and Legal Frameworks: This subgroup will concentrate on the crucial task of developing appropriate regulations, consumer protection measures, and legal clarity for digital assets. This involves navigating complex issues like investor safety, anti-money laundering (AML), taxation, and the legal status of various digital assets. The overarching goal articulated for these subgroups is to build a system that promotes synergy and effective communication between policy advisors and the private sector. This collaboration is vital for creating regulations that are not only robust but also practical and conducive to innovation. What Are the Potential Benefits of This Digital Asset Committee? The formation of such a committee by a major political party brings several potential benefits: Increased Policy Focus: Elevates digital assets from a peripheral issue to a central policy concern, ensuring dedicated resources and attention are allocated to developing a coherent strategy. Industry Collaboration: Provides a formal channel for dialogue between policymakers and industry experts, leading to more informed and effective regulation that understands the nuances of the technology and market. Regulatory Clarity: A focused approach can accelerate the development of clear and predictable regulatory frameworks, which is essential for both businesses and investors operating in the Korean digital assets space. Investor Protection: Dedicated policy work can lead to stronger measures protecting investors from fraud, market manipulation, and other risks inherent in the digital asset market. Fostering Innovation: By involving industry experts, the committee can help design policies that encourage innovation and growth rather than stifling it through overly restrictive rules. Are There Challenges Ahead for Crypto Policy Korea? While the formation of the DPK crypto committee is a positive step, the path to effective Crypto policy Korea is fraught with challenges: Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance between fostering technological advancement and protecting consumers and financial stability is a delicate act. Over-regulation can drive innovation underground or offshore, while under-regulation can lead to significant risks. Political Consensus: Digital asset policy can be a contentious issue, with differing views on its role and risks. Building consensus within the party and across the political spectrum will be necessary for durable policy. Technical Complexity: The digital asset space is constantly evolving, with new technologies and business models emerging rapidly. Policymakers must stay informed and adaptable. Public Perception: Public understanding and perception of digital assets vary widely, influenced by market volatility and high-profile incidents. Global Coordination: Digital assets operate globally. Effective regulation often requires coordination with other countries to prevent regulatory arbitrage. What Does This Mean for the Upcoming Presidential Election? The timing of the DPK crypto committee launch, specifically within the presidential election preparation committee, suggests that digital asset policy is expected to be a relevant topic for voters. Candidates may seek to differentiate themselves by presenting distinct visions for the future of South Korea crypto . Issues like taxation on crypto gains, the scope of regulatory oversight, support for blockchain startups, and investor protection are likely to feature in policy discussions and campaign platforms. The engagement of a major party like the DPK indicates that the development of a robust and forward-thinking Crypto policy Korea is becoming a key battleground for winning over tech-savvy voters and those invested in the digital economy. Actionable Insights for the South Korea Crypto Ecosystem For businesses and individuals involved in the Korean digital assets market, this development highlights the importance of engaging with the political process. Industry participants should seek opportunities to provide input to the committee and policymakers. Staying informed about the committee’s discussions and proposed policies will be crucial for navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. Investors should pay attention to how potential policy changes discussed by the committee might impact the market and specific assets. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Korean Digital Assets The formation of the DPK crypto committee is a significant and promising development for the future of South Korea crypto . It signals a dedicated effort by a major political party to understand and shape the digital asset landscape ahead of the presidential election. By focusing on both industrial growth and robust policy frameworks, and by aiming to bridge the gap between policymakers and the private sector, the committee has the potential to contribute to the development of a clearer, safer, and more innovative environment for Korean digital assets . While challenges remain, this structured approach offers hope for the creation of effective Korea crypto regulation that benefits both the industry and the public.

44566021,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25177,1747137799,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What is Falcon USD (USDf)?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/token/what-is-falcon-usd-usdf/,"USDf, the synthetic stablecoin developed by Falcon Finance, represents an overcollateralised digital dollar that aims to combine security, flexibility, and sustainability in its design. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDf is not pegged to fiat by direct reserves but is instead minted against a diversified set of collateral assets. These include both stablecoins like USDC and USDt, as well as more volatile cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH. Falcon aims to ensure that every USDf issued is backed by assets exceeding its value, using a dynamic overcollateralization ratio to account for volatility and market conditions, thereby enhancing the system’s ability to maintain price stability during market turbulence. One of USDf’s distinguishing features lies in its dual minting mechanisms: Classic Mint and Innovative Mint. The Classic Mint allows users to deposit stable or non-stable assets, receiving USDf either at a 1:1 rate or through an overcollateralised process, depending on the asset’s volatility. The Innovative Mint, aimed at more experienced users, introduces fixed-term deposits and predefined price parameters, while safeguarding the protocol through liquidation thresholds. This layered approach accommodates varying risk appetites and strategies, expanding the token’s use cases across different user segments. Peg stability for USDf is maintained through a blend of delta-neutral trading strategies and cross-market arbitrage opportunities. Falcon deploys user collateral into centralised and decentralised venues, while ensuring that price movements in collateral assets do not affect the dollar value of USDf. To further support its peg, users can engage in arbitrage when USDf trades above or below $1 on secondary markets, creating a market-driven feedback loop to anchor its value. Trade USDf Now Falcon’s architecture positions USDf as a synthetic dollar designed not only for stability, but also for flexible utility and sustained performance in a range of DeFi contexts. Learn more on Falcon Finance here . What is the USDf Token? USDf plays a central role in the Falcon Finance ecosystem as its foundational unit of account and a synthetic dollar. USDf enables users to unlock stable, on-chain liquidity from a wide array of crypto assets without needing to sell them. This allows participants to maintain exposure to their underlying holdings while accessing dollar-denominated value that can be staked, restaked, or used in broader DeFi applications within and beyond the Falcon platform. USDf functions as a stablecoin alternative with an overcollateralisation model that aims to ensure that every minted token is backed by collateral of equal or greater value. USDf contributes to the overall sustainability and scalability of the Falcon protocol by supporting liquidity mechanisms and peg stability efforts. The system allows arbitrage opportunities that help maintain USDf’s dollar parity across markets, while redemptions and minting processes are designed to uphold collateral integrity and user trust. As such, USDf is more than just a synthetic stablecoin, it is the linchpin of Falcon Finance’s architecture, enabling a seamless flow of value and financial utility throughout the platform. USDf Tokenomics USDf’s tokenomics are built around a model of overcollateralisation, which is intended to require that each unit of USDf is backed by assets exceeding its issued value. Users can mint USDf by depositing either stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) at a 1:1 ratio or non-stablecoin assets (e.g., BTC, ETH) with a risk-adjusted overcollateralisation ratio (OCR). These OCRs are dynamically calibrated based on factors such as asset volatility, liquidity, and market behavior. This approach mitigates systemic risk, enhances collateral security, and provides a buffer against market downturns. In the event of extreme price volatility, the protocol includes liquidation mechanisms to preserve the backing of USDf and uphold the integrity of the peg. How to buy USDf with crypto 1.

According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, over the last 30 days, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have scooped up an additional 83,105 BTC, while smaller retail wallets, with less than 0.1 BTC, have collectively shed 387 BTC in the same period. Whales Buy the Dip, Retail Sells the Rally Santiment analysts noted clear signs that smaller wallets were taking profits, likely out of fear of a market top, while whales and sharks were doubling down. This stark divergence, especially the large-scale accumulation, led the analysts to suggest that Bitcoin’s next push up may only be “a matter of time” and could see the asset breach the $110,000 level to usher in a new ATH. The prediction is based on growing macroeconomic optimism, after the flagship cryptocurrency soared to $105,800 on May 12 following news of de-escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. The two squabbling nations have agreed to cease tariff hostilities for 90 days, with the U.S. slashing taxes on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% and Beijing bringing down its levies on American-made goods from 125% to 10%. However, while the agreement spurred rallies in global equities and crypto, Santiment urged caution at the time, noting in an earlier post on X that the announcement may only outline a framework deal, not an executed agreement. The experts advised, “Avoid overextending until confirmations are made,” warning of a potential “buy the rumor, sell the news” pullback. Still, institutional confidence remains unshaken. Yesterday, Michael Saylor’s Strategy added 13,390 BTC to its books for $1.34 billion, averaging $99,856 for each. The purchase brings its total holding to 568,840 BTC, worth over $59 billion, translating to about $20 billion in unrealized profit. Not to be left behind, Metaplanet also announced a more modest $126.7 million acquisition of 1,271 BTC, at $102,119 each. The buy took the Tokyo-based company’s BTC reserves to 6,796, eclipsing El Salvador’s and pushing its BTC Yield for the year to 170%. Price Action Looking at the market, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is showing signs of consolidation after its recent spike. At the time of going to press, it was trading at $102,427, down about 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, although it’s up 8.5% on the week, it slightly underperformed compared to the broader crypto market, which gained 10.5% in that time. However, BTC has continued to shine across longer periods, up 21.2% for the month and 68.1% year-on-year, even though it remains 5.7% shy of its $108,786 ATH set earlier in the year.

Positioned as a “ticket to the DEX world” for CEX users, MoonX simplifies DeFi access and marks the beginning of BYDFi’s dual-engine strategy. CEX vs. DEX: From Competition to Integration With meme coins, airdrops, and early-stage tokens gaining traction, on-chain markets have become a high-growth arena for crypto users. But wallet setup, gas fees, and cross-chain operations remain hurdles for mainstream CEX users. At the same time, CEXs are increasingly limited in capturing early-stage or long-tail assets. The industry is clearly shifting: CEXs and DEXs are no longer separate silos—they are becoming complementary systems. MoonX is BYDFi’s answer to this evolution. MoonX: The Gateway to On-Chain Trading MoonX isn’t another exchange or wallet; it’s a lightweight entry point to Web3 trading. It retains the security and user familiarity of CEXs while unlocking the asset diversity and potential of DeFi. For Example: a user discovers a trending meme coin on social media and wants to copy a whale trade. Traditionally, that would involve switching wallets, acquiring gas, copying contract addresses, and navigating multiple DEX interfaces. With MoonX, there’s no wallet setup, no gas fees, no chain switching—just one BYDFi account and a single tap to execute. MoonX delivers a Web2-level user experience tailored for a Web3 world: Access to Over 500,000 Meme Coins Aggregates liquidity from multiple platforms like Pump.fun , Raydium, PancakeSwap, and more. Currently supports Solana and BNB Chain , with plans to expand to additional major blockchains. Built-In Trading Intelligence Integrates smart strategies and smart money copy trading . Millisecond-level execution, optimized for high-frequency Degen Traders. Security-First On-Chain Infrastructure Hybrid custody ensures users don’t manage private keys but still retain asset control. Co-built with Safeheron using MPC + TEE for institutional-grade protection. Integrated with GoPlus for real-time contract risk scanning and alerts. BYDFi: Entering the Dual-Engine Era MoonX is more than a product update—it’s the start of BYDFi’s CEX + DEX dual-engine architecture. Users can now manage centralized and on-chain assets within one unified account framework. By combining liquidity, strategy tools, and advanced security, MoonX goes beyond trend-chasing. It’s building a foundation for trading early-stage, long-tail assets with optimized on-chain efficiency. Michael, Co-Founder of BYDFi, stated: “MoonX is more than a new feature—it could shape a new standard: a scalable Web3 onboarding system that starts with a CEX front-end and runs on a DEX backend, designed for frictionless asset flow.” He added: “MoonX merges the best of both worlds—CEX performance and DEX freedom—so that anyone can participate in smart on-chain trading. Web3 shouldn’t be exclusive to experts. It should be a finance layer open to all.” About BYDFi Founded in 2020, BYDFi serves over 1,000,000 users across 190+ countries.

Dogecoin (DOGE) explodes off Bitcoin’s ascent over $100,000, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stokes demand with presale, raising $8,100,000 and releasing more than 458 million tokens to 9,800 holders. Both tokens – but different on purpose – indicate a possible flight toward $10 in 2025. Dogecoin borrows the weight of meme-driven momentum, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides structured DeFi utility. Why these two are outstanding is revealed in this article enticing investors to move in before prices increase. Dogecoin’s Meme-Fueled Surge Dogecoin (DOGE) is marching forward; it is stepping up to $0.2058 after a 13.38% 24-hour rally. With Bitcoin’s surge over $100,000, DOGE outruns BTC’s daily gains to propel this rise. Its market cap has ballooned 42% in a month, defying noise about Elon Musk’s exit out of Tesla. Analysts look at $0.30 as the next target, 57% increase since the current value. However, DOGE’s destiny depends on a market sentiment rather than the utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides. The volatility of DOGE is something that investors banking on DOGE need to be navigating, tied to hype instead of function. Yet, it suggests untapped potential when it breaks out. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale phase 4 at $0.025 enjoying its presale winning positions from the first stage ($0.01) and running much higher. Phase 4 is 70% full and the phase 5 is just the next as we will experience price hike of 20% to $0.03. Earlier Mutuum Finance (MUTM) buyers will be rewarded with 20% when the next stage opens. The tokenomics are locked at 140% at the $0.06 listing price, while analysts expect post-launch to skyrocket to $3 from where a 11,900% ROI is estimated. Having recently introduced a dashboard highlighting the top 50 holders, they have got people holding firm rewarded with bonus tokens. This creates urgency not only because phase 4’s low-price fades quickly. DeFi Innovation Drives Mutuum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not dream of quick gains. Its lending model allows users to deposit assets into liquidity pools which earn them a reward of mtTokens, which gain in value the more transactions they create. Lenders borrow using overcollateralized assets hence giving up stability. A buy and distribute system, uses revenue earned from MUTM token platform to purchase back and enhance demand rewarding stakers. The team is concluding a Certik smart contact audit with findings subsequently to be posted on socials that will raise investor trust. If Dogecoin is going for speculative rollercoasters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a platform for gradual growth thus a top bet for DeFi aficionados. Path to $10 Potential Dogecoin’s rally is optimistic, but its $10 dream requires a gargantuan sentiment change. In contrast, however, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the clearer path. Its presale momentum, DeFi utility, and tokenomics point the way to a $3 after the launch and $10 by 2025 with Tokenomics preponderance. The phase 4’s $0.025 price will not last and the 20% gain to $0.03 in phase 5 is soon. Investors who are looking for tokens below $0.5 with explosive potential should check Mutuum Finance (MUTM) out now. Take proactive action to join the presale before phase 4 closes.

Positioned as a “ticket to the DEX world” for CEX users, MoonX simplifies DeFi access and marks the beginning of BYDFi’s dual-engine strategy. CEX vs. DEX: From Competition to Integration With meme coins, airdrops, and early-stage tokens gaining traction, on-chain markets have become a high-growth arena for crypto users. But wallet setup, gas fees, and cross-chain operations remain hurdles for mainstream CEX users. At the same time, CEXs are increasingly limited in capturing early-stage or long-tail assets. The industry is clearly shifting: CEXs and DEXs are no longer separate silos—they are becoming complementary systems. MoonX is BYDFi’s answer to this evolution. MoonX: The Gateway to On-Chain Trading MoonX isn’t another exchange or wallet; it’s a lightweight entry point to Web3 trading. It retains the security and user familiarity of CEXs while unlocking the asset diversity and potential of DeFi. For Example: a user discovers a trending meme coin on social media and wants to copy a whale trade. Traditionally, that would involve switching wallets, acquiring gas, copying contract addresses, and navigating multiple DEX interfaces. With MoonX, there’s no wallet setup, no gas fees, no chain switching—just one BYDFi account and a single tap to execute. MoonX delivers a Web2-level user experience tailored for a Web3 world: Access to Over 500,000 Meme Coins Aggregates liquidity from multiple platforms like Pump.fun , Raydium, PancakeSwap, and more. Currently supports Solana and BNB Chain , with plans to expand to additional major blockchains. Built-In Trading Intelligence Integrates smart strategies and smart money copy trading . Millisecond-level execution, optimized for high-frequency Degen Traders. Security-First On-Chain Infrastructure Hybrid custody ensures users don’t manage private keys but still retain asset control. Co-built with Safeheron using MPC + TEE for institutional-grade protection. Integrated with GoPlus for real-time contract risk scanning and alerts. BYDFi: Entering the Dual-Engine Era MoonX is more than a product update—it’s the start of BYDFi’s CEX + DEX dual-engine architecture. Users can now manage centralized and on-chain assets within one unified account framework. By combining liquidity, strategy tools, and advanced security, MoonX goes beyond trend-chasing. It’s building a foundation for trading early-stage, long-tail assets with optimized on-chain efficiency. Michael, Co-Founder of BYDFi, stated: “MoonX is more than a new feature—it could shape a new standard: a scalable Web3 onboarding system that starts with a CEX front-end and runs on a DEX backend, designed for frictionless asset flow.” He added: “MoonX merges the best of both worlds—CEX performance and DEX freedom—so that anyone can participate in smart on-chain trading. Web3 shouldn’t be exclusive to experts. It should be a finance layer open to all.” About BYDFi Founded in 2020, BYDFi serves over 1,000,000 users across 190+ countries. Its product lineup includes spot , derivatives , copy trading , and now on-chain trading via MoonX . In 2023, BYDFi was recognized by Forbes as one of the Top 10 Global Crypto Exchanges. In 2025, it partnered with Ledger to launch a co-branded hardware wallet, reinforcing user self-custody and asset security. BYDFi is committed to providing a world-class crypto trading experience for users. BUIDL Your Dream Finance.

Speaking Tuesday at the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh, Fink said the pool of capital is parked in cash equivalents because investors are concerned about unstable conditions driven by trade disputes and the ballooning US trade deficit. “ There is €12 trillion just sitting in European bank accounts. In the US, $11 trillion is in money market funds ,” said Fink, whose firm is the world’s largest asset manager with more than $10 trillion in assets under management. “ When uncertainty takes over, people hoard cash. And that’s exactly what we’re seeing right now .” Fink made the remarks shortly after US President Donald Trump landed in Saudi Arabia for a four-day tour of the Gulf. The president is expected to visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to mend economic ties and security coordination with the Gulf nations, including developments in Gaza and tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear activities. US financial health leads to cash hoarding President Trump’s plans to renegotiate international trade deals have made global markets more volatile, but Fink noted that global investors are more focused on US assets. Yet, he admitted there’s a modest reallocation of investments toward regions like Europe, India, Japan, and increasingly, the Gulf. Fink told the delegates that markets are on a temporary lull, but in the eyes of investors, the risks are still pertinent. “ We’re entering another 90 days of uncertainty, ” he explained. The CEO reiterated that discussions around fiscal deficits in the US are “absent,” even as the nation’s debt levels continue to grow. “ US deficits are a problem. To overcome them, the economy needs to sustain 3% annual growth. What Trump is trying to do aligns with what Saudi Arabia is doing, boosting public-private investment ,” he reckoned. Fink also praised Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiative, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which could help the kingdom reduce its reliance on oil sales and attract foreign investment into non-energy sectors. “ Saudi Arabia is building a 21st-century economy, and that is commendable . The focus on infrastructure and innovation is drawing real attention, ” Fink lauded the Saudi government. Falling oil prices and rising fiscal demands have forced the government to scale back some of its more ambitious plans, including developments like NEOM, in favor of projects with commercial profitability and those that align with upcoming global sporting events. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of private equity giant Blackstone, also acknowledged some difficulties in implementing the Kingdom’s transformation plans, but asked leaders to be “patient.” “ You’re going to achieve a lot ,” Schwarzman continued, “ but like all bold visions, some elements won’t happen. That’s normal with change of this scale. Don’t get discouraged .” Markets react to US-China tariff truce The Riyadh event takes place against the backdrop of an easing in US-China trade tensions, which has provided some temporary relief to financial markets. In the agreement reached in Geneva over the weekend, the US announced it would reduce a previously combined 145% tariff on Chinese imports to 30%. In return, China agreed to cut its 125% duties on American products down to 10%. David Seif, chief developed markets economist at Nomura Holdings, said the rollback was “a far larger backtracking than expected.” He added that if negotiations fail to produce a full trade deal by August 10, markets could swing “very quickly in the other direction.” On Tuesday, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge,” dropped slightly more than three points to 18.53, its lowest intraday level in almost two months. The figure fell below the index’s long-term average of 20 just before the US markets opened yesterday.

According to a May 12 announcement , the integration stems from a partnership between Brave Browser and Cardano development firm Input Output. Together, the two firms “will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management.” Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT), said: “Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.” Eich explained that Brave focuses on maximizing user choice while providing tools to engage with decentralized ecosystems. With this integration, users of the Web3 browser and standalone wallet will gain direct access to Cardano’s blockchain without leaving the interfaces. Brave had not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment by publication. Related: Charles Hoskinson says he ‘knew nothing’ of ADA being selected for US reserve Brave browser keeps expanding Brave already supports the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. The announcement explicitly cites Midnight (NIGHT) as an ecosystem that would benefit from the support: “The partnership also sets the stage for future innovation around engagement with Cardano’s governance and Midnight, a blockchain developed by Shielded Technologies, an Input | Output spinout focused on confidential smart contracts and data protection.“ Midnight is a privacy-focused Cardano sidechain. Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson also recently suggested that the network could also enable free transactions for non-fungible token (NFT) ticket holders. Hoskinson explained that users would be given NFTs on sign-up, which would then give them the right to a certain number of transactions per day. This, he explained, would allow for use cases resembling those of the Web2 model: “Then all of a sudden you have the entire Web2 business model: you can have free accounts and free apps for people to use and they’re using crypto infrastructure but they don’t have to have a token.” Source: Mintern Related: Is Cardano (ADA) a “zombie crypto”? The first collaboration in a long-term partnership The announcement hints at more future developments sprouting from the newly formed partnership between Brave Browser and Input Output. The post notes that the collaboration “sets the stage for future innovation around engagement with Cardano’s governance and Midnight.” Eran Barak, the CEO of Midnight, told Cointelegraph in February that transparency, one of blockchain’s biggest selling points, also hinders widespread adoption and applications in fields like business and medicine. He explained that metadata allows individuals to be identified and tracked, hindering blockchain adoption. The development of Midnight follows the team behind the Cardano ecosystem announcing a software toolkit allowing developers to deploy custom-built sidechains in early 2023.

44566459,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159848,1747138850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Shareholder Proposal Faces Crucial Barrier at Dell: SEC Deems Corporate Treasury Decision Routine,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dell-bitcoin-shareholder-proposal/,"In the ever-evolving landscape where traditional corporate governance meets the disruptive force of digital assets, a recent decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has caught the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and corporate strategists. The core of the matter involves tech giant Dell Technologies and a shareholder proposal concerning the potential inclusion of Bitcoin in the company’s corporate treasury. This interaction highlights the ongoing debate about how public companies should approach volatile, non-traditional assets like cryptocurrencies and the power dynamics between company management and its shareholders. What Happened with Dell and the Shareholder Proposal? The specific news revolves around a shareholder proposal submitted to Dell Technologies. This proposal urged the company’s board to consider adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury reserves. The idea behind such proposals often stems from the belief that holding Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, or a way to signal innovation and attract investment from a new class of shareholders interested in digital assets. However, Dell sought to exclude this proposal from its proxy materials for the upcoming shareholder meeting. Represented by the law firm Hogan Lovells, Dell argued that the proposal fell under the category of ordinary business operations, specifically matters related to the company’s fundamental business decisions regarding its assets and investments. Under SEC rules (specifically Rule 14a-8), companies are generally allowed to exclude shareholder proposals that deal with matters relating to the company’s ordinary business operations because these are considered routine management decisions best left to the board and executives. The SEC’s Stance: A “No-Action” Letter The crucial development is the SEC’s response. The regulatory body issued a “no-action” letter to Dell . This means the SEC staff indicated they would not recommend enforcement action against Dell if the company proceeds to exclude the shareholder proposal from its proxy statement. The SEC’s reasoning, as conveyed in the letter, aligns with Dell’s argument: the proposal touches upon decisions related to the company’s fundamental business operations and asset management, which are considered routine management matters. It’s important to understand what a “no-action” letter signifies. It’s not a formal legal ruling on the merits of holding Bitcoin or the wisdom of the shareholder proposal itself. Instead, it’s an indication from the SEC staff that, based on the information provided, they won’t pursue enforcement action based on the exclusion of the proposal under the specific rule cited (the ordinary business exclusion). Why is Managing the Corporate Treasury Considered “Routine Management”? At its core, a company’s corporate treasury function is responsible for managing its financial assets, liquidity, and financial risks. This includes decisions about where to hold cash, what short-term or long-term investments to make, managing debt, and hedging currency or interest rate risks. These decisions require expertise in financial markets, risk assessment, and alignment with the company’s overall strategic goals and financial health. Here’s why these are typically considered routine management decisions: Expertise Required: Treasury management involves complex financial strategies and market knowledge that average shareholders may not possess. Flexibility Needed: Market conditions change rapidly. Management needs the flexibility to make timely decisions about asset allocation without needing a shareholder vote on every specific investment class. Alignment with Strategy: Treasury decisions must align with the company’s operational needs, capital expenditure plans, and overall financial strategy, which are responsibilities of the management team and board. Volume of Decisions: Companies make numerous financial decisions daily. Subjecting every specific investment choice to a shareholder proposal process would be impractical and burdensome. The SEC’s agreement with Dell’s argument reinforces the long-standing principle that while shareholders have a right to vote on significant matters (like mergers, board elections, or major policy changes), the day-to-day and strategic management of the company’s finances, including the specific assets held in its corporate treasury , falls under the purview of the elected board and appointed executives. What Does This SEC Decision Mean for Future Bitcoin Shareholder Proposals? This decision doesn’t necessarily shut the door entirely on shareholders influencing corporate crypto strategy, but it does highlight a significant hurdle. It suggests that simply proposing that a company *consider* or *hold* a specific asset like Bitcoin in its corporate treasury is likely to be viewed by the SEC staff as an ordinary business matter, making it excludable under Rule 14a-8. Potential implications include: Reinforcement of Management Control: The decision empowers management teams to resist shareholder pressure on specific asset allocation choices within the treasury. Higher Bar for Proposals: Shareholders interested in corporate crypto adoption may need to frame their proposals differently, perhaps focusing on broader policy issues like disclosure of crypto exposure, the development of a digital asset strategy framework, or linking executive compensation to digital asset innovation, rather than mandating specific treasury holdings. Focus on Dialogue: This outcome might push shareholders towards direct engagement and dialogue with company management and the board outside the formal shareholder proposal process to advocate for Bitcoin adoption or exploration. Consistency with Past Rulings: The SEC’s stance here is largely consistent with how it has treated other proposals seeking to dictate specific investment decisions or asset allocations within a company’s portfolio or treasury. Why Are Shareholders Pushing for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? (Benefits) The drive for companies to hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasury isn’t random. Proponents point to several potential benefits: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Often dubbed “digital gold,” Bitcoin is viewed as a potential long-term store of value, especially among younger demographics. Innovation Signal: Holding Bitcoin can signal that a company is forward-thinking and embracing technological innovation, potentially appealing to tech-savvy investors and customers. Balance Sheet Diversification: While volatile, Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional cash and financial instruments, which may yield low returns in a low-interest-rate environment. Potential Appreciation: The hope for significant price appreciation is a clear motivator, potentially boosting the company’s balance sheet. Attracting Talent & Investment: Being associated with the crypto space can make a company more attractive to talent and investors interested in the sector. What Makes Companies Hesitant? (Challenges) Despite the potential upsides, there are significant challenges and risks that make companies like Dell cautious about holding Bitcoin : Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. Large swings can significantly impact a company’s quarterly earnings report due to accounting rules (often requiring impairment charges when the price drops). Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally. Future regulations could impact custody, accounting, taxation, or even the legality of holding such assets. Accounting Complexities: Under current accounting standards (like US GAAP), Bitcoin is typically treated as an intangible asset. This requires specific accounting treatment, including potential impairment charges, which can introduce volatility to financial statements. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. This necessitates specialized expertise and infrastructure. ESG Concerns: The energy consumption associated with Bitcoin mining raises environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns for companies focused on sustainability. Lack of Expertise: Many traditional corporate treasury teams lack the expertise required to manage, secure, and account for digital assets like Bitcoin . Public Perception & Reputation: Associating the company with the volatile and sometimes controversial crypto market could impact its brand and reputation. Examples of Companies That Do Hold Bitcoin While Dell is choosing not to pursue this path based on the SEC’s allowance to exclude the proposal, it’s worth noting that some public companies have proactively added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which holds a significant amount of Bitcoin and has made it a core part of its corporate strategy. Other notable examples include Tesla (though they have bought and sold some) and Block (formerly Square), led by Jack Dorsey. These companies often cite reasons aligned with the potential benefits mentioned earlier, such as a hedge against inflation and a belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin as a digital asset. The Future of Corporate Treasury and Digital Assets The interaction between Dell , its shareholder proposal , and the SEC highlights that the question of incorporating digital assets into traditional finance is far from settled. While the SEC’s decision reinforces existing rules about the scope of shareholder proposal s, it doesn’t diminish the growing interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets as potential components of a diversified corporate treasury strategy. As the regulatory environment matures and institutional adoption of digital assets potentially increases, more companies may explore holding crypto. However, decisions will likely remain firmly within the domain of management and the board, carefully weighing the potential benefits against the significant risks and complexities involved. Actionable Insights for Shareholders and Companies For shareholders who believe in corporate Bitcoin adoption, this SEC decision means that direct mandates on specific asset holdings are difficult to push through via the shareholder proposal mechanism. Strategies might need to shift towards: Engaging directly with management and the board to educate and advocate. Focusing on proposals related to risk disclosure around digital assets or the development of a formal digital asset strategy. Investing in companies that have already publicly embraced Bitcoin or other digital assets. For companies, the takeaway is clear: be prepared for questions and potential proposals regarding digital assets. Having a well-defined stance and strategy (even if that strategy is to avoid holding crypto) for managing the corporate treasury in the context of evolving digital finance is becoming increasingly important. Conclusion: Routine Decision, Significant Debate The SEC’s decision to allow Dell to exclude the shareholder proposal on holding Bitcoin underscores the regulatory body’s view that specific asset allocation within a company’s corporate treasury falls under the umbrella of routine management decisions. While this may be disappointing for proponents of corporate crypto adoption via shareholder activism, it is consistent with established corporate governance principles. This event doesn’t represent a judgment from the SEC on Bitcoin itself, but rather on the procedural validity of the shareholder proposal under existing rules. The broader debate about whether, when, and how companies should incorporate Bitcoin and other digital assets into their financial strategies will undoubtedly continue, driven by market dynamics, evolving regulations, and the strategic choices of forward-thinking leadership teams.

At the time, Michael Saylor's firm had a market cap of nearly $2 billion and was looking to raise capital to buy bitcoin—something bulge bracket banks were reluctant to support. Jefferies took a chance on Saylor, marking a pivotal deal for the investment bank and the digital assets sector. Now, Saylor's firm is worth about $111 billion in market cap, other companies are buying bitcoin for their balance sheets, and large Wall Street firms are piling into the digital assets sector. And Jefferies? The firm is now a full-service investment bank for the crypto and blockchain space, and it's doing billions in deals without the crutch of a trillion-dollar balance sheet or FDIC-insured deposits. “We don’t change our stripes too often, but when we see opportunity, we move fast,” Alexander Yavorsky, head of FIG investment banking at Jefferies, told CoinDesk in an interview. The crypto commitment The game-changing MicroStrategy engagement in 2019 kickstarted a much deeper foray into the asset class for Jefferies. By 2020, Jefferies had become the first major full-service investment bank to dedicate a senior banker exclusively to crypto. Tim O’Shea, now co-head of digital assets coverage, spends 100% of his time on the asset class. But don't call them a crypto shop as Jefferies has been consistently doing deals across the board, putting the firm sixth globally in the last twelve months, according to data from Dealogic. Diving deeper into deals that Jefferies worked on, the firm revealed that it has advised on 120 transactions with over $150 billion of deal value across fintech, market structure, and exchanges since 2015. This track record, particularly handling deals that involve applied technology and complex regulatory footprints, uniquely equipped Jefferies to handle the hybrid world where crypto meets traditional finance. “We are a full-service investment banking firm, rather than a crypto shop,” Yavorsky said, ""but we’ve built deep sector knowledge, and we know how to structure deals and move quickly."" Over the past three years, Jefferies has steadily increased its involvement in crypto and crypto-adjacent dealmaking, building a track record across capital markets, M&A, and restructuring. One of the standout deals the firm advised was NinjaTrader on its $1.5 billion acquisition by Kraken , a notable example of consolidation between traditional trading platforms and digital asset exchanges. The Jefferies team brings the ""incredible expertise and talent required to advise on transactions of this size, they are incredibly dialed into the crypto and capital markets universes,"" Martin Franchi, CEO of NinjaTrader, told CoinDesk in an email statement. ""Understanding the needs of folks in the space were native to how they think and in our case, helped bring together the worlds of TradFi and DeFi for a highly strategic deal that benefits not only both firms, but also our customers,” Franchi added. Navigating complex world of crypto What really set Jefferies apart is that the investment bank didn't just stick to the usual deal-making advisory for the industry. With an industry as dynamic as crypto, the bank stayed nimble to take on a much more complex mandate. It played a key role in one of the industry's most high-profile collapses, serving as adviser to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the FTX bankruptcy , where it worked to help recover value for stakeholders. Meanwhile, the bank continued supporting traditional financial institutions that entered the crypto space. It advised J.C. Flowers on its investment in LMAX , and worked with Victory Park Capital on the SPAC merger with Bakkt. Beyond advisory roles, Jefferies has executed capital raises for major players like Galaxy Digital (GLXY) and DRW, and has been active in the crypto mining sector through multiple fundraising and advisory engagements. The firm has also provided strategic advice on a range of crypto exchange transactions, reflecting its broader involvement in infrastructure and market structure developments within digital assets. A growing influence Though not a crypto-exclusive investment bank, Jefferies’ activity in the sector points to a growing comfort with the complexities of digital asset finance, and a willingness to engage where traditional firms have often hesitated. With the lines between centralized and decentralized finance continuing to blur, and infrastructure firms increasingly in M&A crosshairs, Jefferies looks poised to remain one of the most active and experienced investment banks in the digital asset space.

A recent proposal asking the company to consider holding Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy was rejected. And now, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has supported Dell’s decision. So, what exactly happened, and why did Dell say no to Bitcoin? Shareholders want Dell to add Bitcoin Earlier this year, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a Washington-based think tank, asked Dell to think about using Bitcoin instead of cash and bonds, hoping it would work better during high inflation. They pointed to rising inflation, Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a hedge, and even BlackRock’s recommendation of a 2% BTC allocation as reasons to take the idea seriously. However, the group has made similar requests to other big names like Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft . They believe Bitcoin could help protect company money from inflation, just like MicroStrategy has done successfully. Dell Rejected the Idea – SEC Supports But Dell wasn’t convinced. The company sent a request to the SEC asking to leave this proposal out of its 2025 shareholder meeting. On May 8, in a letter , the SEC said Dell wasn’t doing anything wrong by skipping the proposal. Because this kind of decision, how a company handles its money, falls under “ordinary business operations.” In simple terms, the agency said it’s up to management, not shareholders, to decide what to do with the cash. Dell argued that forcing such a proposal could limit their flexibility and lead to poor decision-making on complex financial issues. What About Michael Dell’s Crypto Curiosity? Interestingly, some thought Dell might warm up to Bitcoin after CEO Michael Dell tweeted a meme of Cookie Monster devouring Bitcoin last year. He even commented on “scarcity creating value,” a phrase often used by Bitcoin believers. But for now, Dell’s made its position clear, it’s watching the market, but not making Bitcoin part of its treasury, at least not yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Reports suggest the company is setting its sights on a significant milestone: a U.S. stock market listing . This potential move signals a major step for the firm, known for its extensive Web3 investment activities and expansive crypto portfolio . Why a U.S. Stock Market Listing Matters for Animoca Brands According to a recent report by the Financial Times, Animoca Brands is actively exploring options for listing on a U.S. exchange. Executive Chairman Yat Siu hinted that an announcement could be forthcoming, indicating the company is evaluating various shareholding structures to facilitate this transition. But why the U.S.? A U.S. listing offers several compelling advantages for a global technology and investment firm like Animoca Brands: Access to Deeper Capital Pools: The U.S. market is renowned for its vast liquidity and access to a broad base of institutional and retail investors, potentially providing Animoca with greater access to capital for future growth and investments. Increased Global Visibility: Listing on a major U.S. exchange elevates a company’s profile on the international stage, enhancing brand recognition and credibility among partners, investors, and users worldwide. Benchmarking and Valuation: A U.S. listing provides a clear public valuation benchmark, which can be crucial for future fundraising rounds, acquisitions, and talent recruitment. Attracting U.S. Investors: Directly tapping into the significant U.S. investor base, many of whom are increasingly interested in the Web3 and blockchain sectors, could drive demand for Animoca’s shares. From Delisted to Dominant: Animoca’s Journey and Expanding Crypto Portfolio Animoca Brands’ potential U.S. listing marks a dramatic turn since its delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 2020. The delisting was primarily due to the ASX’s concerns around Animoca’s involvement in cryptocurrency activities at the time. Far from hindering its progress, this event appears to have catalyzed a period of explosive growth and strategic investment. Since 2020, Animoca has become a prolific investor across the Web3 ecosystem. Its expanding crypto portfolio is staggering in its breadth and value. The company has invested in over 540 companies, touching virtually every corner of the decentralized web. Key investments include stakes in some of the most prominent names in the industry: OpenSea: A leading NFT marketplace. Kraken: A major cryptocurrency exchange. ConsenSys: A prominent blockchain technology company behind MetaMask and other Ethereum infrastructure. Numerous other ventures spanning metaverse platforms, NFT projects, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and underlying blockchain infrastructure. This aggressive investment strategy has positioned Animoca Brands as a central player in the Web3 landscape, often seen as an index or barometer for the health and growth of the sector. The Scale of Animoca’s Web3 Investment and Digital Assets The financial scale of Animoca Brands’ operations underscores the significance of its potential listing. The company holds substantial assets, reflecting its deep immersion in the digital economy. Recent figures indicate the firm holds approximately $538 million in digital assets . This includes a diverse range of cryptocurrencies, tokens from portfolio companies, and valuable NFTs. Additionally, the company maintains a strong liquidity position with nearly $300 million in cash and stablecoins . This capital provides the fuel for continued investment and operational expansion. This combination of digital asset holdings and traditional cash reserves provides Animoca with both exposure to the upside of the crypto market and the stability needed to navigate its volatile nature. What Does This Mean for Blockchain Gaming? At its core, Animoca Brands is a pioneer in blockchain gaming . The company develops its own games, such as The Sandbox, and invests heavily in other game studios and platforms building on blockchain technology. A successful U.S. listing for Animoca could have significant implications for the broader blockchain gaming sector: It could provide a blueprint and encourage other Web3 gaming companies to explore traditional market listings. Increased capital could flow into Animoca’s own game development and further investments in the space. A higher public profile could attract more mainstream attention to the potential of play-to-earn and blockchain-integrated gaming models. Animoca’s success is closely tied to the growth of blockchain gaming, and its potential U.S. presence would undoubtedly shine a brighter spotlight on this evolving industry. Potential Challenges on the Path to a U.S. Listing While the prospects are exciting, a U.S. listing for a company with such extensive exposure to cryptocurrencies and digital assets is not without its challenges. The regulatory environment in the United States remains complex and evolving, particularly concerning digital assets. Regulatory Scrutiny: Animoca will face intense scrutiny from regulatory bodies like the SEC regarding its digital asset holdings, investment activities, and the classification of tokens associated with its ecosystem. Valuation Complexity: Valuing a company whose balance sheet includes significant amounts of volatile digital assets can be complex for traditional market analysts and investors. Market Understanding: Educating traditional investors about the nuances and potential of Web3, NFTs, and blockchain gaming will be crucial. Compliance Costs: Meeting the stringent reporting and compliance requirements of a major U.S. exchange will require significant resources and adjustments to operations. Navigating these hurdles will be key to Animoca Brands successfully completing its U.S. listing. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Web3 Investment Animoca Brands’ reported plans for a U.S. stock market listing represent a bold and strategic move. It underscores the company’s significant growth since its Australian delisting and highlights the increasing maturity and ambition of leaders in the Web3 space. With a massive and diverse crypto portfolio , substantial digital asset holdings, and a pioneering role in blockchain gaming , Animoca is poised to bring the world of decentralized innovation to one of the globe’s largest financial markets.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $103,800, while Ethereum ( ETH ) hovered above the key point at $2,520. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies was largely unchanged at $3.3 trillion. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed that annual inflation dropped slightly in April, while the monthly figure rose less than expected. The headline consumer price index data rose from minus 0.1% in March to 0.2% in April, bringing the annualized figure to 2.3%. These figures were lower than the median estimates of 0.3% and 2.4%, respectively.

El-Erian (@elerianm) May 13, 2025 These numbers will fuel Donald Trump’s call for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates , a move that will boost risky assets like Bitcoin and other altcoins. The data came a week after the Fed left interest rates unchanged, and warned that inflation will keep rising because of tariffs. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, hinted that the bank will wait and see to assess the impact of tariffs. Wall Street analysts have reduced their interest rate cut odds. In an X post on Monday, Jim Bianco, a popular economist, noted that the odds of a June cut fell to 8%. July odds have fallen to 35%, and September odds moved from 100% earlier this month to 66%. Rate cuts continue to disappear. * June 18 (red) now 8% (92% no move) * July 30 (green) now 35% (65% no move) No cut is priced until September 17. And even that cut (blue) is disappearing.

Polymarket odds of a rate cut in July rose to 27% on Tuesday from Monday’s 20%. Bitcoin and altcoins do well when the Fed is either cutting rates or when it is hinting at a future cut. A good example of this is what happened during the pandemic when the Fed slashed rates to nearly zero. Crypto assets also jumped in 2023 when the FEd hinted at cuts as post-pandemic inflation data started to cool.

XRP futures open interest has increased from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion over the course of the past week. This 41.6% surge coincides with a steady rise in overall XRP derivatives open interest , which is near 1-month highs. Moreover, as the increase has coincided with a price rally from $2.14 to $2.48, the development signals growing bullish directional conviction, as highlighted by crypto analytics platform Glassnode in a May 13 X post . XRP futures open interest 1-month chart. Source: Glassnode XRP price analysis XRP’s rally has extended beyond the timeframe highlighted by the analytics platform. By press time on May 13, the cryptocurrency was trading at $2.54, having marked a 3.15% gain on the daily chart. Year-to-date (YTD) gains currently stand at 22.38%. The token added nearly $7 billion to its market capitalization since the start of the week, defying a cryptocurrency market-wide pullback. XRP price 1-day and year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold On May 8, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a settlement letter, marking a huge milestone in the longstanding Ripple v. SEC case . While the legal minutiae will still take a while to be fully resolved, XRP has added nearly $100 billion to its market cap since the legal tide began turning in Ripple Labs’ favor, indicating a strong degree of institutional interest. With that being said, not all of the signals currently at play are positive. XRP exchange reserves are near a 1-month high — which often coincides with increased selling pressure. Whales have also transferred large amounts of the token to exchanges, and are potentially preparing to dump large holdings . However, none of the recent bearish developments has proven enough to overturn or even slow down XRP’s bull run. Provided that the current rally lasts, or, at worst, establishes new support zones at higher levels, an overall uptrend could be sustained in the longer term, particularly as the SEC’s decision regarding spot XRP exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), which could ignite another move to the upside, is due in June .

That could set in motion an ‘XRP explosion.’ Even if many are considering investing in XRP, experts suggest keeping an eye on Rexas Finance (RXS) and Cardano (ADA), as they might be fierce competitors in 2025. XRP’s Optimistic Predictions: A Market-Transforming Spike With the surge in the popularity of exchange-traded funds, XRP is predicted to benefit the most. Crypto expert Zach Rector believes XRP will hit around ten dollars, mainly due to his belief that the XRP ETF would guarantee institutional capital, albeit with very pessimistic estimates. He revisited his assumptions after contemplating the benefits the potentialized approval would yield. He thought that during the first year, XRP ETFs would get four to eight billion dollars worth of institutional capital, which could inflate the XRP market valuation tremendously—something it indeed needs. The rector’s research suggests that XRP is exceptionally responsive to capital inflows. He recalls the incident where XRP’s market cap increased by $7.74 billion in eight hours on April 12, 2025, propelled by a mere $12.87 million capital influx. Given the right circumstances, this is a perfect example of how XRP’s price could be appreciated, confirming a $10 price target. Cardano (ADA): The Up-and-Coming Challenger? As diaspora strife dominates the news, Cardano (ADA) quietly asserts itself as an invincible player in the crypto markets. Analysts like Alex Becker have pegged Cardano as a cryptocurrency primed for immense growth, projecting ADA could reach $4 or $5 by 2025. This marks an incredible rise of over 500% to 800% from its value of $0.06441. ADA might have had some challenges, but it has consistently progressed. Cardano recorded a 12% surge over the past week and an 11.4% increase in trading volume, bolstering investor confidence. The price of ADA is being catalyzed by its adoption, new strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing its scalability and interoperability systems. Furthermore, ADA’s proficiency in handling dApps and smart contracts makes it a strong long-term contender. In the wave of crypto adoption, Cardano is probably about to face the same surge that Solana experienced when it rocketed from a low price of $100. Rexas Finance (RXS): Different From Other Altcoins But the most notable altcoin of 2025 might be Rexas Finance (RXS). In its presale phase, Rexas Finance is uniquely positioned to surpass XRP and ADA in valuation due to its tokenized decentralized finance system. Analysts predict Rexas Finance will launch at the end of June 2025, which means it could grow to 10x or more by the year’s end. Other predictions even put its market cap in the range of millions, if not billions. Rexas Finance’s most appealing feature is its launchpad, which helps new projects raise capital with token offerings. This feature and the AI-powered token-building platform highlight Rexas Finance’s user-friendly technology, setting it apart from its competitors. These features combined make Rexas Finance an ideal long-term investment in 2025. The Prospects of These Altcoins Each of XRP, Cardano, and Rexas Finance has significant potential in widely varying aspects of the crypto market. As for XRP, the expected inflow of institutional money through ETFs could help realize the $10 price goal. Through Cardano’s flourishing ecosystem and Rexas Finance’s technology, these alts could also achieve jolting growth in 2025, perhaps even outpacing XRP in returns. Investors looking to position themselves ahead of the next bull run strategically stand to benefit the most from these coins by using their uniquely different opportunities. Although This would yield a considerable boom for risk-taking early investors. Researching and gauging the risks involved in any crypto transaction is essential. 2025 may be the year these altcoins finalize their preparations behind the curtains and take the spotlight to register outstanding profits.

Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation.

Over the past 24 hours, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped 3.3%, currently standing at $3.44 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $165 billion, back to the levels we typically see. Unlike last two days when all top 10 coins were green, only one saw its price increase today. XRP is up 4.9% to the price of $2.55. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw the highest loss: 8.9% to $0.2273. Most other coins are down between 2% and 3%. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) is down 0.9%, the smallest decrease on the list, currently trading at $103,465, while Ethereum (ETH) , fell 2.6%, now changing hands at $2,484. When it comes to the top 100 coins per market cap, only five coins are green and only two among these recorded increases above 0.5%. The first is the above-mentioned XRP, making it the day’s best performer in this category as well. The other one is LEO Token (LEO) , which rose by 1.2% to $8.59. On the other hand, two coins saw double-digit drops. Pi Network (PI) , yesterday’s best performer, fell 27.3% to $1.12. Shiba Inu (SHIB) decreased by 10.1%, now trading at $0.00001564. BTC Has a 40% Chance of Hitting $105,000 by May 30 This week’s moves show a growing optimism in the market, with BTC and ETH looking ready for further price action, according to Nick Forster, Founder of decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz . In an email shared with Cryptonews , Forster commented that the market has seen significant price movements, with the major coins seeing “impressive gains.” Additionally, volatility has been on the rise. Traders on Derive.xyz are positioning for heightened volatility as well, the founder says. 46.7% of all BTC premiums are calls bought, and 37.7% are puts over the previous 24 hours. Also, 42.2% of ETH premiums are calls bought, and 30.6% are puts. This indicates “mixed market sentiment but betting on significant price moves.” Furthermore, the platform finds that there is now a 40% chance for BTC to surpass $105,000 by May 30, up from 16% last week. Also, there is a 20% chance that BTC hits $110,000 by the end of May, up from 7%. As for ETH, it now has a 9% chance of hitting above $3,000 by the end of the month, up from 0.5% last week. There’s also a 17% chance it will hit $2,800 by May’s end, up from 1%. The bullish sentiment seems to be fueled by several key developments. “The China/US trade deal announced by the White House has signaled a potential cooling in the trade war, providing a boost to the market,” Forster says. Furthermore, “ ETH’s Pectra upgrade successfully launched, aiming to improve user experience and attract institutional interest, which is likely contributing to ETH’s price surge. And Coinbase was added to the S&P 500. This milestone highlights the growing mainstream adoption of digital assets, signaling increased confidence in the sector.” MultiBank Group to Tokenize $3BN in Real Estate Assets with MAG MultiBank Group , a financial derivatives institution, has signed a $3 billion tokenization agreement with MAG , a UAE-based real estate developer, and Mavryk , a blockchain team. It also announced the upcoming launch of MBG , the utility token that will power MultiBank’s digital finance ecosystem.

44568655,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159867,1747143007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Exciting News: Crypto.com Pay Launches in South Korea, Revolutionizing Crypto Payments",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-payments-south-korea/,"Get ready, South Korea! The world of digital finance just took a significant leap forward in the Land of the Morning Calm. Leading cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com has officially announced the launch of its innovative payment solution, Crypto.com Pay , for users and merchants across South Korea. This isn’t just another app update; it’s a move poised to integrate cryptocurrencies more seamlessly into the daily economic lives of one of the world’s most tech-savvy nations. For anyone interested in the burgeoning South Korea crypto market, this development signals a powerful step towards mainstream adoption. What Exactly is Crypto.com Pay and Why South Korea? Before diving into the specifics of the South Korean launch, let’s understand what Crypto.com Pay is all about. At its core, it’s a flexible payment gateway that allows consumers to pay with crypto for goods and services online and in-store (where applicable), and enables merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments easily. Think of it as a bridge between the traditional fiat world and the digital asset space, making transactions faster, potentially cheaper, and more secure than some legacy systems. Here’s a quick breakdown of its key features: Multiple Cryptocurrency Support: Users can typically pay with a variety of popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cronos (CRO), and stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Ease of Use: Designed for simplicity, allowing payments via scanning a QR code or clicking a payment link. Merchant Benefits: Merchants can receive payments in crypto or instantly convert them to fiat currency (like Korean Won) to mitigate volatility risks. They often benefit from lower processing fees compared to traditional credit card networks and reduced chargebacks. User Rewards: Often offers cashback or discounts when paying with certain cryptocurrencies, particularly CRO. Now, why is South Korea such a significant market for this launch? South Korea boasts one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency adoption and trading globally. Its population is highly connected, digitally literate, and quick to embrace new technologies, especially in finance and payments. The e-commerce market is massive, and there’s a strong cultural interest in digital assets. Introducing a seamless way to use crypto for everyday purchases in such an environment holds immense potential for driving real-world utility and adoption. Revolutionizing Crypto Payments South Korea: Benefits for Users The arrival of Crypto.com Pay in South Korea opens up exciting possibilities for everyday consumers holding cryptocurrencies. No longer are digital assets solely confined to trading or long-term investment. Now, they can become a practical medium of exchange for purchasing goods and services from participating merchants. This is a significant step towards integrating crypto into the fabric of daily life. Consider the benefits for South Korean users: Spending Power: Instantly unlock the value of your crypto holdings for purchases without needing to first convert to fiat on an exchange and then transfer to a bank account – a process that can be cumbersome and incur fees. Potential Savings: As mentioned, paying with specific cryptocurrencies, particularly CRO, can often come with attractive rewards or discounts, offering a tangible financial incentive to pay with crypto . Convenience: The payment process is designed to be quick and straightforward, similar to scanning a QR code with popular mobile payment apps already common in South Korea. Access to Global Merchants (Potentially): While the initial focus is likely on South Korean businesses, Crypto.com Pay’s global nature could eventually connect South Korean users to international merchants who also accept the service. Imagine being able to use a portion of your Bitcoin gains to buy your morning coffee or use your stablecoins to pay for online shopping – this is the future that crypto payments South Korea with Crypto.com Pay aims to facilitate. It empowers users by giving them more options and control over how they spend their digital assets. Empowering Businesses: How Crypto.com South Korea Benefits Merchants The launch isn’t just great news for consumers; it presents a compelling opportunity for businesses operating within Crypto.com South Korea . By integrating Crypto.com Pay , merchants can tap into a growing demographic of cryptocurrency holders and potentially improve their payment processing efficiency. Here’s how South Korean merchants stand to benefit: Access to a New Customer Base: Attract crypto-savvy customers who are actively looking for ways to spend their digital assets. This can open up a new revenue stream and differentiate the business. Lower Transaction Fees: Compared to the fees charged by credit card companies (which can range from 1% to 3% or more per transaction), crypto payment processing fees are often significantly lower, directly impacting the merchant’s bottom line. Faster Settlement: While traditional card payments can take days to settle, crypto transactions are often confirmed much faster. Merchants can choose to receive payment instantly in fiat (Korean Won) to avoid volatility, or hold the crypto if they prefer. Reduced Chargeback Risk: Cryptocurrency transactions are generally irreversible, significantly reducing the risk of chargebacks, which can be a major headache and cost for businesses accepting credit cards. Global Reach: For online merchants, accepting crypto can potentially open up their business to international customers who prefer or need to pay with crypto . Integrating Crypto.com Pay can be relatively simple for merchants, with various options available, including e-commerce platform plugins (like Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.), payment buttons, and API integrations for custom setups. This ease of integration makes it accessible for businesses of all sizes looking to participate in the future of payments within the South Korea crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Considerations for Crypto.com Pay in South Korea While the launch of Crypto.com Pay in South Korea is undeniably a positive step for adoption, it’s important to acknowledge the existing landscape and potential hurdles. The South Korea crypto market, while active, is also subject to stringent regulations. Some considerations include: Regulatory Compliance: Crypto.com, like any financial service provider dealing with digital assets in South Korea, must adhere to local regulations, including KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. The regulatory environment can also evolve, requiring ongoing adaptation. User Adoption & Education: While many South Koreans are familiar with trading crypto, using it for payments is a different behavior. Educating users and merchants on how to use Crypto.com Pay , its benefits, and managing associated risks (like sending to the wrong address) is crucial for widespread adoption. Volatility Concerns: Although merchants can opt for instant fiat conversion, users paying with volatile assets like BTC or ETH need to be aware that the fiat value of their payment asset can change rapidly before the transaction is completed. Merchant Integration Rate: The success of crypto payments South Korea via Crypto.com Pay depends heavily on how many merchants adopt the service. Building a robust network of accepting businesses takes time and effort. Competition: While Crypto.com is a major player, other crypto payment solutions or even traditional fintech innovations could compete in the South Korean market. Addressing these challenges will be key to the long-term success of Crypto.com South Korea and its payment service. It requires not just technical infrastructure but also strong partnerships, clear communication, and ongoing support for both users and businesses.

TORONTO, May 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Consensus 2025 — Today marks the official launch of the Midnight Foundation, an organization committed to supporting the growth of the Midnight blockchain ecosystem. Midnight is a platform enabling decentralized applications that deliver rational privacy – programmable data protection with selective disclosure. The Foundation’s core mission is to foster a thriving developer community, expand access to Midnight’s privacy-first technology, and guide the network’s evolution toward full decentralization. Through a wide range of initiatives—including open-source tooling, education, and targeted funding—the Foundation will support builders developing real-world use cases using Midnight. Crucially, the Foundation will also play a leading role in Midnight’s path to autonomous governance. As the network matures, control over protocol upgrades, treasury allocation, and ecosystem development will transition to NIGHT token holders through on-chain voting. The Foundation will ensure this transition is secure, transparent, and community-driven. These efforts will be key to empowering the Foundation to redefine what Web3 infrastructure can become: private, compliant, decentralized—and ready for real-world adoption. The Midnight Foundation will be led by Fahmi Syed who has been appointed as President. A recognized leader in decentralized governance and digital innovation, Syed brings over two decades of experience in financial strategy, operational leadership, and decentralized technology to the role. Most recently, he supported the development of the Midnight project at IO. Prior to that, he was CFO at Parity Technologies, the team behind Polkadot and Kusama, where he led financial operations during a period of rapid ecosystem expansion. Earlier in his career, Syed was Chief Operating Officer at FIFTHDELTA, Europe’s largest hedge fund launch of 2021. He also held senior leadership roles at Marshall Wace, where he contributed to the firm’s global growth to $45 billion in assets under management. The core development of the Midnight network itself was led by Shielded Technologies, an engineering spinout from IO, the creators of innovations such as Cardano. Shielded Technologies was founded to pioneer privacy-first, regulation-ready decentralized technologies, and continues to play an integral role in supporting Midnight’s technical innovation and ecosystem growth. Commenting on his appointment, Syed said: “The Midnight Foundation has an extraordinary opportunity to shape the future of decentralized technology in a way that truly protects users’ rights and privacy. I’m honored to lead this mission at such a critical time. Working alongside Shielded Technologies and its visionary CEO, Eran Barak, we are committed to building a thriving, global ecosystem that brings Midnight’s transformative technology to life for developers, businesses, and communities everywhere.” A new kind of blockchain network, Midnight is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional blockchains that expose all transaction data by default. It uses zero-knowledge cryptography and a cooperative tokenomics design to enable truly private, censorship-resistant, and regulation-ready applications. Its public utility token, NIGHT, enables governance and rewards, while its shielded resource, DUST, powers transactions without exposing metadata or wallet details. Unlike typical blockchain fee models, DUST is renewable, non-transferable, and decays over time – a radical new model that makes the network sustainable, privacy-protecting, and secure from economic exploitation. Moving forward, the Midnight Foundation will look to build a wide ecosystem of partners, builders and token holders, working together to realize the potential of the Midnight blockchain network. We invite you to join us on this journey.

Most of the liquidations were on long positions, according to CoinGlass , with $582 million in leveraged longs flushed out amid a rapid downturn. Bitcoin fell to $103,553.47 , while Ethereum slipped 0.80% to $2,531.82 and Solana declined 1% to $174.56. The scale and speed of the correction point to a broader shift in sentiment, particularly among large investors who are now rebalancing portfolios with caution. The drop follows an overheated rally last week that saw Bitcoin surge past $100,000 and Ethereum spike 40% to $2,500. The crypto Fear & Greed Index touched 70, signalling strong investor exuberance. But with key assets now retracing, whales are beginning to shift strategies—moving from profit-taking on earlier long bets to opening shorts and adjusting for possible further downside. Whales exit longs, flip bearish Lookonchain revealed that multiple high-value wallets closed long positions and repositioned for a bearish scenario. One whale locked in $7.5 million in gains by closing 17,702 ETH (valued at $14.8 million) and 9.83 million XRP (worth $24.2 million).

Some whales shifted completely to short positions. An address tagged “ Hyperliquid 50x Address ” reversed a short on the same day and captured $1.18 million in profits before immediately closing out. Another whale then deposited 10 million USDC to boost short exposure on BTC, ETH, and SOL, with trades totalling $14.8 million (BTC), $13.3 million (ETH), and $2.5 million (SOL). These positions reflect a widespread expectation among whales of a continued short-term dip. Rally fades, caution returns The abrupt correction follows a week of exuberant buying as crypto assets broke multi-month highs. Market sentiment had been skewed by the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin and Ethereum, prompting retail traders to pile into long positions. However, the resulting liquidation wave underscored how quickly sentiment can shift in the crypto space. Though the selloff appears to be technical, driven by over-leveraged positions and elevated greed levels, it has reintroduced short-term uncertainty. The moves by whales suggest a more conservative stance as volatility returns to the market. Analysts see long-term support Despite the short-term selloff, some analysts continue to believe that crypto remains on a broader upward trajectory.

Last month marked a significant increase in Virtual’s price after three months of broad correction. Charting over 300% gains in three weeks, it eventually lost steam after failing to overcome $1.9 earlier this month. It initiated a sell and pulled back in the second week of this month. Locating support above $1.27, it bounced back and increased to $2.1 last Friday. Since then, the price has remained stuck due to low volatility, and as we can see, it has currently floated at around $2 over the past few days. A strong daily close above yesterday’s high should set the stage for bigger growth to the top before breaking out to a new high. The reverse would be the case if this small, calm phase turns to distribution. This may trigger a serious rollback to the bottom while the supply level increases. In terms of gain, Virtual remains the leader of the market on the monthly scale as per CoinMarketCap metrics. It is up 251% despite the current drop in the crypto space. A continuous increase could put the asset on a major parabolic move on the short-term scale. Virtual’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While deciding the next major move at $2, the potential resistance level for a test is $2.65. The next resistance level to watch is $4.13. Crossing over the $5.25 resistance should fuel a big move to a new high. The close level to considered for a pullback is $1.5, although there’s a close support at $1.23.

Recent developments in Arizona have put the spotlight on the intersection of state policy and digital assets, as the governor took decisive action regarding several key Arizona crypto bills . What Happened with the Arizona Crypto Bills ? On May 12, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed two significant pieces of legislation that aimed to expand the state’s engagement with digital assets. These vetoes followed an earlier rejection of another crypto-related bill, signaling a cautious approach from the governor’s office towards the rapid integration of cryptocurrencies into state operations and finances. The two bills vetoed on May 12 were: SB 1373: This bill proposed the creation of a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund. The idea was for the state to have a designated place to hold digital assets acquired through means such as law enforcement seizures or legislative appropriations. This would have established a formal mechanism within the state treasury for managing seized or state-owned crypto. SB 1024: This bill sought to enable state agencies to accept payments for fines, taxes, and fees using cryptocurrency. The mechanism would have involved approved third-party providers facilitating the conversion of crypto payments into U.S. dollars before they reached the state’s coffers. This aimed to offer residents and businesses more payment flexibility. These vetoes came after Governor Hobbs had previously vetoed SB 1025 , a bill that would have allowed the state treasury and state retirement systems to invest up to 10% of their funds in Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets. Taken together, these actions highlight a clear stance from the governor regarding the state’s direct involvement with digital currencies at this time. Understanding State Crypto Regulation Attempts Arizona isn’t alone in exploring how to incorporate digital assets into state frameworks. Across the United States, state governments are grappling with the opportunities and challenges presented by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Efforts range from establishing regulatory clarity and consumer protection laws to exploring the use of blockchain for government records or enabling crypto payments for state services. States are motivated by various factors: Innovation and Economic Growth: Attracting crypto and blockchain businesses by creating a favorable legal and regulatory environment. Efficiency: Using blockchain for streamlined processes, supply chain management, or digital identity. Revenue & Treasury Management: Accepting crypto payments or exploring investment opportunities. Asset Management: Handling seized digital assets effectively, as proposed by Arizona’s SB 1373. However, these efforts are often met with significant hurdles, including: Regulatory uncertainty at the federal level. Volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Security risks associated with digital assets. Lack of technical expertise within state agencies. Concerns about illicit use of cryptocurrencies. The vetoes in Arizona underscore the cautious approach many policymakers are taking when balancing the potential benefits with these inherent risks. The governor’s decision suggests that, for now, the perceived risks of direct state exposure to volatile digital assets or the complexities of managing them outweigh the potential advantages these bills offered. What Does This Mean for Arizona Digital Assets and Businesses? The veto of these bills has immediate implications for the landscape of Arizona digital assets and the businesses operating within the state. While Arizona has been considered relatively friendly to blockchain technology in the past, these vetoes represent a pause, if not a step back, for certain types of state-level crypto adoption. For residents and businesses, the possibility of paying taxes or fees directly with crypto via state-approved providers, as proposed in SB 1024, is now off the table for the foreseeable future under the current administration. This means traditional payment methods remain the standard for state transactions. For the state itself, the veto of SB 1373 means there is no dedicated ‘Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund’ yet. The state will need to rely on existing legal frameworks and procedures for handling any digital assets it may acquire through seizures or other means, which may not be specifically tailored for the nuances of crypto. The rejection of SB 1025, the investment bill, indicates that state and retirement funds will not be directly exposed to the volatility of Bitcoin or other digital asset markets based on this legislative push. This aligns with a more conservative investment strategy for public funds, prioritizing stability over potential high growth associated with nascent asset classes. Why Did the Governor Veto Crypto Bills? Potential Reasons While the governor’s explicit, detailed reasons for each veto are typically outlined in official veto letters, common concerns cited by policymakers when rejecting crypto-related legislation include: Market Volatility: The price swings of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a major concern for managing public funds or accepting payments where value needs to be stable. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of a clear and comprehensive federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies makes states hesitant to move too far ahead, fearing potential conflicts or the need for constant adjustments. Security Risks: Concerns about cybersecurity, hacking, and the secure storage of digital assets are paramount when state funds or sensitive payment systems are involved. Consumer Protection: Ensuring adequate safeguards are in place for individuals and businesses interacting with the state using crypto. Complexity and Implementation Challenges: Setting up the necessary infrastructure, training staff, and ensuring compliance for handling digital assets can be complex and costly. Illicit Activity Concerns: Worries that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering or other illegal activities, and ensuring the state does not inadvertently facilitate this. Given the nature of the vetoed bills – establishing a state fund for digital assets (SB 1373), accepting crypto payments (SB 1024), and investing state funds in crypto (SB 1025) – it is likely that concerns related to volatility, security, and regulatory clarity played a significant role in the governor’s decision to governor veto crypto initiatives. Comparing Arizona’s Approach to Other States Arizona’s cautious stance, highlighted by these vetoes, contrasts with some other states that have taken more aggressive steps in embracing crypto and blockchain. For example: Wyoming: Often cited as a leader, Wyoming has passed numerous laws providing regulatory clarity for digital assets, including defining different categories of tokens and establishing special purpose depository institutions for digital asset businesses. Colorado: Has moved forward with accepting cryptocurrency for state tax payments, though often through third-party services that immediately convert the crypto to fiat currency, limiting the state’s direct exposure to volatility. Texas: Has seen legislative efforts to clarify the legal status of digital assets and attract crypto miners and businesses. Arizona’s recent vetoes suggest it is adopting a more conservative ‘wait and see’ approach compared to states actively positioning themselves as crypto hubs through specific legislation. This doesn’t mean Arizona is against blockchain technology entirely, but rather that direct state financial involvement with volatile assets is being approached with significant caution. The Future of Arizona Crypto Law and Policy Despite the recent vetoes, the conversation around Arizona crypto law is far from over. The fact that these bills made it through the legislature indicates there is significant interest among lawmakers in exploring the potential of digital assets. Future legislative sessions may see revised versions of these bills introduced, potentially addressing the concerns raised by the governor’s office. This could involve: Adding stricter safeguards and security requirements. Proposing pilot programs rather than immediate statewide implementation. Waiting for greater clarity from federal regulators. Focusing on less volatile applications of blockchain technology rather than direct crypto exposure. The path forward for Arizona digital assets in state operations will likely depend on evolving market conditions, technological advancements, federal regulatory developments, and continued dialogue between the legislature and the governor’s office. Key Takeaways from the Arizona Vetoes The veto of these Arizona crypto bills offers several important insights: Caution Prevails: State governments remain cautious about directly handling or investing in volatile cryptocurrencies, prioritizing financial stability and security. Implementation Challenges are Real: Beyond the concept, the practicalities of securely accepting, managing, and accounting for digital assets within state systems are significant hurdles. Regulatory Clarity is Needed: States are often looking to the federal government for clearer guidelines before fully committing to widespread crypto adoption in state functions. Not a Full Stop: While these specific initiatives were blocked, the legislative interest in digital assets in Arizona is likely to continue, potentially leading to future, more refined proposals. For the crypto industry, this highlights the ongoing need for education and engagement with policymakers at all levels of government to address concerns and demonstrate the responsible potential of digital assets. In Conclusion: A Setback, Not a Halt Governor Hobbs’s decision to veto the recent Arizona crypto bills represents a significant setback for proponents of rapid state-level digital asset adoption in Arizona. The proposed initiatives, ranging from establishing a strategic reserve for seized crypto to allowing crypto payments for state services and investing state funds, aimed to position Arizona at the forefront of integrating digital assets into government functions. However, the vetoes underscore the inherent caution surrounding cryptocurrencies among some policymakers, driven by concerns over volatility, security, regulatory uncertainty, and implementation complexity. While other states have pursued more aggressive paths, Arizona appears to be taking a more measured approach, at least for now. The vetoes do not signal an end to discussions about Arizona crypto law or the potential use of Arizona digital assets in the future. They are, however, a clear indication that significant hurdles remain for the direct financial integration of volatile cryptocurrencies into state operations. The future of state-level crypto adoption will likely involve ongoing legislative efforts, technological advancements, and crucial dialogue addressing the legitimate concerns of policymakers.

Bitcoin ETFs Record Inflows for Fourth Day in a Row, Ethereum Funds See Outflows In stark contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs faced sustained selling pressure and recorded a total net outflow of $17.59 million. Notably, none of the nine Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow during the session, highlighting waning investor demand despite recent optimism surrounding Ethereum’s ecosystem upgrades. Differential Sentiment Between BTC and ETH The difference in fund flows underscores a growing divergence in investor sentiment between the two leading cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest, likely driven by macroeconomic tailwinds and its perceived status as a digital store of value, Ethereum appears to be facing near-term headwinds despite the successful rollout of its recent Pectra upgrade. Analysts note that this disparity could be due to volatility concerns, regulatory uncertainty, or capital rotation dynamics as Bitcoin continues to dominate the market’s risk-on environment. As Bitcoin ETFs continue their streak of inflows and Ethereum funds experience steady outflows, asset managers and market participants are closely watching to see if this trend signals a broader shift in allocation strategies or a temporary dislocation amid improving macroeconomic conditions. *This is not investment advice.

On the blockchain’s public ledger, every action is recorded and accessible to anyone who wants to view and analyze transactions in real time. This creates a new era of openness in trading and investing, where users can easily track the moves of prominent investors, crypto whales, and smart money. As new tools proliferate Web3, especially those with real-time AI-driven capabilities, traders will increasingly use this visibility to fine-tune their investment strategies and discover promising market entry and exit opportunities by following the big money. What are Crypto Whales? Crypto whales are individuals or organizations that possess immense cryptocurrency holdings. Although there’s no strict definition for what qualifies as a “whale,” they typically control a substantial share of any given asset’s total supply. These entities are usually either extremely early adapters, or experienced market players with a track record of successful and profitable trades. It’s crucial to understand that not all crypto whales are the same. Some may hold large amounts of crypto but have a history of poor performance or low returns. Others might be wallets belonging to cryptocurrency exchanges that manage assets on behalf of users. Monitoring these types of wallets may not provide meaningful insights for retail traders with smaller portfolios. Why is it Important to Track Crypto Whales? As a crypto investor, identifying your next winning trade can be tricky, but it may be worthwhile to monitor the activities of crypto whales. These large holders often signal upcoming market trends with proven trading strategies, some of them might even be project insiders. If multiple well-known whales begin investing in a particular project, it often signals growing market excitement and potential for strong performance. Whales can sometimes use their substantial holdings to significantly influence market movements, especially for projects with lower market capitalization. Many savvy investors keep an eye on whale activity, believing these players have advanced insights or access to valuable information. When whales act, their moves often spark a chain reaction as a large number of their followers begin to mirror their trades. Being early to identify these shifts can be the difference between making a profit and loss for certain trades. How Does Crypto Wallet Tracking Work? Crypto wallet tracking involves monitoring the balances, transaction history, and overall activity of blockchain wallets. Since blockchain data is publicly available, any wallet address can be tracked. However, efficient tracking for smart money wallets across multiple blockchains often requires the use of dedicated tools. Why Is Wallet Tracking Valuable? Whale Watching: Follow the movements of large holders to gain market insights. Portfolio Management: Monitor asset performance across various wallets and networks Security Monitoring: Spot suspicious activity or unauthorized transactions, which can be useful to identify potential project rug pulls. Tax & Accounting: Access detailed transaction history for accurate tax reporting. Bella AI Agents for Tracking Whales Bella Protocol is on a mission to help our crypto trading community seamlessly infuse advanced artificial intelligence technology into their investing workflow. To that purpose, in the past 6 months we’ve released two AI trading agents, the Bella Signal Bot and LLM Research Bot , which have both garnered loyal subscriber bases.

44569273,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159885,1747144211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Curve Finance DNS Attack Highlights Critical DeFi Security Flaw,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/curve-finance-dns-attack/,"The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) faced a scare recently when prominent platform Curve Finance confirmed a security incident. This wasn’t a direct smart contract exploit, but rather a sophisticated attack targeting the very entry point for users: the website’s domain name system (DNS). Understanding the Curve Finance DNS Attack On [Insert Date of Attack if known, otherwise state ‘a recent date’], Curve Finance announced via its official X (formerly Twitter) account that its primary domain, curve.fi, had been compromised. The attack vector was identified as a DNS attack . This means the attackers managed to alter the DNS records associated with the curve.fi domain. Instead of directing users to the legitimate Curve Finance servers, the modified records sent visitors to a malicious IP address controlled by the attackers. Think of DNS as the internet’s phonebook. When you type a website address like curve.fi into your browser, your computer looks up that address in the DNS to find the corresponding IP address (the server’s location). A DNS attack essentially poisons this phonebook entry, sending you to the wrong, potentially dangerous, address. The official communication from Curve Finance clarified a crucial point: the platform’s underlying smart contracts and internal systems remained unaffected. The compromise was limited to the domain level, impacting users attempting to access the site through the standard URL. Why a DNS Attack is a Significant DeFi Security Concern While smart contract hacks often grab headlines, a DNS attack on a major platform like Curve Finance highlights a different, yet equally critical, aspect of DeFi security . Here’s why: Targeting the User Interface: These attacks bypass the security of the smart contracts themselves and target the layer users interact with directly – the website. Phishing Potential: The malicious site users were redirected to was likely a sophisticated phishing replica of the actual Curve Finance interface, designed to trick users into connecting their wallets and approving transactions that would drain their funds. Trust Erosion: Such incidents erode user trust in DeFi platforms, even if the core protocol remains secure. If users can’t trust the website they’re accessing, the entire decentralized premise is undermined. Complexity: DNS infrastructure can be complex, involving domain registrars, hosting providers, and various caching layers, making pinpointing and resolving the issue challenging. This incident serves as a stark reminder that crypto security extends beyond just the blockchain layer. The traditional web infrastructure that interfaces with Web3 applications is also a potential attack surface. Immediate Response and Ongoing Investigation Upon detecting the compromise, the Curve Finance team took swift action. They issued public warnings across their official channels, advising users to avoid interacting with the curve.fi domain until further notice. An investigation was immediately launched to understand how the attackers gained control of the DNS records. The team confirmed they were working closely with their domain registrar to regain control and restore the correct DNS configuration. Resolving a DNS attack often requires coordination between the affected party and the registrar, which can sometimes take time depending on the nature of the compromise and propagation delays across the internet’s DNS servers. Actionable Steps for Web3 Security The Curve Finance incident provides valuable lessons for all participants in the decentralized space. Protecting yourself requires vigilance and proactive measures. Here are some key actionable insights for enhancing your Web3 security : Verify URLs Religiously: Always double-check the URL of any DeFi platform or crypto service you are using. Look for subtle misspellings or alternative domain extensions. Bookmark legitimate sites and use those bookmarks. Use Trusted Sources: Access platforms via official links shared on verified social media accounts (like the platform’s official X/Twitter with a gold or blue checkmark) or reputable crypto news sites, but always cross-reference. Be Cautious with Wallet Connections: When connecting your wallet, carefully review the permissions requested. Never approve transactions you didn’t initiate or don’t understand. Consider DNS Security Tools: While primarily for advanced users or organizations, tools like DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) can help prevent some types of DNS manipulation, though their implementation and effectiveness can vary. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from platforms you use. Security incidents are often first reported on official channels. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, hardware wallets provide the strongest protection against online threats, as private keys are stored offline. This incident underscores that comprehensive crypto security involves not only safeguarding your private keys and understanding smart contracts but also being aware of the traditional internet infrastructure layers that interact with decentralized applications. Challenges in Preventing DNS Attacks Preventing DNS attacks is challenging because the vulnerability often lies with third-party providers like domain registrars or involves sophisticated social engineering or credential theft targeting platform administrators. Even platforms with robust smart contract security can be vulnerable at the DNS level if their domain management practices are not equally secure. Ensuring robust authentication and authorization mechanisms at the registrar level, implementing multi-factor authentication for domain management accounts, and monitoring DNS records for unauthorized changes are critical steps, but attackers are constantly evolving their tactics. Conclusion: Lessons Learned for DeFi and Crypto Security The Curve Finance DNS attack is a critical reminder that the security perimeter in Web3 extends beyond the blockchain itself. While the platform’s core contracts remained secure, the incident highlights the vulnerability of the user-facing web layer to traditional cyber threats like DNS hijacking. This event underscores the need for continuous vigilance from both platforms, which must enhance their domain security practices, and users, who must adopt rigorous verification habits. Moving forward, strengthening DeFi security requires a holistic approach that addresses vulnerabilities at every layer, from smart contracts and protocols to user interfaces and the underlying internet infrastructure. The incident serves as a catalyst for the industry to collectively improve security standards and educate users on best practices for navigating the decentralized web safely. Staying informed and cautious is your best defense in the evolving landscape of Web3 security .

Bitcoin (BTC) made a sluggish start to the week, dropping to an intraday low of $100,833 as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded and moved to its current level but remains down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $2,500, dropping over 2% to $2,458. Despite the bearish sentiment, Ripple (XRP) is up over 4% and trading at $2.50, while Solana (SOL) is down 2.31% and trading at $171. Dogecoin (DOGE) also registered a notable decline, dropping over 7% to $0.223. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is down almost 3%, and Chainlink (LINK) is down over 4% at $16.44. Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable declines. The crypto market cap is down 1.48% and currently sits at $3.28 trillion. US And China Temporarily Slash Tariffs The US and China have taken steps to defuse trade tensions, agreeing to temporarily reduce the trade tariffs imposed on each other. The decision is an indication of the high costs of an all-out trade war with China and comes after President Trump repeatedly stated he would not lower tariffs without concessions from China. The climbdown comes after both sides agreed to hold more formal talks after consumers and companies began showing considerable economic strain. President Trump stated during a press conference at the White House that talks would focus on opening up China to American businesses and revealed he would be speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both sides have released a joint statement saying they will suspend reciprocal tariffs for 90 days as they continue negotiations that began this weekend. Under the new agreement, the US would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% while China would reduce the import duty on American goods to 10%. Dubai Partners With Crypto.com To Launch Crypto Payments Dubai has partnered with Crypto.com to launch crypto payments for government services. The agreement was finalized during the Dubai Fintech Summit on May 12 and is part of Dubai’s cashless strategy which aims to transform the city into a fully digital, cashless society by introducing a new digital payment channel across all official platforms. The partnership will allow individuals and business customers of government entities to pay service fees using the exchange’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into Dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts. Amna Mohammed Lootah, Director of Digital Payment Systems Regulation, said that Dubai aims to make 90% of all financial transactions in the city cashless. “We are confident that this milestone will significantly accelerate the advancement of the Dubai Cashless Strategy.” However, the authorities do not clearly state which cryptocurrencies they will accept. The announcement stated that payments could be made using stable currencies, indicating the use of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase Makes History, Becomes First Crypto Company To Join The S&P 500 Coinbase has become the first crypto company to join the S&P 500. The announcement was made by S&P Global and will come into effect on Monday, May 19. Coinbase will replace Discover Financial Services, which was recently acquired by Capital One. Coinbase (COIN) shares jumped nearly 9% following the announcement. Coinbase has established itself as the largest crypto exchange in the US and reported a net income of $65.6 million in Q1 2025. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong celebrated the moment on X, stating, “Crypto is here to stay.” A company’s inclusion in the S&P 500 boosts its market exposure, as index-tracking funds must purchase its shares. The inclusion means Coinbase joins the likes of Apple and Nvidia in the benchmark index. However, Coinbase is expected to be at the lower end of the index, consisting of companies with a weighting between 0.01% and 0.2%. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a decline over the past couple of sessions as buyer exhaustion and selling pressure prevented a move past $105,000. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week on a bearish note and faced substantial volatility on Monday as it fell to a low of $100,692 thanks to selling pressure at higher levels. BTC also encountered considerable profit-taking at higher levels as investors locked in their gains. BTC’s pullback coincided with macroeconomic shifts, including a strengthening US Dollar Index and renewed optimism around a US-China trade deal, boosting equities and leading to considerable profit-booking in crypto. Analysts have pointed out that the $100,000 level remains a crucial psychological and liquidation level, with over $3.4 billion in long-positions exposed to downside risk if selling pressure persists. The level has already been tested on Monday when BTC dropped to a low of $100,692 before rebounding. Despite the notable correction, BTC has seen positive developments over the past week. The most significant news surrounding the asset was Michael Saylor announcing that Strategy has acquired 13,390 BTC, taking its total holdings to 568,840 BTC. Meanwhile, Healthcare company KindlyMD announced a merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, President Trump’s current crypto advisor. Following last week’s stellar rally, analysts believe BTC could enter a period of consolidation as profit-taking impacts bullish momentum. Glassnode analysts stated, “BTC Supply Mapping shows sustained strength in new demand. First-Time Buyers RSI has held at 100 all week. But Momentum Buyers remain weak (RSI ~11), and Profit Takers are rising. If fresh inflows slow, lack of follow-through could lead to consolidation.” Major crypto exchanges also recorded a significant jump in selling in perpetual futures markets. Selling was also seen in spot markets as BTC ran into a wall of resistance around $106,000. Mena Theodorou, co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, stated, “The tariff reduction could see a broader return to risk-on positioning, with crypto and equities both likely to benefit from renewed investor confidence and global capital flows. The rally comes as the macro backdrop takes a positive turn: in a landmark move, the US has struck trade deals with both China and the UK, while Putin and Zelensky are set to meet on Thursday to discuss a potential ceasefire. These developments have lifted risk sentiment globally, crypto included.” Despite posting a significant rally last week, BTC started in the red, registering a drop of 0.98% on Saturday and 1.66% on Sunday to end the weekend at $94,390. Despite the bearish weekend, the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded on Monday, rising 0.41% to $94,773. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose 2.19% to cross 96,000 and settle at $96,845. A marginal increase on Wednesday allowed BTC to claim $97,000 and settle at $97,013. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied after President Trump announced a trade deal with the UK. As a result, BTC soared over 6%, surging past $100,000 and settling at $103,096. Source: TradingView The rally cooled on Friday as the price registered a marginal decline to slip below $103,000 and settle at $102,851. Price action turned positive on Saturday as BTC rose almost 2% to $104,617. BTC could not push higher as it ran into a wall of resistance around $105,000. As a result, the price dropped nearly 1% on Sunday and settled at $103,804. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price dropped over 1% to $102,729, but not before falling to an intraday low of $100,692. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to drive the price below $100,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH)’s stunning rally stalled over the weekend thanks to massive profit-taking from ETH holders. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency stunned market watchers with a 40% increase, smashing past $2,000 and surging to a high of $2,597 on Saturday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and is down nearly 5% over the past 3 days. Open interest has also registered a notable decline, suggesting a reduction in leveraged bets. According to an analysis by analysts at Glassnode, ETH’s rally was supported by a lack of resistance between $1,800 and $2,500. However, the rally stalled just short of $2,600 at a critical level where 1.3 million ETH has amassed. “$ETH’s sharp move above $1.8K to $2.5K was aided by the low supply concentration in that range. The rally stalled near $2.58K, where ~1.3M ETH was held. As the price approached this level, the supply fell to 1M, indicating that distribution was near the cost basis as the holders exited.” In a separate analysis, a CryptoQuant analyst noted that Ethereum’s funding rates, which reflect futures market sentiment, have remained flat, indicating that the spot market, not traders using leverage, accounted for most of last week’s buying pressure. As we can see in the price chart, ETH’s price action was muted most of last week until the price action turned bullish on Thursday. The price traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping 0.40% on Saturday and 1.34% on Sunday to settle at $1,810. The price registered a marginal recovery on Monday but was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 0.22% to $1,816. Price action remained bearish on Wednesday, with ETH registering another marginal decline and settling at $1,812. ETH rallied Thursday after Trump announced the US-UK trade deal, surging nearly 22% to cross $2,000 and settle at $2,206. Source: TradingView The price raced to an intraday high of $2,489 on Friday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $2,345, ultimately registering an increase of $2,345. Price action remained bullish on Saturday as ETH rose over 10%, surging past $2,500 and settling at $2,585. However, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, dropping nearly 3% to $2,514. ETH encountered volatility on Monday as buyers attempted a move past $2,600 while sellers tried to drive the price below $2,500. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price fell almost 1% to $2,496. The current session sees ETH marginally down, trading around $2,480. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s rally stalled around the $175-$180 mark as buyer exhaustion set in, thanks to a wall of resistance at upper levels. However, despite losing momentum, SOL has not ceded ground to the bears, maintaining its position above $170. SOL’s rally coincided with substantial gains in the broader crypto market, as markets rallied thanks to positive macroeconomic developments. Volumes on Solana-based decentralized exchanges have also risen, handling transactions worth over $3.4 billion in the past 24 hours. Upcoming Solana ETF approvals could act as another catalyst and potentially drive SOL past $300. SOL registered a drop of almost 1% on Saturday (May 3) and 1.81% on Sunday to end the previous weekend at $144. The price found support at this level and rebounded on Monday, rising almost 2% to $146. Sellers attempted to lower the price on Tuesday as SOL fell to an intraday low of $141. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and reclaim $146. A marginal rise on Wednesday saw SOL move to $147. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday, and SOL surged nearly 12% to cross $160 and settle at $164. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose over 5%, crossing $170 to settle at $172. SOL continued to push higher on Saturday, increasing nearly 3% to $177. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped almost 3% on Sunday to settle at $173. The price encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as SOL rose 0.61% to $174, but not before reaching an intraday high of $174. The current session sees SOL marginally down, recovering from a low of $165 and trading at $173. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) registered a substantial drop on Saturday (May 3), dropping over 3% and settling at $0.175. Selling pressure persisted on Sunday as the price fell 2.62%, ending the weekend in the red at $0.170. Sellers retained control on Monday as DOGE registered a marginal decline, remaining at $0.170.

Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price dropped from an intraday high of $0.253 and settled at $0.230 after registering a marginal decline. The current session sees the price down nearly 2% and trading at $0.226. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) registered a substantial decline on Saturday (May 3), dropping nearly 6%, slipping below the 50-day SMA, and settling at $0.319. Bearish sentiment persisted on Sunday as ARB dropped 2.88%, going below the 20-day SMA and settling at $0.310. Despite the bearish sentiment, the price registered a marginal increase on Monday and moved to $0.311.

Unlike previous plans thwarted by regulatory uncertainty, Siu clarified that Animoca’s move is driven not by current market conditions, but by strategic positioning. “This is a unique moment in time,” he said, highlighting what he sees as a rare opportunity for crypto firms to enter the U.S. capital markets with fewer regulatory roadblocks. Animoca Background Animoca was previously delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange in 2020 over governance and crypto-related concerns. Since then, the company has established itself as a heavyweight in the Web3 space with investments in OpenSea, Kraken, and Consensys. It reported unaudited earnings of $97 million on $314 million in revenue for 2024, and currently holds $300 million in cash and stablecoins along with more than $538 million in digital assets. The renewed optimism comes on the heels of President Trump’s return to the White House, which has led to a significant rollback in federal enforcement actions against the crypto industry. Companies Expanding in the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has paused or dropped over a dozen enforcement cases, while the Department of Justice has dissolved its cryptocurrency enforcement unit. This softening approach stands in stark contrast to the more aggressive regulatory environment under former President Joe Biden. Siu emphasized how previous regulatory hostility deterred global blockchain companies from entering or expanding in the U.S. Now, however, he sees a reversal. “There’s renewed confidence,” he said, noting that portfolio companies like Kraken might also pursue U.S. listings by 2025 or 2026 . Other industry players are already acting on this sentiment. Crypto exchange OKX recently announced plans to establish a U.S. base in San Jose, just months after resolving a $504 million settlement with regulators. Similarly, Nexo—once driven out by unclear rules—has announced its return to the U.S. market after a nearly two-year hiatus.

HashKey has announced the launch of HashKey Global MENA (Middle East and North Africa) to handle the new operations. The Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) has approved a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license for HashKey. Blockchain infrastructure development has the potential to link vast areas together, improving economic conditions and providing new opportunities for rural communities. HashKey plans to provide services for institutional clients using USD and AED currencies, such as fiat deposits and withdrawals. HashKey will also offer services to major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The crypto company will focus its efforts on compliance and security. Through its regulatory bodies, the UAE has approved the business services and, therefore, will develop a strong presence in the MENA crypto sector. There has been a lot of growth in the Middle East and Africa regarding crypto innovations, and the new technology has the potential to link vast regions through trustless technology. HashKey will start MENA operations from 19 May. The announcement suggests that HashKey will continue to expand its business globally. Sherif Samad, manager at HashKey MENA, said the company will address the needs of institutional clients, particularly by providing over-the-counter (OTC) services for fiat and crypto exchange. Samad further explained that HashKey will provide a regulated service that allows clients to make large transactions without worrying about legal issues. HashKey aims to provide access to crypto markets while adhering to regulatory laws and supporting the UAE as an important hub for crypto innovation. Samad believes that HashKey is the right company for the job because it already has regulatory approval in other countries, such as Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. HashKey is currently seeking regulatory approval in Europe under the new MiCA license. For institutional investors, such consistency is helpful, primarily if the business in question operates trade on a global level. There are many levels to crypto adoption, including an institutional level which relies heavily on legal frameworks and regulation, mainly when operating between countries. The UAE has been making active efforts to attract global investors so that it can establish itself as a blockchain hub. The UAE wishes to attract international players in the crypto market, especially institutional investors. For example, an Abu Dhabi state-backed firm recently announced a $2 billion investment in Binance and World Liberty Finance, using the stablecoin USD1. World Liberty Finance is a crypto project linked to the Trump family. With increasingly stringent European regulations under the MiCA system, many investors may seek external systems to conduct their business. The UAE may be a welcome reprieve for EU businesses that desire key-turn business solutions with no fuss procedures that work.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-13 13:54:49

This comes after Monday’s monster rally that saw the Dow gain more than 1,100 points amid encouraging Washington–Beijing trade talks. On Tuesday, the consumer price index increased 2.3% on an annualized basis, marking the lowest growth seen since 2021. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, told CNBC that the markets’ “twin fears” of a tariff -induced recession and sticky inflation have eased. As such, the markets should continue “yesterday’s celebration.” Analysts at Goldman Sachs lifted their S&P 500 target from 6,200 to 6,500 over the next 12 months, implying an 11% gain. This marks a reversal from the firm’s two forecast cuts in March due to higher recession risk and tariff-induced uncertainty.

The ALP beat its conservative rivals, the Coalition, and is now reshuffling its cabinet. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the appointment, citing Charlton’s strong credentials as an economist. Albanese pointed out that a digital economy will profoundly impact how Australians work and live. Charlton will work alongside his colleague Tim Ayres, the Minister for Industry and Innovation. However, Charlton will focus his attention on digital assets and regulation. Albanese announced that Charlton will also promote emerging technologies and innovations. Charlton has shown a positive attitude towards cryptocurrencies, making a speech last November about developing balanced policies for crypto and encouraging industry growth. Charlton is a Rhodes scholar, joining the ranks of previous Australian prime ministers such as Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull. Charlton sold his economics firm, Accenture, in 2020 for $35.8 million. Australian political parties value wealthy candidates because they can pay for their campaign, which becomes essential during an economic downturn. Charlton entered politics through a Labor-aligned law firm. Charlton resembles former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in many ways and could be a future candidate for PM himself. Turnbull, who could still make a comeback, made his money as a trader in Siberian and Chinese mines. If this is the case, one may expect Charlton to blend digital assets with conservation and ecological technology, possibly using blockchains to conduct carbon accounting. In March, Charlton joined Treasurer Jim Chalmers to publish a regulatory framework for digital assets. The document signalled a positive switch for the Australian government to collaborate with industry leaders and support local crypto projects. Australia is currently struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and a housing market that is not sustainable in terms of affordability. Charlton described his regulatory approach as enhancing economic dynamism and increasing competitiveness. For Charlton, cryptocurrency is an opportunity to help Australia survive a financial crisis and boost local startups. Charlton suggested changes to government oversight of digital assets, including a review of the Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox, and exploring the benefits of crypto for financial markets. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has also been included in the new approach to digital assets. The ATO found that existing tax categories can accommodate cryptocurrencies. Charlton has also established an ATO group to provide crypto businesses with more guidance regarding tax procedures. The Independent Reserve, an Australian exchange, released April 2025 data, providing a snapshot of the Australian crypto market. Their data shows that 31% of Australians, or 6.2 million people, own cryptocurrency, up from the previous year of 28%. The majority of these investors at 70% are buying Bitcoin. At the same time, Ethereum makes up 29.8% of the people investing. Younger people aged 25-34 vastly dominate the market, with 53% of investors coming from this demographic. There also exists a gender disparity, with around 40% of male respondents investing in crypto, while only 20% of female respondents invest. Self Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSF) are also very popular in Australia, with 36.4% of SMSF holders likely to invest in Bitcoin, and 18% interested in adding Bitcoin to their SMSF, particularly amongst younger workers.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-13 13:58:42

From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been “a big up-trend” that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a “sound-money dominance regime”: “My favorite chart is the S&P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold’s favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We’re watching the rules shift, and it’s not going to happen overnight—it’ll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.” Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s—an “air pocket” where little historical supply had transacted—bitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal “People were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They’d bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they’re up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.” Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. “$100,000 was the target for the last decade,” Check said. “Now it’s the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.” Check’s quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle’s statistical ceiling near $166,000: “If price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‘We’re two standard deviations above the mean, and we’ve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.’” That band—roughly $150,000 to $160,000—marks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: “There’s a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don’t need everyone to sell—just enough to overwhelm new demand.” Derivatives, “Time Pain” And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check’s thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. “Big asset managers must hedge. If they can’t lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won’t take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren’t papering over demand—they’re the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today’s market prefers shallower, longer consolidations—episodes that impose what Check calls time pain. “Depth pain is easy to see—your coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.” Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check’s deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August–September 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. “People are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment—not scheduled supply shocks—is steering the big flows.” Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap—the cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying “mechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.” Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: “Markets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging—all of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what’s the fair macro premium for digital sound money?” For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test. At press time, BTC traded at $102,573.

44569643,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159890,1747144814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial US CPI Report: How it Could Impact the US Dollar and Forex Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-cpi-dollar-impact/,"Market participants are closely watching the upcoming US CPI (Consumer Price Index) data release. This key piece of Inflation Data is expected to significantly influence the direction of the US Dollar and shape sentiment across the global Forex Market , potentially sending ripples through other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Understanding the US CPI : More Than Just Numbers The Consumer Price Index, or US CPI , is a vital economic indicator that measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. Think of it as the official scorecard for inflation. Why is it so important? Because inflation erodes purchasing power. High inflation means your money buys less than it used to. Central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have a mandate to maintain price stability, which often translates to keeping inflation within a target range. The CPI report breaks down price changes across various categories, including: Food and beverages Housing (rent, owner’s equivalent rent) Apparel Transportation (gasoline, vehicle prices) Medical care Recreation Education and communication Other goods and services Economists often focus on ‘Core CPI,’ which excludes volatile items like food and energy, to get a clearer picture of underlying inflationary trends. Why the US Dollar Reacts to Inflation Data The value of a currency, like the US Dollar , is heavily influenced by interest rates and the economic outlook of the country. Inflation Data , particularly the US CPI , plays a critical role in shaping both. Here’s the connection: Interest Rate Expectations: When inflation is high or rising, the central bank (the Federal Reserve) is more likely to raise interest rates or keep them higher for longer to cool down the economy and bring prices under control. Attracting Capital: Higher interest rates make a country’s assets (like bonds) more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns. To invest in these assets, they need to buy the local currency (the US Dollar ). This increased demand can strengthen the currency. Real Returns: Inflation erodes the real return on investments. If inflation is high, the real value of a bond’s interest payments or a savings account’s yield decreases. Central banks raise rates to offer investors a positive real return, making the currency more appealing. Conversely, if inflation is low or falling below the target, the central bank might consider cutting interest rates or signaling a more dovish stance. Lower rates make the currency less attractive relative to others, potentially causing the US Dollar to weaken. Decoding the Impact of Inflation Data The upcoming US CPI report is significant because it provides the latest snapshot of inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy. Market analysts and traders will scrutinize every detail, comparing the actual numbers against their expectations. Let’s consider the potential scenarios and their likely implications for the US Dollar and the broader market landscape: Scenario 1: CPI comes in Higher than Expected Implication: Suggests inflation is proving sticky or accelerating. Likely Fed Reaction: Increases the probability of the Federal Reserve maintaining higher interest rates for longer, or potentially even considering future hikes if the data is significantly strong. Market Impact: Could lead to a strengthening of the US Dollar as rate hike expectations rise. Bond yields would likely increase. Stock markets might face pressure due to higher borrowing costs and reduced future earnings expectations. Cryptocurrency markets, which sometimes react negatively to tighter monetary conditions, could also see downward pressure. Scenario 2: CPI comes in Lower than Expected Implication: Suggests inflation is cooling faster than anticipated. Likely Fed Reaction: Increases the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates sooner or more aggressively in the future. Market Impact: Could lead to a weakening of the US Dollar as rate cut expectations increase. Bond yields would likely fall. Stock markets might rally on hopes of cheaper credit and improved economic prospects. Cryptocurrency markets could potentially benefit from a more favorable liquidity environment. Scenario 3: CPI comes in Exactly or Close to Expectations Implication: Suggests inflation is behaving as the market and the Fed currently anticipate. Likely Fed Reaction: Likely reinforces the Federal Reserve’s current stance and projected path for interest rates. Market Impact: Could result in relatively muted reactions in the US Dollar and other markets, as this outcome is already priced in. Focus would then shift to other economic data or Fed commentary for future direction. It’s important to note that markets don’t always react in a perfectly predictable manner. The devil is often in the details – whether the core CPI or headline CPI is the main driver, and how the market interprets the forward implications for Fed Policy . Navigating the Forex Market Ahead of the Report The period leading up to a major economic data release like the US CPI is often characterized by increased volatility and uncertainty in the Forex Market . Traders might become more cautious, reducing position sizes, or alternatively, position themselves based on their expectations. The US Dollar index (DXY), which measures the USD against a basket of major currencies, is a key benchmark to watch. Recent movements have seen the dollar slip slightly from recent highs, suggesting some market participants might be taking profits or anticipating a softer CPI number, or simply adjusting positions ahead of potential volatility. Currency pairs involving the US Dollar (like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY) will likely experience significant price swings immediately following the release. The magnitude and direction of these moves will depend heavily on the degree of surprise in the actual CPI figures compared to the consensus forecast. The Role of the Federal Reserve and Fed Policy Ultimately, the primary reason the US CPI is so impactful is its direct influence on the Federal Reserve ‘s decisions regarding interest rates – this is the core of Fed Policy . The Fed uses interest rates as its main tool to manage inflation and support employment. Higher inflation data points increase the pressure on the Fed to maintain a restrictive monetary stance. Lower inflation data provides the Fed with more room to potentially ease policy, which could involve cutting rates. Market participants constantly try to predict the Fed’s next move, and the US CPI report is one of the most important pieces of the puzzle they use. Any deviation from the expected inflation path can lead to significant adjustments in market pricing for future interest rate changes, directly affecting the US Dollar , bond yields, and broader financial conditions. Recent commentary from Federal Reserve officials also plays a role. Markets try to gauge the Fed’s reaction function – how they are likely to respond to different economic outcomes. The upcoming CPI report will test whether recent Fed messaging aligns with the incoming data. Potential Market Scenarios and What to Watch As highlighted earlier, the reaction depends on the surprise factor. Here’s a simplified look at potential market movements: CPI Outcome vs. Expectation Likely US Dollar Reaction Likely Stock Market Reaction Likely Crypto Market Reaction Higher than Expected Strengthens Negative (Higher rates) Negative (Risk-off, lower liquidity) Lower than Expected Weakens Positive (Lower rates) Positive (Risk-on, potential for more liquidity) In Line with Expectations Muted / Follows existing trend Muted / Follows existing trend Muted / Follows existing trend Beyond the headline and core CPI numbers, traders should also watch: Month-over-month vs. Year-over-year figures: Both provide different perspectives on price trends. Specific category breakdowns: Are increases broad-based or concentrated in a few areas? Revisions to previous data: Sometimes prior months’ figures are adjusted. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for volatility around the US CPI release, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Know the exact release time and have reliable sources for the data. Manage Risk: If you have open positions in the Forex Market , stocks, or crypto, consider reducing leverage or using stop-loss orders to protect against sharp, unfavorable moves. Avoid Trading During Peak Volatility: The immediate minutes after the release can be chaotic. Sometimes waiting for the market to digest the data and establish a clearer direction is prudent. Focus on the Trend: While one data point is important, remember that the Federal Reserve looks at a range of data over time. Don’t overreact to a single report if it contradicts the broader economic trend. Understand Your Exposure: Be aware of how your portfolio might be affected by significant moves in the US Dollar or shifts in interest rate expectations. Predicting market reactions with certainty is impossible. The market’s interpretation of the data in the context of other economic indicators and forward-looking statements from the Federal Reserve will ultimately determine the price action. Conclusion: The Weight of the Numbers The upcoming US CPI report is undeniably a pivotal event for the global financial markets. As the US Dollar currently sits slightly below recent peaks, the Inflation Data will likely dictate whether it resumes its climb or faces further pressure. The outcome will provide crucial clues about the trajectory of Fed Policy , directly impacting borrowing costs, asset valuations, and the overall economic outlook. Traders and investors across the Forex Market , equity markets, and even the volatile world of cryptocurrencies are holding their breath, ready to react to what these crucial numbers reveal about the state of inflation.

Employees from WonderFi will jump into Robinhood’s existing Canadian workforce, which includes more than 140 staff based in Toronto. “WonderFi has built a formidable family of brands serving beginner and advanced crypto users alike, making them an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada,” said Johann Kerbrat, GM of Robinhood Crypto. Robinhood has been expanding its crypto capabilities in recent years, having acquired Bitstamp for $200 million in 2024. The WonderFi acquisition builds on that strategy, positioning Robinhood to serve Canadian retail investors with a broad set of crypto services, including trading, staking, and custody. WonderFi has approximately 1.6 million users across its platforms and reported over C$3.57 billion in trading volume in fiscal year 2024, a 28% year-over-year increase. The company went public via a reverse takeover in 2021 and has since grown into one of Canada’s leading crypto providers. Robinhood plans to finance the purchase using cash on hand. J.P. Morgan served as Robinhood’s exclusive financial advisor, while WonderFi was advised by FT Partners and multiple legal and financial firms, according to the companies.

44569938,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=726593,1747144920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44569938.jpeg,Yeti Ouro Challenges Dogecoin (DOGE): Who Will Hit $10 First?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/yeti-ouro-challenges-dogecoin-doge-who-will-hit-10-first/,"Memecoins rode a surge in the past 24 hours. The presale of Yeti Ouro (YETIO) hit above $4 million at $0.041 per YETIO, and Dogecoin (DOGE) reached above $0.25 as a result of whale attention. While the retail traders are waiting and speculating on whose coin will reach $10 first, today’s on-chain statistics imply a shocking competition. DOGE Market Momentum Crypto mood turned “greed” overnight, lifting liquidity all around. Dogecoin price paced large-cap gainers with a 24% surge to $0.2571 following whales piling 600 million DOGE into cold storage—the biggest two-day inflow since February’s local peak. Intraday order books now indicate clustering of bids around $0.23, the round-bottom pattern neckline many experts signaled up on this morning. The up-move fueled discussions of DOGE at $1 prior to mid-2025 despite quants observing the coin needing to add approximately $130 billion in market cap to achieve it. Model algorithms released today still forecast a median spot range of $0.24–$0.26 through next week. DOGE/USDT 4h chart displays a strong positive deviation with the price action crossing above the upper Bollinger Band backed by high volume. Subsequent to the volatility expansion, a consolidation phase at 0.23503 above the 20-SMA hints at a respite. Yeti Ouro’s GameFi Advantage Yeti Ouro takes the meme narrative in a different direction: utility-first GameFi. The flagship racer, YetiGo, is developed using Unreal Engine 5 and promises elimination-style PvP with victors rewarded directly in-game with YETIO. By combining console-class graphics with a native reward loop, the group is targeting a user base wider than usual meme-coin collectors. Most importantly, the public beta of YetiGo is slated to hit the existing roadmap timeframe, providing the token with a playable proof-of-concept month ahead of centralized exchange listings. The game invites players into a sleek, high-speed world where every element is crafted for impact. Created alongside the celebrated developers behind Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, the game delivers a cinematic experience packed with detail and momentum. The soundtrack, developed by sound engineers with credits alongside Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, amplifies the action with energy and emotion. Presale traction supports the thesis: 239 million tokens sold and $4.075 million raised as of this morning @ $0.041 per token, with the next-stage price already confirmed to have a steeper increase than the price increase from Stage 3 to Stage 4. Early bird investors have seen a 242% ROI and enjoy a 20% bonus on token purchases. An additional 5% is added to purchases over $500. Tokenomics and Strategic Burn YETIO has a fixed billion supply, half of which drips into circulation through the multi-stage presale and community incentives. A portion of all season launches in YetiGo goes towards a permanent burn wallet, bestowing the ecosystem with a deflationary tailwind missing from most meme competitors. The liquidity, marketing, and team allocations are capped at a single-digit percent, keeping work capital thin while ensuring long-haul scarcity. Fully-diluted valuation at the presale price is around $41 million—paltry alongside large cap memes, but small enough that a single exchange listing might make a difference. YETIO’s Road to $10 A $0.041 to $10 swing requires a rally of 24,250 %, but the arithmetic appears less sensational when plotted against the project’s runway. A $10 price tag would set YETIO’s fully-diluted market cap at about $10 billion—a magnitude less than the 2021 peak of Dogecoin and comparable to second-rank gaming behemoths. Incentives already scheduled to appear in the next year are: A platform-crossing YetiGo beta that dispenses tokens to players First CEX listing to happen in Q2 2025 as per the live roadmap, and The initial season burn aligned with beta launch traffic. Every milestone directly reduces supply or increases demand, compressing distance to double-digits. Assuming presale allocations are used up and the community holds even 30 % of beta users, on-chain velocity models look to a theoretical year-end goal higher than $1 with compound monthly increases of 35 % propelling the token to two-figure levels before the next Bitcoin halving. Who Reaches the Summit First? The race is open. Legacy memes are dependent on renewed hype; Yeti Ouro counters by creating demand through gameplay and controlled scarcity. Dogecoin has liquidity, exchange depth, and cultural mind-share. Yeti Ouro responds with capped supply, deliberate burns, and a near-term Unreal-Engine title that turns playtime into buy pressure. If DOGE sustains its whale-led rally it might flirt with $1 in the next bull wave, but a sprint to $10 still depends on an unprecedented market-cap surge. YETIO, however, is early in its curve: a 250-fold increase from presale prices today stamps the same milestone—possible if GameFi uptake follows past breakout success stories and all roadmaps fire on cue.

Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin ( BTC ) ecosystem. Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure. “You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers So, we have to have VC on that.“ Hu argued against the usual Bitcoiner ethos that argues against outsider capital, saying, “It’s difficult to say, okay, let’s do a fair mint, and then have a very successful, healthy treasury, and you have to pay all this stuff.” “It doesn’t work that way,” he said. Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVM Lightning-only stance sparks debate Not everyone agrees. Mike Jarmuz, a managing partner at Bitcoin venture capital firm Lightning Ventures, told Cointelegraph that Lightning is the only L2 his company has invested in and is interested in. He said, “Anything with a ‘token’ that allows for ‘staking’ and earning some absurd APY interest on your Bitcoin should be avoided.” Jarmuz said that Lightning Network , on the other hand, is growing very quickly and makes Bitcoin transactions instant, nearly free and scalable. Bitcoin Visuals data shows that the Lightning Network has a cumulative capacity across all channels equivalent to almost $452 million at the time of writing. He added: “There is no ‘token’ when using the Lightning network. It’s Bitcoin. That to me is the only real L2, at least as of right now.“ Lightning Network capacity chart. Source: Bitcoin Visuals Jarmuz said that projects not meeting his criteria are “masquerading as useful” while doing nothing for Bitcoin. He claimed that sidechains like the Liquid Network and newer protocols such as e-cash and federations or Ark “are not widely used” but “are at least interesting.” He recognized that those “do not involve a staked token, promising yield,” with projects that have those features, “just waiting for rug pulls and issues.” “We don’t invest in that area,“ he added. Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin payments VCs seen as enablers of Bitcoin growth According to Hu, VCs bring liquidity, resources and experience to new startups while opening “up all the institutional ideas and connections.” He said that those were important additions to Bitlayer’s resources as well, noting that “we wouldn’t have that if those people didn’t invest in us.” He also argued that VCs tend to back long-term infrastructure efforts rather than speculative projects like memecoins or non-fungible tokens. That experience was echoed by Walter Maffione, lead engineer at Lightning Network-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Kaleidoswap, who told Cointelegraph that the protocol started as an open-source project and raised a pre-seed investment from Fulgur Ventures and Bitfinex Ventures. “Those funds were used to pay open-source developers and accelerate protocol development, not to build a token or capture governance rights,“ he said. Hu claimed that VCs have contributed significantly to developing layer-2 scalability solutions, wallets, Bitcoin lending and staking protocols. He added: “All of them are VC-backed, including us. And some of them are listed on top exchanges.” Vikash Singh, principal at Bitcoin VC firm Stillmark, told Cointelegraph that when selecting Bitcoin layer-2 protocols to invest in, they consider demonstrated security and robustness, proliferation and adoption of non-speculative use cases and growth of the application layer. Much like Jarmuz, he said that Stillmark believes that proof-of-work is the superior consensus model. Still, unlike Jarmuz, Singh said proof-of-stake or Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus “may be suitable for Bitcoin sidechains and rollups.” Magazine: ‘Bitcoin layer 2s’ aren’t really L2s at all: Here’s why that matters",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-13 14:04:14

Traders watched the tape as BTC climbed from $97,200 in early Asian hours to a peak of $99,050 before settling around $103,900. The move came amid a flurry of macro developments . Data point to a market caught between fresh liquidity, steady U.S. rates, and record bearish bets. Bitcoin Liquidity Boost Out of Beijing China’s central bank trimmed its one-year lending rate by 15 basis points. It also cut the reserve requirement ratio by half a percentage point. Together, these moves freed an estimated $100 billion of liquidity into the market. The rate cut marked the first easing since December 2024. It came as Beijing seeks to shore up growth and support its equity and property markets. Traders noted the timing: China announced the measures just hours before Bitcoin broke $99,000. Across the Pacific, the U.S. Federal Reserve paused its tightening cycle. In its May 1 statement, the Fed kept the federal funds target at 5.25 percent. Officials cited mixed growth signals and cooling inflation. The pause contrasted with Beijing’s easing. It underscored divergent policy paths. Behind the scenes, U.S.–China relations also warmed. Diplomats held discreet talks on May 2. They agreed to start formal trade negotiations on Friday, May 16 (U.S. Trade Representative’s Office, May 2, 2025). Traders interpreted the move as a sign of reduced friction in goods and capital flows. Market Internals Signal Divergence Not every indicator cheered the rally. On Coinbase Pro, Bitcoin’s price premium versus global benchmarks slipped into negative territory on May 9. U.S. traders paid a slight discount, marking the first negative premium in six weeks. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant reported record-high short interest among institutional funds on that same day. Funds increased bearish positions as prices climbed. The setup resembles prior short squeezes, where forced buy-ins accelerate rallies. Bulls point to China’s liquidity surge and the Fed’s hold. They see the thaw in U.S.–China ties as a further catalyst. They argue that cross-border flows may increase with formal trade talks slated for May 16. They add that record shorts on major funds set the stage for a short squeeze. If those bets unwind quickly, Bitcoin could vault past $100,000. Bears, however, urge caution. They note the negative Coinbase Pro premium as a warning sign. They argue that U.S. demand may lag overseas buying. They worry that heavy short positions reflect more profound skepticism. Those shorts could reinforce selling if policy easing disappoints or trade talks stall. They also flag lower Asian volume during Golden Week from May 10 to May 16. Thin liquidity could exaggerate price swings in either direction. Bitcoin’s climb to just over $104,000 captured a moment of policy tug-of-war. Beijing’s easing and Washington’s steady rates offered mixed signals. Improving U.S.–China ties hinted at smoother trade. Yet market internals from negative U.S. premiums to peak shorts paint a complex picture. BTC/USDT Chart| Source: TradingView Whether FOMO will push Bitcoin towards a new all-time high (ATH) remains open. Traders will watch for forced short-covering and volume shifts as Asia reopens after Golden Week. They will track updates from Beijing, the Fed, and USTR announcements. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $103,782, having dropped 0.65% over the last 24 hours.

A temporary rollback of U.S.-China tariffs triggered a significant risk-on sentiment across financial markets. According to analysis from crypto trading firm QCP Capital , shared via their Telegram channel, this move lifted equity markets while simultaneously putting pressure on traditional safe-haven assets like gold. But how did the digital asset space, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum , fare in this environment? How Did the Tariff Rollback Impact the Market Rally? When trade tensions ease, investors often feel more confident taking on risk. This is the classic ‘risk-on’ behavior. The temporary tariff rollback signaled a potential de-escalation, prompting a broad market rally in assets perceived as riskier, such as stocks. This flow of capital into equities often means a flow *out* of assets seen as less risky or used as hedges, like gold. The initial reaction in the crypto market was a brief dip for both Bitcoin and Ethereum , likely a knee-jerk reaction or perhaps profit-taking in volatile conditions, before stabilization occurred. Bitcoin’s Position Amidst Macro Uncertainty While the broader market rally provided a positive backdrop, Bitcoin ‘s reaction has been somewhat muted. QCP Capital notes that BTC dipped initially but has since stabilized. However, it still seems to be lacking a clear directional bias. Why might this be the case? Bitcoin often acts as a barometer for overall macro liquidity and risk appetite, but it also faces unique pressures. The lingering macro uncertainty, despite the temporary tariff news, could be keeping BTC in a holding pattern. Investors might be waiting for clearer signals on inflation, interest rates, or further geopolitical developments before committing strongly in either direction for Bitcoin . Ethereum Showing Structural Strength: What Did QCP Capital Observe? In contrast to Bitcoin ‘s sideways movement, Ethereum appears to be exhibiting more robust momentum, according to QCP Capital . They highlight that ETH is showing ‘stronger structural momentum’. This isn’t just about short-term price pumps; ‘structural strength’ suggests underlying factors are building a more solid foundation for future growth. This observation from a firm like QCP Capital , known for its derivatives trading insights, carries weight. What factors are contributing to this perceived strength in Ethereum ? The Pectra Upgrade: This upcoming network upgrade is highly anticipated. While details are technical, these protocol improvements are designed to enhance Ethereum’s efficiency, scalability, and security. Future network enhancements are crucial catalysts for investor confidence in a blockchain’s long-term viability and utility. Increased Interest in Long-Dated Options: QCP Capital specifically points to rising interest in long-dated Ethereum options. Options contracts that expire far in the future indicate that market participants are willing to bet on Ethereum’s price performance over a longer time horizon. This suggests bullish sentiment and confidence that ETH’s value will appreciate significantly in the coming months or even years, looking past immediate market volatility. These two points combined paint a picture of an asset class within the crypto market – Ethereum – that has fundamental and forward-looking drivers supporting its value proposition, potentially more so than Bitcoin in the current specific macro environment, as highlighted by QCP Capital ‘s analysis of the market rally fallout. Why the Divergence Between Bitcoin and Ethereum? It’s not uncommon for Bitcoin and Ethereum to show different price dynamics, especially when specific fundamental factors are at play for one but not the other. While Bitcoin remains the dominant force and often moves based on broad macro themes and institutional flows, Ethereum ‘s price can be significantly influenced by developments specific to its network – upgrades, DeFi activity, NFT trends, and staking dynamics. The Pectra upgrade and the options market activity are prime examples of ETH-specific catalysts that can create divergence from BTC’s price action, even within a general market rally context influenced by events like the tariff rollback. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While Ethereum shows promising signs of structural strength, the broader crypto market is not without challenges. The macro uncertainty mentioned by QCP Capital still looms. Geopolitical risks, inflation concerns, and potential shifts in central bank policies could quickly change the market sentiment. However, for investors and traders, this divergence also presents opportunities. Understanding the specific drivers behind assets like Ethereum , beyond just the general market trends influenced by events like a tariff rollback and subsequent market rally , can inform more nuanced trading and investment strategies. Actionable Insight: Pay close attention to fundamental developments specific to blockchains like Ethereum, as they can provide uncorrelated catalysts compared to Bitcoin and the broader macro environment. Monitor options market data for signs of institutional or long-term conviction. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Moment in the Spotlight? The temporary U.S.-China tariff rollback provided a jolt to the global financial system, triggering a risk-on market rally that also touched the crypto market . While Bitcoin remains stable but directionless amidst ongoing macro uncertainty, Ethereum , according to QCP Capital , is demonstrating stronger structural momentum. This strength appears to be underpinned by positive forward-looking factors like the anticipated Pectra upgrade and increasing confidence reflected in the long-dated options market. While macro headwinds persist, Ethereum ‘s specific catalysts suggest it might be carving out its own path, making it a key asset to watch closely in the current market landscape.

Pi Network ( PI ) token was trading at $1.1475 at press time, down 31% from its highest point on Monday. This retreat has brought its market cap to $8 billion, making it the 19th biggest coin in the industry. Pi Coin price Elliot Wave points to a comeback The Elliott Wave is a popular analysis approach that identifies five stages assets go through during a bull market. The first, third, and fifth phases of the impulsive Elliott wave are usually bullish, with the third one being the longest. On the other hand, the second and fourth waves are usually corrective phases. The eight-hour chart shows that the Pi Network price rallied from this month’s low of $0.5572 to a high of $1.6638, a 200% surge, as we had predicted here and here . This rally formed the first phase of the Elliott Wave as it ended at the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. The coin then pulled back and bottomed at $0.9105 on Tuesday, forming the second Elliott Wave. Therefore, if this pattern works, it means that it may surge to the 78.60% retracement point at $2.455, up 116% from the current level. The other potential bullish catalyst for the Pi Network is that it is slowly forming a bullish pennant pattern. This is a common pattern comprising a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. A bullish breakout happens when the two lines of the triangle near their meeting point. You might also like: A 90-year-old theory suggests the Pi Network price may surge soon Pi Network price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential Pi Network catalysts The main reason why the token may move into the third phase is that the developers have teased a major announcement at the Consensus event in Toronto. There are a few potential news events that may push its price higher. The most notable one would be an exchange listing by a major company like Binance, Coinbase, Upbit, or HTX. If the upcoming news is a listing, odds are that it will be HTX, a company that has sent several cryptic X posts with a Pi logo, as shown below. Which crypto's are refueled & ready? 🚀 pic.twitter.com/pKswRdzcyx — HTX (@HTX_Global) May 13, 2025 Another major news item could be an initiative to incentivize developers to build applications using Pi Network’s technology. Most of the biggest blockchains like Avalanche ( AVAX ), Sonic ( S ), and Cronos ( CRO ) have already done so. The developers confirmed in an X post that the announcement will focus on the ecosystem. One of the main criticisms of the Pi Network is that it is a ghost chain with little developer activity. Any announcment that would fuel growth and activity in the network, leading to higher fees and token-burning activity, would be well received. By highlighting the “ecosystem” in the teaser, the Core Team likely ruled out an exchange listing, as such announcements typically originate from the exchanges themselves. Pi Network may also aim to ease the tensions around its token unlocks by announcing a big burn. Such a move would be possible as the Pi Foundation holds billions of tokens in its addresses.

44572239,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159969,1747149644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Major US Recession Avoided? Barclays Forecasts Brighter Economic Outlook and Future Fed Rate Cuts,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/barclays-us-recession-forecast/,"For those navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and broader financial markets , keeping an eye on the macroeconomic landscape is crucial. A significant update from British investment bank Barclays is making waves, as they’ve revised their economic outlook for the United States, moving away from a previous forecast that anticipated a US recession . What’s Changed in the Barclays Forecast? Previously, Barclays had projected a mild economic downturn, specifically a US recession occurring in the second half of 2025. This type of forecast often sends ripples through global financial markets , as a recession in the world’s largest economy can impact everything from consumer spending to corporate profits and, consequently, investment sentiment across asset classes, including digital assets. However, the bank has now shifted its stance. According to reports citing Walter Bloomberg on X, Barclays no longer sees a recession on the horizon for late 2025. This represents a notable change in their perspective, suggesting a more resilient U.S. economy than previously modeled. How Does This Impact Fed Rate Cuts? The change in the Barclays forecast on the US recession outlook is closely tied to expectations around monetary policy, particularly actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Central banks like the Fed often cut interest rates during or in anticipation of economic slowdowns to stimulate activity. If a recession is no longer expected, the timing and pace of potential Fed rate cuts can also shift. Barclays has updated its projections for when the Federal Reserve might begin easing monetary policy. Their new forecast anticipates three 25 basis point (bps) rate cuts from the Fed in 2026. These cuts are specifically projected to occur in: March 2026 June 2026 September 2026 This updated timeline suggests Barclays believes the Fed will maintain its current stance for longer than some might have expected, given the removal of the near-term recession forecast. The market’s interpretation of when and how aggressively the Fed will cut rates is a major driver of asset prices, including bond yields, stock valuations, and even indirectly, cryptocurrency prices. Why is this Economic Outlook Important for Financial Markets? The economic outlook provided by major institutions like Barclays serves as a key data point for investors and analysts trying to predict future market movements. Here’s why this specific revision is significant: Confidence Indicator: Removing the recession forecast signals increased confidence in the U.S. economy’s ability to achieve a ‘soft landing’ – where inflation is brought under control without triggering a significant downturn. Monetary Policy Clues: The specific timing and number of expected Fed rate cuts provide potential clues about the path of interest rates, which affects borrowing costs, corporate investment, and consumer spending. Risk Appetite: A more optimistic economic outlook generally encourages greater risk appetite among investors, potentially benefiting growth-oriented assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies, although the link is not always direct or immediate. Planning for the Future: Businesses and individuals use these forecasts to make decisions about investment, hiring, and spending. It’s important to remember that these are forecasts, and economic conditions can change rapidly. However, a revised Barclays forecast from recession to no recession is a notable development that warrants attention from anyone involved in financial markets . What Could This Mean for Crypto? While the Barclays report focuses on traditional macroeconomic indicators and the Federal Reserve, changes in the broader economic outlook and interest rate environment invariably influence cryptocurrency markets. Lower interest rates, when they eventually arrive, can make riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins relatively more attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing investments like bonds. Conversely, if the Fed keeps rates higher for longer because the economy is perceived as strong (as implied by the removal of the recession forecast), this ‘higher for longer’ scenario can sometimes act as a headwind for risk assets. However, a strong economy also means more disposable income and potentially more institutional interest in various asset classes. The key takeaway for the crypto community is that while digital assets operate on their own technological and adoption cycles, they are not immune to the tides of the global economy. Monitoring updates like the Barclays forecast on the US recession and Fed rate cuts provides valuable context for understanding the broader market sentiment and potential future liquidity conditions. Navigating Economic Forecasts: Actionable Insights How should market participants interpret this news? Here are a few points to consider: Diversify Information Sources: No single forecast is definitive. Look at reports from various institutions to get a well-rounded view of the economic outlook . Understand the ‘Why’: Try to understand the reasons behind the forecast revision. What data points or trends led Barclays to change their view on the US recession ? Focus on Trends, Not Just Dates: While specific dates for Fed rate cuts are interesting, the overall trend of monetary policy (tightening vs. easing) is often more impactful over the medium term. Assess Market Reaction: Observe how financial markets react to this news. Does it align with Barclays’ view, or are markets pricing in something different? Consider Your Own Strategy: Use economic insights to inform, but not dictate, your investment strategy. Your personal financial goals and risk tolerance should always be the primary drivers. This revised forecast from Barclays is a piece of the puzzle in the complex global economic picture. It suggests a more optimistic path for the U.S. economy than previously thought, potentially influencing the timing of future Federal Reserve actions and, by extension, sentiment across various financial markets , including the fascinating world of crypto.

Tokens like Pepe, dogwifhat, FLOKI, or Brett have also soared with a double-digit margin. Meanwhile, one of the memecoins, Degen, quietly attracted massive volume and triggered an over 120% jump and reached one of the important resistance levels. Hence, the DEGEN price is expected to maintain a healthy ascending trend as the bulls appear to be poised for a massive breakout. The Farcaster-born memecoin has been surging by over 55% in the past 24 hours to reach local highs at $0.0086. In the era of copy-paste memecoins, DEGEN stands out not just for its name but for its purpose. Farcaster is one of the most active social protocols, which rides on Base’s blazing-fast rails. Degen, which has become more than a token for the protocol, is facing some upward pressure after a huge surge. However, it can be considered a catapult action as a 200% upswing is on the horizon. The DEGEN price is following a particular pattern of forming a consistent ascending and descending trend. In a wider perspective, the price is about to form a huge double-bottom pattern as it advances towards the neckline. Besides, the price has reached a similar trend between the 50- and 200-day MAs, which reflects the pattern formed in October 2024. A breakout from the 200-day MA resulted in a 400% rise, and the current bearish pressure is at the same levels, validating the bullish claim. Therefore, the DEGEN price is expected to initiate a fresh bullish action once the memecoin successfully breaches and sustains above the range. Once done, a 200% rise may push the price to $0.025 and after small consolidation, the token may rise into the discovery phase to mark a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|FLOKI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 15:24:21

The deal values WonderFi shares at 36 Canadian cents each—a 41% premium to their last closing price. The acquisition continues Robinhood’s strategy of evolving beyond its origins as a commission-free stock trading platform and building a more diverse financial ecosystem. Crypto Briefing @Crypto_Briefing · Follow Robinhood agrees to acquire Canadian crypto trading giant WonderFi for $178 million, enhancing its position in the rapidly growing digital asset market Watch on Twitter View replies 8:34 PM · May 13, 2025 9 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Strengthening Robinhood’s crypto infrastructure WonderFi brings with it a suite of Canadian crypto platforms, including Bitbuy and Coinsquare, both well-established in the country’s digital asset trading space. In fiscal 2024, WonderFi facilitated over C$3.57 billion in trading volume, a 28% year-over-year increase, aligning well with Robinhood’s growing base of crypto-savvy users. Despite operational growth, WonderFi’s stock struggled in 2025—down 13.6% on the Toronto Stock Exchange before the announcement. Its market cap stood at C$163.9 million, making Robinhood’s offer a notable premium and a clear sign of strategic confidence in the acquisition. All WonderFi employees will transition to Robinhood, expanding the firm’s Canadian workforce to over 140. The move is expected to bolster customer support and deepen Robinhood’s understanding of the Canadian regulatory and investor landscape. Crypto M&A heats up in 2025 This acquisition adds to a wave of major cryptocurrency mergers and acquisitions in 2025. Earlier this year, Coinbase acquired Deribit, a crypto options exchange, for $2.9 billion, while Ripple snapped up prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. The flurry of deal-making signals renewed investor confidence and increased institutional activity in the digital asset sector. This resurgence has been supported by favorable regulatory signals from President Donald Trump’s administration, which has encouraged innovation in the crypto space. Bitcoin prices have surged in 2025, even amid broader global economic concerns, suggesting a shift in long-term investor sentiment toward digital finance. Robinhood’s evolving strategy Robinhood’s acquisition spree, including its $200 million purchase of crypto exchange Bitstamp in 2024, highlights its commitment to scaling its crypto operations. By acquiring established platforms like Bitbuy and Coinsquare, the company gains both market access and a ready user base in Canada. The strategy reflects Robinhood’s broader mission to serve as a gateway to decentralised and borderless financial services. While volatility persists in financial markets—the S&P 500 is down 0.6% in 2025—Robinhood appears focused on the long-term digital transformation of finance. The WonderFi acquisition marks another bold step in that direction.

The country’s Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih said the kingdom will pour that amount into the US economy over the next four years. He made the statement at the Saudi-US Investment Forum while Trump met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the Saudi Royal Court. The forum was held at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center, with senior figures from both countries in attendance. The investment plan, according to Khalid, ties directly to Mohammed’s goals under Vision 2030. Khalid said , “This initiative comes within the framework of achieving the aspirations of Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman.” The relationship between the two countries, he added, goes back almost a century, and this investment is just part of building on that. Trump arrives with Elon Musk, Sammy Altman, and Jensen Huang Trump didn’t show up alone. He brought along his current best friend Elon Musk, Elon’s archenemy Sammy Altman, and Nvidia’s brilliant CEO Jensen Huang, all of whom met with Mohammed before the forum began. They shook hands and joined the investment talks. Trump stood for both the US and Saudi anthems at the court, which had trumpets blaring as the purple carpet rolled out. That carpet color was introduced in 2021, with the Saudis saying lavender represents generosity and wildflowers. During the meeting, Trump leaned into his usual informal tone. He introduced Elon as his “buddy,” called the gathering an “honor,” and said of the Crown Prince, “I really believe we like each other a lot.” He added that Mohammed was “very wise, wise beyond his years.” The visit included comments about job creation, with Trump saying the deals on the table could lead to “probably two million jobs” back home, though he didn’t explain what industries would be involved. Trump said, “They are going to walk away with a lot of cheques or a lot of things that you are going to provide.” He didn’t specify the deals or timing. He did say he enjoys seeing Mohammed and that “they have known each other very well.” Khalid Al-Falih lays out full Saudi investment plan Khalid praised the strength of the delegations present, pointing out that the size and caliber showed how serious both governments were. He reminded the audience that the long-term alliance began in 1945 with a meeting between King Abdul Aziz and Franklin Roosevelt. He said the relationship had always been based on energy demand, Saudi ambition, and American tech. He noted that the partnership had led to the creation of Saudi Aramco, one of the world’s most powerful companies. And while oil remains important, he said the real focus now is economic expansion across sectors. Khalid listed areas like mining, construction, hospitality, tourism, AI, renewable energy, data storage, and cloud computing. He claimed that these new projects were helped by the stability of Saudi Aramco’s policies. He said the government’s effort to steady the market had helped bring down inflation and reduce financial instability. He also pointed out that Saudi’s credit rating had gone up despite international volatility, thanks to the kingdom’s large cash reserves and minimal economic fluctuations. Khalid said, “The Kingdom has the lowest rate of economic volatility and fluctuations,” and emphasized how these factors have drawn investors. He added that the Saudi stock market is now among the ten biggest and fastest-growing globally. On top of that, he said the venture capital industry in the country is taking off fast. He also presented the annual Vision 2030 report, saying the government is successfully reaching its goals of building a non-oil economy. He said new investment opportunities are already growing, especially in banking, biotech, and tech. “Investment and business opportunities in the Kingdom have expanded significantly under Vision 2030,” Khalid told the crowd.

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design , and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust. Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps. What is tsUSDe, and why use it? TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin ( TON ). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed. But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more yield. It’s like putting your dollars to work while still staying in stable territory. Where to earn yield with tsUSDe Right now, two of the most active platforms for tsUSDe yield farming on TON are: STON.fi — known for smooth UX and deep liquidity DeDust — fast, lightweight and gaining traction fast. Both let you pair tsUSDe with TON and stake your position to earn trading fees plus additional farming rewards. Did you know? STON.fi has a built-in impermanent loss calculator to help you gauge risk before adding liquidity, while DeDust offers a full portfolio dashboard to track tokens, LPs and rewards in one place. Step-by-step: How to earn yield with tsUSDe 1. Connect your wallet Go to STON.fi or DeDust.io, connect your TON wallet , and make sure you have some TON in your balance to cover transaction fees. 2. Pick a tsUSDe liquidity pool Head to the “Pools” or “Farms” section and find a tsUSDe/TON pool. You’ll see estimated APY numbers, which vary depending on trading volume and incentives. On STON.fi, for example, this pool sometimes hits 30%+ APY . 3. Add liquidity Click “Add Liquidity,” then enter the amount of tsUSDe you want to supply. You’ll also need to supply the same dollar value in TON. Once confirmed, you’ll get LP (liquidity provider) tokens showing your share of the pool. 4. Stake to boost rewards Now, stake those LP tokens to earn extra farming rewards. On STON.fi, look for the “Farm” button next to your position. On DeDust, use the “Boost” feature. Once staked, you’ll start earning even more TON on top of trading fees . 5. Monitor and claim rewards You can check your rewards anytime and claim them whenever you want. You’re in full control; you can unstake or remove your liquidity whenever it suits you. What are the benefits of passive income with tsUSDe? Passive income with tsUSDe comes with unique advantages for users, including: Dollar stability: tsUSDe aims to stay pegged to $1, so your base savings aren’t volatile. Built-in APY: tsUSDe earns ~10% just sitting in your wallet. Extra rewards: Farming lets you boost returns even more through TON incentives. Non-custodial: You keep control of your assets the whole time. What about the risks of TON stablecoin yield? Earning yield with TON stablecoins comes with certain risks to be aware of, such as: Impermanent loss: If TON’s price changes significantly, your share of the pool may shift, reducing your value when you withdraw . Smart contract risk: As with any DeFi platform, there’s always a risk of bugs or exploits . Stablecoin peg risk: tsUSDe is designed to stay at $1, but extreme situations could cause a temporary depeg . Stick with well-known platforms and don’t invest more than you’re comfortable with. Did you know? TON supports TON Proxy , a decentralized anonymity protocol inspired by networks like Tor and I2P. TON Proxy allows users and nodes to obfuscate their identities and traffic. Earn APY with tsUSDe, but carefully If you’re already holding tsUSDe, putting it to work on TON is a no-brainer. You get a solid base yield, plus a chance to earn more through farming — all while keeping your savings in dollars. Whether you go with STON.fi or DeDust, the setup is quick, and the returns can add up fast. Start small, be aware of risks, monitor your rewards, and make your stablecoins work harder.

44572569,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159983,1747150248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum’s Potential Ascent: Could ETH Stunningly Surpass Bitcoin?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-surpass-bitcoin-analysis/,"Is the cryptocurrency landscape on the verge of a significant shift? Recent market movements and analyst commentary suggest that Ethereum (ETH) might be gearing up for a performance that could see it challenge, or even surpass, Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming years. This isn’t just casual speculation; prominent voices in the investment world are drawing parallels to past bull markets where Ethereum demonstrated explosive growth, hinting at a potentially powerful Ethereum price prediction . Why Are Analysts Bullish on Ethereum Now? Several factors are fueling this optimistic outlook on Ethereum. Analysts like Nick Tomaino of 1confirmation and Jim Bianco of BiancoResearch are pointing to key indicators suggesting Ethereum’s current trajectory is mirroring patterns seen in previous bull cycles, notably the 2017 and 2021 rallies. They observe that Ethereum is currently outperforming Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains over recent periods. Nick Tomaino highlights Ethereum’s foundational role in driving innovation across the decentralized web. He notes Ethereum’s clear dominance in critical and rapidly growing sectors: Stablecoins: Digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, crucial for trading and transfers within the crypto ecosystem. DeFi (Decentralized Finance): A suite of financial applications built on blockchain, offering services like lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Ethereum is the undisputed leader in this space. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens): Unique digital assets representing ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles, primarily minted and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. Decentralized Social Networks: Emerging platforms aiming to offer social media functionality free from central control, with many choosing Ethereum for their base layer. Furthermore, Tomaino points to the increasing adoption by major traditional and crypto-native firms. Companies like Coinbase, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Visa are actively building or integrating with the Ethereum platform, signaling significant institutional confidence and expanding the network’s real-world utility. Drawing Parallels to Past Rallies: An Ethereum Analysis Jim Bianco brings a market analysis perspective, emphasizing Ethereum’s recent price action. A notable surge of 38% within a short 72-hour window caught his attention. Bianco suggests that this kind of rapid upward movement could be a precursor to more substantial gains, drawing comparisons to Ethereum’s performance during the 2021 bull market where it saw significant appreciation, partly fueled by the DeFi and NFT booms happening on its network. This historical context is vital for understanding the potential implications of the current market dynamics and forms a key part of any comprehensive Ethereum analysis . The comparison between the current market and the 2017 and 2021 cycles is based on observing how altcoins, particularly Ethereum, tend to perform relative to Bitcoin once a bull market gains momentum. Bitcoin often leads the initial charge, acting as the primary gateway for new capital entering the space. However, as confidence grows and investors seek higher returns, capital tends to flow into altcoins, with Ethereum typically being the first and largest beneficiary due to its established network effects and utility. Understanding the Core Differences: Bitcoin vs Ethereum To fully appreciate the conversation around whether ETH can surpass BTC, it’s essential to understand their fundamental differences: Bitcoin (BTC): Primary Use Case: Store of Value, Digital Gold Technology: Designed primarily for peer-to-peer digital cash (though store of value became dominant narrative) Supply: Fixed supply of 21 million coins Consensus: Proof-of-Work (Energy Intensive) Ethereum (ETH): Primary Use Case: Decentralized Platform for Applications (Smart Contracts) Technology: A programmable blockchain enabling complex applications (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc.) Supply: No fixed supply, but issuance mechanism changed significantly with The Merge (potentially deflationary under certain conditions) Consensus: Proof-of-Stake (Energy Efficient) This difference in purpose is crucial. While Bitcoin’s value is primarily derived from its scarcity and status as a decentralized store of value, Ethereum’s value is tied to the activity and innovation happening on its platform. The more applications built, the more transactions processed, and the more value locked in DeFi, the stronger the demand for ETH (used for gas fees and staking) becomes. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength: More Than Just Price The analyst predictions are not solely based on price charts; they are deeply rooted in the strength and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum’s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) significantly reduced its energy consumption and paved the way for future scalability upgrades (like sharding). This technical evolution makes the network more sustainable and capable of handling a larger volume of transactions, addressing some of its previous limitations. The network effect is also a powerful driver. Because so many developers, users, and projects are already on Ethereum, it becomes the default choice for new innovations in the decentralized space. This creates a virtuous cycle: more innovation attracts more users, which attracts more developers, further solidifying Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform. This robust ecosystem is a key component when evaluating the future Crypto market outlook . Challenges and What Could Impact the ETH vs BTC Race Despite the bullish sentiment, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty is a major factor that could impact both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Governments globally are still figuring out how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies, and unfavorable regulations could stifle innovation or adoption. Competition from other smart contract platforms (often dubbed “Ethereum killers”) is also a factor. While none have yet dethroned Ethereum, networks like Solana, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain offer alternatives that compete for developers and users, often promising higher speeds or lower fees. However, Ethereum’s established network effect and ongoing scalability solutions via Layer 2 networks (like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, etc.) help it maintain its lead. Market volatility is another constant. While analysts can predict potential trends, the crypto market is known for its sharp and unpredictable price swings, which can be influenced by macroeconomic factors, global events, or sudden shifts in sentiment. What This Means for the Future Crypto Market Outlook The possibility of Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin, often referred to as “The Flippening,” has been a topic of discussion for years. While Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most recognized brand, Ethereum’s utility and the vibrant ecosystem built upon it present a compelling case for its long-term growth potential. The analysts’ recent comments suggest that the conditions might be aligning for Ethereum to make a significant move relative to Bitcoin. This doesn’t necessarily mean Bitcoin will decline; rather, it highlights Ethereum’s potential for disproportionate growth fueled by the expansion of decentralized applications and institutional integration. A strong performance from Ethereum could also be seen as a positive sign for the broader altcoin market and the overall health of the decentralized web. Conclusion: Watching the Race Unfold The predictions from respected analysts like Nick Tomaino and Jim Bianco add weight to the argument that Ethereum’s current momentum, driven by its dominance in key crypto sectors and increasing institutional adoption, could lead to it outperforming Bitcoin. While the future is never certain and challenges exist, the fundamental strength of the Ethereum ecosystem and the historical parallels drawn by analysts make a compelling case for its potential ascent. As the market evolves, the race between these two crypto giants remains one of the most fascinating narratives to watch in the ongoing Crypto market outlook .

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose by around 2%, hitting $3.48 trillion. However, it dropped 1.7% the next day to $3.28 trillion as investors booked profits ahead of the US CPI data release. Bitcoin saw its price drop to an intraday low of $101,871 before recovering to trade near $103,376, marking a 0.5% increase over the past 24 hours. Ethereum also declined, reaching a low of $2,411 but recovered to $2,508 by late asian trading hours. Will Bitcoin crash again? With trade tensions easing, BTC reached an intraday high of $105,525 before shedding some of the value by late Asian trading hours. The catalyst behind Bitcoin’s breakout appears to be de-escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Over the weekend, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice President He Lifeng agreed to reduce tariffs in a deal signed in Geneva. Starting May 14, both nations will cut their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period, down significantly from current levels of 145% and 125%. The shift in tone has renewed risk appetite, helping lift risk-sensitive assets like Bitcoin, which had been under pressure during the prolonged trade war. Analysts say the improved liquidity backdrop and reduced geopolitical uncertainty are historically favourable for crypto rallies. Adding to the momentum was the release of April’s CPI data, which showed annual inflation cooling to 2.3%. The lower-than-expected reading eased fears of prolonged tightening by the Federal Reserve and further boosted risk appetite. Bitcoin found itself in the middle ground, benefiting from renewed risk appetite like equities, but lacking the retreat seen in traditional hedges. In the meantime, on-chain analysts pointed to increasing liquidity concentration around the $102,000 to $103,000 zone. Well-followed commentator Daan Crypto Trades noted on X that BTC had “swept most nearby liquidity” after consolidating in the $103K–$105K range. CoinGlass data supported this view, showing dense liquidation clusters just below current levels, around the $103,000 mark. Analysts are watching this range closely to gauge whether the recent breakout has more room to run or if a pullback is likely. However, one thing analysts agreed on was the fact that volatility is expected as long as Bitcoin trades in this area. “It’s about to get seriously volatile for $BTC. Sharp wicks down, sharp wicks up,” wrote trader James Wynn, in an X post earlier in the day. Wynn also referred to CoinGlass data, highlighting a buildup of sell orders near $106,000. Bulls need to clear this zone with strong momentum to confirm further upside, he said, adding that he expects BTC to rally toward $140,000–$160,000, with a potential top forming in July. To maintain upward momentum, Bitcoin needs to reclaim and hold above $106,000, an area now acting as immediate resistance, a view echoed by analyst Haris Khan, who also identified this level as a key breakout threshold in the current cycle.

He pointed to the firm’s Cryptoasset Sentiment Index, which has reached its highest reading since November 2024. According to Dragosch, similar peaks in April 2022, October 2023, and late 2024 were followed by either short-term corrections or periods of sideways price action. This rising optimism, he warned, could be overextended, increasing the likelihood of a near-term pullback despite Bitcoin’s favourable long-term trajectory. Nevertheless, fellow analyst CrypNuevo remained firmly bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, citing key historical signals in play. According to him, Bitcoin recently completed a successful retest of its 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), which currently sits around $80,300. This level has acted as a launchpad for new all-time highs in previous cycles. Based on this trend, CrypNuevo believes Bitcoin is now positioned to make a new all-time high in the coming weeks. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows echoed a similar sentiment. See below.

Altcoin market holds steady With Bitcoin trading sideways, the altcoin market remained relatively steady, with total market capitalisation edging up by just 0.73% to $1.40 trillion. The slowdown was reflected in the Altcoin Season Index, which fell three points to 34 on Tuesday, down from its weekend reading. However, according to Nansen’s Aurelie Barthere, the suspension of further tariff hikes removes the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which may allow altcoins to follow Bitcoin’s lead in the coming weeks. For a full-fledged altcoin season to unfold, Bitcoin may need to give up more market dominance, currently sitting at 61.8%, according to market watchers. Notably, the 71% dominance level is viewed as a key reversal zone that has historically preceded significant altcoin rallies. Prominent crypto analyst Crypto Rover, however, believes that the shift may already be underway. In a May 11 post, Rover declared that “Phase 2 is starting,” referencing a four-phase rotation cycle that historically leads to explosive gains across the altcoin sector.

The buying frenzy happened during the fallout of President Donald Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, which caused major volatility in global markets and crushed confidence in the US dollar. As capital looked for somewhere stable to land, investors turned to Japan, treating it as a safe place to stash funds in the middle of a chaotic global economy. The Japanese Ministry of Finance confirmed this week that the country saw ¥8.2 trillion worth of net foreign purchases in April alone. That number blows past anything in the records going back to 2005 and is more than three times the typical April average from the past 20 years. The inflows included $25.5 billion into Japanese equities, which hasn’t been seen since April 2023, and $31.5 billion into long-term bonds, the highest since July 2022. Global central banks poured cash into Japan Traders said the bond surge likely came from central bank reserve managers who needed to move money out of US assets fast. A big chunk of the buying landed in Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs)—seen as a liquid and stable option during uncertain times. Yujiro Goto, chief FX strategist at Nomura, said the size of long-term bond purchases “significantly exceeded” what’s typical for April. More importantly, he pointed out how unusual it was to see investors go hard into both bonds and stocks at the same time. Yujiro explained that the action looked like a de-dollarisation play, with foreign investors moving out of the US and into Japan, where the markets are big and stable enough to handle that much capital. Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at the Bank of Singapore, said the flood of money into Japan happened after investors got spooked by Trump’s economic policies, including his trade war and public shots at Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell. “There is probably some truth to the idea that Japan was seeing the effects of de-dollarization in April,” Mansoor said. He explained that when central banks diversify their reserves, they’re looking for liquid markets, and Japan fits that profile better than most. This week, Trump agreed to pause new tariffs on China for 90 days, which helped calm things down a little. But it’s still unclear whether that slowdown will stop the flow into Japanese markets. On May 9, Bank of America released new data from its institutional investor survey. Nearly every fund manager surveyed said Trump’s economic policies would lead to stagflation in the US That’s slow growth combined with rising prices. The survey also found that betting against the US dollar had become the most common trade among managers since Trump’s reciprocal tariff move. Even with the fear, BofA analysts said the dollar’s status wasn’t dead yet. They said the currency’s position “remains intact in absolute terms and relative to all viable alternative currencies.” Investors might be nervous, but the dollar still has no real replacement.

In a May 13 filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Eric Council Jr.’s legal team asked that he be sentenced to no more than one year and one day in prison following his guilty plea. Council was part of a group that took control of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) X account in 2024 through a SIM swap attack, posting a message that suggested the regulator had approved spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded fund listings for the first time. “A sentence of twelve months and one day serves the ends of justice,” said the May 13 filing. “It sufficiently punishes the defendant for his role in this case. It also promotes respect for the law and deters future criminal conduct.” Eric Council Jr.’s sentencing recommendation, filed on May 13. Source: PACER Council initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but changed his plea to guilty in February on one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. The judge overseeing the case, Amy Berman Jackson, also ordered prosecutors to “identify the felony and point to where that information can be found in the record” by May 13. Prison sentence between 1 and 2 years? The SEC hacker is scheduled to be sentenced on May 16. Prosecutors asked the judge to impose a two-year sentence on Council, saying he “profited through a sophisticated fraud scheme.” Court filings showed he earned roughly $50,000 through similar SIM swap attacks.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptocurrency-giant-robinhood-increases-its-activity-in-the-canadian-market-with-a-major-acquisition-here-are-the-details/,"Robinhood has announced plans to acquire Canadian crypto platform WonderFi in an all-cash deal valued at approximately CAD$250 million (approximately USD$180 million), marking a significant expansion of its international digital asset ambitions. Robinhood to Acquire Canada's WonderFi in $180 Million All-Cash Deal Under the terms of the deal, Robinhood will pay CAD$0.36 per share to acquire all outstanding shares of WonderFi. The deal is expected to close pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. Once completed, the acquisition will allow Robinhood to deepen its footprint in Canada’s growing crypto market. WonderFi, known for its user-friendly digital asset trading platform and partnerships with licensed Canadian exchanges, will retain its product offerings post-acquisition. Its team will be integrated into Robinhood Crypto, where they will focus on serving Canadian customers and accelerating crypto innovation in the region. “This acquisition helps us advance our mission to democratize finance globally,” said Robinhood Crypto General Manager Johann Kerbrat. “WonderFi’s strong presence in Canada gives us a solid foundation as we expand our crypto offerings internationally.” Robinhood’s move comes amid broader efforts to grow its crypto business globally. The company, which recently launched crypto wallets and expanded its token offerings, is now aiming to gain a foothold in Canada, one of the most active regulated crypto markets. Backed by high-profile investors like Kevin O'Leary, WonderFi has become a major player in Canada's digital asset space, particularly after merging with Bitbuy and Coinsquare to create a more robust platform under its own brand. In a joint statement, the companies highlighted their shared commitment to regulatory compliance and user safety, citing Canada’s strong framework as a key advantage. If approved, this would be Robinhood’s first major international crypto purchase. *This is not investment advice.

Robinhood has signed an agreement to acquire @WonderFi , a Canadian leader in crypto products. We’re excited to partner with WonderFi to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada. More details: https://t.co/B2ygTDYOPw pic.twitter.com/9u1c0vJeWV — Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) May 13, 2025 With over C$2.1 billion in assets under custody and a strong portfolio that includes Bitbuy and Coinsquare, WonderFi has positioned itself as a key player in Canada’s crypto sector. Post-acquisition, WonderFi will continue operating its existing products, while its leadership and employees will integrate into Robinhood Crypto . The deal marks a milestone in Robinhood’s ongoing effort to build a global financial ecosystem, with Canada serving as a strategic hub. Robinhood’s user-centric, low-cost platform aligns closely with WonderFi’s mission of broadening access to crypto. Johann Kerbrat, SVP and GM of Robinhood Crypto, emphasized the synergy between the two companies, calling WonderFi “an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada.” Robinhood’s Canadian headquarters, established in Toronto in 2024, already hosts over 140 employees and serves as an infrastructure engineering hub. WonderFi Shareholders to Receive All-Cash Consideration Under the terms of the agreement, Robinhood will acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of WonderFi for C$0.36 per share in cash. This will be executed through a statutory plan of arrangement under British Columbia’s Business Corporations Act. The total equity value of the deal stands at approximately C$250 million on a fully diluted, in-the-money basis. WonderFi President and CEO Dean Skurka expressed confidence in the alignment of the companies’ missions. “We’re delighted to be joining the Robinhood team and to supercharge our product offerings for customers,” he said. Bobby Halpern, Executive Chairman of WonderFi, added that the all-cash offer represents the culmination of years of development, creating a launchpad for further growth under Robinhood. Purchase Price Represents a 41% Premium The purchase price reflects a 41% premium to WonderFi’s closing share price on the Toronto Stock Exchange as of May 12, 2025, and a 71% premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average price. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to shareholder, court, and regulatory approvals. J.P. Morgan advised Robinhood, while Financial Technology Partners advised WonderFi, and received legal and fairness-opinion support from several prominent Canadian firms. Robinhood Plans Blockchain-Based Trading for Europe Robinhood is developing a blockchain-based platform that will allow retail investors in Europe to trade U.S. securities, including stocks. The initiative will likely be launched in partnership with a digital-asset firm. Both Arbitrum, a blockchain overlaid on Ethereum, and Solana have been under consideration for the collaboration, though discussions are still ongoing. This move to offer tokenized U.S. securities aligns with a broader trend in the financial industry.

Among the top contenders is a promising emerging token that has recently garnered significant attention for its unique technology and strong growth projections. All eyes are also on a rising utility token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 70% sold out, already raking in over $8.1 million with over 9,800 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. Keep an eye on this promising altcoin as it has all the ingredients for a breakout, alongside the ongoing Bitcoin rally. Bitcoin’s surge above $100,000: what it means for the future of cryptos Bitcoin’s recent move above the $100,000 threshold has re-energized the crypto market, and that the banner digital asset is poised on the brink of entering a fresh bullish homestretch. This amazing price move reaffirms Bitcoin’s role as the leading cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin’s continued ascent past $103,000, the increase is likely to cause its dominance to move market sentiment to affect the movements of altcoins. Nonetheless, the story going on about Bitcoin’s new surge isn’t the only story out there. Other cryptos such as Mutuum Finance are paying attention, and preparing themselves for a break out, making them a strong bet for diversifying portfolios for investors. Mutuum Finance might very well head down the path of Bitcoin in the not too distant future, with room for growth expected to far outpace BTC. Mutuum Finance: genuine innovation in DeFi lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale momentum At today’s $0.025, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 5 20% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-cap DeFi plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building momentum at a high pace and here is a unique chance to join in early before it shoots to $0.03 in Phase 5 of the presale. More than 9,800 investors have already signed up, taking the raise to $8.1 million. With the next price increase imminent and Phase 5 on the horizon, time is fast running out to prelock potential 140% gains prior to public launch at $0.06.

The token has now recovered from its session lows after the U.S. reached a deal with China to cut tariffs from 90 days while they negotiate a final agreement. Tariffs will stand at 10% on both sides for the time being. During a roundtable that discussed the topic of tokenization, Chairman Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto official appointed by the Trump administration, highlighted that “the Commission must keep pace with innovation and consider whether regulatory changes are needed to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets.” It is a new day at the SEC. Policymaking will no longer result from ad hoc enforcement actions. Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 12, 2025 He emphasized that the agency will do everything in its power to fulfill the President’s vision of making America the “crypto capital of the world.” This is a positive development that favors a bullish XRP price forecast . XRP Price Forecast: Elliott Wave Analysis Gives $7 Target So far in 2025, and despite the bear market that took place during the first quarter, XRP has delivered gains of 22.7%, making it the best-performing crypto asset of the top 5 during this period. Meanwhile, trading volumes in the past 24 hours have kept surging and currently sit at $10.6 billion, accounting for 7.2% of the token’s total circulating supply. Buying pressure is at its highest point in months as market sentiment has improved in the past month. After bouncing off the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), XRP may have gathered the necessary fuel to start moving to new heights. The first and most relevant resistance up ahead is the $3.4 level. A bullish breakout above this price zone will confirm the target highlighted in the chart of $7.14 as it would mark the beginning of wave #5 for XRP. Moving forward, as long as the 200-day EMA support holds, any pullbacks should be considered a buying opportunity. XRP’s prospects are quite promising but the highest upside potential during altcoin season will likely come from the best crypto presales like SUBBD (SUBBD). SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $400,000 to Launch its Decentralized Content Distribution Platform SUBBD (SUBBD) is launching a new platform for content creators that leverages the power of blockchain technology to help them keep a higher share of their earnings and avoid the unfair bans imposed by centralized alternatives. Since its presale event kicked off in early April, the project has raised $400,000 to start building the SUBBD ecosystem. The $SUBBD token will allow creators to get a say in the platform’s governance and will allow them to cash out their earnings almost instantly. Meanwhile, fans will get discounts, early access to new features, and the possibility of paying for custom requests through the use of this token. More than 2,000 creators with a combined following exceeding 250 million users have already been brought in to SUBBD. As their fans progressively embrace this new platform, the demand for the ecosystem’s native asset will explode. To buy SUBBD at its discounted presale price, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

According to Whale Insider, XRP achieved an impressive $1.2 billion in retail trading volume on Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, highlighting a significant shift in investor sentiment and market dynamics. XRP’s Ascendancy in South Korea The surge in XRP’s trading volume is not an isolated incident but part of a broader trend observed across major South Korean exchanges. On Upbit, XRP accounted for a staggering 27.6% of the total trading volume, amounting to $3.7 billion in 24 hours, vastly outpacing Bitcoin’s $340 million during the same timeframe. Similarly, Bithumb reported $1.2 billion in XRP trading volume, representing 32% of its total volume, further emphasizing XRP’s dominance in the region. JUST IN: $XRP leads the pack in South Korea with $1.2 billion in retail trading volume, overtaking $BTC and $ETH – Upbit. pic.twitter.com/8jrzC0pu2T — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) May 13, 2025 Factors Driving XRP’s Popularity Several factors contribute to XRP’s burgeoning popularity among South Korean investors . One significant element is the ‘Kimchi Premium,’ a phenomenon where cryptocurrency prices in South Korea trade at a premium compared to global markets. This premium often leads to increased trading activity as investors seek arbitrage opportunities. Additionally, South Korea’s vibrant crypto community, known for its enthusiasm and rapid adoption of digital assets, has played a pivotal role in propelling XRP’s trading volumes. The country’s investors are often early adopters of emerging cryptocurrencies, and XRP’s recent performance has captured their attention. Implications for the Global Crypto Market XRP’s dominance in South Korea has broader implications for the global cryptocurrency market. The significant trading volumes and investor interest in the region can influence XRP’s global price and liquidity. Moreover, the trend underscores the importance of regional markets in shaping the dynamics of digital asset trading. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As XRP continues to gain traction in South Korea, it may attract increased attention from international investors and exchanges, potentially leading to greater adoption and integration into various financial systems. The developments in South Korea could serve as a bellwether for XRP’s performance in other markets, highlighting the interconnected nature of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. In conclusion, XRP’s unprecedented rise to the top of South Korea’s cryptocurrency market, as reported by Whale Insider, signifies a notable shift in trading patterns and investor preferences. The combination of local market dynamics, investor behavior, and global interest positions XRP as a cryptocurrency to watch in the evolving digital asset landscape.

During this period, the token has produced gains of 153.2% as Solana meme coins have faced significant buying pressure. This token, which will eventually be rebranded as ElizaOS, offers access to a decentralized AI trading bot. Its name resembles that of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which is also known as a16z. According to its website, the project’s goal is to first launch a trading bot that can produce 20% yearly returns solely by investing primarily in meme coins and DeFi tokens . However, the creator of ai16z, Shaw Walters, ultimately decided to pivot to AI agent tokens and launched ElizaOS, a platform through which users can deploy AI agents. You can deploy Eliza and have users chatting with your docs in minutes. Here's an example: https://t.co/jZU4XAI4jo And here's the source code to get started: https://t.co/28jXVmYzVA pic.twitter.com/GeGVzHNfMt — Shaw (@shawmakesmagic) May 11, 2025 This pivot was initially criticized and resulted in a significant downturn for ai16z. However, as market sentiment continues to improve, this meme coin has benefited and rallied to the point of becoming the 16th most valuable asset in this category with a market cap of $390 million. AI16Z Price Prediction: This Meme Coin Could Rise to $1 After ‘Golden Cross’ In the past 24 hours, ai16z has retreated by 3.6% as trading volumes have cooled down a bit. The daily chart shows that AI16Z broke above its 21-day EMA on April 22 and also managed to reverse its downtrend as it surged above its nearest lower highs. Momentum indicators have been pushed to the extremes by this bullish price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already been hovering above overbought levels. A golden cross between the 21-day and 50-day EMA supports a bullish AI16Z price prediction that could propel AI16Z to at least $0.60 in the near term. With market sentiment improving significantly in the past month, the odds that this meme coin can rise to $1 are quite high. This would not be uncharted territory as AI16Z rose to an all-time high of $2.48 in January 2, 2025. Hence, if FOMO is strong enough, investors could easily push the token to at least $1 in a relatively short period. Similarly, the best crypto presales like MIND of Pepe (MIND) will also benefit from what seems to be the beginning of a fresh bullish cycle. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Gears Up to Wrap Up its Successful Presale – Don’t Miss Out MIND of Pepe (MIND) is an AI agent coin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. With the help of artificial intelligence, this AI agent plans to take social media platforms like X by storm. Since its presale event kicked off in January, MIND of Pepe has raised $9.15 million to deploy this powerful bot. As the agent interacts with high-profile accounts and regular users, it will progressively collect insightful information that it will pass on to $MIND holders exclusively. These insights include new opportunities in the meme coin space, popular presales, and emerging projects that are still flying below most investors’ radars. As its influence grows, the demand for $MIND will rise as well. Hence, at its discounted presale price of $0.0037515, this AI agent coin could deliver significant gains to early buyers.

Mutuum Finance has already begun attracting attention from seasoned investors looking to take advantage of its enormous upside potential. The altcoin MUTM presale is already in phase four of its presale which is already over 70% sold out and the tokens are going for $0.025, and as luck would have it, the platform has raised $8.1 million. Over 9800 investors have already joined, with price set to hit $0.03 in the subsequent round. Investors in this round can expect up to 140% returns when the token’s projected launch price of $0.06 is realized. If history repeats itself, this altcoin could very well follow in Solana’s footsteps, turning modest investments of $500 into a staggering $50,000 as it rises in value. Mutuum Finance: A New DeFi Behemoth in the Making Mutuum Finance transforms the decentralized lending world through its exceptional dual borrowing system which drives broad market adoption. Mutuum Finance has gained support from over 9800 investors during its presale period which has resulted in raising $8.1 million for the project. Early adopters who participate in Phase 4 will benefit from monumental gains because the token price is $0.025 but Phase 5 will bring it to $0.03. According to experts MUTM has the potential to reach more than $5 by the end of this year beginning at its initial offering price of $0.06 due to its innovative lending system which addresses the growing requirements of DeFi platforms. The game-shifting model of Mutuum Finance drives its increasing popularity because it operates as a solid token although undervalued. A real-time leaderboard of the top 50 holders of MUTM has been activated by the project’s team. Successful token holders who do not fall below their position will be rewarded with bonuses that amplify both their position value and long-term investment in MUTM. The growing interest of investors in utility-based projects over hype-based projects is indicative of MUTM’s success at being able to demonstrate profitable substance-based cryptocurrency projects. Disrupting DeFi Lending with a Two-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi lending landscape with its innovative merge of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model is enabling users to earn passive income by lending their USDT through automated liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. Users can now start direct Peer-to-Peer transactions without depending on third parties because of the P2P model which gives users total control over their assets. Mutuum Finance combines the P2P system with P2C to provide streamlining operations and profitable investment opportunities for users. Fueling Community Growth with Reward Programs To enhance its user base Mutuum Finance has established various incentive plans for acquisition. The platform devotes $100,000 to give ten investors each $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform provides rewards to users who successfully refer potential new users to join the platform. New users who join early receive extra advantages such as elite community communications which enhance their connection to the platform. Priced at just $0.025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a high-potential altcoin currently in Phase 4 of its presale, already over 70% sold out. The project has raised $8.1 million from nearly 10,000 investors and is gaining serious traction thanks to its unique DeFi lending model and strong community backing. A $500 investment at this stage has the potential to grow into $50,000, based on launch projections and expert forecasts. Secure your MUTM tokens before the price increases in Phase 5.

What’s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February’s breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, “Dogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!” Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled “Pre-Halving resistance” on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls “that key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support … Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19–$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ≈ +165 % (to $0.23) and ≈ +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: “DOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS … Next Price Target : $0.72.” His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital’s next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus’ lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin’s latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

It is the most valuable NFT collection, with a total market capitalization of nearly $1.2 billion across its 10,000 NFTs as of May 13, according to data from CoinGecko. The CryptoPunks collection was launched in 2017 by Larva Labs, an NFT designer co-founded by Hall and Watkinson. Since then, the NFTs have clocked upward of $3 billion in sales, according to NODE. Each NFT sale creates royalties for the holders of the NFTs’ IP. In 2022, the highest-grossing CryptoPunk NFT sold for nearly $24 million, according to CryptoPunks’ website. The collection was purchased in 2022 by Yuga Labs, best known for designing the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection — the third-largest NFT collection by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko.

We still need a good week here to confirm a… pic.twitter.com/1IQQDeFYbx — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) May 12, 2025 Central to the analysis is the observation that XRP has been holding its previous range highs as support for approximately 25 weeks. The asset went on a historic run in late 2024 following former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation , climbing to a multi-year high of $3.39 in January 2025. Following this, it experienced a decline in early February and settled around $2. Since then, it has spent most of its time consolidating around this level, showing resilience and remaining above its 2021 peak of $1.96. Cryptoinsightuk noted that this sustained support forms a strong foundation for a potential breakout, especially as momentum indicators begin to turn. The Stochastic RSI on the weekly chart has also moved out of oversold territory. This typically precedes renewed upward momentum. Meanwhile, the standard 14-period RSI is recovering and approaching a potential bullish cross. Technical Setup Strengthens the Outlook Cryptoinsightuk stated that XRP “still needs a good week here to confirm a bullish cross,” but emphasized that the market conditions align favorably for bulls. If the RSI confirms the move, the analyst expects the asset to experience a surge similar to late 2024, with the possibility of an even more aggressive move.

Cryptoinsightuk acknowledged this positive altcoin performance, noting that market-wide momentum could skyrocket XRP. The chart reflects strong buyer interest during recent dips, as whales accumulated 900 million tokens last month. According to the analyst, if XRP experiences a bullish RSI crossover, it could be the final technical signal to trigger a major move. XRP’s current price action reflects this strengthening outlook. The asset is trading at $2.57, marking a 9.27% increase from the previous day. The rise follows not only favorable technical indicators but also positive developments in the legal and macroeconomic landscape, and this analysis suggests that XRP could soon experience an aggressive rally.

According to a recent update from Coin Bureau, this remarkable accomplishment is driven by the addition of over 638,000 new non-empty wallets since the start of 2025, representing an impressive 11% increase in holders. This surge in adoption highlights the growing confidence in XRP amid evolving market conditions and regulatory developments. XRP is about to hit 6.5M holders for the FIRST time in its 12+ year history! Since the start of 2025, over 638K new non-empty wallets have joined—an 11% increase! What’s next for $XRP ? pic.twitter.com/3VftFOa1no — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) May 13, 2025 Factors Driving XRP’s Surge in Holders The increase in XRP holders is indicative of several intertwined factors. One of the most significant contributors is the rising adoption of blockchain technology and digital assets on a global scale. As cryptocurrencies gain more mainstream acceptance, XRP has maintained its position as a leading asset, particularly due to Ripple’s proactive approach in the financial sector. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships and collaborations with financial institutions worldwide have also played a pivotal role in driving interest. As Ripple continues to integrate its technology into traditional banking systems and enhance cross-border payment solutions, more users are recognizing the potential of holding XRP as part of a diversified crypto portfolio. Another catalyst is the increasing adoption of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, within its payment network . This integration has created a more robust ecosystem for users, allowing them to leverage both stable and volatile assets seamlessly. Consequently, more wallets are becoming active, reflecting the utility and stability provided by Ripple’s expanding product line. Legal Developments and Their Impact The legal landscape surrounding XRP has been a critical aspect of its adoption journey. The prolonged legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has kept many investors on edge. However, recent developments have provided some relief and clarification. In 2023, Judge Torres ruled that XRP, when traded on digital-asset exchanges, does not constitute a security. This ruling significantly boosted investor confidence, despite the court’s simultaneous finding that XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities regulations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Future Projections With XRP on the brink of breaking the 6.5 million holder mark, market sentiment remains notably optimistic. Analysis from EGRAG Crypto projected that XRP could trade between $2.50 and $4.45 by the end of 2025, while CCN.com presents a more bullish outlook, estimating a range between $4.05 and $6.15. These forecasts are based on current adoption trends, technical analysis, and potential regulatory clarity. As the number of holders continues to climb, XRP’s resilience and utility within the blockchain ecosystem are becoming increasingly apparent. Whether through strategic partnerships or favorable legal outcomes, XRP’s position in the market seems increasingly secure, presenting opportunities for long-term growth. The anticipated milestone of reaching 6.5 million holders is a testament to XRP’s enduring appeal and the strategic initiatives undertaken by Ripple Labs. As market conditions evolve and legal challenges are navigated, XRP’s growing adoption signals its robustness as a digital asset. The crypto community remains hopeful that Ripple’s continued efforts will propel XRP to new heights, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone in the ever-expanding world of blockchain finance.

With many opinions and options in the market, finding the best casino that meets your requirements can be challenging. So, whether you are a beginner seeking to deepen your toes into playing casinos or a seasoned player, join me as we explore the top 10 crypto casinos to play this year. With a wealth of experience in the crypto industry, we will shift gears into casinos that accept crypto, scrutinizing their offerings, user experiences, and security measures. Luckily, I have tried and tested the platforms, so I’ll save you the hassle of reading countless online reviews and signing up for multiple platforms to find the best one. What are crypto casinos? Crypto casinos are a form of online gambling platform with a twist. The platforms integrate blockchain technology, revolutionizing how we fund and cash out on the platforms using cryptocurrencies. The platforms promise transparency, security, and innovative gameplay, captivating the attention of avid gamblers and tech enthusiasts alike. 2025 unveils a spectrum of possibilities, and I am here to guide you through the top 10 crypto casinos that I find promising. Selection criteria Navigating the digital gambling landscape demands a discerning eye, not a roll of the dice. Here is my selection criterion for curating the best crypto casinos for 2025. Game variety and quality: The platform had to provide various game offerings. Some games on my checklist include classic table games, live dealer options, and innovative slots. However, the number didn’t count if the game qualities were poor; the platforms had to excel at providing a rich and engaging gaming experience. Security features: While blockchains are unhackable, smart contracts governing how we interact with the blockchain can have loopholes that bad actors can use to manipulate the platforms. The platforms of choice had to have extra security measures such as encryption protocols and multi-factor authentication. User data privacy and secure playing environments were a priority. Payment options and wagering requirements: With thousands of cryptocurrency contracts available in the market in 2025, it is fair that the top 10 cryptocurrencies support a variety of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a fiat currency. Another important aspect was the wager requirements; the players had to enjoy their winnings without complications. Bonuses and promotions: Bonuses and promotions are an exhilarating aspect of every gambling experience. My checklist included welcome bonuses for new players, loyalty rewards, and cashback offers. The bonuses and promotions are a top reason to revisit a platform repeatedly. User experience: The best crypto casinos go beyond enticing offers, providing an intuitive user interface for their player community. Factors I considered included responsive customer support, ease of navigation, and player reviews. Good crypto casinos give their players an easy time to immerse themselves in the excitement of gambling. Innovative features and technology: With the ever-evolving tech landscape, it was important for the platforms to exhibit some form of innovation. I considered the unique features and partnerships that alleviated the overall offering of the digital casino. Top platforms set trends. Reputation and player feedback: I scouted player reviews, testimonials, and community forums to gauge the experiences of fellow gamblers. The best platforms had to garner at least 7 out of 10 stars in the reviews section. Top platforms garner positive feedback and have a track record of satisfied players. Players guide – Advice for choosing the right crypto casino in 2025 Here is some advice for navigating the crypto casino landscape. Remember, casinos are high-risk platforms where you can quickly lose your hard-earned money. Take is a roadmap to select your best platform from my top 10 crypto casino list. Define Your Priorities: What matters to you in a crypto casino? Casinos will rank differently on a scale of parameters. So, are you looking for an extensive game selection, robust security, specific crypto deposits and withdrawals, or generous bonuses? Your priorities will help you quickly sieve through the list. Game Variety and Quality: Game varieties can significantly impact your satisfaction with a crypto casino. Pick a platform with diverse games, from classic table games and slots to live dealer experiences. The games must also be of high quality. Security Measures: While most security features are in the backend, you can play your part by looking for features like two-factor authentication and the platform’s approach to fair gaming and instant payouts. The platform should state its commitment to protecting user privacy and funds. Payment Options: The platform must accept crypto, particularly the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Diverse payment options ensure you can conveniently and quickly cash in and out without a hassle. Bonuses and Promotions: Explore the bonuses and promotions the casinos have to offer. Look beyond the surface-level numbers and scrutinize the terms and conditions. Pay attention to wagering requirements, time limits, and whether the bonuses align with your gaming preferences. User-Friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface can significantly enhance your gaming experience. Assess how easy it is to gamble on the platform, how often, and how fast you can cash out your gains. How easy is it to navigate to another game? How smooth are live game experiences? A user-friendly interface ensures you can focus on the games, not the navigation. Customer Support: The crypto market is live 24/7, and so should customer support. A reliable support team can make a significant difference in resolving any issues or answering queries promptly. Mobile Compatibility: Mobile applications are fast becoming a default feature of any gaming application. The platforms should provide a seamless experience on a tablet or PC device. It should be compatible with your operating system, allowing you to enjoy your favorite game on the go. Regulatory Compliance: Gambling casinos are highly regulated. Check on the regulations in your jurisdiction and ensure the platform operates within the legal frameworks in your area. Licensed casinos provide an extra layer of assurance regarding fair play and financial security.

Here are features that crypto casinos employ to ensure security: As mentioned, crypto casinos leverage the transparency and integrity of blockchain ledgers. A blockchain ledger is immutable and, therefore, immune to risk or fraud Some platforms employ smart contracts that players can scrutinize to verify the fairness or outcome of a game. Multi-factor or two-factor authentication adds an extra security layer preventing unauthorized access by third parties. Cryptocurrencies are famous for their anonymity, which means limited exposure of a player’s personal information in the case of a data breach. While the platforms can go a long way to providing multiple security features, a player can cause a security breach. Ensure safe storage of your passwords, and enable the security features provided by a gaming platform such as 2FA. Are crypto casinos legal?
