Here’s What the Charts Suggest,https://bitzo.com/2025/05/can-near-and-render-regain-momentum-to-reclaim-january-highs-heres-what-the-charts-suggest,"NEAR and RENDER showed impressive gains earlier this year, but can they bounce back to those peak levels? Recent chart movements provide potential hints and signals of what's ahead for these cryptocurrencies. Readers will discover the technical indicators suggesting possible upward trends and the factors influencing the future performance of these digital assets. NEAR Protocol Surge Amid Six-Month Pullback and Key Level Trade Opportunities Over the past month, NEAR Protocol recorded a notable 53.40% increase, alongside a 37.94% weekly boost, showcasing a sharp recovery in the short term. Despite this, the coin experienced a significant 40.10% decline over the last six months, reflecting difficulties in its longer-term trend. Price movements indicate rapid gains occurring within an overall context of downward pressure. The current price fluctuates between $1.944 and $2.858, with support around $1.42 and resistance at $3.25. Recent gains have been driven by bulls, but there is no clear trend as bears remain active near resistance. Trading strategies may include cautious buying at support and potential selling near resistance should momentum weaken. Upward Surge Amid Wider Volatility and Cautious Momentum Last month, RENDER saw a significant surge of about 43.59%, while the six-month performance decreased by approximately 26.02%. This indicates a mixed trend, with short-term gains near 23.90% suggesting some bullish energy despite the longer-term downturn. The price movements reveal a volatile pattern, with a quick monthly recovery contrasting with a broader decline seen over the half-year period. Recent fluctuations have attracted renewed attention, highlighting the dynamic nature of the market despite ongoing instability. Currently, RENDER trades between $3.06 and $5.33, facing immediate resistance at $6.18 and support at $1.65, with a second resistance level at $8.45. Bullish signals from a 65.67 RSI and positive momentum indicators suggest potential upward movement, though oscillators caution against overextending. Trading strategies should focus on buying near support while watching for opportunities to capitalize on breakouts or pullbacks near resistance levels. Conclusion The charts indicate potential signs of recovery for both NEAR and RENDER . Technical indicators show an upward trend might be forming. If buying pressure continues, these coins could challenge their January highs. Monitoring key support and resistance levels will be crucial. Both projects have strong fundamentals that may bolster investor confidence. Overall, the possibility exists for NEAR and RENDER to regain momentum, but sustained growth will depend on broader market conditions.

Currently trading at $1.05, THETA has rallied over 38.2% in the past month, signaling renewed market interest. The platform’s foundational dual-token model—with THETA for governance and TFUEL for operational use—continues to support content delivery networks and real-world utility. With a circulating supply of 1 billion tokens, a revitalized development roadmap, and strong industry partnerships, Theta’s consistent upward movement positions it as one of the best crypto assets to watch this quarter. While Theta has firmly established Itself, Qubetics ($TICS) represents the next big step in blockchain adoption. Built to close the gap between Web3 ideals and real-world application, Qubetics integrates tools that enhance privacy, utility, and economic efficiency. Its Decentralized VPN solution is particularly impactful, offering businesses, remote professionals, and digital-first participants a secure, scalable, and censorship-resistant way to access global services. With privacy becoming a core pillar of Web3 architecture, Qubetics delivers practical features that past-generation chains failed to address—making it a top contender for the best crypto to buy right now. At the same time, BNB is making headlines with institutional momentum and bullish forecasts. Priced at $616, BNB recently saw trading volume double to $753 million. The excitement follows VanEck’s proposal for a BNB ETF, which would allow institutions to access BNB while earning staking rewards. Backed by Binance’s unmatched infrastructure, BNB also caught attention from Standard Chartered, which forecasts a 360% increase to $2,775 by 2028. This projection underscores growing confidence in BNB’s long-term utility as the primary token powering Binance Smart Chain. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN Access and Unmatched Presale Traction Qubetics is emerging as the go-to network for community members seeking functionality and forward-compatible infrastructure. Its Decentralized VPN feature ensures encrypted, uninterrupted internet access—empowering users with censorship resistance and data protection without reliance on centralized intermediaries. For remote workers and enterprise users alike, this solution offers a powerful way to bypass geo-restrictions, secure sensitive data, and maintain performance across jurisdictions. Traditional VPNs lack the decentralization and transparency Qubetics enables. That distinction is quickly making it one of the best crypto to buy right now. The platform’s momentum is best reflected in its thriving presale. Stage 34 of the Qubetics presale is live, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.2532. To date, more than 512 million tokens have been sold to over 26,200 holders, raising over $16.9 million. Participants who entered at Stage 1 for $0.01 have already locked in a 2,432% return, a rare early-stage success story in today’s maturing digital asset space. Presale Performance and ROI Projections For those just discovering the project, it’s far from too late. Entering the crypto presale at the current $0.2532 price still presents compelling upside. A move to $1 would yield a 294% ROI, and if $TICS reaches $5, participants could see a 1,874% return. Analysts point to ROI potential as high as 5,822% if $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch. These figures highlight why Qubetics is consistently named among the best crypto to buy right now. Qubetics is also deploying platforms like QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE to support decentralized application development, further strengthening its long-term value and ecosystem depth. With active community engagement and real-world application at its core, $TICS is more than a token—it is a critical piece of the blockchain infrastructure of the future. Theta (THETA): The Engine Behind Decentralized Streaming Theta Network has long been a quiet performer with real-world use cases. It brings decentralization to video content delivery, challenging centralized models with more efficient and cost-effective alternatives. With THETA serving governance and TFUEL powering transaction fees and streaming rewards, the dual-token economy is engineered for performance and scalability. Currently trading at $1.05, Theta has rebounded sharply, up more than 38% month-over-month. While it’s still well below its all-time high of $15.90, technical indicators point to continued recovery, driven by ecosystem upgrades and partner integrations. Theta’s use case is both accessible and proven: content delivery, bandwidth sharing, and user-driven infrastructure. The token’s consistent progress and revival in market sentiment make it one of the best crypto to buy right now, particularly for backers seeking innovation outside of traditional finance. Theta delivers functional decentralization with active adoption, renewed price momentum, and real-world relevance in media and entertainment sectors. BNB: Institutional Adoption and Blockchain Dominance Binance Coin (BNB) is redefining what large-scale utility looks like in digital finance. The token is at the center of one of the largest blockchain ecosystems globally—Binance Smart Chain—and its usage spans trading fee discounts, staking, payments, and liquidity operations. As of May 2025, BNB is trading at $616 and gaining traction from both retail and institutional channels. Two major events are fueling the surge in market attention. First, Standard Chartered’s forecast projects a rise to $2,775 by 2028, a trajectory supported by Binance’s unparalleled dominance in global exchange volumes. Second, VanEck’s proposed BNB ETF introduces the potential for regulated, Wall Street-compatible exposure to BNB, along with staking rewards—an offering that could attract billions in institutional capital. Recent data shows that BNB’s daily volume has surged to $753 million, reflecting a significant uptick in activity and positioning. With critical infrastructure already in place, high-volume liquidity, and ecosystem-wide integration, BNB is a foundational asset for anyone serious about the digital economy. These developments reinforce its position as one of the best crypto to buy right now, especially for participants looking to engage in network utility and scalability. BNB combines unmatched utility, strategic market positioning, and institutional credibility, creating a compelling asset for the present and future market cycle. Final Thoughts Real momentum is forming across the digital asset landscape, and community members are increasingly aligning with projects that deliver measurable value. Theta is showing strong signs of revival, built on a working decentralized video ecosystem. BNB, backed by dominant infrastructure and the possibility of an SEC-approved ETF, is capturing both attention and capital. But it’s Qubetics that holds a unique position—offering a rare blend of early-stage access, real-world use cases, and rapid community growth. With its decentralized VPN, real-time application in digital privacy, and a presale currently in Stage 34, Qubetics offers substantial upside for early participants. Entry at $0.2532 can still deliver ROI ranging from 294% to 5,822%, depending on how post-launch performance unfolds. Time is a crucial factor, and those waiting on the sidelines may miss out as momentum builds into Stage 35. For backers searching for the best crypto to buy right now , the choice lies in identifying assets that combine innovation, scale, and timing. Qubetics, Theta, and BNB each fulfill these criteria—with Qubetics offering a particularly rare entry point still open.

For those following the intersection of cutting-edge tech and investment, Google’s latest move is significant. Google has announced a new initiative aimed squarely at fostering the next wave of innovation in AI. Google AI Launches New Investment Fund Google recently unveiled its AI Futures Fund. This initiative is designed to back startups that are leveraging the advanced AI tools developed by Google DeepMind, the company’s leading AI research and development lab. The fund signals Google’s commitment to supporting founders who are pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. The AI Futures Fund is structured to provide support across various stages of a startup’s growth, from early seed funding to later-stage rounds. This flexibility ensures that companies at different points in their journey can potentially benefit from Google’s resources and expertise. Support and Benefits for AI Startups Participation in the AI Futures Fund offers several key advantages for selected startups. These benefits go beyond just financial investment: Early Access to Google AI Models: Startups can gain early access to cutting-edge AI models from DeepMind, giving them a competitive edge in development. Expert Collaboration: Founders have the opportunity to work directly with experts from both DeepMind and Google Labs, tapping into deep technical knowledge. Google Cloud Credits: Access to Google Cloud resources is crucial for AI development, and the fund provides credits to help startups scale their operations. Direct Investment: Some companies will receive direct venture capital investment from Google, providing essential funding for growth. A Google spokesperson clarified that the fund operates on a rolling basis, meaning there are no fixed application windows or deadlines. Opportunities are considered as they arise for companies aligning with the fund’s goals. While a specific fund size wasn’t disclosed, check sizes will vary based on the startup’s stage and needs. Early Success Stories and Application Details The AI Futures Fund has already seen participation from several startups, serving as early case studies. Examples include Viggle, a platform focused on meme creation, and Toonsutra, a webtoon application. These examples highlight the diverse range of applications the fund is interested in supporting. Startups interested in applying for the AI Futures Fund can begin submitting their applications starting May 12. Google’s Broader Commitment to AI Investment The AI Futures Fund is part of a larger pattern of significant commitments Google has made to advance AI technology and talent.

Prior to that, in September, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a $120 million Global AI Opportunity fund aimed at expanding AI education and training worldwide. Google.org also launched a $20 million generative AI accelerator program specifically for nonprofits developing AI tech. Google also operates its Google for Startups Founders Funds, which supports founders across various industries, including AI.

Stablecoins have become a “political hot potato” ahead of next month’s presidential elections, South Korean media outlets wrote on May 12. Aju Kyungjae quoted the Bank of Korea (BOK) as stating that it alone should have the legal authority to approve plans to launch a won-based stablecoin. South Korean Central Bank: Stablecoin Showdown Ahead? Koh Kyung-chul, the head of the BOK’s electronic finance unit, explained: “Stablecoins would have a significant impact on the implementation of central bank policies such as monetary policy and financial stability, as well as payments and settlements.” The Bank of Korea, in downtown Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Otraff [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The bank official added that the BOK should be involved from the “initial” stage. This will ensure that “any negative impact on central bank policy is minimized,” Koh said. Koh added that the BOK should also be granted input should lawmakers decide to create stablecoin-related legislation. The official explained: “Legislation design is important. This will help build a stable and sustainable digital payment ecosystem.” The BOK appears to be concerned that a won-pegged stablecoin could replace the demand for legal currency. This, it worries, could have a significant knock-on effect for monetary policy. Bank officials say they are aware that US dollar-pegged stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are already being used in place of the dollar in cross-border trade operations. The central bank has already spoken about stablecoins at length this year. In its payment and settlement report last month, the BOK warned: “Stablecoins can infringe upon monetary sovereignty and undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy. A careful review is necessary before they are approved.” Earlier this month, the BOK Governor Lee Chang-yong issued another stablecoin warning. The Governor said that USDT “and other stablecoins” would “likely bypass South Korean capital regulations and foreign exchange regulations.” Lee Chang-yong concluded that stablecoin regulation “is an urgent matter.” However, the presidential frontrunner and Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung recently claimed that South Korea “must create a won-based stablecoin market.” The DP leader spoke about KRW-pegged coins. He said that South Korea must “enter the stablecoin market quickly” or risk an “outflow of national wealth.” Seoul shares open higher on hopes for US-China trade deal #Kospi #Kosdaq #stocks #updates https://t.co/Tfr4Vw6HPx — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) May 12, 2025 ‘Terra Collapse Should Serve as a Warning’ Lee Jae-myung’s comments sparked a backlash from Lee Jun-seok, the candidate for the Reform Party. The latter accused the DP candidate of making “dangerous and experimental” economic promises. He also said that Lee Jae-myung had failed to learn the lessons of the calamitous collapse of the Terra ecosystem and its KRW-pegged stablecoin in May 2022. Lee Jun-seok said that his rival was “bandying plausible-sounding words” like “stablecoin” about “without understanding anything about the market.” Several Lee Jae-myung allies have jumped to the frontrunner’s defence. An ex-DP MP accused the Reform Party leader of failing to “familiarize himself with the basic concepts of global financial regulation.” South Korea’s ruling conservatives opted for a right-wing candidate as the official campaign for the presidential election kicked off https://t.co/Y0hXiJQ0SS — Bloomberg (@business) May 12, 2025 Should Lee Jae-myung win power on June 3, he and his party may find themselves at loggerheads with the BOK. The DP lawmaker Min Byung-deok last month unveiled a private member’s bill entitled the Digital Asset Basic Act (literal translation). Min’s bill stipulates that the regulatory Financial Services Commission, not the BOK, should be given the sole authority to approve stablecoin issuances.

LTC price has approached the final major resistance in its journey towards retesting the all-time high. Litecoin (LTC) price opened the third week of May 2025 in a bullish outlook, after rallying more than 23 percent last week. The veteran altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.77 billion, gained around 2.4 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $102 on Monday, 2025 during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which led to over $709 in net liquidations today, nearly $2 million involved LTC leveraged trades. Furthermore, Litecoin’s futures open interest surged over 9 percent in the last 24 hours to hover about $691 million at the time of this writing. Litecoin Records Robust Fundamentals As one of the top-tier altcoin that is secured through the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, the Litecoin network has attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors. According to on-chain data analysis, the Litecoin network continued to process over 1 million transactions per week, thus having processed over 25 million transactions year-to-date. Meanwhile, institutional investors, led by fund managers, continue to press to offer regulated Litecoin’s investment products such as ETFs and ETPs. Last week, Valor Inc., a digital asset management wing firm for DeFi Technologies, unveiled LTC’s ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. In the United States, several fund managers, led by Canary Capital, continue to pressure the U.S. SEC to approve Litecoin ETFs soon. LTC Price Eyes ATH Following a successful rebound from a multi-year rising logarithmic trend in the past few weeks, LTC price has approached a crucial liquidity zone of around $107. Since the Litecoin network undertook its third halving on August 2, 2023, LTC price has mostly consolidated below $107 to date. However, LTC’s macro-bullish momentum has gained significant traction in the recent past. In the weekly timeframe, LTC’s MACD line is almost crossing the Signal line amid growing bullish histograms. A consistent close above $107 will propel LTC price toward its all-time high in the subsequent weeks. However, a possible rejection at about $107 will lead to another correction towards the support level of about $81.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-12 23:30:08
44543781,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159657,1747092629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto.com Dubai Partnership: Pioneering Public Service Crypto Payments,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-com-dubai-payments/,"Get ready for a significant leap forward in how you interact with government services in one of the world’s most forward-thinking cities! The news is official: Crypto.com has joined forces with Dubai Finance (DOF) to enable cryptocurrency payments for public service fees. This isn’t just a technical integration; it’s a bold statement about Dubai’s commitment to embracing the future of finance and solidifying its position as a global hub for innovation and the digital economy. For anyone interested in the intersection of blockchain technology, government services, and major financial centers, the Crypto.com Dubai partnership is a game-changer. What Does the Crypto.com Dubai Partnership Entail? At its core, this collaboration is about making everyday interactions with government services more accessible and aligned with the evolving digital landscape. The partnership, announced via Dubai government media, leverages Crypto.com’s robust payment infrastructure to facilitate transactions using various cryptocurrencies. This means that residents, tourists, and businesses in Dubai holding supported digital assets will soon have the option to pay for a range of public services without needing to convert their crypto into traditional fiat currency beforehand for these specific payments. The key players are clear: Crypto.com: A major global cryptocurrency platform known for its exchange, wallet, and payment solutions. They bring the technical expertise and infrastructure to process crypto transactions securely and efficiently. Dubai Finance (DOF): The government entity responsible for managing Dubai’s financial affairs, including the collection of public revenues. Their involvement is crucial for integrating crypto payment options into the official payment systems. This isn’t merely an experiment; it signifies a strategic move by Dubai to integrate digital currencies into its operational framework, reflecting a broader vision for a cashless and digitally-driven economy. The focus is on providing convenience and choice while maintaining the necessary financial controls and transparency required for government transactions. Enabling Dubai Crypto Payments: A Step Towards Digital Maturity The ability to make Dubai crypto payments for public services marks a significant milestone. Historically, government payments have been one of the last frontiers for digital transformation, often relying on traditional banking systems or physical cash. By opening the door to cryptocurrency, Dubai is not only catering to the growing number of individuals and entities that hold digital assets but also streamlining payment processes. Consider the potential benefits: Increased Convenience: For crypto holders, paying directly in crypto eliminates the steps and potential fees associated with converting crypto to fiat. Efficiency: Digital payments, including crypto, can often be processed faster than traditional methods, potentially reducing administrative delays. Attracting Innovation: Offering crypto payment options reinforces Dubai’s image as a tech-friendly city, potentially attracting more blockchain companies and talent. Transparency (for some): While the end-to-end transparency of public finance is complex, the nature of blockchain transactions can offer a verifiable record of payment initiation. This move aligns perfectly with Dubai’s broader digital transformation agenda, which aims to make government services seamless, smart, and user-centric. Integrating Dubai crypto payments is a logical extension of this vision, pushing the boundaries of how citizens and businesses interact with public administration. The Vision Behind Crypto Adoption Dubai Dubai hasn’t been shy about its ambitions in the digital asset space. The emirate has actively sought to become a global leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency. This includes establishing regulatory bodies like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and creating special economic zones designed to attract crypto businesses. The crypto adoption Dubai strategy is multi-faceted, aiming to foster innovation, create jobs, and diversify the economy. Allowing crypto payments public services is a tangible outcome of this strategy. It demonstrates that the government is not just regulating the space but is also willing to adopt the technology itself. This sends a strong signal to the global crypto community that Dubai is serious about integrating digital assets into its financial ecosystem at a fundamental level. Key aspects of Dubai’s crypto vision include: Area Dubai’s Approach Regulation Developing clear frameworks (e.g., VARA) to provide certainty for businesses and investors. Infrastructure Encouraging the establishment of crypto exchanges, custodians, and service providers. Adoption Exploring use cases in real estate, tourism, and now, public services. Talent Attracting skilled professionals and entrepreneurs in the blockchain space. This partnership with Crypto.com is a concrete example of how Dubai is putting its vision for crypto adoption Dubai into practice, moving beyond theoretical discussions to practical implementation that impacts everyday life and business. How Will Crypto Payments Public Services Work in Practice? While the full technical details of the implementation are still emerging, the partnership suggests a streamlined process. Users are likely to interact with the existing government service portals or payment systems, where a new option for cryptocurrency payment will be presented. Upon selecting this option, they would likely be directed to a Crypto.com payment gateway or interface. Here’s a simplified potential flow: User accesses a Dubai government service portal to pay a fee (e.g., for a license renewal, utility bill, or fine). At the payment stage, the user selects ‘Pay with Cryptocurrency’. The system calculates the equivalent value of the fee in supported cryptocurrencies at the current exchange rate. The user is directed to a Crypto.com payment interface, possibly scanning a QR code or confirming via their Crypto.com app or wallet. The transaction is processed on the blockchain via Crypto.com’s infrastructure. Confirmation is sent back to the government portal, and the payment is registered. The specific cryptocurrencies supported will depend on the agreement and technical integration, but major ones like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Crypto.com Coin (CRO) are likely candidates. The partnership aims to make crypto payments public services as smooth and intuitive as possible, minimizing complexity for the end-user while ensuring the government receives the correct value in fiat or a stable equivalent. The Critical Role of the Dubai Finance Partnership The involvement of Dubai Finance partnership is absolutely critical to the success of this initiative. DOF is the custodian of the government’s financial systems and revenue collection. Integrating a novel payment method like cryptocurrency requires careful planning, technical integration, and adherence to financial regulations and reporting standards. DOF’s role likely includes: Defining which public services will accept crypto payments initially. Ensuring the correct calculation and reconciliation of crypto payments against fiat fee amounts. Managing the conversion of received crypto into fiat, if required, or holding it according to government policy. Integrating Crypto.com’s payment gateway securely into existing government financial infrastructure. Establishing accounting and reporting procedures for crypto transactions. This Dubai Finance partnership signifies government-level endorsement and integration, moving beyond private sector acceptance to official state-level adoption. It highlights the government’s trust in Crypto.com’s ability to handle these transactions reliably and compliantly within the regulatory framework VARA provides. Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits are significant, implementing crypto payments public services is not without its challenges: Volatility: The fluctuating nature of cryptocurrency prices requires robust mechanisms to ensure the government receives the correct fiat value at the time of the transaction. This is typically handled by the payment processor (Crypto.com) guaranteeing an exchange rate for a short window. User Education: Not everyone is familiar with using cryptocurrency. Clear instructions and support will be necessary to ensure broad accessibility. Regulatory Evolution: While Dubai has a framework, the global regulatory landscape for crypto is still developing, which could influence future policies. Technical Integration: Merging new payment systems with legacy government infrastructure can be complex. Security: Ensuring the security of transactions and user data is paramount. Addressing these challenges will be key to the successful and widespread adoption of this new payment option. The Crypto.com Dubai partnership will need to navigate these complexities carefully to build user trust and ensure seamless operation. Actionable Insights for Residents and Businesses For those in Dubai or planning to interact with its public services, this partnership presents new possibilities: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Dubai government channels and Crypto.com regarding which specific services will accept crypto payments and when the service goes live. Understand the Process: Familiarize yourself with how crypto payments via Crypto.com work to be ready when the option becomes available. Consider the Benefits: If you hold supported cryptocurrencies, evaluate whether paying public service fees directly offers convenience or other advantages for you. Watch the Trend: This move could pave the way for more businesses and services in Dubai to accept crypto, further boosting crypto adoption Dubai . This development isn’t just news; it’s a practical change that could affect how you handle everyday financial tasks in Dubai. Being prepared and understanding the implications is worthwhile. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Dubai and Crypto The partnership between Crypto.com and Dubai Finance to enable crypto payments public services is a landmark development. It’s a clear demonstration of Dubai’s proactive approach to integrating digital assets into its core financial infrastructure and executing its vision for crypto adoption Dubai . By facilitating Dubai crypto payments for essential services, the emirate is not only enhancing convenience for its tech-savvy population but also setting a precedent for other global cities. This Dubai Finance partnership with a major player like Crypto.com highlights the increasing maturity and real-world utility of cryptocurrencies. While challenges remain, the commitment shown by Dubai’s government is a powerful signal of the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. This is a pivotal moment, showcasing how innovative collaborations can push the boundaries of traditional finance and pave the way for a more digitally integrated future.

44544123,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159659,1747093224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breakthrough: SEC Chair Atkins Signals Pro-Crypto Regulatory Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-policy-shift/,"For years, the cryptocurrency industry in the United States has grappled with a regulatory landscape often described as uncertain, confusing, and primarily driven by enforcement actions rather than clear rules. This environment has created significant challenges for businesses and investors alike, stifling innovation and driving some activity offshore. However, a potentially transformative shift in the US crypto policy might be on the horizon, signaled by none other than SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Understanding the Shift in SEC Crypto Regulation In a significant announcement, SEC Chair Paul Atkins outlined a proposed new direction for the commission’s approach to digital assets. The core of this shift involves moving away from what has often been perceived as an ‘enforcement-first’ strategy towards a more predictable and transparent rule-based framework. This is a pivotal moment for SEC crypto regulation , suggesting a potential end to the era of ‘regulation by enforcement’ that has drawn considerable criticism from the industry and legal experts. The previous approach, while intended to protect investors, often left market participants guessing about how existing securities laws applied to novel digital asset structures. Companies frequently found themselves targeted by SEC enforcement actions without clear, pre-existing guidance on how to comply. This created a climate of fear and uncertainty, making it difficult for legitimate businesses to operate and innovate within the U.S. Chair Atkins’ comments, as reported by The Block, indicate a clear recognition of these issues and a commitment to addressing them head-on. The proposed rule-based approach aims to provide the clarity that the digital asset space desperately needs to mature and thrive under appropriate oversight. What Did Paul Atkins SEC Announcement Detail? Paul Atkins’ statement laid out several key areas where the SEC plans to implement changes and provide updated guidance. His remarks were critical of the past tactics employed by the commission, acknowledging the need for a more constructive engagement with the industry. Key points from his announcement include: Moving Away from Ad Hoc Enforcement: A clear intention to reduce reliance on enforcement actions as the primary method of regulation. This doesn’t mean an end to enforcement against bad actors, but rather a focus on establishing rules first. Criticism of Past Tactics: Explicit acknowledgment that the previous approach has been problematic and has not served the goal of fostering a well-regulated, innovative market effectively. Updating Guidance on Securities Classification: Providing clearer criteria and processes for determining whether a digital asset constitutes a security under U.S. law. This is perhaps one of the most contentious and uncertain areas currently. Reviewing and Updating Custody Rules: Addressing how digital assets should be held and managed by regulated entities, an area crucial for institutional adoption and investor protection. Revising Broker-Dealer Rules: Adapting existing rules for broker-dealers to accommodate the unique nature of digital assets and the technologies underpinning them. Supporting Innovation: A stated goal to support technological innovation within the digital asset space while simultaneously establishing clear standards. This comprehensive list touches upon the most pressing regulatory pain points identified by the crypto industry. By committing to update guidance in these specific areas, the Paul Atkins SEC seems to be signaling a genuine effort to build a regulatory framework that is both protective and pragmatic. Why is Crypto Regulatory Clarity So Crucial? The lack of clear rules has been a significant impediment to the growth and mainstream adoption of digital assets in the U.S. Without predictable regulations, businesses face immense legal and operational risks. Investors, both retail and institutional, are hesitant to engage fully in a market where the rules of the game are constantly shifting or unclear. Crypto regulatory clarity is essential for several reasons: Fostering Innovation: When companies understand the rules, they can design products and services that comply, encouraging investment and development within the U.S. Investor Protection: Clear rules provide a predictable environment, reducing opportunities for fraud and manipulation and ensuring investors understand the risks and legal protections available to them. Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions require regulatory certainty before committing significant capital to the digital asset space. Clear rules can unlock substantial institutional investment. Market Integrity: Defined standards for trading, custody, and market surveillance contribute to a more stable and trustworthy market. Competitiveness: Without clarity, the U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions that have established more welcoming regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Chair Atkins’ focus on providing this clarity through a rule-based approach directly addresses these critical needs. It suggests a potential path forward where the U.S. can harness the benefits of digital asset technology while mitigating the associated risks effectively. What Does a Rule-Based Approach to Digital Asset Rules Look Like? A rule-based approach means the SEC would proactively propose, solicit public comment on, and finalize specific regulations tailored to digital assets. This contrasts with the enforcement-first model, where the SEC primarily uses enforcement actions against companies or individuals to signal its interpretation of how existing laws apply. Under a rule-based system for digital asset rules , we might expect to see: Specific Rule Proposals: The SEC would publish detailed proposed rules outlining how digital assets should be treated under securities laws, what disclosures are required, how trading platforms should operate, and how custody should be handled. Public Comment Periods: The industry, legal experts, and the public would have formal opportunities to provide feedback on proposed rules, allowing for a more collaborative and informed regulatory process. Finalized Regulations: Based on comments and further consideration, the SEC would issue final rules that provide clear, legally binding standards for market participants. Guidance and Frameworks: Alongside rules, the SEC might issue interpretive guidance documents or frameworks to help the industry understand how to comply. This process is more transparent and predictable than relying on enforcement actions, which can be costly, time-consuming, and provide clarity only after a potential violation has occurred. Implementing comprehensive digital asset rules through this process would represent a monumental shift in the SEC’s engagement with the crypto sector. Challenges and Opportunities for US Crypto Policy While the prospect of a rule-based approach is largely welcomed by the industry, the path forward is not without its challenges. Crafting effective regulations for rapidly evolving technology is complex. The devil will be in the details of the actual rules proposed. Potential challenges include: Pace of Rulemaking: The traditional rulemaking process can be slow, potentially lagging behind the rapid development of the digital asset space. Content of Rules: The effectiveness of the shift depends entirely on whether the resulting rules are pragmatic, well-informed, and appropriately tailored to digital assets. Overly strict or poorly designed rules could still stifle innovation. Jurisdictional Issues: Digital assets often blur lines between different regulatory bodies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, etc.), requiring coordination across agencies. Political and Internal Dynamics: Shifting the approach requires consensus and commitment within the SEC and potentially navigating political pressures. Despite these challenges, the opportunity presented by this potential change in US crypto policy is immense. A clear, functional regulatory framework could position the United States as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting investment, fostering job creation, and ensuring robust investor protection within a predictable legal environment. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? For businesses and investors in the digital asset space, Chair Atkins’ announcement is a signal to stay engaged and prepared. While specific rules have not yet been proposed, the intention is clear. Monitor SEC Announcements: Pay close attention to official SEC statements, proposed rules, and requests for comment. Engage with the Process: If possible, participate in public comment periods on proposed rules. Industry input is crucial for developing effective regulations. Seek Legal Counsel: Continue to consult with legal experts familiar with digital asset law to understand current requirements and prepare for potential future rules. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the nuances of securities law as it may apply to digital assets and the potential implications of different regulatory approaches. This shift, if successfully implemented, could fundamentally alter the landscape for digital assets in the U.S., moving towards a future where innovation and regulation coexist more harmoniously. Conclusion: A New Dawn for U.S. Crypto Regulation? SEC Chair Paul Atkins’ announcement marks a potentially transformative moment for SEC crypto regulation . By advocating for a move away from ad hoc enforcement towards a clear, rule-based framework, the commission signals a willingness to address the long-standing calls for regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. While the details of future digital asset rules are yet to be seen, the commitment to providing updated guidance on crucial issues like securities classification, custody, and broker-dealer rules offers a glimmer of hope for a more predictable and supportive regulatory environment for US crypto policy . This shift, if executed effectively, has the potential to unlock significant innovation and investment, ultimately benefiting both the industry and investors by establishing clear, understandable standards for participation in the digital asset market. The journey towards comprehensive crypto regulatory clarity is far from over, but Chair Atkins’ statement suggests the SEC may finally be ready to take a different, more constructive path forward.

Investors and enthusiasts are keen to discover if these digital assets will lead the next big rally. This article delves into whether these memecoins have what it takes to ignite widespread enthusiasm and growth. PEPE Price Surge Hints at Short-Term Bullish Energy Pepe 's price climbed sharply over the last month with a 106.12% increase and a steep 77.04% weekly jump. The half-year change of 1.14% shows an extended period of subdued movement. Recent gains suggest that traders have reacted strongly in the short term, pointing to an emerging burst of interest after a period of quiet market activity. Current levels mark resistance near $0.00001 and a secondary push toward $0.00002, with support clearly seen at $0.000004. An RSI reading of 84.40 indicates that bullish momentum is intense, though conditions are stretched. Traders may look for opportunities to buy on dips within support while testing resistance cautiously, as the trend remains narrow and uneven despite recent surges. Dogwifhat's Rollercoaster: Short-Term Surge Meets Long-Term Decline WIF recent performance shows a near 200% monthly increase alongside a weekly jump of over 114%, while a six-month period witnessed a steep decline of about 63%. The price history reveals dramatic short-term rallies that contrast with longer-term downward pressure, highlighting significant volatility. Current trading sees prices moving between $0.39 and $0.80, with immediate resistance at $0.97 and a second resistance at $1.38, and firm support near $0.14. Bulls drive the surge, yet an RSI of 83 suggests overbought conditions. Lacking a clear trend, traders might consider cautious long entries near support and profit-taking near resistance. SPX6900 Experiences Significant Price Growth and Key Levels The past month marked a dramatic 69% surge, alongside a notable one-week increase of 62%. Over the last six months, a gain of 16% indicates a steady uptrend. Price movements have fluctuated between $0.41 and $0.68, showcasing significant volatility that has kept traders engaged and active in the market. Currently, SPX prices encounter resistance at $0.81 and a secondary level at $1.08, with support firmly established at $0.25. A high RSI nearing 73 and positive momentum suggest bullish pressure, though caution remains essential. Traders might look to enter near support while monitoring for pullbacks around resistance levels to capture potential short-term profit opportunities. Conclusion As market confidence grows, attention turns to PEPE , WIF , and SPX6900 . These coins have shown potential for driving a new rally. Each has distinct features that appeal to different investor groups. PEPE captivates with its playful theme, WIF attracts through its innovative approach, and SPX6900 offers unique incentives. Their combined momentum could fuel the next big surge in interest and activity. This sets the stage for a possible new phase of growth.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance has warned that a hacker has again hijacked its domain name system (DNS), sending users to a malicious website. In the second attack on its infrastructure in a week, the “curve.fi DNS might be hijacked. Don’t interact!” the team said in a May 12 warning to X. In a follow-up post to a user asking whether it was a hack or a hijack , the Curve Team said the website “Points to the wrong IP” when users try to visit. A DNS works like a directory that translates domain names into IP addresses. Source: Curve Finance The team also said in another update that the “Password is secure,” its two-factor authentication was set up a “long time ago,” and a question has been sent to the “registrar now.” ”While all smart contracts are safe, the domain name points to a malicious site which can drain your wallet! We are investigating and working on recovering the access. No sign of a compromise on our side,” Curve said . Source: Curve Finance Curve Finance was hit with a similar front end attack in August 2022 . In a post-mortem, the consensus was that the attackers managed to clone the Curve Finance website and reroute the DNS server to the fake page. Users who attempted to use the platform had their funds drained into a pool operated by the attackers. Cointelegraph has contacted Curve Finance for comment. Curve Finance potential front-end attack Onchain security firm Blockaid also detected unusual activity from the Curve website recently, warning users to stay away and avoid interacting for now. It could be a case of a “potential frontend attack,” according to the security firm, which is when hackers target the part of the website users interact with, such as the buttons, forms, or text on the site, to steal sensitive data. Source: Blockaid “If you’re connected, please refrain from signing transactions and avoid interactions with the DApp until the issue is resolved. We’re working closely with affected partners. More updates soon,” Blockaid said.

On May 5, a hacker took over its official X handle. “To clarify: the incident was limited strictly to the X account. No other Curve accounts were affected. No security issues were found on our side, no user funds were impacted, and there were no victims of phishing links that the hacker posted,” the team said in a follow-up May 6 post.

The firm added 7,976 ETH worth $18.9M, bringing total holdings to over 1 million ETH. Its Bitcoin trust now holds 614,639 BTC after buying 41,452 BTC in two weeks. BlackRock has filed an amendment to its S-1 registration for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), seeking to enable in-kind creation and redemption of ETF shares for its Ethereum ETF. This in-kind mechanism allows authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for Ethereum (ETH), bypassing the need for cash transactions. BlackRock Seeks In-Kind ETH Redemptions to Cut Costs and Track Price Efficiently The proposed in-kind process aims to enhance tax efficiency, reduce trading costs, and improve liquidity. By facilitating direct ETH transactions, the ETF can better track Ethereum’s market price and minimize capital gains taxes associated with asset sales. Currently, the ETHA ETF operates on a cash-based system, where ETF shares are created or redeemed using cash, necessitating the buying or selling of ETH in the market.

Early this year, an investigation from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike determined that PowerSchool – which operates a widely-used Student Information System (SIS) – witnessed a data breach affecting millions of US school kids. PowerSchool’s SIS software helps schools track students’ attendance, grades, addresses and oftentimes very specific personal information like Social Security numbers or health history. PowerSchool disclosed that “current and former students and educators” had their names, contact details, dates of birth, limited medical alert information, Social Security numbers and “other related information” compromised. Months later, state school leaders and employees from at least 20 North Carolina school systems have reported that hackers have attempted to extort them via threatening emails. The NBC-affiliated WRAL News reports that the extortion attempt asks for a payment in cryptocurrency in exchange for keeping the victims’ data secret. While PowerSchool says that the threat has been contained, cybersecurity expert Doug Levin said to “take that with a grain of salt.” Says Levin, “We also always encourage literally everyone, whether you’ve been caught up in this incident or not, to just freeze their credit records at the credit reporting agencies… It is a simple step that you can take to provide some measure of protection against financial fraud against yourself, should your information ever get exposed in a data breach like this one… Incidents have been happening more frequently. They’ve been more sophisticated. They have also been more significant in terms of their impact, whether you’re talking about money or amounts, or the sensitivity of data that has been released. And one of the things that school systems are doing now is also looking and asking questions of all of their vendors and third parties they do business with, like PowerSchool. There is certainly a trend right now that school systems are beginning to ask many more questions of their vendors and partners to ensure that they have strong cybersecurity in place, while school systems as well are shoring up their cybersecurity practices.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

44544749,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159714,1747094418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking AI Agents Reality: Even a16z VCs Debate Definition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/a16z-ai-agents-definition/,"In the fast-paced world of tech, especially the intersection of AI and potentially blockchain-backed applications, buzzwords come and go, often stretched thin until their meaning blurs. The current star player in this linguistic game is undoubtedly the term AI agents . Despite the massive investment flowing into this area, including from major players like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), there’s a surprising lack of consensus on what an AI agent actually is. What is the True AI Definition ? Even VCs Struggle It might sound counterintuitive, but even those deeply embedded in funding the next wave of AI struggle with a precise AI definition for agents. Three infrastructure investment partners at a16z – Guido Appenzeller, Matt Bornstein, and Yoko Li – explored this very question on a recent podcast. This firm, known for backing AI giants like OpenAI, is reportedly eyeing a substantial $20 billion fund for further sector investment, highlighting their belief in AI’s potential. Yet, despite this enthusiasm, captured in their view that AI copilots will become ubiquitous and some roles will be fully automated by AI agents , the definition remains fluid. Appenzeller noted a ‘continuum’ of products being labeled as agents, ranging from simple systems to ambitious human replacements. From Clever Prompts to Complex Systems: The Spectrum of AI Agents What’s being called an AI agent today covers a wide range: Simple Agents: Appenzeller described the most basic form as essentially a ‘clever prompt’ layered over a knowledge base. These systems take a human query and provide a pre-written or ‘canned’ response, similar to basic IT support chatbots. They perform a single, predefined task. Ambitious Agents: On the other end are systems aiming to replace human workers entirely. This vision requires something approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), needing to persist over long periods and work independently on complex problems. The reality, according to the a16z VCs and industry builders like Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, CEO of Artisan, is that getting this nascent AI technology to work reliably is challenging. Artisan, despite a viral ‘stop hiring humans’ campaign, still employs human staff, illustrating the current limitations. Major Hurdles in AI Development for True Agents Becoming a genuine human worker replacement faces significant technical obstacles in AI development : Persistent Long-Term Memory: Current models struggle to remember context across long interactions, a crucial requirement for complex tasks. Cost of Memory: Storing and accessing vast amounts of conversational history is computationally expensive. Eliminating Hallucinations: AI models can generate incorrect or nonsensical information. No one wants an employee, human or artificial, who fabricates data. These issues prevent current systems from acting truly autonomously and reliably over extended periods, which is necessary for complex roles. a16z ‘s Working Definition: What’s Possible Today? Despite the ambiguity, the a16z trio did arrive at a practical definition for what’s achievable now. Yoko Li described an AI agent as a reasoning, multi-step Large Language Model (LLM) equipped with a dynamic decision tree. This means an agent isn’t just a bot executing a single command. It must be able to: Make decisions about a task. Take autonomous actions based on those decisions. Examples include fetching data, deciding who to contact from a list, and drafting communications, or writing code and determining its placement. This capability goes beyond simple automation, showing a degree of agency, but still falls short of AGI. Can AI Technology Replace Humans Soon? The consensus among the a16z VCs is that while AI agents can automate specific tasks humans currently perform, similar to previous waves of automation, outright human replacement in most roles is not foreseeable with the current state of AI technology . Matt Bornstein emphasized that many jobs require human creativity and complex thinking that current agents cannot replicate. He expressed doubt that full human replacement is even theoretically possible in many creative or complex roles. However, he noted that the marketing rhetoric surrounding AI agents often overstates their current capabilities, contributing significantly to the confusion around their definition and potential. Conclusion: Navigating the Hype Around AI Agents The takeaway from the experts at a16z is clear: the term AI agents is currently a broad umbrella covering a wide spectrum of capabilities, and the most ambitious claims about human replacement are premature. The significant challenges in AI development , such as memory and reliability, mean that true, autonomous agents capable of handling complex roles like humans are still a distant prospect. Understanding the current limitations and realistic potential of AI technology is crucial for navigating the hype and making informed decisions about its adoption.

In the interview, Long described a noticeable and sudden shift in how U.S. banks approach blockchain technology and XRP. The video has drawn attention to Long’s remarks, suggesting that Bank of America’s leadership is eager to engage with Ripple’s technology. Monica Long reveals Bank of America’s CEO says, “We’re all in on #XRP .” Once BlackRock announces the XRP ETF, the FLOODGATES WILL BURST! #XRPHolders #XRPFamily pic.twitter.com/iiaeD7ejge — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) May 10, 2025 A Rapid Turnaround in Institutional Tone Long began by asking, “It feels like the floodgates are going to open this year, doesn’t it?” She noted that the change in sentiment happened quickly, following the rollback of SAB 121 , which had previously locked banks out of the crypto custody market. She also drew attention to the immediate positive reactions from major financial institution executives. She stated that Bryan Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, expressed they were “all in,” signaling a readiness to deepen involvement with Ripple’s solutions. The CEO recently spoke on Bank of America’s readiness to join the digital asset space , noting that it has been preparing for this shift. A Shifting Regulatory Climate Ripple’s history with major U.S. banks, including Bank of America, dates back to its early focus on messaging software and payment solutions. Long highlighted that although these institutions had once worked closely with Ripple, recent years brought growing regulatory uncertainty and what she called “hostility” toward digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 That environment appears to be changing rapidly. She noted that after the election, Ripple’s conversations with banking partners around stablecoin integration and transaction banking “changed overnight.” Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has helped the crypto market grow. Under his leadership, the SEC ended the war on crypto, which began under the former administration, and this shift has sent XRP to heights not seen since 2018. The SEC has also dismissed its lawsuit against Ripple and recently filed a motion asking the court to approve the settlement terms. The Post-Election Turnaround and Institutional Endorsement She emphasized the speed of this change and its impact on Ripple’s positioning in the financial sector. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has acknowledged this shift, attributing the renewed acceptance of cryptocurrencies to the “ Trump effect .” The post by BullRunners suggested that BlackRock’s involvement in the market through an XRP ETF would open the floodgates for XRP. While BlackRock has yet to file for an ETF, the company recently met with the SEC’s crypto task force to discuss ETF approval standards , suggesting it is interested in the market. Long’s comments reflect optimism that the barriers Ripple has faced are now being lifted, with major banks beginning to treat its products and XRP as viable components of the future financial system.

What’s notable is the movement of seasoned XRP and Cardano (ADA) holders quietly increasing exposure to this high-upside opportunity. Having already secured $8 million in early contributions, MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just benefiting from marketing—it’s building trust through structured phases, transparent mechanics, and increasing analyst attention. While ADA and XRP continue to range with little momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE offers an alternative with genuine upside and immediate relevance. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! The Current Status of XRP and Cardano in May 2025 Cardano (ADA) is holding a bullish structure with hints of an upcoming ETF, and a series of utility-based partnerships linked to its LAOS upgrade. Still, prices remain capped between $0.70–$0.72 , with major resistance at $0.81 and $1.17 unbroken. XRP , meanwhile, is sitting at $2.22 , grappling with uncertainty following ETF approval delays and tapering volume. Bloomberg still places an 85% probability on an eventual ETF, but the lack of short-term progress is nudging some holders to explore other options. Both remain quality assets—but the shift in capital shows growing appetite for high-reward entries like MAGACOINFINANCE . 3,000%+ Return Potential and Limited-Time 50% Token Bonus MAGACOINFINANCE currently presents one of the clearest high-upside setups available in 2025: Over 3,000% potential ROI from entry to target 50% bonus tokens available during this round Fixed 100 billion token supply , with 45% allocated to pre-sale Pricing and bonuses adjusting hourly as interest builds With no open-ended promises or drawn-out timelines, the token stands apart from typical hype-driven plays. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Positioned for 25x–35x Returns by Year-End Projections suggest MAGACOINFINANCE may reach its $0.007 listing target , implying 25x to 35x returns for early entrants—placing it high among 2025’s altcoin favorites. What reinforces this forecast? A major global marketing rollout is in motion Confirmed agency and influencer partnerships Exchange discussions are ongoing Instead of speculation, MAGACOINFINANCE is advancing through each milestone with precision. No wonder capital from XRP and ADA holders is flowing in. PRESALE SELLING OUT — TAP TO SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW! Analysts Say MAGACOINFINANCE Is a Strategic 2025 Entry For many analysts, MAGACOINFINANCE now represents the early-stage play for those who missed ETH or DOGE in their early days. Unlike ADA and XRP—still range-bound— MAGACOINFINANCE is in open price discovery, gaining attention from over 20,000 investors and establishing a real brand presence. The timing couldn’t be more critical. The 50% bonus is active—but won’t last much longer.

44545057,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159715,1747095015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price: Navigating the Crucial Dip Ahead of CPI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-cpi-dip/,"The cryptocurrency world often moves with lightning speed, and recent action around the Bitcoin price is a prime example. Just days ago, Bitcoin was pushing towards the $106,000 mark, showing strong upward momentum. However, the mood shifted, leading to a notable dip below $103,000, hitting approximately $102,388 on May 12th. This move caught the attention of many investors, raising questions about the market’s immediate future. Was this the start of a larger downturn, or just a temporary pause? Understanding the drivers behind this volatility is key for anyone navigating the current crypto market landscape. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Dip Ahead of the CPI Report? The primary catalyst cited for this recent downturn in the Bitcoin price was anticipation surrounding the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, scheduled for release on May 13th. Here’s a breakdown of the factors at play: Pre-CPI De-risking: Investors and traders often become cautious ahead of major economic data releases like the CPI report . Unexpected inflation figures can significantly impact traditional markets (stocks, bonds) and, increasingly, the crypto market due to its growing correlation with macroeconomics. To mitigate potential negative surprises, many participants chose to reduce their exposure, selling off assets, including Bitcoin. Profit-Taking: After Bitcoin’s run-up towards $106,000, reaching levels not seen in some time, it was natural for some investors who bought at lower prices to take profits off the table. This selling pressure contributes to downward price movement. Algorithmic Trading: Automated trading systems are programmed to react quickly to market signals and news events. The impending CPI report likely triggered algorithms designed to reduce risk or take short positions, amplifying the selling pressure. This confluence of factors created a wave of selling that pushed the price down from its recent highs. Is This a Major Crash or Just a Bitcoin Correction? Market dips can be unsettling, but it’s crucial to differentiate between a healthy market correction and a full-blown crash or bear market. A Bitcoin correction is typically defined as a price decline of 10% or more from a recent peak. The move from near $106,000 to around $102,388 represents a drop of roughly 3.4%, which is relatively minor in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. This suggests the recent movement is more of a pullback driven by specific event anticipation rather than a structural breakdown of the market. Analysts quoted by The Block and other financial news outlets largely view this pullback as temporary. They point to the fact that the fundamental reasons people are investing in Bitcoin haven’t changed. While short-term price movements can be dictated by news cycles and trading sentiment, the long-term trajectory is often influenced by broader adoption and underlying network strength. What Does Institutional Adoption Tell Us About Bitcoin’s Strength? Despite the short-term price fluctuations, the underlying bullish fundamentals for Bitcoin remain robust. A key driver of this optimism is continued and growing institutional adoption . Large corporations and investment firms are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or offering crypto investment products to their clients. A prime example highlighted recently is MicroStrategy’s ongoing commitment. The company, led by Michael Saylor, announced another significant purchase, adding 13,390 BTC to their already substantial holdings. This consistent buying pressure from major players like MicroStrategy signals strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Why is institutional adoption so important? Increased Capital Inflow: Institutions bring significant capital, providing strong buying support. Validation: Their participation lends legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially encouraging other traditional investors. Long-Term Holders: Institutions often have longer investment horizons compared to retail traders, contributing to market stability by reducing short-term selling pressure. This trend of increasing institutional adoption provides a strong fundamental floor for the Bitcoin price , suggesting that dips are likely viewed by these large holders as buying opportunities rather than reasons to exit. How Does the CPI Report Impact the Crypto Market Going Forward? The actual release of the CPI report on May 13th will be closely watched. Here’s a look at potential scenarios and their implications for the crypto market : CPI Meets Expectations: If inflation figures come in as analysts predict, it could alleviate some market anxiety. This might lead to a relief rally as the de-risking pressure subsides and investors regain confidence. CPI is Lower Than Expected: A surprisingly low inflation number could be seen as positive, potentially reinforcing the narrative that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts sooner. This could be bullish for risk assets, including Bitcoin. CPI is Higher Than Expected: If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could signal that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer. This is generally viewed negatively for risk assets and could lead to further selling pressure in both traditional and crypto markets. Regardless of the immediate reaction, the CPI report is just one piece of the puzzle. The broader economic outlook, regulatory developments, and continued trends in institutional adoption will all play a role in shaping the future direction of the crypto market and the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways from the Recent Dip: The recent dip in Bitcoin price was largely preemptive selling ahead of the CPI report . This move is considered a temporary pullback or minor Bitcoin correction , not a crash, by many analysts. Strong underlying fundamentals, driven by increasing institutional adoption (like MicroStrategy’s purchases), remain bullish for the long term. The reaction to the actual CPI report will likely dictate short-term market movement. Understanding macro factors is increasingly important for navigating the crypto market . In Conclusion: A Temporary Pause, Not a Reversal? The recent dip below $103,000 for Bitcoin serves as a reminder of the market’s sensitivity to macroeconomic events and investor sentiment. However, by understanding the context – namely, the anticipation of the CPI report and the underlying strength provided by continued institutional adoption – the picture becomes clearer. The consensus among many analysts is that this is likely a temporary Bitcoin correction , a pause for breath, rather than a fundamental reversal of the bullish trend. As the market digests the latest economic data, attention will quickly shift back to the broader narrative of adoption, innovation, and Bitcoin’s position as a unique asset class within the evolving global financial landscape.

One key area of innovation is the development of stablecoins, digital assets pegged to stable references like fiat currencies. However, a significant aspect often overlooked in the stablecoin conversation is privacy. Enter Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson , who has recently hinted at exploring the concept of a privacy-focused stablecoin within the Cardano ecosystem. This idea, discussed on the eToro podcast, sparks intriguing possibilities for the future of digital cash and crypto privacy . Why is a Privacy-Focused Stablecoin on Cardano a Big Deal? Most stablecoins today, while offering stability, operate on public blockchains where transaction details are transparent. While transparency has its merits, it doesn’t always align with the need for financial privacy that many individuals and businesses require for everyday transactions. Think about using cash – it offers a level of anonymity that is currently lacking in the stablecoin space. Hoskinson’s exploration into a privacy-focused Stablecoin aims to bridge this gap. Here’s why this concept is particularly interesting for Cardano : Enhancing Utility: A privacy-preserving Stablecoin could significantly increase the utility of the Cardano blockchain for a wider range of transactions, including those where discretion is preferred. Setting a Precedent: If successful, Cardano could indeed become the first major ecosystem to deploy a widely adopted, privacy-centric Stablecoin , positioning it as a leader in this niche. Attracting New Users: Users and businesses prioritizing financial privacy might be drawn to the Cardano ecosystem specifically for this feature. The Current Stablecoin Landscape on Cardano It’s worth noting that Cardano already hosts stablecoins. The network currently supports approximately $31.5 million worth of stablecoins on its blockchain. While this is a growing figure, the introduction of a native, privacy-focused option could fundamentally change the dynamics and potential use cases for stable value on Cardano . Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Feature Typical Stablecoin (Public Chain) Potential Cardano Privacy Stablecoin Transaction Visibility Publicly visible Potentially obscured or zero-knowledge proof based Use Case Trading, DeFi, transparent payments Trading, DeFi, private payments, remittances Privacy Level Low (pseudonymous) High (closer to cash) What Does ‘Cash-Like Privacy’ Mean in Crypto? When Charles Hoskinson talks about ‘cash-like privacy’, he’s referring to the ability to conduct transactions without the details (sender, receiver, amount) being easily trackable by third parties on a public ledger. This doesn’t necessarily mean absolute anonymity, but rather a level of privacy that prevents mass surveillance of financial activity. Achieving this in a decentralized and compliant manner is a significant technical and regulatory challenge. Potential technologies to achieve this could include: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) CoinJoin-like mixing techniques Confidential Transactions Implementing these complex cryptographic solutions while maintaining the stability and auditability required for a Stablecoin is where the innovation lies. Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Privacy While the idea of a privacy-focused Stablecoin is exciting, it comes with substantial challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Privacy features often attract scrutiny from regulators concerned about illicit activities and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Developing a solution that balances privacy with regulatory requirements is crucial. Technical Complexity: Implementing robust privacy features without compromising security or scalability is technically demanding. Adoption: User adoption will depend on ease of use, trust in the privacy mechanisms, and integration into existing crypto and traditional financial infrastructure. Balancing Transparency: How to provide necessary transparency for audits or regulatory reporting while preserving user privacy is a delicate balance. What Could This Mean for ADA Coin? The potential impact on the ADA Coin , the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano network, is multifaceted. If a privacy-focused Stablecoin on Cardano gains traction, it could drive increased activity and utility on the network. This increased usage, potentially involving transaction fees paid in ADA Coin or staking associated with the stablecoin’s operation, could positively influence the overall demand and value proposition of ADA Coin . Moreover, successful innovation like this enhances Cardano’s reputation as a leading blockchain platform, potentially attracting more developers, projects, and users to the ecosystem, further benefiting ADA Coin holders. Actionable Insight: Stay Informed For anyone interested in Cardano , stablecoins, or crypto privacy , keeping a close watch on developments stemming from Charles Hoskinson’s comments is key. While currently just an idea being pondered, significant progress in this area could mark a major milestone for Cardano and the broader cryptocurrency space. Follow official Cardano channels and reputable crypto news sources for updates on this potential project. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Private Digital Cash Charles Hoskinson’s contemplation of a privacy-focused Stablecoin on Cardano represents a bold and forward-thinking approach to addressing a critical gap in the current stablecoin market. By aiming for ‘cash-like privacy’, Cardano is exploring ways to make digital value truly usable for everyday transactions where privacy is paramount. While the path forward involves significant technical and regulatory challenges, the potential benefits for the Cardano ecosystem, the utility of the ADA Coin , and the broader movement towards private digital cash are immense. This idea, if realized, could solidify Cardano’s position as an innovative leader in the blockchain space, pushing the boundaries of what a decentralized financial system can offer.

XRP Was Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle Earlier In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where XRP could be heading next based on a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Symmetrical Triangle, which forms when an asset consolidates between two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The top line of the triangle connects together successive lower highs in the price, and the bottom one higher lows. Like with other TA consolidation patterns, the former trendline is likely to provide resistance during a retest, while the latter one supports. A break out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. Naturally, an escape above the triangle is bullish, while a fall under it is bearish. As the price consolidates inside a Symmetrical Triangle, its range gets narrower with time, until it shrinks to a point at the apex. Thus, as the asset travels toward the end of the triangle, it can become more likely to find a breakout. The Symmetrical Triangle isn’t the only type of triangle that exists in TA. Two other popular variations are the Ascending and Descending Triangles, which emerge when one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis. As the names of these patterns already suggest, they involve consolidation toward a net upside and downside, respectively. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that XRP was potentially trading inside for years before a breakout: As displayed in the above graph, XRP was nearing the apex of this long-term Symmetrical Triangle last year, meaning a breakout was becoming probable. And indeed, with the bull rally during the last couple of months of the year, the coin managed to find a break above the pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver’s Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows Generally, breakouts resulting from a triangular pattern are assumed to be of the same length as the height of the triangle itself. Based on the height of this Symmetrical Triangle, a potential bullish target could lie at around $15 for the cryptocurrency. Naturally, this target would only hold if the trajectory that XRP is currently following is truly based on this Symmetrical Triangle. In the scenario that the pattern does end up being the governing one and the coin observes a bull run to this level, it would have seen an increase of more than 500% from the current price. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.45, up around 3% in the last seven days.

44545679,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159749,1747096854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive 250 Million USDC Minted: What This Means for the Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/250-million-usdc-minted/,"Big news just hit the crypto wire! According to data shared by the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , a staggering 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a small transaction; it’s a significant injection of stablecoin liquidity into the ecosystem. But what does this massive mint actually signify, and how might it impact the broader stablecoin market and the crypto world at large? Understanding the Basics: What is USDC and Why Does Minting Matter? Before we dive into the implications of this specific event, let’s quickly cover the fundamentals. USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin, which means its value is pegged to a stable asset, in this case, the U.S. dollar. It’s issued by Circle, a regulated financial technology company. The goal of stablecoins like USDC is to provide a digital dollar that can be easily moved on blockchain networks, offering stability in the often-volatile cryptocurrency landscape. Minting, in the context of stablecoins, refers to the creation of new tokens. When someone wants to convert U.S. dollars into USDC, they send the dollars to Circle or a partner, and Circle then ‘mints’ or creates the equivalent amount of USDC tokens on the blockchain. These new tokens are backed 1:1 by the dollars held in reserve. Conversely, ‘redeeming’ USDC means sending the tokens back to Circle to receive the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, which leads to the burning (destruction) of the USDC tokens. The fact that 250 million USDC minted indicates that there has been significant demand from entities or individuals looking to bring a large amount of U.S. dollars onto the blockchain in the form of USDC. Whale Alert Crypto: The Messenger of Big Moves The information about the 250 million USDC minted came to light thanks to Whale Alert . This service is widely followed in the crypto community because it tracks and reports large transactions on various blockchains, often involving significant amounts of cryptocurrency or stablecoins moved by ‘whales’ – large holders. While the ‘USDC Treasury’ isn’t a single wallet but rather represents Circle’s operational addresses for minting and redemption, Whale Alert’s reporting confirms the official creation of these new tokens by the issuer. Seeing a Whale Alert crypto notification for such a large stablecoin mint immediately grabs attention because it suggests substantial capital movement is either happening or being prepared to happen within the crypto ecosystem. Why Mint 250 Million USDC? Potential Reasons Behind the Massive Increase A mint of this size isn’t arbitrary. There are several plausible reasons why Circle might mint 250 million USDC minted at this time: Increased Demand: The most straightforward reason is that institutional clients, exchanges, or large investors have deposited $250 million with Circle to acquire USDC. This signals a desire to hold digital dollars for various purposes. Preparing for Redemptions: Although less common for a mint, Circle might proactively mint tokens to ensure sufficient operational float to handle expected redemptions smoothly, though minting is primarily driven by inflows. Strategic Allocations: Circle might be preparing these funds for strategic purposes, such as funding operations, making investments, or facilitating partnerships within the crypto or traditional finance space that require on-chain dollar liquidity. Exchange Inflows: Large amounts of newly minted stablecoins are often sent to cryptocurrency exchanges. This can indicate that investors are bringing capital onto exchanges, potentially to buy other cryptocurrencies. Yield Opportunities: With various DeFi protocols offering yield on stablecoins, institutions or large holders might be minting USDC to deploy it into these opportunities. Without direct confirmation from Circle, these remain potential explanations, but they cover the most common scenarios for such a large USDC supply increase . Impact on the Stablecoin Market and Beyond An injection of 250 million USDC minted has several potential implications for the stablecoin market and the broader crypto ecosystem: Increased Liquidity: More USDC means more digital dollars available on various blockchains, making it easier and potentially cheaper to trade between crypto assets, transfer value, and participate in DeFi protocols. Potential Buying Pressure: If the minted USDC is moved onto exchanges, it represents significant potential buying power. Traders and investors often use stablecoins as a gateway to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. A large influx of stablecoins can sometimes precede upward price movements in the market as this liquidity is deployed. Shifting Stablecoin Dominance: While Tether (USDT) remains the largest stablecoin by market cap, USDC is a strong second. Significant mints like this contribute to USDC’s overall supply and market share, influencing the dynamics between major stablecoins. Indicator of Capital Inflow: A large USDC mint is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that new capital (in the form of fiat dollars) is entering the crypto ecosystem rather than exiting it. The movement of this newly minted USDC will be closely watched by traders and analysts using services like Whale Alert crypto to try and predict where this liquidity might be deployed. Considering the Challenges and Nuances While a large mint can signal positive sentiment and increased activity, it’s important to consider the nuances: Centralization: USDC, like most stablecoins pegged to fiat, is centralized. Its issuance and reserves are controlled by Circle. This means users rely on Circle’s solvency, transparency, and compliance with regulations. Regulatory Environment: Stablecoins are under increasing scrutiny from regulators globally. The rules governing their issuance, reserves, and usage are still evolving, which could impact their future operations. Purpose of Funds: The minted funds might not necessarily be used for buying crypto. They could be intended for operational expenses, payroll, or held as reserves on exchanges. Tracking the movement of the funds reported by Whale Alert crypto is key to understanding their ultimate purpose. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do? As a crypto participant, seeing a large mint like 250 million USDC minted can be informative. Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports from services like Whale Alert and crypto news outlets to track large movements. Monitor On-Chain Data: If you’re comfortable with blockchain explorers, you can try to follow where this newly minted USDC is sent. Is it going to exchanges? DeFi protocols? Unknown wallets? Assess Market Sentiment: A large stablecoin mint can be interpreted as a sign of potential buying pressure, but combine this signal with other market indicators before making investment decisions. Understand Stablecoin Risks: Remember that even stablecoins carry risks, including issuer risk and regulatory risk. Understand how USDC works and its reserve structure. This significant USDC supply increase is a data point in a complex market. Use it to inform your understanding, not as a sole basis for trading decisions. Conclusion: A Significant Boost to USDC Supply The minting of 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury, as reported by Whale Alert crypto , is a noteworthy event. It signifies substantial capital inflow into the digital asset space, driving a significant USDC supply increase . While the exact deployment of these funds remains to be seen, such large movements typically point towards increased demand for stablecoin liquidity, potentially fueling activity within the stablecoin market , exchanges, and DeFi protocols. Keeping track of these on-chain signals provides valuable insight into the flow of capital within the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Recently, a significant development – the US-China trade agreement – captured global attention. While often viewed through the lens of traditional markets, its potential impact on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin , is a subject of intense analysis. An interesting perspective has emerged, suggesting this particular trade deal might be more immediately beneficial for the Stock Market than for digital assets like Bitcoin. Understanding the US-China Trade Deal’s Immediate Impact The core of the analysis, as reported by Cointelegraph, centers on the direct economic mechanisms at play. The US-China Trade Deal involved lowering import tariffs. For publicly traded companies, especially those with significant exposure to international trade, reduced tariffs can translate almost directly into several key advantages: Increased Sales: Lower import costs can make goods cheaper for consumers, potentially boosting demand. Improved Profitability: Companies save money on imported components or goods, widening profit margins. Reduced Uncertainty: A trade agreement can ease fears of future tariff hikes or trade disruptions, encouraging business investment and consumer spending. These factors create a fertile ground for the Stock Market , where company performance and future earnings potential are primary drivers of value. Stock prices often react positively and quickly to news that directly enhances the business environment. Why Bitcoin’s Reaction Differed From the Stock Market Unlike the direct line connecting tariff reduction to corporate bottom lines, the impact on Bitcoin is less immediate and more nuanced. The analysis points to prevailing Macroeconomic Conditions as the primary reason for the pause in Bitcoin’s strong upward trajectory, which had been targeting levels like $105,000. While a stable global economy is generally positive for all assets, the specific benefits of a trade deal focused on traditional goods and services flow more directly into equity markets first. Scarce assets, such as gold and Bitcoin, often act as alternative stores of value or hedges against inflation and economic uncertainty. A reduction in trade tensions, while positive overall, can sometimes reduce the immediate appeal of these ‘safe haven’ or uncorrelated assets, at least in the short term. An example cited is the price of gold, which reportedly fell 3.4% after the announcement of the tariff agreement, illustrating this dynamic. Positive Undercurrents: The Rise of Bitcoin ETF Inflows Despite the macroeconomic headwind from the trade deal seemingly favoring stocks initially, the analysis highlights significant positive developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. Between May 1 and May 9, a substantial $2 billion flowed into US spot Bitcoin ETF products. This is a crucial data point for several reasons: It demonstrates continued, strong demand for Bitcoin. ETFs are a popular vehicle for traditional investors, including large funds and wealth managers. Significant inflows often signal increasing Institutional Investment interest. This inflow of funds from institutional players is widely regarded as a bullish signal for the price of Bitcoin. It suggests that sophisticated investors are allocating capital to the asset, providing a strong foundation of demand independent of the day-to-day swings influenced by traditional macroeconomic news like trade deals. The Significance of Institutional Investment for Bitcoin The growing trend of Institutional Investment entering the Bitcoin space through regulated products like ETFs is a transformative force. Unlike retail investors, institutions often deploy much larger sums of capital and tend to have longer-term investment horizons. Their participation adds legitimacy, liquidity, and stability to the market. The $2 billion inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETF s within a little over a week is a testament to this ongoing trend and provides a counter-narrative to the idea that macro events like the US-China Trade Deal are the sole determinants of Bitcoin’s price action. Looking Ahead: Why $100,000 Might Be a Floor, Not a Ceiling Based on the strength indicated by these substantial institutional inflows via Bitcoin ETF s, the analysis suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s price stability. While the Stock Market may have enjoyed a more immediate boost from the trade deal, the underlying demand demonstrated by institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin products provides significant support. The analysis concluded that it is unlikely that Bitcoin will fall below the $100,000 mark, underpinned by this consistent buying pressure from large players. In essence, the situation presents a dual perspective: traditional macro events like trade deals can provide tailwinds for equities, but the internal dynamics of the crypto market, particularly the surge in Institutional Investment facilitated by vehicles like the Bitcoin ETF , are building a strong case for Bitcoin’s long-term value and potentially setting higher floors for its price.

The move signals Adams’ renewed focus on digital finance and economic innovation as he works to reposition his administration following months of legal scrutiny. Adams names crypto advisors, announces NYC’s first digital finance summit Speaking at a press conference at Gracie Mansion on May 12, Adams tapped two new advisors, including June Ou, founder of the blockchain-focused firm Figure, and Richie Hecker, a tech investor an d Tr action and Scale CEO. The two will help the city consider how to use cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 technologies for the common good and economic growth. “We are focused on the long-term values of these technologies for our city and its people, not chasing memes or trends,” said Adams, adding that New York City is open for business to those i n cr ypto, blockchain, Web3, or fintech space. Adams has a history of being bullish on crypto. When elected Mayor in 2022, he promised to accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin . At that time, he noted, “Many people laughed at me—and all I can say is, who’s laughing now?” he said, echoing his words from December. He said that the industry is now growing, and since then, the number of crypto and blockchain startups that have made New York City home has spiked. His 2023 financial disclosure revealed that he owned some Bitcoin, somewhere between $5,000 and $54,999, although he suggested it was worth more later in 2024 The Mayor also revealed that the city’s first-ever crypto summit will be held on May 20, just two months after President Donald Trump held a similar event at the White House. Its goal is to gather innovators, investors, and policymakers to shape the future of digital finance in NYC. Adams noted that New York is emerging as a serious contender to California’s Silicon Valley in crypto innovation. He also touted blockchain technology’s potential to expand financial inclusion, particularly for communities historically excluded from traditional financial systems. Adams’ crypto push follows surprise dismissal of federal corruption case Adams’ crypto announcement came just days after a major legal cloud was lifted. A federal corruption case against him was formally dismissed in April. The charges, which were related to illicit donations he allegedly received from the Turkish government, had been followed for months. To the surprise of many, however, the US Department of Justice, reportedly at the behest of Trump-appointed officials, dismissed the case. It was dismissed “with prejudice,” which bars it from being reopened. Court documents revealed serious questions about how the case was handled. US District Judge Dale Ho pointed out that the dismissal “smacks of a bargain” between Adams and federal authorities. He suggested that concessions around immigration policy may have influenced the decision. Controversy continues against the Mayor, with Adams denying ever committing any crime and no charges against him ever filed. DOJ under Trump shuts down Adams corruption case Adams met President Donald Trump at the White House on May 9. He thanked Trump for his assistance in his 2024 campaigns. The meeting occurred just days before Adams announced crypto advisors, creating buzz over the content of his meeting with Trump. Some critics suspect there may also be a connection between the dismissal of the case and a change of political attitude on the part of the Mayor. Adams, who was a Democrat, has more recently hewed more closely with Trump on a variety of topics, especially immigration and policing. He even ran for election as an independent, jilting the Democratic Party. The Mayor has denied any quid pro quo and claims the meeting was a “policy dialogue.” But the timing has fueled speculation. Why announce new crypto advisors just days after meeting Trump and weeks after a corruption case gets thrown out? When asked if there was any connection between the events, the Mayor’s office did not respond. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Pepe Coin, a meme supported coin, is riding a wave of whale accumulation, with 24 trillion tokens bought in 2025 alone. Meanwhile Mutuum Finance (MUTM), being a DeFi lending platform, is charting through its presale, collecting $8,000,000 and selling out more than 455 million tokens to 9,700 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is 70% filled with each token going for $0.025 in its fourth presale phase indicating strong demand. With both projects reaching a market cap of $50 billion, what one is most explosive in returns? Let’s break it down. Pepe Coin’s Meme-Fueled Surge Pepe Coin is coming back with heft, trading today at $0.00000817 after reclaiming a $0.00000760 support. Whale wallets have ballooned 20% this year, and that adds 24 trillion tokens that speak volumes of confidence. Technical indicators are releasing bullish signals: a cup-and-handle pattern is emerging, looking to $0.00001465, while Stochastic RSI suggests strong upward momentum. Open interest is $396 million; 52.78% long, which is market optimism. Yet, Pepe Coin faces hurdles. Resistance is at $0.0000090 and a group of EMAs around $0.00000814 – $0.00000918 may slow its ascent. To reach a $50 billion market cap, Pepe Coin would require enormous price jump, the current value would have to increase by thousands. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hitting through its presale, phase 4 is now at $0.025 per token. Investors are pouring in having raised $8,000,000 selling 455 million tokens to 9,700 holders. The phase is 70% over, and the phase five will be 20% more of the price, that is a price of $0.03, at the current rate buyers are going to get a quick gain before the next level. The price of project listing in tokenomics is set to be $0.06; phase 4 investors will therefore reap 140% return. Taking it further, analysts estimate that an investment on the current price will have an ROI of 9,900% after launch at a price of $2.50. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just getting hype. its lending model enables users to borrow and earn passive income through mtTokens which earn interest over time. With the buy-and-distribute system, platform revenue finds its way into token buybacks and increases demand. The team is already concluding a Certik audit, the result of which will be soon released on social media thus reaffirming trust in the system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is looking to engage their customers and recently they launched a dashboard that they use to display the top 50 token holders. These leaders get bonus tokens for having their places and a brilliant decision to reward loyalty and provoke a competition. While Pepe Coin thrives on viral momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility, ensuring stability as it scales. Its structured presale, with prices climbing each phase, creates urgency—phase 4’s rapid sell-out underscores the FOMO driving investors to act now. Portfolio Multiplication Showdown Pepe Coin’s meme mania rally could blow up big if it gets a $50 billion market cap, but on the way there, volatility is the name of the game. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with the back bone of DeFi and amid growth in presale leads to a more forthcoming path. An approximate $50 billion market cap would multiply MUTM’s value exponentially especially with early investors at $0.025. Its 140% listing return and future 9900% post launch escalation position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as great competition.

Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is taking steps forward with a new AI-powered testnet. But in the middle of these stories, Unstaked is quietly showing what AI in crypto can truly look like. While Dogecoin aims for a move toward $3.94 and Cardano continues testing AI scalability, Unstaked is building AI with actual use. Its AI agents are not just included for attention, they are designed to deliver impact across major platforms. People watching the top-performing crypto projects are beginning to recognize the gap between AI as a headline and AI as a working system. That difference is gaining traction fast: Unstaked has already raised $4.5 million during its presale, including $1 million in a single day, clear proof of growing interest in its practical approach. Dogecoin (DOGE) Forecast: Possible Push Toward $3.94 Dogecoin has once again surprised the market by rebounding 38% from $0.138. This rebound has sparked optimism, with analyst Kevin predicting a possible move toward $3.94. His forecast relies on Fibonacci extension levels, pointing to a golden pocket zone that has previously led to major rallies. Based on this analysis, if DOGE holds its strength, a move to $1.10 in the mid-term may also be possible. A look at the log chart shows a potential 740% upside. With favorable macro factors in play, the coin could go even further. Still, Dogecoin’s price is largely influenced by public attention rather than core project strength. Cardano (ADA) Trials AI for Blockchain Speed Cardano is making waves with its new AI-based testnet called the “Face Melting Net” (FMN). This platform brings in thousands of AI agents to simulate fast and complex trading environments to test how well Cardano handles large data flows. Charles Hoskinson says this could move Cardano ahead in blockchain scalability. The purpose of the FMN testnet is to increase Cardano’s transaction handling capability using these AI simulations. Developers can launch decentralized apps on the testnet to see how well the system performs under heavy use. If all goes well, it may boost Cardano’s place as a strong, scalable blockchain. Still, the focus here is mainly on testing features. The AI agents run in a closed setup, and their effect in real-life use is not yet confirmed. Unstaked’s AI Tools Deliver Real Value, Backed by $4.5M in Presale In a space where AI is often thrown around for attention, Unstaked stands apart with working AI features. It doesn’t just attach AI for marketing, its agents are designed to function and deliver across real platforms. These tools will go live after the presale ends and the project launches, ready for action on Telegram, X, and later, Discord. Unlike the limited use seen in Cardano’s testnet, Unstaked’s AI agents interact with users, assist in content sharing, answer questions, and handle digital tasks. Every move they make is recorded on-chain, making all activity traceable and clear. Rewards are based on actual work done, not just promises. Users are active participants in Unstaked’s system. They can set the roles and targets for their AI agents and guide their strategies. As these agents perform better, their owners gain more $UNSD, turning AI into a tool for real progress and visible results. Unstaked is not using AI for show, it’s using it for function. These agents are built for real use, giving people control over useful digital tools. While others talk about what AI might do, Unstaked is ready to make it happen when the presale ends. Unstaked’s practical approach has already captured major attention. The project is now in Stage 9 of its presale, priced at $0.00823, with a planned launch price of $0.1819, giving early buyers the potential for a 2,700% return. That promise of both function and reward has fueled strong interest: Unstaked has raised $4.5 million so far, including $1 million in a single day, making it one of the most watched crypto presales in the current market. Final Say! Dogecoin may still surprise with another price jump, and Cardano is clearly working on speed and scale. But in a market full of talk, Unstaked shows what working AI really looks like. Its agents are not stuck in a test system, and they are more than a headline trick. For those following the top-performing crypto projects , Unstaked brings something else to the table: AI that works, rewards that reflect effort, and features launching after the presale finishes. As other projects test and promote, Unstaked is close to launching a working AI system, a vision that has already attracted $4.5 million in presale funding.

As blockchain and artificial intelligence combine, projects blending both are becoming hot topics. Well-known coins like Hedera (HBAR) and Litecoin (LTC) still provide steady returns, but a newcomer is capturing attention. Web3 ai goes beyond simple tokens by offering working tools and a growing platform from the start. Priced at only $0.000331, $WAI tokens offer early buyers a chance for strong gains as the project grows. If you are searching for the top trending crypto pick of 2025, this comparison aims to guide you toward the best options. Web3 ai: Could This AI Token Be the Top Trending Crypto of 2025? Web3 ai is breaking through in 2025 as a project that delivers value early. Instead of waiting for future updates, Web3 ai plans to launch with 12 AI-powered tools including auto-trading bots, price prediction systems, scam detectors, and portfolio managers. These tools use machine learning and neural networks to analyze blockchain data, market movements, and social trends. The result is faster and clearer trading signals for users facing unpredictable market conditions. The $WAI token is now in stage 3 of its 50-stage presale at $0.000331. It will list at $0.005242, offering a possible 1,747% return for early buyers. With every stage, the price increases, rewarding those who join early. Web3 ai stands out for its plan to offer paid upgrades and its deflationary burn system to manage supply. Even though staking will not be used, the project has focused on making its token valuable as AI keeps changing crypto trading. Many now see Web3 ai as a strong candidate for the top trending crypto in the months ahead. Hedera (HBAR): Can This Hashgraph Coin Defy the Odds? Hedera (HBAR) trades near $0.178, down 3.4 percent in the past day. Short-term holders may worry, but many see long-term value in Hedera’s hashgraph network and growing ecosystem. Price forecasts for May 2025 suggest movement between $0.156 and $0.195. A bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart hints at a slow push higher. Risks remain. Signs of a death cross and weak support levels make timing important. Even so, Hedera’s partnerships and unique technology place it in the conversation for top trending crypto picks for those who value scalability and strong network design. Litecoin (LTC): Can the Original Altcoin Make a Comeback? Litecoin (LTC), often called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, is trading at around $86 after dipping 1.2 percent in 24 hours. Market watchers still expect an upward path in May, with price targets between $49.86 and $105.91. An average near $74.87 suggests a possible return of about 25 percent. LTC’s position above both the 21- and 50-day moving averages points to more momentum ahead. As one of the longest-standing cryptocurrencies, Litecoin holds a place as a top trending crypto choice for those preferring stability. It may not offer the excitement of newer coins, but its low fees, reliability, and wide exchange support make it a steady part of any crypto strategy. The Top Trending Cryptos to Follow Right Now The maturing crypto market demands more than fast price moves. Finding the top trending crypto options now means focusing on usefulness, new ideas, and staying power. Hedera continues to grow with its forward-looking design, and Litecoin keeps its role as a trusted older name. Web3 ai brings something different. Priced at $0.000331, with a listing plan at $0.005242, it gives early backers a strong chance in 2025. With 12 AI-powered tools launching after token release, Web3 ai is firmly on the list of top trending crypto assets to watch closely.

Microsoft is set to host its annual Build developer conference next week, running from May 19 to 22. This event is a key date for developers and tech enthusiasts alike, and this year, the spotlight is firmly on artificial intelligence. Given the rapid pace of AI development, expectations are high for significant announcements across Microsoft’s vast ecosystem, from cloud services to consumer software. At last year’s Build, we saw exciting steps like the integration of Copilot into Microsoft Teams, the introduction of Copilot+ AI-powered PCs, and even Windows Volumetric Apps for Meta Quest headsets. This year, the focus is likely to deepen, particularly concerning AI integration into core Microsoft products. The keynotes and sessions will be available online for free, making it accessible for everyone to tune in and see what’s next. What to Expect at Microsoft Build 2025 The upcoming Microsoft Build conference is poised to be a pivotal event, showcasing the company’s latest advancements, especially in the realm of AI. Following price adjustments for many software products last November, including Windows 365, Office 365, and Microsoft 365, Microsoft is likely to unveil new AI-powered features designed to add significant value and justify these changes. Here are some key areas where we anticipate major announcements: Deeper Copilot AI Integration: Copilot, Microsoft’s generative AI assistant, is expected to be a central theme. We could see it woven more deeply into various Microsoft software offerings, benefiting both individual users and large enterprises. Windows AI Capabilities: Significant upgrades are anticipated for Windows, potentially giving Copilot on Windows more ‘agentic’ functionality. This could allow the AI to perform everyday PC tasks autonomously, streamlining workflows and improving user interaction with the operating system. Azure AI Hardware: Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, is crucial for powering AI workloads. Rumors suggest a potential announcement regarding a successor to the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator chip, possibly dubbed ‘Maia 2’. Custom AI silicon is vital for efficient and cost-effective cloud AI services. Alternative AI Models: Reports indicate Microsoft is exploring using alternative AI models from companies like xAI, Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek for Copilot, potentially signaling shifts in its AI strategy beyond its primary partnership. New Internal AI Models: Microsoft is also rumored to have developed its own family of competitive AI models, internally known as MAI. Build could be the platform where these models are unveiled and potentially offered via an API, competing directly in the AI model market. Diving Deeper into Copilot AI Advancements Copilot AI is set to take center stage at Build. The expected enhancements point towards a more capable and integrated AI assistant. One of the most intriguing possibilities is the addition of ‘agentic’ features within the Windows client. This could mean Copilot moving beyond simply answering questions or generating text to actually performing actions on your PC. Imagine asking Copilot to organize your files, adjust system settings, or complete multi-step tasks with a single command. References found by leaker TestingCatalog suggest an ‘Action button’ feature is in development, specifically designed to trigger these automated tasks. Beyond Windows, expect Copilot AI to become more deeply embedded in the Microsoft 365 suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) and potentially expand its capabilities within Microsoft Teams and other enterprise tools. These integrations aim to boost productivity and creativity for users across different applications. Powering the Cloud with Azure AI Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform is the backbone for many of its AI services, including Copilot. To handle the increasing demands of AI training and inference, specialized hardware is essential. The potential announcement of a ‘Maia 2’ AI Accelerator chip, a custom-designed silicon for Azure, highlights Microsoft’s commitment to building its own infrastructure optimized for AI workloads. Partnering with manufacturers like Marvell for production indicates a move towards greater control over its AI hardware supply chain. Improved Azure AI capabilities, fueled by advanced chips, mean faster processing, lower costs, and more powerful AI services available to developers and businesses globally. Enhancing User Experience with Windows AI Features The integration of AI directly into the Windows operating system is a significant trend. Windows AI features, powered by Copilot and potentially new underlying models, aim to make the PC experience more intuitive and efficient. The rumored ‘agentic’ capabilities are a prime example, allowing the OS to anticipate needs and perform actions proactively. This could range from simple tasks like summarizing documents to more complex operations involving multiple applications. These advancements are part of Microsoft’s broader strategy to position Windows as an AI-first platform, leveraging local processing power alongside cloud-based AI to deliver responsive and intelligent experiences. The Future of AI Integration Across Microsoft Microsoft Build 2025 is expected to provide a clear vision for the future of AI integration across the company’s entire product portfolio. From consumer-facing tools like Windows and Microsoft 365 to the enterprise power of Azure and Dynamics, AI is set to become a fundamental layer. The potential introduction of Microsoft’s own MAI models, offered via API, could signal a strategic shift, positioning Microsoft not just as a consumer of AI models but also as a provider, competing in the foundational model space. This widespread AI integration aims to create a more connected, intelligent, and productive ecosystem for developers and end-users alike. In conclusion, Microsoft Build 2025 is shaping up to be a landmark event focused heavily on AI. We anticipate major announcements regarding the evolution of Copilot AI, significant upgrades to Windows AI features, and advancements in Azure AI hardware like the potential Maia 2 chip. The conference will likely highlight Microsoft’s strategy for deep AI integration across its products and services, aiming to deliver enhanced capabilities and drive innovation in the developer community and beyond.

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1. Dogecoin's (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year. According to CoinGecko , DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins). The memecoin’s market strength has been coupled with strong onchain insights. Data from CryptoQuant noted that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over 90 days, has been ""taker buyer dominant.” It indicates more aggressive buying than selling, a pattern last seen in November 2024, leading to DOGE’s breakout rally of 385% to $0.48 in Q4, 2024. DOGE spot taker CVD. Source: CryptoQuant Similarly, the long-term holder net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL), which tracks unrealized profits or losses for DOGE holders with a lifespan of at least 155 days, recently crossed 0.5 for the first time since March 1, 2025, turning to optimistic or “belief” sentiment. A NUPL above 0.5 means most holders are in profit, signaling confidence and a reduced likelihood of selling.

The Trump administration was billed as the first pro-crypto US government, and Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached an all-time high of $106,000. Despite this, the first quarter of the year has been characterized by stumbling financial markets in the face of impending trade wars and global political instability. Crypto, which has broadly positioned itself as a hedge against such concerns, has struggled in-step with traditional markets too. You might also like: Mass crypto adoption requires transparency and education | Opinion Some may argue that this is a sign crypto isn’t meeting the tantalizing use case for cryptocurrency: a decentralized alternative that operates 24/7, unbound by the decisions of any single government, fund, or corporate actor. But while crypto has also struggled in-step with traditional markets, it has also shown resilience, on an upward trajectory in Q2, amid BlackRock’s investment in tokenized futures, and a multitude of emerging crypto ETF products. However, we can concede that rather than taking full advantage of this moment, the uncomfortable truth is that crypto is still stuck in the blocks. Despite the clear product-market fit, today’s ecosystem remains a playground for enthusiasts and fund managers, with more proofs-of-concept than actual scalable infrastructure that you could reasonably expect the average Joe to use. Global DeFi is a long way off. Crypto isn’t ready Consider the scale of what’s at stake: the top five global asset managers oversee $30 trillion in assets. If they tokenized just 10% of their portfolios, crypto’s current market cap would double overnight, transforming the industry from a niche experiment into the backbone of mainstream finance. The question is how to onboard such a wealth of capital. Up until now, we have had institutional experimentation: hedge funds swooping in for fast gains with minimal capital. This is not real adoption; it’s still just “playing.” In crypto’s supposed breakthrough year, the industry has been passing time with memecoin mania and neatly packaged ETFs, endless speculative trading fueled by retail hype. It should have been building for mass adoption; it is imperative to not just encourage institutions to onboard, but ordinary people, too. For DeFi to become mainstream, it needs retail investors who can act independently of institutional capital, with their vast numbers depegging it from the whims of policy and elite capital markets. If crypto fails to do this, or turns to the task too late, we will simply be left with “alt-Fi”: a speculative market for the same old investors to trade on a new generation of tech. The talk of a return to fundamentals is promising; it squares us back with the original goal of building a unified network capable of seamlessly tokenizing, managing, and programming global assets. Within such a structure, not only would institutions lend the weight of their liquidity, but billions of everyday users could finally access a financial system without friction, gatekeeping, or mediation. By focusing on onboarding users to intuitive interfaces, backed up by hyperscalable L1s and robust infrastructure, DeFi could build the foundation for mainstream adoption and move past enthusiastic experiments towards a refuge from increasingly volatile global markets. The road to success So, how do we get there? DeFi needs three things to reach the critical inflection point for mass adoption: a UX that can streamline complex actions into manageable, intuitive systems, a backend that can sustain the demands of a global user base, and a legislative landscape that can enable innovation to flourish. Utility The biggest obstacle to mass adoption is currently UX. DeFi’s complex interfaces, or even lack of interfaces, make it unusable at times for a non-specialist user. Many premier asset holders are unable or unwilling to maximize their portfolio, with complex bridges, staking, and swap mechanisms acting as both a barrier to trust as well as ability. Interventions with AI-based projects that act upon users’ expressed goals (“swap assets cheaply”), and wallets with human-readable transactions instead of cryptic hashes, will make DeFi as intuitive as PayPal, and drive user onboarding to the moon. And once billions can engage without friction, demand will force infrastructure, both technical and legislative, to catch up fast. Infrastructure But of course, DeFi needs the pipes to work. It is not enough to build usable interfaces: the backend has to support them. When billions of users arrive, DeFi has to be ready. Next-gen L1s like Solana ( SOL ) and Aptos ( APT ) claim thousands of transactions per second, but Solana’s struggles under high demand during the $TRUMP episode exposed limits to both testing and scaling. Testing should be undertaken in real-world conditions with accurate transaction metrics like swaps per second (SPS). Increased focus on scaling solutions like state sharding and parallel processing will boost throughput while preserving decentralization. These innovations are necessary if we are going to get to true scalability: one million SPS is the goal. This is where we need to be to support DeFi at the global scale. Inflection point These impending UX and L1 improvements are just the lock gates opening: once intuitive systems and scalable networks are in place, capital will arrive in floods. The premise of DeFi isn’t a hard sell; everyone knows TradFi is only serving the few. The future of finance, a universal asset layer, needs accessible systems for everyday users and reliable infrastructure for the big players to act. This applies to the legislature as much as infrastructure. The legislative sandboxes recently announced for crypto exchanges in the US are fundamentally important: when demand improves, DeFi will reach an inflection point, one that it must be ready for, and the legislative trial period will have to be over; systems must already be in place to support it. Conclusion The current economic turbulence could be the catalyst crypto needs, making blockchain’s value proposition increasingly compelling. Yet without scalable solutions ready to handle massive capital inflows, this opportunity could slip away: the inflection point is looming. However, once the capital and user base are there, and the safety nets are in place, the dominoes will fall. Investors and institutions will have the confidence they need to enter the market in a meaningful way, and their customers soon after. But to get there, L1 innovators must prioritize fundamentals now, crafting systems for institutions and everyday users, or DeFi will miss this historic wave. Following a roadmap for intuitive UX, hyperscalable L1s, and legislative clarity, DeFi can build the unified network it promised and avoid the trap of “alt-Fi” that lies waiting in the wings.

44546356,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159754,1747098656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Crypto Regulation: Alarming Warning on Blockchain Favoritism,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-regulation-warning/,"The world of finance is constantly evolving, with new technologies pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Among these, blockchain stands out, promising revolutionary changes to everything from payments to asset settlement. But as Blockchain in Finance gains traction, regulators face complex questions. At a recent SEC crypto roundtable, a significant SEC Warning was issued by Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, cautioning against the potential pitfalls of regulators appearing to favor specific technologies like blockchain. This sparked a lively debate, highlighting the ongoing tension between fostering innovation and maintaining regulatory neutrality in the face of burgeoning Financial Technology . Understanding the Core Debate: SEC Crypto Regulation and Neutrality The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a crucial role in overseeing financial markets, protecting investors, and maintaining market integrity. As digital assets and blockchain technology have grown, so too has the complexity of SEC Crypto Regulation . The fundamental challenge for the SEC, and regulators globally, is how to apply existing securities laws to novel technologies and assets, or whether new frameworks are needed. Commissioner Crenshaw’s comments cut to the heart of a critical regulatory principle: neutrality. Regulatory neutrality suggests that rules should apply equally to all market participants and technologies performing similar functions, without favoring one over another. The concern raised by Crenshaw is that if the SEC, through its actions or statements, appears to actively promote or endorse blockchain technology specifically, it could compromise this neutrality. This could inadvertently create an uneven playing field, potentially disadvantaging established or alternative technologies, or even newer innovations that might emerge later. Her perspective contrasts with others, including SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce, who have publicly acknowledged the potential benefits and market efficiencies that blockchain technology could bring to Traditional Finance . This divergence of views within the commission underscores the difficulty in navigating the integration of cutting-edge Financial Technology into long-standing financial systems. Why the SEC Warning Matters for Traditional Finance and Beyond Commissioner Crenshaw’s SEC Warning isn’t just about theoretical regulatory principles; it has practical implications for how Blockchain in Finance develops. If regulators are perceived as pushing for blockchain adoption, it could: Influence Market Behavior: Companies might feel pressured to adopt blockchain even if it’s not the most suitable or efficient solution for their specific needs, simply to align with perceived regulatory direction. Stifle Competition: Favoring one technology could discourage innovation in alternative distributed ledger technologies or entirely different technological approaches to financial problems. Create Regulatory Arbitrage: It could lead to situations where regulatory treatment is based on the underlying technology rather than the function being performed or the risks involved, potentially creating loopholes or undue burdens. Impact Investor Perception: If the SEC seems to favor blockchain, it might inadvertently lead investors to believe blockchain-based projects are inherently safer or more legitimate, regardless of individual project risks. Maintaining neutrality allows the SEC to focus on regulating the *activity* or *function* (e.g., issuing securities, operating an exchange, providing custody) rather than the specific *technology* used to perform it. This technology-agnostic approach is often considered the gold standard for regulators dealing with rapid technological change. Exploring the Potential of Blockchain in Traditional Finance Despite the regulatory caution, the potential benefits of integrating Blockchain in Finance are significant and are precisely why figures like Chair Atkins and Commissioner Peirce highlight its promise. The appeal lies in blockchain’s core characteristics: Efficiency: Streamlining processes like clearing and settlement, reducing reliance on intermediaries, and enabling near-instantaneous transactions. Transparency: Providing a shared, immutable ledger that can increase visibility and auditability for certain types of transactions. Cost Reduction: Lowering operational costs associated with traditional financial infrastructure, reconciliation, and manual processes. Increased Speed: Accelerating transaction times compared to multi-day settlement cycles in some traditional markets. Tokenization: The ability to represent real-world assets (like real estate, art, or stocks) as digital tokens on a blockchain, potentially increasing liquidity and fractional ownership. Major financial institutions are actively exploring these possibilities. Projects involving the tokenization of bonds, the use of distributed ledgers for interbank payments, and the exploration of digital currencies by central banks (Central Bank Digital Currencies – CBDCs) are all examples of how Traditional Finance is engaging with this new Financial Technology . The Balancing Act: Innovation vs. Investor Protection under SEC Crypto Regulation The challenge for the SEC is finding the right balance. How can they facilitate the responsible adoption of potentially beneficial technologies like blockchain without compromising core regulatory principles or creating new risks? This is the central tension in the ongoing debate around SEC Crypto Regulation . Regulators must grapple with several factors: Identifying Securities: Determining which digital assets or blockchain-based products constitute securities under existing law (like the Howey Test). Market Integrity: Addressing risks like market manipulation, fraud, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in nascent technologies. Investor Protection: Ensuring adequate disclosures, preventing scams, and providing recourse for investors in a complex and often opaque market. Interoperability: Considering how new blockchain systems will interact with existing Traditional Finance infrastructure. Commissioner Crenshaw’s point is that focusing too narrowly on *promoting* blockchain itself might distract from these fundamental regulatory responsibilities. The focus, from her perspective, should remain on the regulated activities and ensuring they meet required standards, regardless of the tech stack used. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Future of Blockchain in Finance For businesses operating or seeking to operate with Blockchain in Finance , and for investors looking at this space, the SEC’s internal debate offers key insights: Focus on Function, Not Just Technology: When developing or evaluating blockchain projects, understand the regulatory implications based on the *function* the project performs (e.g., offering an investment contract, facilitating trading) rather than assuming blockchain status provides a regulatory pass. Compliance is Paramount: Assume that existing securities laws and regulations likely apply, even if the technology is new. Engage with legal counsel familiar with both financial regulation and blockchain. Watch Regulatory Developments Closely: The SEC’s approach to SEC Crypto Regulation is still evolving. Pay attention to speeches, enforcement actions, and proposed rules. Understand the Risks: Be aware of the technological risks (smart contract bugs, network vulnerabilities) and market risks (volatility, liquidity) specific to blockchain-based systems. The differing opinions within the SEC are not necessarily a sign of dysfunction, but rather a reflection of the complex and novel issues presented by Financial Technology . It highlights the rigorous debate happening behind the scenes as regulators try to formulate a coherent approach. Examples of Blockchain Exploration in Traditional Finance While regulatory clarity is still developing, Traditional Finance institutions are not waiting on the sidelines. Here are some areas where Blockchain in Finance is being actively explored or piloted: Area of Finance Blockchain Application Potential Benefit Payments Cross-border payments, interbank settlements Faster, cheaper transactions Securities Settlement Tokenized assets, atomic settlement Reduced counterparty risk, faster settlement Trade Finance Digitizing letters of credit, supply chain finance Increased transparency, reduced fraud Asset Management Tokenization of funds, fractional ownership Increased liquidity, broader access These examples demonstrate the tangible interest in leveraging blockchain’s capabilities, even as the regulatory environment, shaped by discussions like the one prompting the SEC Warning , continues to take shape. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Finance and Technology Commissioner Crenshaw’s caution serves as a vital reminder that as we embrace new Financial Technology , the foundational principles of regulation must remain paramount. While Blockchain in Finance offers exciting potential for efficiency and innovation within Traditional Finance , the path forward requires careful consideration of regulatory neutrality, investor protection, and market stability. The ongoing dialogue within the SEC and among regulators globally is crucial. It’s not about stifling innovation but ensuring that it occurs within a framework that safeguards the financial system and those who participate in it. The future of SEC Crypto Regulation will likely continue to be shaped by these debates, striving to find the delicate balance between harnessing the power of technology and upholding the integrity of financial markets.

Ever wondered if the Big Apple could become a major player in the digital asset space? Well, it looks like New York City is making a serious move to position itself as a global NYC crypto hub . Mayor Eric Adams is leading the charge, actively calling on Crypto companies NYC to set up shop and contribute to the city’s technological future. Eric Adams Crypto Vision: Building a Hub New York City Mayor Eric Adams isn’t shy about his ambition to transform the city into a leading center for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Speaking at a press briefing, Mayor Adams emphasized his desire to attract innovative crypto firms NYC to the city, aiming to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and keep New York at the forefront of the global financial landscape. His vision involves more than just attracting businesses; it’s about fostering an ecosystem where crypto innovation can thrive alongside traditional finance. This move signals a clear intent from the city’s leadership to engage with the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, acknowledging its potential impact on the economy and society. Announcing the First NYC Crypto Summit As part of this ambitious push, Mayor Adams also announced plans for the city’s first-ever NYC Crypto Summit . Scheduled for the following week after his May 12th announcement, the summit is designed as a crucial platform for dialogue and collaboration. The goal? To bring together city officials, regulators, and leaders from the cryptocurrency industry to explore how they can work together effectively. Think of it as a brainstorming session on a grand scale. Topics likely on the agenda include: Integrating blockchain technology into city services. Understanding and refining New York crypto regulation . Identifying opportunities for job creation and talent development in the crypto sector. Discussing the challenges and opportunities for Crypto companies NYC . The summit represents a proactive step by the city to understand the needs of the industry and signal its willingness to engage directly with stakeholders. Navigating New York Crypto Regulation: The BitLicense Question While Mayor Adams is enthusiastic about the potential of becoming a NYC crypto hub , he also acknowledges the complexities, particularly concerning regulation. New York State has some of the strictest rules in the country for cryptocurrency businesses, notably the BitLicense requirement. This license, mandated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), has been a point of contention within the industry, with some firms finding it overly burdensome and costly. Mayor Adams reportedly expressed both support for the need for regulation to protect consumers and maintain stability, and caution regarding the impact of overly strict rules on innovation. Finding the right balance is key. How can New York protect its residents and financial system while still being an attractive place for crypto firms NYC to operate and grow? This delicate balance is a major challenge that the city, and likely the NYC Crypto Summit , will need to address head-on. Attracting Crypto Companies NYC: Benefits and Challenges So, why would Crypto companies NYC choose New York? The city offers undeniable advantages: Talent Pool: Access to a vast pool of financial, technical, and legal talent. Financial Capital Status: Being at the heart of global finance provides unparalleled networking and partnership opportunities. Infrastructure: Robust technological and physical infrastructure. However, challenges remain: Regulatory Environment: The strict New York crypto regulation , including BitLicense, can be a deterrent. Cost of Doing Business: New York is an expensive city, which can impact operational costs for startups and established firms alike. Competition: Other states and cities are also actively trying to attract crypto businesses with potentially more favorable regulatory climates. Mayor Adams’ call and the upcoming NYC Crypto Summit are clear signals that the city is ready to tackle these challenges and work towards creating a more welcoming environment. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Digital Future Mayor Eric Adams’ initiative marks a significant moment for New York City’s engagement with the cryptocurrency world. By openly inviting Crypto companies NYC and announcing the first NYC Crypto Summit , he is taking concrete steps towards realizing the vision of a leading NYC crypto hub . While the path involves navigating complex issues like New York crypto regulation , the commitment to collaboration and innovation demonstrated by the mayor is a positive sign for the future of digital assets in the city. The success of this endeavor will depend on effective dialogue, balanced policymaking, and the willingness of both the city and the industry to work together to overcome obstacles and capitalize on the immense potential that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology offer.

It comes around nine months after Anchorage introduced a stablecoin rewards program for institutions holding the PayPal USD ( PYUSD ) stablecoin. Mountain Protocol’s USDM to wind down As part of the acquisition, Mountain Protocol said it would begin an “orderly wind-down process” for USDM, which operates as a yield-bearing stablecoin. Mountain Protocol said it ceased minting the stablecoin on May 12 but noted that USDM rewards will remain active for another 30 days. After that, the reward rate will be set to 0% APY. The stablecoin issuer’s customers can redeem their USDM through the firm’s platform, while other USDM holders are encouraged to swap the stablecoin for other tokens on exchanges. Related: ‘Dark stablecoins’ could emerge as regulations tighten Mountain Protocol’s Ethereum-based USDM is not to be confused with Mehen Finance’s USDM stablecoin, which runs on the Cardano network. Mountain Protocol’s USDM saw considerable success shortly after launching in late 2023, rising to a $155 million market cap by March 2024, according to RWA.xyz . However, its market cap has since fallen below $50 million. RWA.xyz estimates there are around 10,820 USDM holders.

Traditional finance giants are integrating tokenized assets into their operations. Regulatory clarity is crucial for unlocking global capital markets through tokenization. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to deepen its engagement with crypto regulation through its fourth Crypto Task Force roundtable, held today at 1 p.m. ET. This session, titled Tokenization: Moving Assets Onchain, spotlights the merging of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This aims to explore how blockchain-based tokenization is reshaping capital markets and asset management strategies. The event features SEC Chairman Paul Atkins’ keynote and discussions with leading voices from both legacy financial institutions and crypto-native firms.

There will be background checks that need to be completed before the investor’s attendance is confirmed. “The first Competition is officially over,” the project posted to X . “If you were in the top 220 on the leaderboard , ch eck the email you signed up with for details on the Dinner with President Trump as soon as possible. There will be background checks that need to be completed before your attendance is confirmed.” This development was the culmination of Trump’s weekslong promotion of the contest, which has drawn allegations that he is using his position to enrich his family business while opening himself up to foreign influence. The contest was stratospheric upon the meme coin’s introduction in January 2025, quickly drawing traders and Trump fans. The coin reached an all-time high of $75 once before dropping to around $12.63 recently. Participants gambled around $148 million in an attempt to finish in the top 220. Only a few million dollars were spent to score a place at the dinner table with Trump. Lawmakers attack Trump’s pay-to-play crypto strategy Trump’s crypto enterprise has drawn criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs, and even the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential conflicts of interest and allegations of corruption . The contest to dine with the president has intensified those concerns, creating a bidding war for direct access to the Head of State. Senator Richard Blumenthal , De mocrat of Connecticut, has written a letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company behind the coin, asking for answers. He claims possible conflicts of interest and violations of federal law. Blumenthal said the event was not just another one of those whacky crypto promotions but something that raised serious ethical concerns. The dispute is particularly heated because some of the largest investors of the meme coin are said to be from overseas. Reports indicate d that many wallets were making massive purchases via offshore crypto exchanges unavailable to US users. This raised questions about money from overseas gaining special US access to the president of the US. Critics have voiced concerns that the event could be skirting campaign finance regulations by offering valuable access to Trump in return for financial contributions—albeit through unconventional means rather than traditional campaign donations. Still, the Trump campaign and the businesses connected to it say they abide by all rules. A spokesman said the president’s crypto assets are in a trust managed by his children and are separate from campaign operations. TRUMP coin reacts to NFT rewards and market surges The $TRUMP cryptocurrency was created in mid-January and boasts a market capitalization of over $2bn after months of investors buying into the heavily promoted coin. A Trump family-linked company and another firm own a majority of the coins. The TRUMP meme coin project is teasing an additional reward beyond the dinner — digital collectibles. The project announced that everyone who kept the same number of tokens as they had at the end of the contest would receive a Trump Diamond Hand limited edition NFT, which is described as very special and rare. This news led to another surge in price, with some market watchers reporting a 71% rise in TRUMP’s price on their terms upon announcement. Yet, the token is still extremely volatile. Crypto analysis company Chainalysis said 58 TRUMP meme coin wallets have more than $10 million in earnings per wallet. But there’s also been a downside to the buzz. CNBC reported that some 764,000 wallets are underwater on the token. The TRUMP coin was among the meme-inspired political tokens that proliferated in a wave of speculation launched by Fight Fight Fight LLC. It builds off the momentum of Trump’s recent effort to court younger voters and digital-first supporters, but it also underscores just how murky the world of crypto-politics can be.

A ZKsync-related X account posted on May 13, confirming the accounts for ZKsync and Matter Labs were compromised, warning users not to interact after the accounts shared links to a fake airdrop in an apparent phishing scam. Other X users had warned the ZKsync X account was compromised. Source: pseudo The hacked ZKsync and Matter Labs then both posted a fake statement claiming ZKsync was under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and that the Treasury Department could impose sanctions on the platform. Matter Labs communications head Lynnette Nolan confirmed to Cointelegraph that the now-deleted X post “is not legit” and both accounts are now “fully back in the control of the team.” “Shoutout to the zksync hackers. Instead of dropping a token and stealing a few bucks they decided to scare the living shit out of onchain degens,” crypto startup g8keep co-founder Harrison Leggio, who goes by “Pop Punk,” posted to X. Source: Harrison Leggio The fake statement was seemingly aimed at crashing the price of the platform’s self-titled token, ZKsync ( ZK ), which has fallen around 2% in the last hour amid the X account breach, according to CoinGecko. The SEC has investigated crypto companies in the past, and many of these firms have chosen to publicly disclose when they’ve been investigated by the regulator. The SEC has stopped many of its probes under the Trump administration, with Crypto.com, Immutable, OpenSea and RobinHood Crypto, among others, confirming the agency had ended investigations. ZK is down 6.4% over the last day to trade at around 7 cents, cooling from a nearly 38.5% rally it’s enjoyed over the past week. Related: US prosecutors want 2 years for SEC X account hacker Matter Labs’ Nolan said the firm was looking into how the X accounts were breached, and believed it was via “compromised delegated accounts,” which allow users limited access to an X account, allowing them to post on its behalf. Two hacks in as many months It’s the second compromise of ZKsync-controlled platforms since April. On April 15, an attacker breached the admin account of ZKsync’s airdrop distribution contract and used a function to mint 111 million unclaimed ZK tokens, worth approximately $5 million at the time. The hack happened amid the platform handing out 17.5% of ZK’s supply to ecosystem participants. The attacker later returned 90% of the stolen tokens , agreeing to keep 10% as a bounty.

A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40× margin. At Bitcoin’s current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It’s also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain. Many gamblers are shorting $BTC with high leverage! 0x51d9 opened a $93M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $105,690. 0x5D2F opened a $44M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $112,660.https://t.co/WcW1u4FdWz… pic.twitter.com/pAf1LEMnZp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 Second Whale Holding At Crossroads Another account took a $44 million short at $103,494.40, again using 40× cross margin. Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it’s wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin’s climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40× margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains.

As retail interest spikes and high-utility projects take the spotlight, a few names are rising above the noise. BlockDAG, Cold Wallet, and Dragoin are leading the charge with real-world use cases and eye-popping ROI potential. From BlockDAG’s viral mobile mining to Cold Wallet’s zero-knowledge privacy features, and Dragoin’s fantasy-driven play-to-earn experience, these aren’t just tokens, they are ecosystems in motion. Each one is carving out a distinct niche while delivering serious value beyond hype. With presale prices still within reach but climbing fast, the time to move is now. These projects are not waiting for the spotlight! 1. BlockDAG ($BDAG): Mobile Mining Powers a $237M Presale Surge BlockDAG is setting the pace in the presale coin market, combining real traction with a product users can touch. Its X1 mobile mining app is turning heads fast, racking up over 1 million users who are already mining straight from their smartphones. No complex rigs, no cloud subscriptions: just tap, mine, and grow. That accessibility is giving BlockDAG (BDAG) the kind of viral momentum most projects can only dream of. The numbers speak for themselves. The presale has officially crossed $237 million, with 20.1 billion BDAG coins sold and Batch 28 now active. A limited-time price of $0.0019 runs until May 13, while the current batch price is already $0.0262. Early adopters from Batch 1 are sitting on a jaw-dropping 2,520 percent ROI, and the momentum is still building. As BlockDAG heads toward major exchange listings and continues scaling its mobile user base, it is no longer just a presale opportunity. It is the standard by which every other launch is being measured. 2. Cold Wallet ($CWT): 4,900 Percent ROI and Real Privacy in Your Pocket Cold Wallet is shaking up the presale meme coin space with a mission that cuts through the noise, real privacy, real control, and no compromises. While other projects chase trends, Cold Wallet is delivering institutional-level security to everyday users. Its wallet acts like cold storage, blocking data leaks, trackers, and IP exposure right out of the gate. With zero-knowledge proofs baked in, users can trade, stake, and interact with DeFi without revealing a single detail about their wallets or activity. But it is not just about protection. $CWT is at the core of a growing ecosystem, powering governance, gated access, and long-term incentives designed to reward serious holders. Now in Stage 4 of its presale at $0.00743, Cold Wallet is eyeing a projected 4,900 percent ROI by launch. For early participants, the value play here is hard to ignore. 3. Dragoin ($DDGN): Where Memes, Dragons, and 6,700 Percent ROI Collide Dragoin brings fantasy flair to the presale meme coin world, blending Game of Thrones vibes with on-chain gameplay. Built on Ethereum, it features a Telegram-based play-to-earn game where users battle with dragons and earn $DDGN tokens. With a renounced smart contract and real utility, it is more than just meme hype, it is a gamified ecosystem built for engagement. Now in Stage 4 with tokens priced at $0.000044, Dragoin projects a 6,700 percent ROI at launch. Unsold tokens will be permanently burned, adding real scarcity. For those chasing high upside with storytelling and strategy, this one delivers. What The Future Holds The window is closing fast on these top presale coin contenders. BlockDAG is scaling at full speed with its viral X1 mining app and massive presale success. Cold Wallet is raising the bar for crypto privacy, and Dragoin is turning heads with its fantasy-fueled, play-to-earn model. Each one brings something different to the table, but all three are backed by traction, transparency, and time-sensitive pricing. Whether you’re hunting for a 100x breakout or a presale coin with real-world utility, these projects are showing up while others stall. Miss them now, and you might be watching from the sidelines as they take off.

The price of XRP climbed back above $2.61 for the first time since March 6th, marking a strong recovery for the digital asset. However, at the time of writing, XRP has slipped back to the fourth position. At the same time, market experts have noticed a positive change in XRP’s price charts. Over the past few months, XRP’s price was affected by a bearish divergence, which kept its growth limited. But in recent days, this pattern seems to have ended. The 3-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP has now moved above its previous levels, suggesting that the coin is gaining strength and could continue moving upwards. XRP Price Analysis: Signs of a Bullish Breakout On the daily chart, XRP is trying to break above a key resistance level around $2.45 to $2.46. However, to confirm a breakout, it needs to close a daily candle above this line. If it succeeds and manages to cross above $2.58 to $2.59, it could mean a major bullish trend. If that happens, XRP might not only rise in the short term but could also continue to perform well over the next few weeks or even months. On its way up, the price could face some hurdles around levels like $2.77, $2.95, $3.15, and $3.30. $5 In Sight? Some analysts suggest we may already be in a direct bullish phase, with the price aiming straight toward the $5 mark. Either way, as long as support holds, the focus remains on higher prices. In the short term, XRP may continue to stretch upward, with a new micro target zone set between $2.77 and $2.97. This could mark the next area of interest for traders looking for bullish confirmation.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 02:10:49

With strong fundamentals, technical strength, and surging community interest, these coins are fast becoming must-watch plays for traders and investors. XRP: Riding Legal Wins and Institutional Demand After Ripple’s own legal battle against the U.S. in a ruling victory, XRP has captured many headlines. SEC. XRP Trading Above $2.21 Sees Whale Accumulation. According to data from Santiment, XRP whale accumulation has reached extreme levels. Moreover, large whale holders now control over 12% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. Analysts are looking at price targets of $3, $4.85, and perhaps $6.22. XRP’s future is looking good. Although it is a little volatile in the short term, it may likely reach Ethereum’s market cap if it runs at the current pace for a couple of weeks. Kaspa (KAS): Underrated Gem With BlockDAG Innovation Kaspa is gaining recognition as one of the top proof-of-work networks in the market. The KAS price forecast shows strong support around $0.55, and there is resistance near $0.083. Thus, the price is likely to push towards $0.11 later in the year. For Q3 and Q4 monthly prediction remains positive, the high volume of trading is consistent and also a growing developer ecosystem. Analysts keep an eye on Kaspa as a potential dark horse in the next bull cycle. Solana (SOL): Technical Powerhouse on the Rise Solana is making a comeback, currently trading at $169.43, after easing from the April dip to $115. The technical indicators are suggesting that buyers are in control. It has an RSI of 73.70, MACD crossover is bullish, and the price action is above the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Experts in the industry are aimed at a target price range of $180–$200 in the short term and can even rise to $350–$370 in the long term, should momentum and ecosystem growth continue. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Contender As the crypto market prepares for its next wave, XRP, Kaspa, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as key contenders to lead the charge. Together, they reflect the perfect mix of established strength and emerging opportunity — making them top picks for the next altcoin cycle.

Trading at $2.43, there are a few reasons why XRP is rallying. . One of the biggest factors is a new bill being discussed in Missouri called House Bill 594. If it passes, it would let people in the state deduct all capital gains taxes from profits made on things like Bitcoin and XRP. That means if someone makes money trading these, they won’t have to pay taxes on those profits — and that’s huge news for crypto investors in the U.S. XRP Adoption Continues to Rise in 2025 Another reason is that more people are holding XRP than ever before. So far in 2025, the number of XRP holders has gone up by 11%, showing growing interest in the coin. On top of that, XRP is now being accepted as a payment method on the travel booking site Travala.com. That means people can use XRP to book hotels and flights, giving it more real-world use. The Ripple team is also making progress on the technology side. XRP is being integrated with Cosmos and building something called EVM sidechains, which basically makes it easier for different blockchains to connect and work together. Plus, Ripple’s custody service now supports a new system for safer storage called shared MPC wallets. They’re also doing well in the tokenization space — that’s where real-world assets like property or stocks are turned into digital tokens on the XRP Ledger. Lastly, on the price prediction side, analyst Ali Charts said that if XRP can break out of its current chart pattern, it might jump as high as $15. Right now, technical indicators like RSI and stochastic RSI are showing bullish signals, hinting that a breakout could be coming soon.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-13 02:57:18
