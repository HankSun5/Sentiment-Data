This early recognition places Litecoin ahead of other pending altcoin ETFs for Solana and XRP, sparking optimism that LTC might become the next asset to grab mainstream attention. Meanwhile, analysts highlight two other standouts this February: Sui, a newly rebranded chain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin bridging daily financial needs. Below is a closer look at what’s fueling Litecoin’s renewed hype and why some believe Sui and Remittix(RTX) might also be top movers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Acknowledgment: A Big Win Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, originally forked from the Bitcoin blockchain, just saw a 17% price jump after the SEC recognized Canary Capital’s application to launch a Litecoin ETF. Observers say this puts it ahead of Solana and XRP, which also have filings in the works but haven’t received the same nod yet. If the ETF gets approval, it could usher in a wave of mainstream capital, potentially returning LTC to price levels unseen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunasremarked that this filing is already checking most boxes, feeding rumors of a relatively smooth path toward final approval. Critics note that parallels between Litecoin and Bitcoin might make regulators more comfortable green-lighting an LTC-focused product. Many also expect the current SEC administration to be friendlier to crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s stance on digital assets. Should the ETF pass, it may also further normalize crypto within traditional finance circles. That official confidence can ripple outward, boosting liquidity and consumer adoption across the sector. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders in their own right, the race for altcoin ETFs appears to favor LTC at the moment. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Two Other Altcoins Grabbing Headlines Amid the ETF talk, analysts are also singling out Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential top performers in February. Sui, fresh from a rebrand, wants to boost transaction speeds and scale for dApps, making it attractive to developers who are chasing fast networks. However, the more consumer-facing star might be Remittix (RTX), a PayFi solution bridging FIAT and crypto for cross-border payments. Imagine a traveling event organizer in Latin America, frequently wiring funds to overseas partners. Conventional methods hurt with hefty fees; Remittix (RTX), by contrast, provides quick wallet-to-cash methods without typical bank overhead. So far, Remittix (RTX) has raised over $10.5 million and sold roughly 430 million tokens. One token is now selling for $0.0512. The altcoin’s real-world benefits—lower wire costs, more straightforward cross-border flows—could help it stand out in a sector often dominated by purely tech-driven or comedic tokens. Observers see this PayFi approach as possibly mirroring the early success of major players like XRP but focusing more on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF ushers in a fresh wave of crypto positivity, watchers believe tokens addressing daily financial needs—like Remittix(RTX)—may ride the tide exceptionally well. Conclusion: What Sets February’s Winners Apart? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is an essential step toward mainstream crypto integration, overshadowing altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP that remain unacknowledged. Meanwhile, coins like Sui emphasize high-speed networks, and Remittix(RTX) focuses on bridging everyday finance for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. With LTC’s climb already impressing investors, the door is open for these lesser-known gems to capture attention in a bullish February. Whether you’re watching the ETF race or hunting for the next big PayFi breakout, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its mission to reduce cross-border friction could spark the same mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems flourish.

This early nod gives Litecoin an edge over other pending altcoin ETFs like those for Solana and XRP, raising hopes that LTC could be the next cryptocurrency to gain widespread popularity. Meanwhile, analysts are also spotlighting two other notable contenders this February: Sui, a newly rebranded blockchain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin addressing everyday financial needs. Below, we delve into what’s driving Litecoin’s renewed enthusiasm and why Sui and Remittix(RTX) are also seen as potential top performers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Nod: A Significant Lead Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, which originated as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, has recently experienced a 17% price increase after the SEC acknowledged Canary Capital’s proposal for a Litecoin ETF. Analysts point out that this development places it ahead of Solana and XRP, which have yet to receive similar recognition for their filings. Should the ETF receive approval, it could attract substantial mainstream capital, potentially elevating LTC to prices not seen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas noted that the current filing meets most requirements, fueling speculation that final approval might be relatively straightforward. Critics argue that the similarities between Litecoin and Bitcoin could make regulators more inclined to approve a product focused on LTC. There’s also an expectation that the current SEC leadership might be more favorable towards crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s positive stance on digital assets. If the ETF is approved, it could further legitimize crypto within traditional financial sectors, boosting liquidity and wider adoption. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders, the current race for altcoin ETFs seems to favor LTC for now. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Other Altcoins Making Waves As discussions around ETFs continue, analysts are also focusing on Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential stars in February. Sui, having undergone a rebrand, aims to enhance transaction speeds and scalability for dApps, making it appealing to developers seeking fast networks. On the other hand, the more consumer-oriented Remittix (RTX) emerges as a PayFi solution that connects FIAT and crypto for international payments. Consider a traveling event planner in Latin America who often sends money to international partners. Traditional methods can be costly with high fees, whereas Remittix (RTX) offers quick wallet-to-cash options without the usual bank fees. To date, Remittix (RTX) has amassed over $10.5 million and sold about 430 million tokens. Each token is currently priced at $0.0512. The practical advantages of this altcoin—such as reduced wire transfer costs and easier cross-border transactions—could help it stand out in a market often dominated by tech-centric or meme-based tokens. Analysts see this PayFi model as potentially echoing the initial success of major players like XRP but with a stronger focus on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF brings a new wave of positivity to the crypto world, those focusing on everyday financial solutions—like Remittix(RTX)—could benefit significantly. Conclusion: What Distinguishes February’s Top Picks? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is a crucial step towards mainstream crypto adoption, overshadowing unacknowledged altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP. Meanwhile, altcoins like Sui focus on high-speed networks, while Remittix(RTX) aims to bridge daily financial needs for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. As LTC’s ascent already impresses investors, there’s potential for these under-the-radar coins to gain attention in a promising February. Whether you’re observing the ETF contest or searching for the next significant PayFi breakthrough, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its goal to ease cross-border transactions could ignite the same kind of mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems thrive.

The cryptocurrency has recently seen increased buying interest, with firms adding DOGE to their holdings. At press time, Dogecoin price was down 10% trading at $0.2637, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.36 billion. Despite recent volatility, market watchers anticipate an upward trend based on historical price patterns and renewed institutional interest. Will Dogecoin’s Price Rally 300%? Dogecoin has experienced notable price fluctuations, with a recent 10.94% decline in the last 24 hours. However, analysts remain optimistic, pointing to a potential breakout. In the last week, DOGE price has plummeted by 17% in the last week and 31% in the long term startetgy. Traders have observed similarities between the current market cycle and the 2020-2021 bull run, where Dogecoin underwent two major corrections before a strong price surge. Crypto analyst Javon Marks has projected a rise to $0.6533, an increase of over 80% from current levels. He further suggests that a move beyond this threshold could push Dogecoin above $1.25, representing a 333% gain. Another analyst, Kevin, has also identified patterns aligning with the previous bull cycle, reinforcing the outlook for a strong recovery. Institutional Investors Show Renewed Interest in Dogecoin Companies are beginning to accumulate Dogecoin, signaling growing confidence in its long-term potential. Neptune Digital Assets, a blockchain company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, has recently acquired 1,000,000 Dogecoin tokens through a strategic derivative purchase. The firm acquired DOGE at an average price of $0.37 per token on December 27, 2024. Neptune has also expanded its crypto portfolio with a recent purchase of 20 Bitcoin at an average price of $99,833 per BTC. This move aligns with the company’s strategy of strengthening its digital asset holdings. Neptune’s CEO, Cale Moodie, stated that the firm remains committed to acquiring more assets while managing leverage risk. This move follows Grayscale’s launch of a Dogecoin Trust early Friday morning, providing institutional and accredited investors with a regulated way to invest in the cryptocurrency. DOGE Price Historical Patterns Hint at Breakout Market analysts have compared Dogecoin’s current cycle to previous trends, noting similarities in price corrections and rebounds. The previous bull run saw two major corrections before Dogecoin surged to new highs. In the ongoing cycle, the cryptocurrency has followed a similar pattern, with the first correction leading to a 65% decline and the second dropping 58.18%. If Dogecoin follows past trends, analysts believe it could experience a strong recovery, potentially reaching $1.25. Some market watchers have set even higher price targets, suggesting that DOGE could rally towards $4 if conditions align with previous growth patterns.

Table of Contents Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum ecosystem updates Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price has had a rough few days, with a sharp drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3, the lowest it has been since September 2024. The decline came as financial markets reacted to new U.S. tariffs, which took effect on Feb. 1. The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods, leading to uncertainty across global markets, including crypto. Within hours, diplomatic efforts were underway. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on X that he had spoken with Donald Trump and secured a temporary 30-day pause on the tariffs while both countries worked on a broader border security agreement.

Following these developments, market sentiment improved , and Ethereum’s price has rebounded to $2,700 as of this writing on Feb. 4. At one point, ETH briefly touched $2,900 after Trump halted tariffs on Canada and Mexico.

So, what’s really happening in Ethereum’s ecosystem, and how could it impact Ethereum’s price prediction in the days ahead? Let’s dive deeper. Ethereum ecosystem updates Ethereum has been making critical changes to improve scalability and transaction efficiency. Gas limit increase and scalability improvements On Feb. 3, validators approved an increase in Ethereum’s gas limit for the first time since 2021, marking the first adjustment in the post-Merge era. The increase raised the gas limit from 30 million to over 31 million units, with a maximum capacity of 36 million expected soon. Unlike previous changes that required a hard fork, the adjustment took effect automatically after more than half of the validators signaled their support. Gas represents the computational power needed to execute transactions and smart contracts on Ethereum. Every action on the network incurs a gas cost, and the gas limit determines the total computational work that can be processed in a single block. When transaction volume exceeds this limit, users either wait for inclusion in a later block or pay higher fees to have their transactions prioritized. Raising the gas limit increases the number of transactions and operations that can fit within a block, improving overall throughput and easing congestion. The change also allows more complex decentralized applications to function smoothly, benefiting the growing ecosystem of financial applications, NFT platforms, and on-chain services. However, while raising the gas limit helps improve transaction capacity, it does not address Ethereum’s core limitations in cost and speed. For instance, Ethereum handles 1 to 1.5 million daily transactions, while Solana processes between 60 and 65 million. The difference is substantial, with Solana not only processing exponentially more transactions but also doing so at a fraction of the cost, making long-term scalability a persistent challenge. Ethereum’s market position and competitive challenges To address these concerns, Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade, set to go live in early 2025, is expected to enhance network scalability further, particularly for layer-2 solutions. A key part of this upgrade involves increasing the blob target from three to six. Blobs are large data packets used in layer-2 scaling solutions, allowing them to store transaction data temporarily rather than writing it directly onto Ethereum’s main chain. Expanding blob capacity effectively increases the throughput of layer-2 networks, making them faster and cheaper. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and zkSync ( ZK ) already play a crucial role in reducing congestion and gas fees for Ethereum users. Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network in terms of total value locked, has seen consistent growth due to its ability to batch multiple Ethereum transactions into a single compressed proof, significantly cutting costs. Optimism follows a similar approach but integrates an incentive model that distributes OP tokens to projects building on its network. zkSync, which leverages zero-knowledge rollups, provides an even more advanced scaling solution, offering near-instant transactions with lower fees. While these layer-2 solutions help alleviate Ethereum’s congestion issues, they highlight a fundamental contrast between Ethereum and its competition. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on additional layers to scale, other blockchain ecosystems have built-in scalability. Solana, Avalanche ( AVAX ), and even emerging players like Sei ( SEI ) are capable of handling large transaction volumes without requiring external scaling solutions. Beyond technical upgrades, Ethereum’s market position has also been facing pressure. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped to 0.027 as of Feb. 4, its lowest level since March 2021 and nearly 50% lower than a year ago. ETH/BTC price chart | Source: TradingView As Bitcoin continues to gain dominance in both liquidity and investor interest, Ethereum’s relative valuation remains under scrutiny. Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum’s recent price drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3 was not just a reaction to broader economic uncertainty but also served as a market reset, clearing out excessive leverage that had built up in Ethereum’s open interest. “There was a lot of garbage low-quality leverage long open on Ethereum which got closed when price touched the 2100 area,” noted one analyst, highlighting a $4 billion reduction in open interest that ultimately helped stabilize the market. This dump was probably the best thing that happened to Ethereum.

This was a healthy Dump for ETH. pic.twitter.com/bfbdM3SMbM — Emperor👑 (@EmperorBTC) February 3, 2025 With those positions flushed out, Ethereum’s price recovery to $2,700 was driven by spot demand rather than excessive leverage, signaling a healthier foundation for future price movement, he added. From a technical perspective, Ethereum briefly dipped below its 200-week moving average, a significant level that has often acted as a major support zone. “ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025, dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib,” another trader pointed out, referring to key retracement levels that have marked past cycle bottoms. $ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025 dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib, as it did in August and Sept. Price is already back above the 200 WMA now That being said, getting $ETH around the 200 WMA is the same as buying a Mega Cap… pic.twitter.com/g5xtEAz5Jf — The Long Investor (@TheLongInvest) February 3, 2025 While price has already reclaimed the 200 WMA, previous instances where Ethereum tested this level in August and September 2024 led to strong recoveries. However, the broader macro landscape still presents risks. The recent market dip was triggered by escalating U.S. tariffs, a policy shift that briefly shook global financial markets. While diplomatic resolutions have provided temporary relief, uncertainties remain, particularly around potential retaliatory measures or further economic restrictions. If global liquidity tightens or risk sentiment weakens, Ethereum’s ability to sustain a recovery could face challenges. Another factor to watch is Ethereum’s ability to maintain market dominance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ). The ETH/BTC ratio has been on a downtrend, reflecting a shift in investor preference toward Bitcoin, which has seen stronger institutional flows. Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and the recent gas limit increase could support its ecosystem growth, but these improvements need to translate into tangible benefits for users and developers to sustain long-term demand. Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? The latest market reset, which cleared out billions in leveraged positions, has left Ethereum in a healthier position, but what happens next depends on a mix of factors—scalability upgrades, adoption, competition, and economic conditions. Ethereum price prediction 2025 Ethereum’s price action in 2025 is expected to be shaped by its ability to scale efficiently while maintaining strong demand within its ecosystem. DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average of $5,510, with a potential peak of $6,037, while Changelly takes a more bullish stance, predicting an average of $6,124 and a maximum of $7,194. Joe, co-founder of DeAgentAI, told crypto.news that the recent price action fits a broader historical pattern. “Short-term bearish signals—like the one flagged on Feb. 3—often require nuanced interpretation.” He pointed to historical setups from 2023 and 2024 that triggered sharp reversals, suggesting traders should watch for Ethereum’s reaction to key support levels. Ethereum price prediction 2027 If Ethereum continues leading the smart contract space and scaling solutions mature, ETH could see a rise in 2027. DigitalCoinPrice projects an average of $9,580 with a peak at $10,098, while Changelly paints an even stronger outlook, predicting an average of $12,316 and a maximum of $14,527. At the same time, DeFi growth, NFT innovation, and Ethereum’s role in real-world asset tokenization could provide fresh demand for ETH. However, if risk assets face tightening conditions, ETH’s price could face headwinds despite fundamental improvements. Ethereum price prediction 2030 Meanwhile, long-term forecasts see Ethereum reaching levels that once seemed distant. DigitalCoinPrice estimates an average price of $14,829 in 2030, with a high of $15,108, while Changelly provides a much more aggressive projection, predicting an average of $40,055 and a potential peak of $47,066. That being said, long-term predictions always come with risks. Ethereum faces competition from Solana, Avalanche, and emerging blockchain networks, all aiming to offer lower fees and higher speeds. While ETH prediction models remain optimistic, it’s essential to combine technical forecasts with real-world adoption trends before making any long-term commitments.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC and a post on the ministry’s official Telegram channel , the government wants to create a “unified registry” as part of its ongoing efforts to regulate the mining sector. Russia’s Deputy Minister of Energy Yevgeny Grabchak unveiled the proposal at a “working meeting” on mining this week. Why Does Russia’s Energy Ministry Want Crypto Mining Hardware Register? The ministry thinks this measure will help it keep tabs on crypto miners as it looks to “increase the effectiveness of regional bans.” Russian Ministry of Energy officials speak about crypto mining at a meeting on February 3. (Source: Minergo Rossii/Telegram) Moscow is extremely keen to develop its crypto mining sector. Recently, some state-run organs have been given the green light to develop their crypto mining-related projects . These could see crypto mining projects launched in the Russian Far East and in other parts of the country with surplus power. However, Russian decision-makers are worried that a surge in mining could cause power shortages in energy-deficient areas. While US-led export controls on Russia have primarily targeted weapons components and high-end chips, a less threatening product shows just how hard it will be for Donald Trump to squeeze Vladimir Putin’s economy: Japanese grand pianos. https://t.co/P68AgUBjac — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 4, 2025 Power Problems? Some parts of the nation are already experiencing crypto mining-related power shortages. Moscow has responded with regional wintertime bans on mining in several parts of the country. But these bans do not appear to have made much of a dent on the nation’s wide network of “grey” and illegal miners. May operators appear to be flaunting the bans. Thus, the ministry appears to think it will be able to keep tabs on miners by forcing them to report on their mining rig purchases. The TEC-27 power plant near Moscow, Russia. (Source: PJSC Mosenergo/Anna Samarino [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Growth Potential Grabchak’s proposal would see Moscow create a single register of “equipment without which cryptocurrency mining is impossible.” “The fundamental task of the registry will be optimizing the mechanisms for identifying mining activities. This will help us effectively enforce bans on mining in regions where it is prohibited.” Russian Energy Ministry Additionally, the ministry said, the registry could help boost crypto mining in other regions. The registry will help economic growth, including through the introduction of new IT solutions, the ministry added. Russia’s Energy Ministry has spearheaded work on the bans, which some provinces already want to see extended . Furthermore, Grabchak claimed that Russian crypto miners “have increased their electricity consumption by 14% in the past two years.” He added that crypto miners “have used up all available capacity in some areas.” And this means “new consumers (miners)” “cannot connect to these networks,” Grabchak said.

Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced a stablecoin bill today. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said he plans to try to move that bill through Congress before a larger crypto market structure bill. But he added that he hopes to have both on the President’s desk within the administration’s first 100 days. In part, he said, that could be possible because both pieces of legislation have had bipartisan support in the past session of Congress. Sen. Scott pointed out that the market structure bill being worked on in the Senate will be a bipartisan one continuing the work that Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) did in the Senate and the FIT 21 legislation that passed in a bipartisan vote in the House last year.

In his opening remarks, Sacks shared that “the President said in his executive order in the first week that it’s the policy of his administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology and related technologies across all sectors of the economy.” He also reminded the audience that in that executive order, the President established both a working group for digital assets as well as a mandate for the group. “Our objective is to accomplish the task the President assigned for us in his EO, which is to propose a Federal regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States,” said Sacks. The ""Golden Age"" For The Bitcoin And Crypto Industry Begins Sacks also contextualized the significance of this new administration’s not being antagonistic to the Bitcoin and crypto industry, especially in light of what transpired under the Biden administration. “I’ve talked to many founders over the last few years and they’ve told me repeatedly that the number one thing they need from Washington is regulatory clarity,” he said. “They just want to know what the rules of the road are so they can abide by them. We’re coming off frankly four years of arbitrary prosecution and persecution of crypto companies where the SEC wouldn’t tell founders what the rules were and then they would prosecute them. Many founders even told me stories of being debanked personally just because they had founded a crypto company,” he added. Before concluding his opening remarks, Sacks noted that he looks forward to working with the politicians hosting the conference alongside him — Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman French Hill (R-AR), Senator John Boozman (R-AR) and Congressman (R-PA) — in “creating a golden age for digital assets.” Senator Scott began by stating that this “golden age has begun” and that “the good news is that it’s going to get better.” He also noted that he plans to “work synergistically with the House and the Senate, with the White House leading the way” when it comes to passing bills on digital assets. The U.S. At The Forefront Of Bitcoin And Crypto Innovation Rep. Hill stressed that the United States should be leading the way, not falling behind when it comes to the digital asset industry. “We don’t want to be behind in financial technology and digital assets in the United States, [and] our innovators need clarity,” said Rep. Hill. “They need to know what the rules of the road are.” He also stated that he’s forming a working group between the House Financial Services Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee to craft a clear regulatory framework. Senator Boozman highlighted the fact that not all crypto assets are the same (without necessarily singling bitcoin out). “Some assets are commodities, some are securities,” said Senator Boozman, who noted that different regulatory agencies should oversee different crypto assets accordingly. Rep. Thompson walked the audience through the stages of the Internet, pointing out the fact that the internet today has become the “Internet of value.” “America really was the leader when it came to Internet 1.0, and [with] Internet 2.0, again, it was America that led that for the world,” said Rep. Thompson. “Internet 3.0 is what we’re talking about today, and that’s the Internet of value — and we’re approaching it in a principled way.” This “principled way” includes protecting consumers while still offering innovators in the Bitcoin and crypto industry space to foster innovation, according to Rep. Thompson. “The opportunities [in crypto] are unimaginable,” said Rep. Thompson. “I know that [David Sacks] is laser focused on bringing certainty to digital asset markets.” During a question and answer session, Senator Scott noted that bipartisan efforts are being made around crypto in the Senate. “Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand are coming together for the market structure bill ,” he said. Comments On Anti-Money Laundering Regulation When asked about reconsidering Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws as they pertain to crypto, Senator Scott said he’s open to it. “I think that the broader conversation should not be about digital assets alone,” said Senator Scott. “It’s about bad actors doing bad things by any means necessary.” Rep. Hill chimed in regarding AML regulations, stating that they should exist, much like they do in the analog financial space. Educational Efforts Rep. Thompson brought up the importance of educating those in the House and Senate about crypto assets, given that it’s still a relatively new subject. “Member education is what our first goal is here,” he said. Rep. Hill echoed his sentiment. “A key element now is the education and technical assistance that can be provided to members both in the House and Senate,” he said. Sacks also offered his thoughts on this topic. “Part of what we’re here to do is provide resources on education,” he said, adding that some of the educators can be “luminaries in the industry.” As Sacks spoke on this topic, he also differentiated between Bitcoin and all other crypto assets and networks. “Crypto can be an esoteric subject, and it is good to explain it, to demystify it,” said Sacks. “You’ve got the cryptocurrency itself like bitcoin, [and then other assets that] run on blockchains, which are just distributed ledgers.” The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Before the conference concluded, Sacks also addressed the prospect of the U.S. creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . “One of the things that the President instructed us to do was to evaluate the idea for a Bitcoin reserve,” said Sacks. “So, that is one of the first things we’re going to look at as part of the internal working group in the administration.”",Trump|Politics|Politicians|President Trump|Politics|Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-02-04 23:39:46

KyberSwap, Indexed Finance Fraudster Charged According to the Monday press release , the 22-year-old man broke through KyberSwap’s coding to artificially alter the prices within the protocol’s liquidity pools. “Medjedovic then calculated precise combinations of trades that would cause the KyberSwap AMM to “glitch,” in his words, allowing him to steal tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from the liquidity pools,’ the United States Attorney’s Office states. Shortly after the hack, Medjedovic attempted to extort KyberSwap’s developers for control of the platform and its DAO, ultimately stealing $48.8 million worth of coins from the crypto collective.

In an October 2021 incident, Medjedovic manipulated prices on Indexed Finance’s index pools using borrowed cryptocurrencies, resulting in over $16.5 million being drained from investors. The following year, the now-indicted Medjedovic conspired with an unnamed accomplice to launder the pocketed funds through fraudulent crypto exchange accounts while further hiding their origins through the use of a crypto mixer. “Hackers can at times be painted in a flattering light by pop culture, some admiring their skills and acumen,” stated FBI Assistant Director in Charge Dennehy. “They’re stealing money that isn’t theirs, and they’re breaking the laws of this country.” “We allege Andean Medjedovic violated several of those laws, and he, along with all the other cyber criminals who believe they’re untouchable will face justice,” he added.

According to reports, the U.S. Attorney’s Office allegedly believes that the one-time University of Waterloo student is currently on the lam from the charges somewhere outside of the United States. Medjedovic has been charged with one count of money laundering, one count of money laundering conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, and one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer.

The vote will determine whether the exchange resumes trading or undergoes liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. If approved, the restructuring plan could see trading recommence by April 2025, with initial payouts starting within 10 business days. WazirX Creditors To Vote On Restructuring Plan According to a recent statement from the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, creditors will vote on a restructuring plan to recover losses from the WazirX hack. The proposed plan outlines a 52% immediate debt settlement, with the remaining 48% to be paid from future profits and asset recoveries. The vote follows approval from the Singapore High Court, allowing WazirX creditors to decide the exchange’s future. If the plan is accepted by at least 75% of creditors, trading may resume by April 2025, and payouts will begin within 10 business days. In addition, the development comes days after the Singapore High Court granted WazirX approval in late January to convene a Scheme meeting. This meeting will allow creditors to vote on the proposed recovery plan, facilitating a structured repayment of unstolen funds. What Happens If Plan Fails? If WazirX creditors reject the restructuring plan, the exchange will undergo liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. This could postpone repayments until 2030, significantly reducing the chances of full recovery for affected users. Industry experts have warned that liquidation could lead to unpredictable asset distribution. The timeline for payouts would be extended, and the value of recoverable assets could decrease due to market volatility and operational challenges. Source: X Planned Recovery Measures And Future Operations To facilitate debt repayments and restore operations, WazirX plans to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) and introduce recovery tokens. The proposal also includes periodic buybacks to stabilize the platform and improve financial sustainability. Moreover, the restructuring plan will allocate Net Liquid Platform Assets to creditors as part of the recovery process. The company has been working closely with the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to ensure faster distribution and prevent prolonged delays in fund recovery. The vote will determine whether the Indian exchange can resume trading or enter a liquidation process. The restructuring plan is an alternative to liquidation. It offers creditors a more immediate path to fund recovery. With over 4.4 million creditors involved, the voting process is a crucial moment for the Indian exchange Meanwhile, WazirX continues its efforts to recover stolen funds, freezing $3 million in assets as part of its recovery plan. Founder Nischal Shetty emphasized that this is just the beginning, reaffirming the platform’s commitment to retrieving lost crypto.

According to the team, the upgrade “turns the Uniswap protocol into a platform for developers”. At the heart of the new version are special hooks contracts with detailed parameter customization for pools, swaps, fees and order interactions. The creators noted that v4 is the cheapest version of the protocol to date. Organizing pools will be 99.9% cheaper than the previous iteration, Uniswap v3. Swap users have been promised savings on multicast exchanges. According to a statement from the team, the development utilized suggestions from “hundreds of community members.” The update code went through nine security audits, and as part of the bounty program, the company paid out $15.5 million. No critical vulnerabilities were found. In July 2023, the Uniswap team announced that it would launch the fourth version of the protocol within four months of the Dencun hardfork on the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly before that, the creators published a “draft” of the v4 code, which had not yet undergone a number of audits and refinements.

Key support levels are $4.55, $4.28, and $3.60, crucial for stability. Experts believe Polkadot may surge past $50, possibly revisiting its $55 high. Polkadot (DOT) has taken a hit, with its price dropping sharply and leaving many to wonder what’s next. This isn’t just a small dip—it’s a major setback for the cryptocurrency, causing some concern about its short-term future. Before this drop, Polkadot had been trading above $6, riding a wave of optimism, with its price rising over 12% amid hopes that a Polkadot exchange-traded fund (ETF) could soon launch in the United States. The excitement kicked off last week when digital asset manager 21Shares filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission to launch a Spot Polkadot ETF. Polkadot Price: Key Levels to Watch Polkadot is currently in a correction phase after reaching a high. The price is currently trading near the $4.80 level and is trying to break above the $5 target. DOT closed the previous session at $5.14 and key resistance levels are at $6.10 and $5.94.

It’s about building trust, establishing value, and setting the stage for long-term success. Web3Bay is taking a methodical, transparent approach with its 28-stage token presale, aiming to balance supply and demand while solidifying its position as the highest potential crypto. This strategic roadmap is not just about raising capital; it’s about fostering sustainable growth and investor confidence. The current stage, Stage 4, illustrates this carefully planned progression. Web3Bay has already garnered significant interest, raising $1.07 and distributing 270 million tokens. At the current price of $0.004562625 per token, early adopters have the opportunity to participate at a favorable entry point. The projected ROI at launch is over 6,400%, a compelling figure that underscores the potential of this structured model. Strategic Token Allocation: Fueling Long-Term Value What distinguishes Web3Bay’s presale is its emphasis on controlled token availability. Each stage brings a reduction in the number of tokens offered, creating a sense of scarcity that can contribute to price stability at launch. Early stages might release a greater volume of tokens, but subsequent stages gradually tighten the supply. This approach not only rewards early believers in the project’s vision but also helps prevent market saturation. By the final stages, the limited availability is designed to maintain demand and support price integrity – qualities often associated with the highest potential crypto. This systematic approach stands in contrast to many “all-at-once” token sales that can flood the market, often leading to volatile price swings. Web3Bay’s stage-based strategy offers a clear, predictable structure. It ensures that the project enters the market with a balanced, sustainable ecosystem, avoiding a sudden influx of tokens that could create instability. This controlled release schedule positions Web3Bay as the highest potential crypto. A Foundation for Future Growth: More Than Just Fundraising Fundraising and token distribution are just the initial steps. Web3Bay’s structured presale is part of a broader roadmap designed to achieve the project’s long-term objectives. By carefully scaling funding through incremental price increases, Web3Bay can concentrate on sustainable development rather than relying solely on initial hype. This strategy provides the team with the resources needed to fulfill its promises while building confidence among investors and future users. Each stage builds upon the previous one, generating natural momentum. As the price gradually increases, it reflects the growing interest and trust in the project. The staged structure also provides opportunities for Web3Bay to regularly update its community, keeping them informed and engaged. By the time the project launches, it will have a solid foundation, a strong community base, and a price that more accurately reflects its market potential. This measured approach is a key factor in Web3Bay’s potential as a highest potential crypto. Open Communication: Building Confidence and Trust Transparency is central to Web3Bay’s presale strategy. By clearly outlining each stage and openly communicating pricing, token availability, and overall progress, Web3Bay is building a relationship of trust with its supporters. Potential investors can easily see where the project stands, what’s coming next, and how their participation fits into the overall vision. The gradual token release and ongoing updates help prevent misinformation or confusion that can sometimes occur during rapid token sales. Instead of rushing the process, Web3Bay ensures its backers are well-informed, increasing confidence and reducing uncertainty. This commitment to transparency, combined with a well-structured presale, strengthens Web3Bay’s standing as the highest potential crypto. A Path to Stability: Beyond the Initial Launch Web3Bay’s 28-stage presale is more than just a fundraising mechanism; it’s a carefully designed roadmap aimed at fostering long-term growth and market stability. The gradual reduction in token availability supports price integrity, the measured price increases build momentum and trust, and the ongoing transparency reinforces community confidence. With $970,000 already raised, 250 million tokens sold, and the price per token steadily increasing, Web3Bay’s presale structure is demonstrating its effectiveness. Early participants are positioned for significant returns, and the project is on track to achieve a launch price that reflects genuine market interest rather than short-lived speculation. This structured, transparent approach to fundraising and token distribution not only supports a successful launch but also lays a strong foundation for continued success. With its clear vision and measured strategy, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the highest potential crypto , potentially benefiting both its early backers and the wider community.

Could 2025 bring another golden opportunity? Top analysts say RCO Finance (RCOF), Sui (SUI), and (XRP) might be the next big winners. They believe these must buy altcoins can turn a small $1,000 investment into $1 million. Let’s look at why experts are so confident. 1. RCO Finance Some say RCO Finance could be the next big name in crypto. It’s a DeFi trading platform that stands out because it brings AI into finance. This makes trading easier for everyone and removes some of the usual barriers that stop people from getting involved. A key feature of RCO Finance’s offering to traders is its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This is a tool that helps you make better decisions by trading how you like, based on your risk tolerance and goals. Think of it as a portfolio manager, but one that is automated such that you are profitable without the heavy lifting that comes with personal trading or the fees that come with portfolio managers. In early 2024, many traders lost money when Telegram-based coins crashed after Notcoin launched. With the robo advisor, they could have avoided big losses. What’s more, the platform prioritizes security by conducting regular audits of its smart contracts. SolidProof , a trusted Web3 auditor, conducts these audits to guarantee the safety of investors’ funds. Another thing that makes RCO Finance different is that it doesn’t require KYC, which protects user privacy. It also lets users stake their assets and earn rewards. This can help investors grow their money over time without needing to do much. The platform recently launched its beta version and is letting users test its AI-driven tools. More updates are expected, which could increase interest even further. With strong security measures in place, traders have another reason to consider RCOF as a key pick for Q1 2025. 2. Sui In the world of blockchain, speed is more than just a bonus. It’s something platforms need to compete. That’s where SUI comes in. It can handle huge amounts of transactions without slowing down. Many developers and companies see it as one of the best crypto to buy because it works faster than others still using old methods. But speed isn’t the only thing SUI brings to the table. It also makes life easier for developers. Imagine a small team in Latin America trying to build an app for gig workers. With SUI, they can do it without struggling with slow networks or system crashes. This is a big deal for anyone working on new projects in the crypto world. Meanwhile, SUI’s price movement has been slow recently. SUI is valued at $3.74, a 3.36% decrease in its value from last week. Sui’s recent integration into Phantom Wallet will increase its availability and usage, making SUI one of the must buy altcoins. This could push its price to $5 soon. 3. XRP One of XRP’s biggest strengths is speed. The network can handle over 1,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the crypto world. It also keeps costs low, which is why many see it as one of the must buy altcoins for quick payments. Businesses and individuals looking for a reliable way to send money worldwide find it useful. XRP continues to be a popular choice. Its speed, low fees, and ability to handle many transactions make it stand out. Ripple’s latest XRP Markets Report showed that the company held 4,485,366,320 XRP at the end of 2024, giving investors insight into the current coin’s price and market trends. XRP’s performance has been dropping recently. XRP is trading at $2.88, which indicates a 4.95% fall from last week. Moving forward, some experts predict an uptrend for XRP due to the possibility of an XRP ETF soon. This could push the value of XRP to $4, making it one of the must buy altcoins. RCOF Becomes One of the Must Buy Altcoins: Join Now and See Your $1k Rise to $1 Million The RCOF presale is catching the interest of many crypto traders. Some believe it could become a major name in the market. So far, RCO Finance has raised more than $12 million, moving into the fifth stage of its presale. Right now, the RCOF token costs $0.10. Experts think that when it officially launches, the price could jump to somewhere between $0.40 and $0.60. If that happens, early investors might see a return of over 670%, making it one of the must buy altcoins. Some analysts are even more confident. They believe they could easily turn an investment of $1,000 into $1 million quickly. With so much talk around the RCOF token, many traders are keeping a close eye on it.

BlockDAG’s Biggest Offer Turns Up the Heat! SOL Price Analysis Hints at Recovery & XRP Supply Debate Resurfaces,https://thecoinrise.com/350-more-bdag-blockdags-biggest-offer-turns-up-the-heat-sol-price-analysis-hints-at-recovery-xrp-supply-debate-resurfaces/,"Solana, XRP, and BlockDAG are shaping up as strong contenders for the best crypto to buy now, each making headlines with key developments. The latest Solana (SOL) price analysis highlights its potential for recovery after briefly dipping below $195, with investors watching resistance levels to determine its next move. Meanwhile, discussions around XRP supply continue, sparking fresh debates about its total token limit. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing all the attention with its biggest offer yet — the FINALCALL700 bonus. This offer is fueling its record-breaking presale, offering a massive 350% extra BDAG with every purchase. With $191.5 million already raised and demand surging, early buyers rush to lock in this limited-time opportunity before BDAG’s price climbs. Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Recover After Dropping Below $195? The recent Solana (SOL) price analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency recently dropped below $195 before making a swift recovery. This decline followed a rejection near $280, sparking concerns about short-term movement. Despite the pullback, analysts believe the asset still has room for upward momentum, provided key resistance levels are broken. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests an oversold market, which could support a potential rally. For Solana to reach $500, it must first surpass resistance at $280 and $400, while maintaining support above $180 and $200. The Solana price analysis also highlights Bitcoin’s influence, as broader market trends continue to impact its trajectory. XRP Supply Debate: Why 100 Billion Cap Is Permanent Discussions around the XRP supply have resurfaced, with some questioning whether Ripple holds the ability to create additional tokens beyond the 100 billion originally issued. However, XRPL validator Vet has clarified that the network’s design prevents any increase in supply. The XRP Ledger includes an “invariant checker,” a security feature that ensures no new tokens can be minted. Unlike Bitcoin, which once faced an accidental inflation bug, XRPL’s structure makes such an issue highly unlikely. Additionally, XRP’s supply is decreasing over time due to transaction fees that burn small amounts with each transaction, reinforcing the token’s scarcity. FINALCALL700: 350% Bonus Drives BlockDAG’s $191.5M Presale BlockDAG’s presale is reaching new heights, and its latest offer, FINALCALL700, is making it even more appealing. For a limited time, every BDAG purchase comes with a 350% extra coin bonus, making this the most rewarding offer in BlockDAG’s history. Traders looking to maximise their holdings before launch are moving quickly, as this bonus significantly increases their BDAG count. For example, a $1,000 BDAG purchase with FINALCALL700 results in $4,500 worth of BDAG, an opportunity rarely seen in early-stage crypto sales. The BDAG coin presale has already raised $191.5 million and sold over 18.3 billion coins, making it one of the largest in the market. BDAG’s price has surged 2380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, fueling strong demand. The combination of its rapid growth and FINALCALL700 has many traders calling it the best crypto to buy now, as presale participation continues accelerating. The bonus isn’t just an extra incentive—it’s actively driving momentum, pushing BlockDAG toward new milestones as interest skyrockets. But what does the future hold for BDAG holders once the presale ends? Analysts predict a $1 price right after launch, positioning BDAG as a strong long-term contender. The FINALCALL700 may be the best chance to stake up on BDAG coins before prices climb even higher, but it won’t last forever. With demand accelerating, those still on the sidelines risk watching this opportunity slip away as BDAG moves toward its next phase. Final Thoughts: Where SOL, XRP & BDAG Stand Now? As the market continues to shift, each of these contenders presents a unique opportunity. The Solana (SOL) price analysis suggests a potential rebound, but breaking resistance levels will be key to its next rally. The XRP supply remains fixed at 100 billion, confirming its scarcity as discussions around its tokenomics settle. However, BlockDAG’s momentum is on another level. With FINALCALL700 offering 350% extra BDAG, demand is high and the presale has skyrocketed past $191.5 million. Analysts predict BDAG will hit $1 post-launch, making this presale phase a rare entry point for those looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Once the FINALCALL700 bonus disappears, so does the chance to secure extra BDAG coins at this affordable price.

The company has reportedly enlisted Jefferies Financial Group Inc. to assist with the potential listing. If the IPO happens, Bullish will go public among several cryptocurrency companies as hope rises that President Donald Trump will be friendly to crypto. Led by Chief Executive Officer Tom Farley, the exchange is growing internationally, with offices in the U.S., Hong Kong, Singapore, Gibraltar, and the Cayman Islands. Bullish pursues IPO as market conditions improve An IPO would see Bullish joining a growing number of companies in the sector moving ahead with plans to go public amid expectations that President Donald Trump will pursue a pro-crypto agenda. The firm once revealed its plans to go public in 2021 via an SPAC, only to shelve those plans. The new IPO discussions reflect the company’s shift in approach as market conditions improve and the regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies becomes more defined. Bullish is a subsidiary of Block.one, a blockchain software company subsidiary whose backers include Thiel, Alan Howard, Louis Bacon, and Richard Li. Block.one, whose co-founder and CEO Brendan Blumer also serves as Bullish’s chairman, launched the company in 2021 and capitalized Bullish with about $10 billion in digital assets and cash. Crypto firms set to reenter IPO market as regulatory landscape shifts Going public via an IPO was challenging for crypto firms under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chair Gary Gensler, was slow to review filings from companies like Circle, which initially pursued a public listing through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. However, following the collapse of FTX and the resulting investor skepticism toward the crypto market, Circle abandoned its plans in December 2022. Over the past four years, big crypto firms haven’t had much hope of going public, but all that’s set to change in January. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to reverse course on President Joe Biden’s digital asset crackdown is spurring hope that the initial public offering market could soon open to stablecoin provider Circle Internet Financial, trading platform Kraken, and other firms that have said they’d like to go public. Recently, Circle refiled for a traditional IPO, and there’s ample reason to think the stars will align for the firm and others like it to be successful this time. A representative of the firm said: Due to the nature of the registration process, we cannot comment. I can say that becoming a public company has always been a part of Circle’s core strategy, underscoring our commitment to trust and transparency. Circle spokesman. The Bullish IPO discussions are ongoing, and details, including timing and valuation, remain subject to change. Additional banks may also be brought in to support the offering. The representatives of Bullish and Block.one have not yet responded to the requests for comment, and a spokesman for Jefferies has declined to comment. Bullish’s IPO plans align with those of other crypto companies returning to the public markets. With more definitions of regulations and the positive shift in the investor’s mindset, more companies are expected to go for the public market.

Though no official information has been released concerning the IPO, Bloomberg reported that the Peter Thiel-backed firm may advance this push this year. Bullish Global IPO Is Not a Surprise According to the Bloomberg report , citing people familiar with the IPO , Bullish Global allegedly works with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. on the potential listing. Before this time, Bullish Global has been considering going public. Almost four years ago, it announced its intention to go public through a Special-Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). Despite the lofty plans, the firm soon broke from this move. According to the same sources, which requested to be anonymous due to the confidentiality of information, there are ongoing deliberations on the matter. However, they also clarified that details of the offering could change, which may include adding more banks to the existing lineup. Bullish Global made the news last year when it acquired the crypto media site Coindesk. Despite the claims of editorial independence, the platform has had to deal with management and editorial conflicts of interest. Bullish IPO and Top Crypto Candidates Beyond the Bullish IPO plans, many organizations are gradually moving towards going public. Popular stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial is still mulling the possibility of going public in the United States. Meanwhile, another Peter Thiel-backed firm, Bitpanda, has its sights set on public listing. In the case of Bitpanda, it has collaborated with Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise it on its next step. The crypto industry is advancing, with companies recording impressive earnings amid the turn of the bull run. According to Galaxy Research, at least four companies are on track to go public this year. Besides Circle, it named Fireblocks, Chainalysis, and Kraken the likely candidates to go public. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings’ CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed, against broad industry clamor, that there are no IPO plans . Should the Galaxy IPO come true, these firms will join Coinbase, MARA Holdings, and other crypto-native firms in the stock market. Favorable Crypto Policies To Help Noteworthy, President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance may have revived the US companies’ faith toward going public. It is worth noting that Thiel was one of those who supported the Republican politician around the time of his campaign. With the spotlight on the industry, regulatory shifts may also favor the service providers to go public. Bullish Global and Circle, with failed SPAC moves, may finally gain the IPO pathway to going public.

39928573,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=668671,1738714433,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39928573.jpeg,White House Crypto Czar David Sacks holds “disappointing” first press conference,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/white-house-crypto-czar-david-sacks-holds-disappointing-first-press-conference/,"David Sacks, the newly appointed White House Crypto Czar, walked into his highly anticipated press conference on Capitol Hill today and left many in the crypto community frustrated. His mission was to explain how President Trump’s administration plans to push the US into crypto dominance after years of chaos under Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto regime. Instead of providing the hard-hitting regulatory clearances everyone expected, Sacks played it safe with broad strokes, vague assurances, and a lot of talk about “the golden age of digital assets.” Sacks opened with gratitude, thanking leaders from both the House and Senate, including Chairmen Tim Scott, French Hill, John Boozman, and GT Thompson, who were all standing right beside him as you can see in the video below. “The president set this as a week-one priority,” Sacks said. “We’re committed to ensuring American dominance in digital assets.” Trump’s crypto vision triggers regulatory shake-up Trump’s executive order laid the groundwork for the Crypto Czar’s mission, which is to craft a federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, particularly stablecoins. Sacks pointed to the working group established under the executive order, which includes big names like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick, and incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by crypto-friendly commissioner Mark Uyeda until Paul Atkins gets Senate-confirmed, has also created a dedicated crypto task force, which is led by ‘Crypto Mom’ Hester Peirce, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. Sacks took a moment to vent about the damage done by the SEC’s previous approach. “I’ve talked to many founders who told me their biggest problem is regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “They were prosecuted without being told what they did wrong. Some were even debanked personally just for founding a crypto company.” Sacks blamed this hostility for pushing innovation offshore, something he and the administration are desperate to reverse. The Crypto Czar also made it clear that he wholeheartedly believes all financial assets are going digital, whether regulators are ready or not. “Just like every analog industry became digital, financial assets will follow,” he said. “We don’t want that innovation happening in other countries.” To drive the point home, Sacks referenced FTX’s collapse, which he said was proof of the dangers of offshore operations. “The biggest fraud in crypto history happened in the Bahamas,” he reminded the room. “Keeping innovation onshore means better consumer protection.” Stablecoins come first as Congress warms up to crypto Sacks repeatedly pointed out the importance of stablecoins in the administration’s strategy. He mentioned the bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, which plans to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins that would maintain the US dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency, as Cryptopolitan reported yesterday. “Stablecoins could create trillions in demand for US Treasuries and potentially lower long-term interest rates,” Sacks explained. French Hill, who is the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, confirmed that stablecoins would be prioritized over other crypto issues. “We’re moving fast on this,” Hill said. “Bipartisan support between the House and Senate is already in place, and we’ve learned from past efforts.” He referenced last year’s bipartisan success when 71 Democrats joined House Republicans to pass stablecoin legislation in the House, though it stalled in the Senate. Hill also praised Hester’s involvement. “Hester brings a clear-headed approach to crypto regulation,” he said. John Boozman, who is the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, explained why his committee, typically focused on farming, has a role in crypto regulation. “The CFTC oversees commodities, and some digital assets fall under that category,” he said. Boozman promised that collaboration between the SEC and CFTC would prevent jurisdictional battles from delaying progress. “We’ve worked separately before, but now we’re coming together with purpose.” AML laws under scrutiny; Bitcoin reserve under consideration Fred Peterson from Punchbowl News asked Sacks whether crypto-specific AML measures were on the table. Sacks responded cautiously. “We’re open to discussions,” he said, “but this isn’t just about digital assets. Bad actors exist in all financial systems.” One of the more intriguing moments came when Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schwanberger asked about Trump’s campaign trail promise to explore a Bitcoin reserve. Sacks confirmed that: “The president instructed us to look into it. We’re still waiting for some key officials to be confirmed, but this is one of the first things we’re reviewing.” He clarified that while a Bitcoin reserve is being explored, a crypto sovereign wealth fund would require separate discussions. GT Thompson, who is Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said Congress is in sync with the White House’s goals, so any and all expectations of pto-crypto legislations are allowed.

From Dogecoin’s explosive rise to Shiba Inu’s unforgettable bull run, meme coins have consistently turned small investments into life-changing gains. And most recently, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) proved once again that meme coin magic is very much alive, making early investors massive returns in record time. But here’s the thing—crypto never sleeps, and a new golden opportunity is already knocking. With its bulls-backed community, staking rewards, and Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already live, BTFD Coin (BTFD) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s shaping up to be a movement. If you missed CHILLGUY’s rocket ride, don’t let history repeat itself—BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to join in February 2025 , gearing up to be the next legendary meme coin to watch. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad and Staking—A Community-Backed Powerhouse BTFD Coin isn’t just about memes and hype—it’s about community-driven growth, smart tokenomics, and explosive earning potential. While CHILLGUY had its run, BTFD’s Bulls Squad is setting a new standard for meme coin engagement and rewards. The Bulls Squad is a referral program designed to bring early believers massive rewards. Think of it like this: you refer friends, they buy BTFD, and you earn free tokens. It’s simple, it’s lucrative, and it’s already making waves. Imagine stacking up tokens just by bringing in more people to the movement—it’s like growing your own crypto empire before the token even lists! But that’s not all. BTFD Coin also features a Play-to-Earn game that went live on January 1st, 2025, letting users battle, trade, and earn tokens while having fun. And if staking is more your style, BTFD offers a whopping 90% APY, making it one of the best new meme coins to join in February 2025, offering one of the best passive income opportunities in the meme coin market today. Now, let’s talk numbers—Stage 14 is here, and BTFD is currently sitting at just $0.00016 per token. But this price won’t stick around for long. With over $5.93 million already raised, 69 billion tokens sold, and more than 10,200 bullish holders, the BTFD army is only getting stronger. How big could BTFD get? Let’s do the math. Listing price is $0.0006 and the projected price after launch is $0.006. If you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.00016, you’d get 62.5 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its predicted post-launch price of $0.006, that stash would be worth a massive $375,000! That’s enough to wipe out debt, put a down payment on a house, or even buy a Tesla. But to catch this wave, you’ve got to act fast. The price is set to increase with every stage, and with demand surging, the chance to grab BTFD at these low levels won’t last. How to Buy BTFD Coin? Set up your bullish wallet – Get MetaMask or Trust Wallet and secure your keys. Load up with BNB or ETH – You’ll need these to swap for $BTFD. Connect your wallet – Head to the presale page and get ready. Buy BTFD – Select your purchase amount and confirm. Receive your BTFD – Tokens will be claimable before listing. Stay updated – Staked rewards and game earnings will vest after launch.

With its laid-back branding, massive community engagement, and a dedicated meme culture, CHILLGUY attracted thousands of investors who saw their portfolios skyrocket.

The hype is building, the numbers are solid, and the Bulls Squad is turning early believers into crypto heavyweights.

The price dropped over 9% in just a few hours, hitting a low of $91,530, only to bounce back by more than 12% following reports that President Trump is negotiating with Mexico and Canada to lift tariffs. This shift in sentiment quickly fueled renewed optimism across the market. Related Reading: Solana Retraces TRUMP Meme Pump Gains – But Technicals Suggest A $300 Run Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s resilience amid uncertainty. He noted that BTC still looks much stronger than anything else in the market, maintaining a solid uptrend when viewed from a broader perspective. Despite the aggressive sell-off, Bitcoin remains structurally sound, with strong demand levels preventing deeper corrections. With BTC trading back above key levels, investors are watching closely to see if the cryptocurrency can sustain this momentum and push toward all-time highs. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can solidify its position as the dominant asset in the market or if further volatility will test its strength again. For now, Bitcoin appears to be leading the market recovery, proving its resilience once more. Bitcoin Holding Bullish Price Action Despite recent volatility and aggressive selling pressure, Bitcoin continues to show strength compared to altcoins, proving its dominance in the market. While many altcoins struggle to recover, BTC has rebounded quickly from its lows, reinforcing its position as the leading asset. Yesterday’s price action further confirmed that Bitcoin is still in control, and the long-anticipated altseason may be delayed until altcoins can catch up with BTC’s momentum. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s resilience. He noted that BTC is much stronger than anything else in the market and still looks perfectly fine when zooming out. According to Daan, Bitcoin’s demand remains significantly higher than other assets, especially during times of uncertainty. This is evident in the recent market movement, where BTC recovered swiftly while most altcoins remained stagnant or continued to drop. Daan’s analysis reveals that Bitcoin is currently trading within a defined range, with an all-time high (ATH) of $109K at the upper boundary and strong support at the $90K level. As long as BTC holds within this range, the potential for another breakout remains high. If bulls manage to push BTC above the ATH, a new bullish phase will begin, potentially leaving altcoins further behind. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Another key factor driving Bitcoin’s dominance is institutional interest. The recent data from major on-chain analytics platforms reveals that Bitcoin accumulation remains strong among whales, with large holders continuing to add BTC despite market uncertainty. Unlike previous market cycles, where retail investors drove price surges, this rally appears to be fueled by institutions and long-term holders, making it more sustainable. Testing Key Demand Levels Bitcoin is testing crucial liquidity below the $100K mark, currently trading at $99,400 and attempting to find a strong footing before its next move. Price action remains highly unpredictable and volatile, with investors closely watching key levels for signs of a potential breakout or further downside. For BTC to confirm short-term strength, it must reclaim the $100K mark and hold it as support. This level is a psychological and technical barrier that, once secured, could trigger renewed bullish momentum. If Bitcoin struggles to maintain this level, further consolidation below $100K could follow, delaying any breakout attempts. The $98K level is another crucial support zone. As long as BTC stays above this mark, a push back above $100K remains highly likely. Losing this level could lead to a deeper retracement, testing lower demand zones before another attempt to reclaim higher levels.

HTX was formerly known as Huobi. The disclosure came in the middle of a string of posts on X touting the Decentralized USD (USDD), a stablecoin backed by subsidiaries of Sun’s Tron platform. In one of the posts, Sun says (translated from Chinese) that “even if Li Lin uses it, he can leave unscathed; USDD will give him every penny of the interest!” In the post, Sun continues by saying Li “concealed due diligence materials, creating a $30 million hole internally.” Furthermore: “I discovered it, exposed it, and after being exposed, he [Li] tried to weasel out of it and didn’t pay a cent.” Sun ended up lending the company money to cover the loss. “Fortunately, I had money back then,” he concluded. Sun has been posting heavily about USDD as Tron plans to issue a new version of USDD — USDD 2.0 — that will offer 20% APY on staking. Sun and Li’s numerous issues This is not the first issue that has arisen with the October 2022 sale of Li’s share in Huobi. In May 2023, Sun alleged that Li’s brother Li Wei obtained a large quantity of Huobi’s native HT token at no cost “through improper means” in a now-deleted X post. Sun promised to recover and destroy Li Wei’s HT, despite also claiming that Lin Wei sold the token. In June 2023, Li Lin filed a suit against Huobi Global in Hong Kong, claiming that his X-Spot company owned the rights to the Huobi trademark, despite the sale of his shares. According to Bloomberg, Li Lin went on to co-found New Huo Technology Holdings digital asset service platform. Harvard has called him the 39th most generous philanthropist in China. Justin Sun stays busy with finance and art The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Sun in March 2023 for the sale of purported crypto securities. Sun has invested over $30 million in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, where he already served as an adviser. Sun is probably best known to the public for his purchase for $6.2 million of a conceptual artwork that consisted of a banana taped to wall. He went on to eat the banana.

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

Starting at approximately $0.52 in November 2024, XRP’s price jumped to around $2.46 by early 2025, marking an increase of nearly 373%. It’s currently sitting at $2.65, which means more than a 400% increase over one year. This gave rise to all kinds of speculation about whether XRP would achieve a big breakout against BTC. If we take a look at the monthly price chart (courtesy of CoinMarketCap), it’s noticeable that XRP has been performing very well. However, this can always change when it comes to cryptocurrencies, though some experts and well-known traders have a positive stance regarding future developments. Expert Opinion: Bullish, but Cautious For instance, a few days ago, Peter Brandt said on X that even though he doesn’t care about XRP, there is no other way right now to define the chart other than a bull flag.

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 345,000 YouTube subscribers that Sui ( SUI ) may be repeating a historic pattern that could lead to a collapse. According to Pizzino, SUI saw an overbalance in time and price following its collapse to a low of $2.38. Pizzino explains that the overbalance means SUI went down longer in price and further in time than any corrective period it witnessed during this bull market. With the current setup, the trader says SUI may be following in the footsteps of its April to August 2024 price action when it initially crashed from about $2 to below $1 before witnessing another deep corrective move. “[Sui is] trying to hold the 50% level similar to what it did last time [in April 2024]. Okay, that was a 58% decline into this freak bottom ($0.43 in August 2024). So see that dump into this level. It’s almost exactly the same guys.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube He says if Sui cannot hold $2 as support on the daily chart it may dip to $1.60 or even lower, which would be in line with the 2024 pattern. “So if you get these next couple of panic lows, I’d be looking somewhere around back to $1.60, maybe even $1.10, $1.20 at those previous tops, maybe back down into that zone [around $0.73]. But we won’t worry about those yet. Let’s see if it actually gets back down to the $2 level.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube SUI is trading for $3.60 at time of writing, up 14% in the last 24 hours. ?

As 2025 unfolds, Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) remain popular choices, but a new contender, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is making waves with its AI-driven decentralized wallet and smart trading solutions. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale already attracting major interest, the question is clear: Will Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) keep up, or is WLTQ the next big thing? Let’s dive in and uncover what 2025 holds for these three altcoins and why WallitIQ (WLQT) could be your best bet right now. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Promising Future: The Presale Surge And What It Means For 2025 The ongoing presale for WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been a success, with the presale rapidly gaining traction. Investors are flocking to secure the token before the price rises further. With the presale gaining momentum, the future looks promising, and the project is gearing up for a major leap in 2025. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is a clear indicator of the project’s growing popularity and potential. With more people flocking to join, the presale continues to raise substantial funds, and with its ongoing pace, experts predict that WLTQ could see a substantial surge in value by 2025. As more investors jump on board, the presale success is just the beginning . This decentralized wallet is designed to improve the DeFi experience, making it easier for users to trade, invest, and participate in crypto markets. Features like exclusive airdrops, community rewards, AI chatbots, and performance tracking make the platform more than just a wallet; it’s a fully integrated ecosystem designed for both crypto enthusiasts and serious investors. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is redefining the way people interact with digital assets through its AI-powered, decentralized crypto wallet. With its focus on security, speed, and user-friendly features, the platform includes an MVP of Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App offering faster and safer crypto transactions. Additionally, transaction security is guaranteed through a Solidproof audit, affirming the safety of its ecosystem. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) tokenomics are designed for long-term growth and sustainability. With a limited supply of WLTQ tokens, early investors have a prime opportunity to secure their stake in the ecosystem. As the presale nears completion, WLTQ is poised to launch on major exchanges and is already listed on CoinMarketCap at a price of $0.0420 , increasing its visibility in the crypto market . XRP’s Path To New Heights In 2025 In 2024, XRP (XRP) broke its resistance and traded above $2, fueled by market optimism. Many experts predict a bullish 2025, with XRP (XRP) potentially reaching $5 or even $7 by mid-year. Key drivers of this growth include the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, bringing clarity to investors. Additionally, Ripple’s new RLUSD stablecoin is gaining momentum, and the potential approval of an XRP (XRP) ETF could attract institutional interest. With major players like Canary Capitals seeking approval, this could drive XRP (XRP) to new price heights, solidifying its position in the future of finance. Dogecoin’s Future: Potential For Growth Or Decline By 2025 Dogecoin, initially created as a meme coin, has evolved into a widely recognized cryptocurrency. As of the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.33 . Analysts have mixed predictions for its future; some anticipate that if social media hype and community support persist, Dogecoin could surpass $1. Conversely, a decline in interest might see it revert to around $0.10. However, not everyone is optimistic. Another big Dogecoin price prediction says the coin could crash down to $0.10 by 2025 if meme-driven momentum evaporates. Dogecoin fans shrug that off, claiming that a loyal community can push any dip back up, but some watchers say new tokens like WallitIQ (WLTQ) might lure investors away. What’s Next For Crypto Investors? As we look ahead to 2025, the crypto landscape is full of potential , but only a few projects stand out from the crowd. While Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) may have had their moments, they’re facing increasing competition from projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ), a game-changer in the world of decentralized finance. With its presale already generating massive excitement, WallitIQ (WLTQ) represents a promising investment opportunity, and this is the perfect time to get in early and secure your share of the tokens.

MANTRA has sharply bounced back from a significant price point, doubling its value for all holders. A recent review of Ethereum prices suggests a potential fall to $2,913 if it slips below $3,023. Web3Bay stands out by reducing doubts entirely. It hands control over its holders with trustless smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring openness. The platform’s presale success, raising over $1 million with 280 million tokens sold, signals strong market adoption. Web3Bay isn’t just attracting users; it’s drawing them into a transformative future. Mantra Surges 60%: What’s Next? The 60% increase in MANTRA demonstrates a strong recovery from an essential support level, securing 100% profits for all its holders. This achievement boosts investor confidence as MANTRA utilizes the latest technological innovations. Transaction activities on top exchanges like Binance ($746.8M) and OKX highlight vibrant market participation. With a positive market outlook and solid technological backing, MANTRA’s rise seems to have strong market and technological support. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Battle for $3,000 Current Ethereum price analyses indicate significant stress, with a recent 6.8% drop pushing it near the crucial $3,000 threshold. The market has seen $850 million in liquidations, emphasizing a growing bearish view. Data on Ethereum derivatives points to caution, with a decline in open interest and a drop in the long-to-short ratio, signaling waning confidence. If Ethereum breaks below $3,023, it could test $2,913, though any rebound around this level could provide temporary relief. How Web3Bay Ensures Trustless, Profitable, and Fair E-Commerce Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce with a safer, more effective, and cost-friendly platform powered by smart contracts. These contracts execute on their own, ensuring precision and fairness without the possibility of external tampering. By committing to relinquish ownership after distributing non-team tokens, Web3Bay guarantees a system free from central control, promoting transparency and fairness. At the core of Web3Bay’s operational model are the 3BAY token holders, who play an active role in guiding the platform’s decisions. They have a say in everything from fee structures to new feature integrations, making every important decision community-driven. Web3Bay is set to evolve into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enhancing its flexibility and maintaining its user-focused ethos. This transition is already garnering global interest. The presale for this web3 crypto has crossed the $1 million mark, with over 280 million tokens claimed. Investors getting in before the close of Stage 4 at a presale price of $0.004562625 per token have the prospect of a 4,200% gain upon launch, with a target price of $0.1959 per token. Final Say! The 60% surge in Mantra underscores the potential of robust technology and solid fundamentals, whereas Ethereum’s price faces increasing uncertainty. With substantial trading on Binance alone, Mantra’s climb reflects a solid foundation. Conversely, Ethereum risks falling to $2,913 without strong support at $3,023. While one shows stability, the other is uncertainty, yet Web3Bay provides a unique narrative. With an upcoming price increase at launch, early investors in this web3 crypto might realize a 4,200% return. However, with limited time left in presale Stage 4, timing is critical for those looking to invest.

After briefly rising above the $100,000 price mark on Tuesday, BTC has since fallen back and now hovers just above $99,000. The rebound that initially raised market sentiment appears to have been short-lived, as the cryptocurrency struggles to regain the upward momentum needed to break through higher resistance levels. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Price Crash Could Be a Buying Opportunity for Big Players Bitcoin Smart DCA Flashes—What This Means While BTC faces these ups and downs, Darkfost, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlighted a potential opportunity for investors employing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. According to Darkfost, the Smart DCA indicator was recently triggered, suggesting that current price levels may be a “favorable” entry point for those looking to accumulate BTC over time. Darkfost explained that by comparing Bitcoin’s average price to its short-term realized price—ranging from one week to one month—this indicator aims to identify optimal zones for long-term accumulation. The analyst added: When executed properly, a DCA strategy can generate substantial returns in the short, mid, or long term, depending on the investor’s goals. However, this indicator should be used alongside other metrics and a broader market analysis for optimal accuracy and effectiveness. Signs of Bullish Momentum Emerge While short-term price fluctuations have rattled some investors, other analysts point to underlying trends that hint at bullish potential. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Onatt, observed that buyer activity is beginning to outweigh selling pressure. Related Reading: After The Bitcoin Crash: Will It Rise Or Drop Again? 5 Key Indicators Using data from Coinbase, Onatt noted a visible premium indicating strong demand for Bitcoin, even in the face of recent volatility. Furthermore, negative funding rates—driven by approximately $2 billion in long liquidations—suggest a market environment where buyers are taking advantage of discounted prices to position themselves for a potential upward movement. Onatt also explained: Bitcoin’s upward momentum remains likely as long as USDT dominance stays below 4.65%, signaling continued market confidence and potential for further recovery. Adding to this sentiment, analyst Ali identified a critical demand zone for Bitcoin between $96,475 and $99,360. According to Ali, as long as this range holds as a support level, the market outlook favors the bulls. A breakout above the $102,350 to $103,900 supply zone could further strengthen the bullish case, potentially setting the stage for a sustained recovery. #Bitcoin $BTC has reclaimed a critical demand zone between $96,475 and $99,360 as support. As long as this level holds, the odds favor the bulls; especially if the $102,350–$103,900 supply wall breaks. pic.twitter.com/FLpwRqYVuu — Ali (@ali_charts) February 4, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-05 02:00:45

This abysmal performance has seen crypto analysts predict that DOGE could continue plunging. As a result, investors are flocking to RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging AI altcoin that has raised over $12.73 million during its ongoing public presale. Why are Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pivoting toward RCO Finance (RCOF)? Let’s find out! Dogecoin Price Dumps 25% In A Week: What’s Next? Dogecoin has performed dismally over the past week, tumbling by double digits. On January 27, the Dogecoin price was trading at around $0.3335. After trading around this range for days, the Dogecoin price experienced a sharp drop on February 2. This slump came after Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the $100,000 support level, triggering a bearish trend in the altcoin market. The resulting downtrend saw Dogecoin (DOGE) trade as low as $0.2477 on February 3. Notably, this price means Dogecoin (DOGE) has plunged 25% in a week. Moreover, experts expect the Dogecoin price to plummet further as investors migrate to tokens with better prospects. RCO Finance: A Trading And Investment Hub With AI Features With the Dogecoin price grappling with the renewed bearish trend in the crypto market, investors are searching for alternative investments to hedge against further losses. To address this need, investors are flocking to RCO Finance , a budding DeFi platform that supports over 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). By combining the crypto and TradFi industries, RCO Finance lets you create a robust investment portfolio that can withstand the current bear market. While this offering is impressive, it mainly complements RCO Finance’s top feature, an AI-powered robo advisor. The robo advisor is RCO Finance’s flagship feature because it leverages machine learning and advanced algorithms to analyze data from prominent sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. With the carefully curated data, the robo advisor is able to offer custom investment insights based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. These recommendations can tell you when to enter, double down, or exit positions for the highest possible returns and minimal risk exposure. For example, the robo advisor could have suggested purchasing Dogecoin (DOGE) before the Q4 2024 rally. Also, the robo advisor could have prompted you to sell before the Dogecoin price crashed. RCO Finance designed its robo advisor with you in mind. To this end, RCO Finance allows you to customize your trading station, giving the robo advisor the power to trade on your behalf. This feature saves you the time and effort needed to find high-potential investments early. Thus far, RCO Finance has launched its beta platform , allowing you to interact with the robo advisor and other features early. Notably, RCO Finance has rolled out its beta platform while still running its presale. This milestone explains why this budding DeFi platform has already onboarded over 10,000 users. RCOF: A One-Of-A-Kind Investment Opportunity As the Dogecoin price continues crashing, investors are shifting to RCOF to hedge against more losses. DOGE investors and other crypto enthusiasts are rushing to buy RCOF because it is a safe investment. It is worth noting that SolidProof, a leader in blockchain security, audited RCOF’s smart contract and found it was vulnerability-free. The crypto space is also buzzing about RCOF because of its robust tokenomics. Notably, RCOF is a deflationary token with a maximum supply of 800 million tokens. This tokenomics model positions RCOF for tremendous growth as the RCO Finance ecosystem scales. As of February 3, RCOF was in Stage 5 of its presale. RCOF’s price during this stage is $0.1. This price is set to jump to $0.13 when RCOF kickstarts Stage 6. Also, RCOF is poised to generate more gains for Stage 5 investors, seeing as its listing price is $0.4-$0.6. Astonishingly, experts foresee RCOF surging 12,000% in Q1 2025. In doing so, RCOF will have mirrored the 12,800% climb in the Dogecoin price in 2021. This forecast explains why you should snag this rare opportunity and join the RCOF presale today!

NEAR Protocol has faced significant price fluctuations, with its value dropping over 12% in the past session, reflecting the market’s volatility. Despite this, analysts see NEAR as a long-term blockchain contender due to its ability to recover rapidly from market downturns. Polkadot continues to establish itself as a multichain champion, enabling different blockchains to communicate and interact. By introducing parachains, it has given developers the freedom to create custom blockchains that enhance blockchain efficiency and adoption. Among these strong contenders, Qubetics stands out with its innovative Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This project is tackling the inefficiencies of traditional financial systems, offering seamless interoperability and a transparent, secure trading environment. With a thriving presale, selling over 460 million tokens and raising $11.9 million, Qubetics is rapidly becoming a must-watch crypto project. Qubetics – Revolutionizing Real World Asset Tokenization Traditional financial markets often struggle with inefficiencies, high transaction fees, and slow settlements. Qubetics is set to change that by introducing a blockchain-based Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. By allowing businesses and individuals to tokenize tangible assets such as real estate, fine art, and commodities, Qubetics is opening up new investment opportunities. How Qubetics’ Tokenization Marketplace Works Imagine owning a fraction of high-value real estate without needing massive capital. Qubetics allows investors to buy, sell, and trade tokenized assets seamlessly, democratizing access to valuable assets that were once exclusive to large financial institutions. For businesses, this platform offers greater liquidity by enabling quicker asset transfers without relying on traditional banking intermediaries. This means companies can raise funds by selling tokenized shares of their assets while investors gain exposure to diversified, high-value markets. TICSScan – Empowering Blockchain Transparency A vital part of the Qubetics ecosystem is TICSScan, a blockchain explorer that provides in-depth insights into transaction activity, validator performance, and smart contract management. This transparency ensures that every transaction on the Qubetics blockchain is verifiable, enhancing trust within the ecosystem. Qubetics Presale – A Golden Opportunity Currently, in its 20th stage, the Qubetics presale has already attracted over 18,300 holders. With tokens priced at $0.0667, analysts are optimistic about its growth trajectory, expecting significant adoption upon its mainnet launch. Polkadot – The Multichain Champion Polkadot is redefining blockchain interoperability, allowing multiple chains to work together in a unified ecosystem. Instead of separate blockchains operating in silos, Polkadot’s parachain structure connects them, ensuring seamless data sharing and scalability. Parachains enable projects to create custom blockchains optimized for specific use cases while still benefiting from Polkadot’s security and scalability. This means that DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise applications can build on Polkadot without facing the same congestion issues as single-chain networks. With a rapidly expanding developer community and major partnerships, Polkadot is one of the most robust blockchain networks today. As enterprises and governments seek scalable blockchain solutions, Polkadot is positioning itself as a leader in real-world blockchain integration. NEAR Protocol – A Scalable Blockchain for the Future NEAR Protocol has gained traction as one of the most developer-friendly blockchain platforms. Despite recent price volatility, NEAR continues to show resilience with significant recovery patterns. This Layer-1 blockchain is designed for speed, low fees, and scalability. By utilizing sharding technology, NEAR ensures that transactions are processed efficiently without causing network congestion. This makes it an ideal blockchain for DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and decentralized marketplaces. While NEAR has experienced recent price fluctuations, its ability to recover quickly shows strong market demand. As adoption increases, this blockchain is expected to maintain its status as one of the top cryptos to join now. Why Real World Asset Tokenization is the Future With growing adoption of blockchain technology, real-world asset tokenization is set to disrupt traditional finance. Qubetics is leading this movement, ensuring seamless interoperability between physical and digital assets. As blockchain transparency becomes increasingly essential, TICSScan plays a crucial role in providing users with real-time insights into transactions and network activity. Conclusion – The Future of Crypto is Here For those looking to invest in transformative blockchain projects, Qubetics , Polkadot, and NEAR Protocol stand out as the top cryptos to join now. Whether it’s Qubetics’ asset tokenization marketplace, Polkadot’s multichain capabilities, or NEAR’s scalability solutions, these projects are shaping the future of decentralized finance.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.10 Market cap $907,369,647.51 Trading volume $62,296,802.87 Circulating supply 1,028,555,202 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.8428 24-hour high $0.9342 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.27% 50-day SMA $1.272 14-Day RSI 32.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.941 Tezos price analysis: XTZ shows signs of recovery despite broader bearish momentum TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 5% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.774, and resistance is at $1.109. Tezos shows signs of short-term recovery. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ continues to trend lower The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on February 5 shows a continued dip in the price. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.88, below the 20-day SMA and just above its critical support of around $0.774. XTZ continues to trend lower The MACD indicator, with a bearish crossover, also confirms the selling pressure observed on the chart. The RSI (33.51) reflects an oversold market, indicating strong selling pressure and a possible rebound. If buyer interest does not return soon, XTZ could break below $0.774. The coin must break past resistance at $1.109 for a recovery to be confirmed. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Slight buying pressure is present for XTZ The 4-hour chart shows a slight recovery, trading above the lower Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands are slightly expanding, suggesting increased volatility in the short term and possible recovery. Slight buying pressure is present for XTZ The CMF indicator shows some capital inflow and mild buying pressure, although limited. On the other hand, the MFI suggests a balance between sellers and buyers, indicating potential consolidation. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.790, it might move toward lower support levels. XTZ must move back above the middle Bollinger Band at $0.905 to confirm a recovery. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.0404 SELL SMA 5 $1.0611 SELL SMA 10 $1.1080 SELL SMA 21 $1.1870 SELL SMA 50 $1.2729 SELL SMA 100 $1.1756 SELL SMA 200 $0.9411 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.1551 SELL EMA 5 $1.1987 SELL EMA 10 $1.2557 SELL EMA 21 $1.3073 SELL EMA 50 $1.2899 SELL EMA 100 $1.1612 SELL EMA 200 $1.0313 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ is struggling to break past resistance around $0.9 – $1, which it needs to clear to continue its recovery. However, with the capital inflow observed in the short term, the price could trend higher and may even break past $1.10. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after a failed attempt at the 0.915 resistance level—a move spurred by sellers disposing of their coins and taking a profit. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover?

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it’s in the red zone, trading between $0.8428 and $0.9342.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-05 02:32:18

These two projects have caught the attention of traders, but another rising star is quickly making waves— Lightchain AI , which has now raised $14 million in its presale, positioning itself as a top contender for high-growth investments in 2025. As established players like Solana and Kaspa ride the bullish momentum, Lightchain AI is proving that early-stage investments can deliver massive ROI, making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens in the market.

Recently, on-chain data revealed that Shiba Inu whales had moved a staggering 15.1 trillion SHIB tokens in just one day. This significant SHIB transfer comes amid its market crash to new lows. With the increased whale activity, the question arises of whether these large-scale investors are preparing for a potential surge in the price of SHIB. Shiba Inu Whales Make Big Moves With 15 Trillion SHIB Transfer IntoTheBlock’s data reveals that large-scale SHIB holders , commonly referred to as Shiba Inu whales, have executed another massive transaction. In the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu whales moved a staggering 15.1 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $253.05 million. This large-scale SHIB transaction has caught the market’s attention, as whale movements often influence market sentiment and impact price trajectories. On February 2, Shiba Inu Whales transferred a whopping 4.3 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at $66.22 million. This transaction marked a significant increase of more than 2.8 trillion SHIB compared to their previous transaction of 1.5 trillion SHIB recorded on February 1. However, it appears that the activity of Shiba Inu whales has intensified even further. These large-scale token holders executed a recent 15.1 trillion SHIB transfer, representing an astonishing increase of 10.8 trillion from the previous day’s transfer of 4.3 trillion. Interestingly, this increase in whale transactions comes as the market experiences a significant crash. Following United States (US) President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada, the crypto market has been in a downturn . Big players like Bitcoin and Ethereum have crashed significantly, with BTC trading below the $100,000 mark and ETH down below $3,000. Shiba Inu was also among the cryptocurrencies affected by the market volatility. CoinMarketCap’s data reveals that SHIB experienced a 20% crash over the week, driving its price to new lows. While the meme coin has recovered slight gains of about 6.4% in the past 24 hours, its recent downtrend still reflects ongoing bearish pressure . Amidst the downtrend, IntoTheBlock reports that large holder inflows have skyrocketed by 553.59% in the last seven days. On February 2, large-scale SHIB holders had accumulated 1.27 trillion SHIB. However, their buying activity surged dramatically the next day, with whales purchasing an impressive 6.51 trillion SHIB. Despite the significant uptick in whale inflows, ITB’s data shows an extraordinary rise in outflows. Whale outflows skyrocketed by 1,290% in the last seven days, with 967.25 billion SHIB sent out on February 2. This trend continued the next day when whales moved an astonishing 6.5 trillion SHIB, marking a difference of over 5.5 trillion compared to the previous day. Are SHIB Whales Preparing For A Price Rally? While large-scale transactions often influence market trends, it’s still uncertain if the recent increase in Shiba Inu’s whale movements signals an impending price rally . Based on CoinMarketCap’s data, Shiba Inu appears to be showing signs of slight recovery from its recent downtrend, possibly driven by the surge in whale transfers. However, despite this rebound, the price of Shiba Inu remains well below its 2024 price high of over $0.00002. As of writing, the meme coin is trading at $0.000015, indicating a significant drop in value due to bearish market trends and changes in investor sentiment. Additionally, the meme coin’s trading volume has plummeted 38.7% in the last 24 hours, settling at $874.2 million.",Altcoin News|Shiba Inu|bitcoin|btc|Coinmarketcap|ETH|Ethereum|IntoTheBlock|meme coin|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shiba Inu whales|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-05 03:00:33

Back then, a flurry of tweets and memes turned casual holders into overnight millionaires. Today, a fresh contender, RCO Finance, is catching buzz, claiming it can top DOGE’s success with AI-driven innovation. If you missed out on Dogecoin’s explosive run or are simply tired of waiting for a second wave, you’re not alone. Many DOGE faithful are now exploring RCO Finance to invest in a project with more than just meme appeal. Keep reading to see why these two tokens are being compared—and why RCOF might reshape your crypto game. Dogecoin’s Legacy and the 2021 Rally Glow Dogecoin soared in 2021 thanks to viral social media hype and celebrity endorsements. Prices leaped faster than most experts ever imagined, going on a 21,000% rally and creating a new generation of crypto believers. Even after a cooldown, DOGE remains a household name, albeit one that rides market sentiment. Some holders are waiting for another big run, but things have quieted. Meme-driven mania can resurface, yet there’s no guarantee lightning will strike twice. That uncertainty has Dogecoin investors scanning for new opportunities, hoping to replicate the thrilling upswing that defined DOGE’s 2021 Rally. RCO Finance: A New Vision for DeFi While Dogecoin relies on community buzz, RCO Finance stands on real-world utility and AI-driven insights. Thanks to a non-KYC approach, this project lets you buy assets like shares and real estate straight with crypto. Audited by SolidProof , the platform has drawn over 10k users who are impressed by its transparency. The AI-powered Robo Advisor is at the core, which helps you make more intelligent trades by evaluating live market data. Suppose You spot a trending altcoin that seems ready to pop. You consult the Robo Advisor, which has been monitoring trading volumes and social media buzz. It reveals that network congestion is currently high, pushing up gas fees. Rather than diving in and wasting money on fees, the AI advises you to wait a few hours. Later, when traffic dips, you execute your trade at a lower cost and keep more profits. This hands-on approach shows why many believe RCO Finance could match or surpass the hype Dogecoin experienced during its 2021 Rally.

Solana & XRP Investors Are Betting Big on These 5 Cryptos After the Dip!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-to-500k-solana-xrp-investors-are-betting-big-on-these-5-cryptos-after-the-dip/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

The days of shrugging off these so-called “joke” tokens are long gone. Just ask those who got in early on Notcoin—life looks pretty different when your meme coin investment pays off. But here’s the real question: what if you missed those golden opportunities? What if you could go back in time and grab those early presale prices before they exploded? Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the meme coin that’s turning heads and sending shockwaves across the crypto space. With its viral presale gaining momentum and an eye-watering 90% APY on staking, BTFD is offering a second chance for those who feel like they missed out. The time to act is now because, as history shows, meme coins with strong hype and community backing tend to skyrocket once they hit the open market. . Notcoin: The One That Got Away Notcoin was one of those projects that flew under the radar at first but quickly became one of the most talked-about meme coins of its time. What started as a fun, gamified token quickly turned into a high-return investment for early adopters. Those who got in at the ground floor saw their holdings multiply, leaving latecomers regretting their hesitation. This is the classic story of crypto investing—blink, and you miss it. By the time the mainstream caught onto Notcoin’s potential, prices had already surged. The biggest winners? Those who had the guts to jump in early. The rest? Well, they’re the ones kicking themselves, wishing they had seized the opportunity when it was dirt cheap. But here’s the thing: history has a way of repeating itself, and if you felt the sting of missing out on Notcoin, there’s good news—BTFD Coin is here, and it’s looking even more promising. Unlike Notcoin, which relied primarily on hype, BTFD backs its momentum with tangible staking rewards and a presale that’s already raising eyebrows. The writing’s on the wall: early adopters of BTFD could be looking at the same kind of gains, if not bigger. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Notcoin’s success is a lesson—those who wait, miss out. And with BTFD following a similar trajectory, the question is: are you going to make the same mistake twice? 2. BTFD Coin: The New King of Meme Coin Gains If you missed out on Notcoin, consider this your redemption shot. BTFD Coin is doing what meme coins do best—going viral, building an unstoppable community, and setting the stage for massive post-launch gains. But BTFD isn’t just another meme token; it’s designed with long-term sustainability in mind, thanks to its 90% APY staking rewards. The presale numbers speak volumes—BTFD Coin is absolutely smashing it! Currently in its 14th stage, the price sits at just $0.00016, but it won’t stay that low for long. With over $5.93 million already raised, more than 10,200 bulls in the game, and a staggering 69 billion BTFD tokens sold, this presale is picking up serious momentum. Those who got in early have already seen their initial investment multiply, and with BTFD’s listing price set at $0.0006, the upside potential remains massive. Unlike Notcoin, where gains relied purely on market speculation, BTFD is rewarding its investors even before launch with lucrative staking returns. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s doing everything right. The hype, the staking rewards, the presale success—BTFD is shaping up to be the next meme coin phenomenon, and this is your golden opportunity to get in before it blows up. Don’t Repeat the Same Mistake—Get in Now Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is set to redefine what meme coins can do, combining viral appeal with real financial incentives. If you missed out on Notcoin, this is your second chance. The presale is gaining steam, and with prices set to climb post-launch, hesitation could mean another lost opportunity.

This restructuring is one of the first concrete moves by President Trump’s administration to diminish the regulation of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Early executive orders of Trump’s administration aimed to promote crypto growth and prevent over-regulation. Some of the changes include the fact that some members of the crypto enforcement team are being moved to different divisions within the SEC, one high-profile lawyer has been taken out of the enforcement division, and one could say a demotion. The regulatory firm did not comment on the restructuring when asked. Trump shifts to crypto support as SEC leadership overhaul signals new regulatory approach During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump, a previous cryptocurrency skeptic, changed his position to support digital assets and was endorsed by the crypto community, which had considered former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as an enemy. The current acting SEC chair, Mark T. Uyeda, has shown crypto-friendly tendencies and has made several notable alterations to the agency’s leadership, including forming a team to review the SEC’s tactics regarding digital assets. This team is headed by Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner and a known crypto advocate, who has recently expressed disappointment with the watchdog’s previous handling of crypto regulation. The team calls it legally ambiguous and unworkable. Peirce wants to develop a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and helps avoid fraud. Uncertainty looms over crypto enforcement as SEC reshuffles It is currently unknown how this downsizing will affect ongoing enforcement actions, including a high-profile case launched against Coinbase in 2023. The regulator accused Coinbase of providing exchange services without being registered with the SEC, which was in violation of federal securities laws. However, the company has argued that many digital assets are not securities — a position the crypto industry has rejected. The crypto enforcement unit at the SEC was created during Trump’s first term and was greatly enhanced during Gensler’s tenure. When Biden took over in May of this year, the agency had already essentially doubled the size of the team responsible for cracking down on fraudulent and unregistered crypto-asset offerings and had brought more than one hundred enforcement actions. During that time, Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a lawyer with strong crypto industry ties, to succeed Gensler as SEC chair. At the time of this writing, awaiting Senate Banking Committee confirmation is Atkins, an advocate of a less stringent regulatory regimen.

ETH is showing positive signs but faces many hurdles near the $2,880 level. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,550 zone. The price is trading below $2,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,880 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Faces Hurdles Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it dropped heavily below $2,500, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH tested the $2,120 zone and recently started a recovery wave. The price was able to surpass the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels. It even climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,402 swing high to the $2,127 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $2,900 zone. The price failed to clear the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,402 swing high to the $2,127 swing low. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,800 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,880 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,120 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,640 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term.

However, the US proceeded with its 10% tariffs on China, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The escalation has pushed BTC back below the critical $100,000 price level. Bitcoin Suffers Amid Trade Wars After a volatile 24 hours filled with uncertainty surrounding US trade tariffs on Mexico and Canada, BTC experienced a short-lived relief rally to $102,000. This came after US President Donald Trump announced a 30-day delay in imposing tariffs on the two North American nations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Shows Market Far From Overheating – Details However, today’s implementation of US tariffs on China triggered a sharp downturn, causing BTC to break below the $100,000 level. In response, China’s Ministry of Finance announced new countermeasures. Starting February 10, China will impose an additional 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on agricultural equipment, crude oil, and certain vehicles. Additionally, Beijing has accused the US of violating World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations with its one-sided tariff policies. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce also stated that it would tighten export controls on key raw materials, including molybdenum, indium, bismuth, tellurium, and tungsten, citing national security concerns. With trade tensions escalating between the US and China, analysts predict heightened volatility in the crypto market in the coming days. Well-known crypto strategist Michael van de Poppe shared his outlook: Bitcoin bounced back swiftly and is currently acting within the range. I assume we’ll see new ATHs in February and it’s quite normal to correct after such a strong bounce. Volatility through the roof, but, as long as Bitcoin remains above $93K, a new ATH is likely. Meanwhile, crypto trader and investor Phoenix suggested that BTC could establish a new trading range amid the ongoing trade war. However, history suggests that heightened tariffs could spell trouble for cryptocurrencies. Web3 enthusiast merts.eth pointed out in an X post that BTC plummeted 65% in 2018 when Trump first initiated a trade war with China. The effects were not limited to digital assets, as the S&P 500 also dropped 12% in the weeks following the implementation of tariffs. More Downside For BTC? As Bitcoin struggles to hold the $100,000 price level, concerns are mounting about another potential breakdown in price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out that if BTC fails to hold the $97,190 support level, there could be more pain for the top digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Must Hold Above $97K To Sustain Momentum – Metrics The analyst made another observation about how BTC is currently trading in a bearish flag pattern.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. Can WIF attain new heights in 2025? Will Dogwifhat reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs).

Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Will WIF reach $100?

TrumpCoin (DJT) is one such project that skyrocketed on the day of Trump’s inauguration, but quickly crashed soon after. Meanwhile, the more established Pepe (PEPE) has also seen losses, highlighting the inherent volatility within the meme coin space. Many investors are now seeking utility-focused projects and Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a top choice. This powerful PayFi solution takes a pragmatic approach to dealing with issues in the global payments space, offering a modern alternative to outdated systems. So why is Remittix seeing so much attention and how will TrumpCoin and Pepe perform in Q1 of 2025? TrumpCoin Continues To Decline TrumpCoin is trading at approximately $0.000277, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $43,210. The coin has seen a slight decline of about 2.57% in the past day. Since its launch in mid January, TrumpCoin experienced an initial surge, reaching a peak of $0.0024 on January 19. Early data indicates that some of the largest holders of TrumpCoin have realized substantial returns. Approximately 33% of the top 15 holders had fully exited their positions by late January, with one investor achieving a 91% return. Notably, some investors reported returns exceeding 10,000% with one reaching nearly 19,000%, while still retaining significant portions of their holdings. However, the launch of TrumpCoin has prompted mixed reactions. While some view it as an innovative venture into the crypto space, others express concerns over potential ethical and legal implications. Critics argue that such initiatives could undermine the credibility of both the cryptocurrency market and political institutions. Pepe Posts 15% Loss In 24 Hours Pepe (PEPE) has seen a steep 15% loss in the last 24 hours, plummeting down to $.00001041. Pepe is still up by 1,020% over the past year, though recent losses have brought the project’s future into question. Pepe continues to suffer from its large whale holding with roughly 47.82% of its holding base made up by whales and 52% by regular traders. This adds another layer to Pepe’s volatility with big-sell offs becoming commonplace in times of market uncertainty. Remittix (RTX): Making Crypto as Easy to Use as Cash Crypto was supposed to revolutionize finance, yet most people still cannot spend it in their day-to-day lives without great hassle. If you want to cash out, pay bills or send money abroad, you’re forced to deal with high fees, slow processing times and complicated workarounds. Ultimately, crypto isn’t as practical as it should be. Remittix (RTX) is changing that. It allows users to convert over 40 different cryptocurrencies into FIAT instantly and send the money directly to any bank account worldwide with no delays, no hidden fees, just simple, fast transactions. Whether you’re a freelancer needing to cash out your earnings, a trader looking to move profits into FIAT, or someone sending money to family across borders, Remittix makes the process effortless. The benefits go even further. 1.4 billion people worldwide don’t have access to a bank account, but many have crypto wallets through mobile apps. With Remittix, they can receive funds in digital assets and withdraw them in cash via remittance services like Western Union, breaking down financial barriers and increasing global accessibility. Remitttix Presale Booms, Surpassing $10.7 Million The Remittix (RTX) presale has taken the crypto space by storm, surpassing $10.7 million raised in record time. Tokens are currently up for grabs for just $0.0539, creating an ideal entry point for proactive investors. The project’s deep value proposition has prompted analysts to anticipate a steep 800% price rise during the presale phase alone with further growth after the launch. For those who want to push the boundaries of what is possible in PayFi, this market disruptor is not a project to sleep on in 2025.

Republican lawmakers are stepping up their efforts to bring clear rules to the crypto industry, forming a bicameral working group to push legislation on stablecoins and digital asset market structures. The move, announced on Feb. 4 at a Capitol Hill press conference, marks a coordinated effort between key House and Senate leaders to create a structured framework for crypto regulation, an issue that has remained in legal limbo for years. 🚨Chairman @RepFrenchHill : ""In the 119th Congress, we have a bicameral project for both a stablecoins bill and a regulatory framework that will bring clarity to digital assets in the United States."" Watch more📺 pic.twitter.com/HIxvssZTS5 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) February 4, 2025 The working group includes members from four major committees—the House Financial Services Committee, the House Agriculture Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, and the Senate Agriculture Committee—showing that lawmakers see crypto regulation as an issue that spans multiple sectors of financial oversight. Representative French Hill of Arkansas, along with Senators Tim Scott and John Boozman and Representative Glenn Thompson, will play leading roles in shaping these policies, drawing from existing legislative efforts while introducing new proposals. You might also like: Lawmakers plan to build on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which passed a House committee in 2024, while also using a new stablecoin bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4 as a starting point for further discussions. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott has made it clear that speed is a priority , saying he wants to push the crypto bills through the Senate within the first 100 days of the congressional session. Conversations with Democratic colleagues are already underway, raising the possibility that some elements of these bills could gain bipartisan support. At the press conference, David Sacks , Trump’s crypto and artificial intelligence czar, spoke about the broader vision for digital assets, calling this a key moment to create a “golden age” for crypto in the U.S. His role extends beyond Congress, as he is also overseeing a separate initiative within the White House to assess the possibility of a government-held Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. Trump’s executive order on Jan. 23 laid the foundation for that discussion, along with directives to prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency. For years, the lack of clear rules has driven many crypto firms to set up operations overseas, where regulations have been more clearly defined. If successful, this working group could finally give the crypto industry the clarity it has long been waiting for.
