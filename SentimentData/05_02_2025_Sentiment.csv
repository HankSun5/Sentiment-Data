This early recognition places Litecoin ahead of other pending altcoin ETFs for Solana and XRP, sparking optimism that LTC might become the next asset to grab mainstream attention. Meanwhile, analysts highlight two other standouts this February: Sui, a newly rebranded chain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin bridging daily financial needs. Below is a closer look at what’s fueling Litecoin’s renewed hype and why some believe Sui and Remittix(RTX) might also be top movers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Acknowledgment: A Big Win Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, originally forked from the Bitcoin blockchain, just saw a 17% price jump after the SEC recognized Canary Capital’s application to launch a Litecoin ETF. Observers say this puts it ahead of Solana and XRP, which also have filings in the works but haven’t received the same nod yet. If the ETF gets approval, it could usher in a wave of mainstream capital, potentially returning LTC to price levels unseen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunasremarked that this filing is already checking most boxes, feeding rumors of a relatively smooth path toward final approval. Critics note that parallels between Litecoin and Bitcoin might make regulators more comfortable green-lighting an LTC-focused product. Many also expect the current SEC administration to be friendlier to crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s stance on digital assets. Should the ETF pass, it may also further normalize crypto within traditional finance circles. That official confidence can ripple outward, boosting liquidity and consumer adoption across the sector. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders in their own right, the race for altcoin ETFs appears to favor LTC at the moment. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Two Other Altcoins Grabbing Headlines Amid the ETF talk, analysts are also singling out Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential top performers in February. Sui, fresh from a rebrand, wants to boost transaction speeds and scale for dApps, making it attractive to developers who are chasing fast networks. However, the more consumer-facing star might be Remittix (RTX), a PayFi solution bridging FIAT and crypto for cross-border payments. Imagine a traveling event organizer in Latin America, frequently wiring funds to overseas partners. Conventional methods hurt with hefty fees; Remittix (RTX), by contrast, provides quick wallet-to-cash methods without typical bank overhead. So far, Remittix (RTX) has raised over $10.5 million and sold roughly 430 million tokens. One token is now selling for $0.0512. The altcoin’s real-world benefits—lower wire costs, more straightforward cross-border flows—could help it stand out in a sector often dominated by purely tech-driven or comedic tokens. Observers see this PayFi approach as possibly mirroring the early success of major players like XRP but focusing more on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF ushers in a fresh wave of crypto positivity, watchers believe tokens addressing daily financial needs—like Remittix(RTX)—may ride the tide exceptionally well. Conclusion: What Sets February’s Winners Apart? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is an essential step toward mainstream crypto integration, overshadowing altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP that remain unacknowledged. Meanwhile, coins like Sui emphasize high-speed networks, and Remittix(RTX) focuses on bridging everyday finance for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. With LTC’s climb already impressing investors, the door is open for these lesser-known gems to capture attention in a bullish February. Whether you’re watching the ETF race or hunting for the next big PayFi breakout, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its mission to reduce cross-border friction could spark the same mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems flourish.

This early nod gives Litecoin an edge over other pending altcoin ETFs like those for Solana and XRP, raising hopes that LTC could be the next cryptocurrency to gain widespread popularity. Meanwhile, analysts are also spotlighting two other notable contenders this February: Sui, a newly rebranded blockchain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin addressing everyday financial needs. Below, we delve into what’s driving Litecoin’s renewed enthusiasm and why Sui and Remittix(RTX) are also seen as potential top performers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Nod: A Significant Lead Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, which originated as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, has recently experienced a 17% price increase after the SEC acknowledged Canary Capital’s proposal for a Litecoin ETF. Analysts point out that this development places it ahead of Solana and XRP, which have yet to receive similar recognition for their filings. Should the ETF receive approval, it could attract substantial mainstream capital, potentially elevating LTC to prices not seen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas noted that the current filing meets most requirements, fueling speculation that final approval might be relatively straightforward. Critics argue that the similarities between Litecoin and Bitcoin could make regulators more inclined to approve a product focused on LTC. There’s also an expectation that the current SEC leadership might be more favorable towards crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s positive stance on digital assets. If the ETF is approved, it could further legitimize crypto within traditional financial sectors, boosting liquidity and wider adoption. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders, the current race for altcoin ETFs seems to favor LTC for now. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Other Altcoins Making Waves As discussions around ETFs continue, analysts are also focusing on Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential stars in February. Sui, having undergone a rebrand, aims to enhance transaction speeds and scalability for dApps, making it appealing to developers seeking fast networks. On the other hand, the more consumer-oriented Remittix (RTX) emerges as a PayFi solution that connects FIAT and crypto for international payments. Consider a traveling event planner in Latin America who often sends money to international partners. Traditional methods can be costly with high fees, whereas Remittix (RTX) offers quick wallet-to-cash options without the usual bank fees. To date, Remittix (RTX) has amassed over $10.5 million and sold about 430 million tokens. Each token is currently priced at $0.0512. The practical advantages of this altcoin—such as reduced wire transfer costs and easier cross-border transactions—could help it stand out in a market often dominated by tech-centric or meme-based tokens. Analysts see this PayFi model as potentially echoing the initial success of major players like XRP but with a stronger focus on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF brings a new wave of positivity to the crypto world, those focusing on everyday financial solutions—like Remittix(RTX)—could benefit significantly. Conclusion: What Distinguishes February’s Top Picks? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is a crucial step towards mainstream crypto adoption, overshadowing unacknowledged altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP. Meanwhile, altcoins like Sui focus on high-speed networks, while Remittix(RTX) aims to bridge daily financial needs for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. As LTC’s ascent already impresses investors, there’s potential for these under-the-radar coins to gain attention in a promising February. Whether you’re observing the ETF contest or searching for the next significant PayFi breakthrough, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its goal to ease cross-border transactions could ignite the same kind of mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems thrive.

The cryptocurrency has recently seen increased buying interest, with firms adding DOGE to their holdings. At press time, Dogecoin price was down 10% trading at $0.2637, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.36 billion. Despite recent volatility, market watchers anticipate an upward trend based on historical price patterns and renewed institutional interest. Will Dogecoin’s Price Rally 300%? Dogecoin has experienced notable price fluctuations, with a recent 10.94% decline in the last 24 hours. However, analysts remain optimistic, pointing to a potential breakout. In the last week, DOGE price has plummeted by 17% in the last week and 31% in the long term startetgy. Traders have observed similarities between the current market cycle and the 2020-2021 bull run, where Dogecoin underwent two major corrections before a strong price surge. Crypto analyst Javon Marks has projected a rise to $0.6533, an increase of over 80% from current levels. He further suggests that a move beyond this threshold could push Dogecoin above $1.25, representing a 333% gain. Another analyst, Kevin, has also identified patterns aligning with the previous bull cycle, reinforcing the outlook for a strong recovery. Institutional Investors Show Renewed Interest in Dogecoin Companies are beginning to accumulate Dogecoin, signaling growing confidence in its long-term potential. Neptune Digital Assets, a blockchain company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, has recently acquired 1,000,000 Dogecoin tokens through a strategic derivative purchase. The firm acquired DOGE at an average price of $0.37 per token on December 27, 2024. Neptune has also expanded its crypto portfolio with a recent purchase of 20 Bitcoin at an average price of $99,833 per BTC. This move aligns with the company’s strategy of strengthening its digital asset holdings. Neptune’s CEO, Cale Moodie, stated that the firm remains committed to acquiring more assets while managing leverage risk. This move follows Grayscale’s launch of a Dogecoin Trust early Friday morning, providing institutional and accredited investors with a regulated way to invest in the cryptocurrency. DOGE Price Historical Patterns Hint at Breakout Market analysts have compared Dogecoin’s current cycle to previous trends, noting similarities in price corrections and rebounds. The previous bull run saw two major corrections before Dogecoin surged to new highs. In the ongoing cycle, the cryptocurrency has followed a similar pattern, with the first correction leading to a 65% decline and the second dropping 58.18%. If Dogecoin follows past trends, analysts believe it could experience a strong recovery, potentially reaching $1.25. Some market watchers have set even higher price targets, suggesting that DOGE could rally towards $4 if conditions align with previous growth patterns.

Table of Contents Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum ecosystem updates Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price has had a rough few days, with a sharp drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3, the lowest it has been since September 2024. The decline came as financial markets reacted to new U.S. tariffs, which took effect on Feb. 1. The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods, leading to uncertainty across global markets, including crypto. Within hours, diplomatic efforts were underway. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on X that he had spoken with Donald Trump and secured a temporary 30-day pause on the tariffs while both countries worked on a broader border security agreement.

Following these developments, market sentiment improved , and Ethereum’s price has rebounded to $2,700 as of this writing on Feb. 4. At one point, ETH briefly touched $2,900 after Trump halted tariffs on Canada and Mexico.

So, what’s really happening in Ethereum’s ecosystem, and how could it impact Ethereum’s price prediction in the days ahead? Let’s dive deeper. Ethereum ecosystem updates Ethereum has been making critical changes to improve scalability and transaction efficiency. Gas limit increase and scalability improvements On Feb. 3, validators approved an increase in Ethereum’s gas limit for the first time since 2021, marking the first adjustment in the post-Merge era. The increase raised the gas limit from 30 million to over 31 million units, with a maximum capacity of 36 million expected soon. Unlike previous changes that required a hard fork, the adjustment took effect automatically after more than half of the validators signaled their support. Gas represents the computational power needed to execute transactions and smart contracts on Ethereum. Every action on the network incurs a gas cost, and the gas limit determines the total computational work that can be processed in a single block. When transaction volume exceeds this limit, users either wait for inclusion in a later block or pay higher fees to have their transactions prioritized. Raising the gas limit increases the number of transactions and operations that can fit within a block, improving overall throughput and easing congestion. The change also allows more complex decentralized applications to function smoothly, benefiting the growing ecosystem of financial applications, NFT platforms, and on-chain services. However, while raising the gas limit helps improve transaction capacity, it does not address Ethereum’s core limitations in cost and speed. For instance, Ethereum handles 1 to 1.5 million daily transactions, while Solana processes between 60 and 65 million. The difference is substantial, with Solana not only processing exponentially more transactions but also doing so at a fraction of the cost, making long-term scalability a persistent challenge. Ethereum’s market position and competitive challenges To address these concerns, Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade, set to go live in early 2025, is expected to enhance network scalability further, particularly for layer-2 solutions. A key part of this upgrade involves increasing the blob target from three to six. Blobs are large data packets used in layer-2 scaling solutions, allowing them to store transaction data temporarily rather than writing it directly onto Ethereum’s main chain. Expanding blob capacity effectively increases the throughput of layer-2 networks, making them faster and cheaper. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and zkSync ( ZK ) already play a crucial role in reducing congestion and gas fees for Ethereum users. Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network in terms of total value locked, has seen consistent growth due to its ability to batch multiple Ethereum transactions into a single compressed proof, significantly cutting costs. Optimism follows a similar approach but integrates an incentive model that distributes OP tokens to projects building on its network. zkSync, which leverages zero-knowledge rollups, provides an even more advanced scaling solution, offering near-instant transactions with lower fees. While these layer-2 solutions help alleviate Ethereum’s congestion issues, they highlight a fundamental contrast between Ethereum and its competition. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on additional layers to scale, other blockchain ecosystems have built-in scalability. Solana, Avalanche ( AVAX ), and even emerging players like Sei ( SEI ) are capable of handling large transaction volumes without requiring external scaling solutions. Beyond technical upgrades, Ethereum’s market position has also been facing pressure. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped to 0.027 as of Feb. 4, its lowest level since March 2021 and nearly 50% lower than a year ago. ETH/BTC price chart | Source: TradingView As Bitcoin continues to gain dominance in both liquidity and investor interest, Ethereum’s relative valuation remains under scrutiny. Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum’s recent price drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3 was not just a reaction to broader economic uncertainty but also served as a market reset, clearing out excessive leverage that had built up in Ethereum’s open interest. “There was a lot of garbage low-quality leverage long open on Ethereum which got closed when price touched the 2100 area,” noted one analyst, highlighting a $4 billion reduction in open interest that ultimately helped stabilize the market. This dump was probably the best thing that happened to Ethereum.

This was a healthy Dump for ETH. pic.twitter.com/bfbdM3SMbM — Emperor👑 (@EmperorBTC) February 3, 2025 With those positions flushed out, Ethereum’s price recovery to $2,700 was driven by spot demand rather than excessive leverage, signaling a healthier foundation for future price movement, he added. From a technical perspective, Ethereum briefly dipped below its 200-week moving average, a significant level that has often acted as a major support zone. “ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025, dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib,” another trader pointed out, referring to key retracement levels that have marked past cycle bottoms. $ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025 dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib, as it did in August and Sept. Price is already back above the 200 WMA now That being said, getting $ETH around the 200 WMA is the same as buying a Mega Cap… pic.twitter.com/g5xtEAz5Jf — The Long Investor (@TheLongInvest) February 3, 2025 While price has already reclaimed the 200 WMA, previous instances where Ethereum tested this level in August and September 2024 led to strong recoveries. However, the broader macro landscape still presents risks. The recent market dip was triggered by escalating U.S. tariffs, a policy shift that briefly shook global financial markets. While diplomatic resolutions have provided temporary relief, uncertainties remain, particularly around potential retaliatory measures or further economic restrictions. If global liquidity tightens or risk sentiment weakens, Ethereum’s ability to sustain a recovery could face challenges. Another factor to watch is Ethereum’s ability to maintain market dominance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ). The ETH/BTC ratio has been on a downtrend, reflecting a shift in investor preference toward Bitcoin, which has seen stronger institutional flows. Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and the recent gas limit increase could support its ecosystem growth, but these improvements need to translate into tangible benefits for users and developers to sustain long-term demand. Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? The latest market reset, which cleared out billions in leveraged positions, has left Ethereum in a healthier position, but what happens next depends on a mix of factors—scalability upgrades, adoption, competition, and economic conditions. Ethereum price prediction 2025 Ethereum’s price action in 2025 is expected to be shaped by its ability to scale efficiently while maintaining strong demand within its ecosystem. DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average of $5,510, with a potential peak of $6,037, while Changelly takes a more bullish stance, predicting an average of $6,124 and a maximum of $7,194. Joe, co-founder of DeAgentAI, told crypto.news that the recent price action fits a broader historical pattern. “Short-term bearish signals—like the one flagged on Feb. 3—often require nuanced interpretation.” He pointed to historical setups from 2023 and 2024 that triggered sharp reversals, suggesting traders should watch for Ethereum’s reaction to key support levels. Ethereum price prediction 2027 If Ethereum continues leading the smart contract space and scaling solutions mature, ETH could see a rise in 2027. DigitalCoinPrice projects an average of $9,580 with a peak at $10,098, while Changelly paints an even stronger outlook, predicting an average of $12,316 and a maximum of $14,527. At the same time, DeFi growth, NFT innovation, and Ethereum’s role in real-world asset tokenization could provide fresh demand for ETH. However, if risk assets face tightening conditions, ETH’s price could face headwinds despite fundamental improvements. Ethereum price prediction 2030 Meanwhile, long-term forecasts see Ethereum reaching levels that once seemed distant. DigitalCoinPrice estimates an average price of $14,829 in 2030, with a high of $15,108, while Changelly provides a much more aggressive projection, predicting an average of $40,055 and a potential peak of $47,066. That being said, long-term predictions always come with risks. Ethereum faces competition from Solana, Avalanche, and emerging blockchain networks, all aiming to offer lower fees and higher speeds. While ETH prediction models remain optimistic, it’s essential to combine technical forecasts with real-world adoption trends before making any long-term commitments.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC and a post on the ministry’s official Telegram channel , the government wants to create a “unified registry” as part of its ongoing efforts to regulate the mining sector. Russia’s Deputy Minister of Energy Yevgeny Grabchak unveiled the proposal at a “working meeting” on mining this week. Why Does Russia’s Energy Ministry Want Crypto Mining Hardware Register? The ministry thinks this measure will help it keep tabs on crypto miners as it looks to “increase the effectiveness of regional bans.” Russian Ministry of Energy officials speak about crypto mining at a meeting on February 3. (Source: Minergo Rossii/Telegram) Moscow is extremely keen to develop its crypto mining sector. Recently, some state-run organs have been given the green light to develop their crypto mining-related projects . These could see crypto mining projects launched in the Russian Far East and in other parts of the country with surplus power. However, Russian decision-makers are worried that a surge in mining could cause power shortages in energy-deficient areas. While US-led export controls on Russia have primarily targeted weapons components and high-end chips, a less threatening product shows just how hard it will be for Donald Trump to squeeze Vladimir Putin’s economy: Japanese grand pianos. https://t.co/P68AgUBjac — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 4, 2025 Power Problems? Some parts of the nation are already experiencing crypto mining-related power shortages. Moscow has responded with regional wintertime bans on mining in several parts of the country. But these bans do not appear to have made much of a dent on the nation’s wide network of “grey” and illegal miners. May operators appear to be flaunting the bans. Thus, the ministry appears to think it will be able to keep tabs on miners by forcing them to report on their mining rig purchases. The TEC-27 power plant near Moscow, Russia. (Source: PJSC Mosenergo/Anna Samarino [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Growth Potential Grabchak’s proposal would see Moscow create a single register of “equipment without which cryptocurrency mining is impossible.” “The fundamental task of the registry will be optimizing the mechanisms for identifying mining activities. This will help us effectively enforce bans on mining in regions where it is prohibited.” Russian Energy Ministry Additionally, the ministry said, the registry could help boost crypto mining in other regions. The registry will help economic growth, including through the introduction of new IT solutions, the ministry added. Russia’s Energy Ministry has spearheaded work on the bans, which some provinces already want to see extended . Furthermore, Grabchak claimed that Russian crypto miners “have increased their electricity consumption by 14% in the past two years.” He added that crypto miners “have used up all available capacity in some areas.” And this means “new consumers (miners)” “cannot connect to these networks,” Grabchak said.

Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced a stablecoin bill today. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said he plans to try to move that bill through Congress before a larger crypto market structure bill. But he added that he hopes to have both on the President’s desk within the administration’s first 100 days. In part, he said, that could be possible because both pieces of legislation have had bipartisan support in the past session of Congress. Sen. Scott pointed out that the market structure bill being worked on in the Senate will be a bipartisan one continuing the work that Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) did in the Senate and the FIT 21 legislation that passed in a bipartisan vote in the House last year.

In his opening remarks, Sacks shared that “the President said in his executive order in the first week that it’s the policy of his administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology and related technologies across all sectors of the economy.” He also reminded the audience that in that executive order, the President established both a working group for digital assets as well as a mandate for the group. “Our objective is to accomplish the task the President assigned for us in his EO, which is to propose a Federal regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States,” said Sacks. The ""Golden Age"" For The Bitcoin And Crypto Industry Begins Sacks also contextualized the significance of this new administration’s not being antagonistic to the Bitcoin and crypto industry, especially in light of what transpired under the Biden administration. “I’ve talked to many founders over the last few years and they’ve told me repeatedly that the number one thing they need from Washington is regulatory clarity,” he said. “They just want to know what the rules of the road are so they can abide by them. We’re coming off frankly four years of arbitrary prosecution and persecution of crypto companies where the SEC wouldn’t tell founders what the rules were and then they would prosecute them. Many founders even told me stories of being debanked personally just because they had founded a crypto company,” he added. Before concluding his opening remarks, Sacks noted that he looks forward to working with the politicians hosting the conference alongside him — Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman French Hill (R-AR), Senator John Boozman (R-AR) and Congressman (R-PA) — in “creating a golden age for digital assets.” Senator Scott began by stating that this “golden age has begun” and that “the good news is that it’s going to get better.” He also noted that he plans to “work synergistically with the House and the Senate, with the White House leading the way” when it comes to passing bills on digital assets. The U.S. At The Forefront Of Bitcoin And Crypto Innovation Rep. Hill stressed that the United States should be leading the way, not falling behind when it comes to the digital asset industry. “We don’t want to be behind in financial technology and digital assets in the United States, [and] our innovators need clarity,” said Rep. Hill. “They need to know what the rules of the road are.” He also stated that he’s forming a working group between the House Financial Services Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee to craft a clear regulatory framework. Senator Boozman highlighted the fact that not all crypto assets are the same (without necessarily singling bitcoin out). “Some assets are commodities, some are securities,” said Senator Boozman, who noted that different regulatory agencies should oversee different crypto assets accordingly. Rep. Thompson walked the audience through the stages of the Internet, pointing out the fact that the internet today has become the “Internet of value.” “America really was the leader when it came to Internet 1.0, and [with] Internet 2.0, again, it was America that led that for the world,” said Rep. Thompson. “Internet 3.0 is what we’re talking about today, and that’s the Internet of value — and we’re approaching it in a principled way.” This “principled way” includes protecting consumers while still offering innovators in the Bitcoin and crypto industry space to foster innovation, according to Rep. Thompson. “The opportunities [in crypto] are unimaginable,” said Rep. Thompson. “I know that [David Sacks] is laser focused on bringing certainty to digital asset markets.” During a question and answer session, Senator Scott noted that bipartisan efforts are being made around crypto in the Senate. “Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand are coming together for the market structure bill ,” he said. Comments On Anti-Money Laundering Regulation When asked about reconsidering Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws as they pertain to crypto, Senator Scott said he’s open to it. “I think that the broader conversation should not be about digital assets alone,” said Senator Scott. “It’s about bad actors doing bad things by any means necessary.” Rep. Hill chimed in regarding AML regulations, stating that they should exist, much like they do in the analog financial space. Educational Efforts Rep. Thompson brought up the importance of educating those in the House and Senate about crypto assets, given that it’s still a relatively new subject. “Member education is what our first goal is here,” he said. Rep. Hill echoed his sentiment. “A key element now is the education and technical assistance that can be provided to members both in the House and Senate,” he said. Sacks also offered his thoughts on this topic. “Part of what we’re here to do is provide resources on education,” he said, adding that some of the educators can be “luminaries in the industry.” As Sacks spoke on this topic, he also differentiated between Bitcoin and all other crypto assets and networks. “Crypto can be an esoteric subject, and it is good to explain it, to demystify it,” said Sacks. “You’ve got the cryptocurrency itself like bitcoin, [and then other assets that] run on blockchains, which are just distributed ledgers.” The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Before the conference concluded, Sacks also addressed the prospect of the U.S. creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . “One of the things that the President instructed us to do was to evaluate the idea for a Bitcoin reserve,” said Sacks. “So, that is one of the first things we’re going to look at as part of the internal working group in the administration.”",Trump|Politics|Politicians|President Trump|Politics|Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-02-04 23:39:46

KyberSwap, Indexed Finance Fraudster Charged According to the Monday press release , the 22-year-old man broke through KyberSwap’s coding to artificially alter the prices within the protocol’s liquidity pools. “Medjedovic then calculated precise combinations of trades that would cause the KyberSwap AMM to “glitch,” in his words, allowing him to steal tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from the liquidity pools,’ the United States Attorney’s Office states. Shortly after the hack, Medjedovic attempted to extort KyberSwap’s developers for control of the platform and its DAO, ultimately stealing $48.8 million worth of coins from the crypto collective.

In an October 2021 incident, Medjedovic manipulated prices on Indexed Finance’s index pools using borrowed cryptocurrencies, resulting in over $16.5 million being drained from investors. The following year, the now-indicted Medjedovic conspired with an unnamed accomplice to launder the pocketed funds through fraudulent crypto exchange accounts while further hiding their origins through the use of a crypto mixer. “Hackers can at times be painted in a flattering light by pop culture, some admiring their skills and acumen,” stated FBI Assistant Director in Charge Dennehy. “They’re stealing money that isn’t theirs, and they’re breaking the laws of this country.” “We allege Andean Medjedovic violated several of those laws, and he, along with all the other cyber criminals who believe they’re untouchable will face justice,” he added.

According to reports, the U.S. Attorney’s Office allegedly believes that the one-time University of Waterloo student is currently on the lam from the charges somewhere outside of the United States. Medjedovic has been charged with one count of money laundering, one count of money laundering conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, and one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer.

The vote will determine whether the exchange resumes trading or undergoes liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. If approved, the restructuring plan could see trading recommence by April 2025, with initial payouts starting within 10 business days. WazirX Creditors To Vote On Restructuring Plan According to a recent statement from the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, creditors will vote on a restructuring plan to recover losses from the WazirX hack. The proposed plan outlines a 52% immediate debt settlement, with the remaining 48% to be paid from future profits and asset recoveries. The vote follows approval from the Singapore High Court, allowing WazirX creditors to decide the exchange’s future. If the plan is accepted by at least 75% of creditors, trading may resume by April 2025, and payouts will begin within 10 business days. In addition, the development comes days after the Singapore High Court granted WazirX approval in late January to convene a Scheme meeting. This meeting will allow creditors to vote on the proposed recovery plan, facilitating a structured repayment of unstolen funds. What Happens If Plan Fails? If WazirX creditors reject the restructuring plan, the exchange will undergo liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. This could postpone repayments until 2030, significantly reducing the chances of full recovery for affected users. Industry experts have warned that liquidation could lead to unpredictable asset distribution. The timeline for payouts would be extended, and the value of recoverable assets could decrease due to market volatility and operational challenges. Source: X Planned Recovery Measures And Future Operations To facilitate debt repayments and restore operations, WazirX plans to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) and introduce recovery tokens. The proposal also includes periodic buybacks to stabilize the platform and improve financial sustainability. Moreover, the restructuring plan will allocate Net Liquid Platform Assets to creditors as part of the recovery process. The company has been working closely with the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to ensure faster distribution and prevent prolonged delays in fund recovery. The vote will determine whether the Indian exchange can resume trading or enter a liquidation process. The restructuring plan is an alternative to liquidation. It offers creditors a more immediate path to fund recovery. With over 4.4 million creditors involved, the voting process is a crucial moment for the Indian exchange Meanwhile, WazirX continues its efforts to recover stolen funds, freezing $3 million in assets as part of its recovery plan. Founder Nischal Shetty emphasized that this is just the beginning, reaffirming the platform’s commitment to retrieving lost crypto.

According to the team, the upgrade “turns the Uniswap protocol into a platform for developers”. At the heart of the new version are special hooks contracts with detailed parameter customization for pools, swaps, fees and order interactions. The creators noted that v4 is the cheapest version of the protocol to date. Organizing pools will be 99.9% cheaper than the previous iteration, Uniswap v3. Swap users have been promised savings on multicast exchanges. According to a statement from the team, the development utilized suggestions from “hundreds of community members.” The update code went through nine security audits, and as part of the bounty program, the company paid out $15.5 million. No critical vulnerabilities were found. In July 2023, the Uniswap team announced that it would launch the fourth version of the protocol within four months of the Dencun hardfork on the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly before that, the creators published a “draft” of the v4 code, which had not yet undergone a number of audits and refinements.

Key support levels are $4.55, $4.28, and $3.60, crucial for stability. Experts believe Polkadot may surge past $50, possibly revisiting its $55 high. Polkadot (DOT) has taken a hit, with its price dropping sharply and leaving many to wonder what’s next. This isn’t just a small dip—it’s a major setback for the cryptocurrency, causing some concern about its short-term future. Before this drop, Polkadot had been trading above $6, riding a wave of optimism, with its price rising over 12% amid hopes that a Polkadot exchange-traded fund (ETF) could soon launch in the United States. The excitement kicked off last week when digital asset manager 21Shares filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission to launch a Spot Polkadot ETF. Polkadot Price: Key Levels to Watch Polkadot is currently in a correction phase after reaching a high. The price is currently trading near the $4.80 level and is trying to break above the $5 target. DOT closed the previous session at $5.14 and key resistance levels are at $6.10 and $5.94.

It’s about building trust, establishing value, and setting the stage for long-term success. Web3Bay is taking a methodical, transparent approach with its 28-stage token presale, aiming to balance supply and demand while solidifying its position as the highest potential crypto. This strategic roadmap is not just about raising capital; it’s about fostering sustainable growth and investor confidence. The current stage, Stage 4, illustrates this carefully planned progression. Web3Bay has already garnered significant interest, raising $1.07 and distributing 270 million tokens. At the current price of $0.004562625 per token, early adopters have the opportunity to participate at a favorable entry point. The projected ROI at launch is over 6,400%, a compelling figure that underscores the potential of this structured model. Strategic Token Allocation: Fueling Long-Term Value What distinguishes Web3Bay’s presale is its emphasis on controlled token availability. Each stage brings a reduction in the number of tokens offered, creating a sense of scarcity that can contribute to price stability at launch. Early stages might release a greater volume of tokens, but subsequent stages gradually tighten the supply. This approach not only rewards early believers in the project’s vision but also helps prevent market saturation. By the final stages, the limited availability is designed to maintain demand and support price integrity – qualities often associated with the highest potential crypto. This systematic approach stands in contrast to many “all-at-once” token sales that can flood the market, often leading to volatile price swings. Web3Bay’s stage-based strategy offers a clear, predictable structure. It ensures that the project enters the market with a balanced, sustainable ecosystem, avoiding a sudden influx of tokens that could create instability. This controlled release schedule positions Web3Bay as the highest potential crypto. A Foundation for Future Growth: More Than Just Fundraising Fundraising and token distribution are just the initial steps. Web3Bay’s structured presale is part of a broader roadmap designed to achieve the project’s long-term objectives. By carefully scaling funding through incremental price increases, Web3Bay can concentrate on sustainable development rather than relying solely on initial hype. This strategy provides the team with the resources needed to fulfill its promises while building confidence among investors and future users. Each stage builds upon the previous one, generating natural momentum. As the price gradually increases, it reflects the growing interest and trust in the project. The staged structure also provides opportunities for Web3Bay to regularly update its community, keeping them informed and engaged. By the time the project launches, it will have a solid foundation, a strong community base, and a price that more accurately reflects its market potential. This measured approach is a key factor in Web3Bay’s potential as a highest potential crypto. Open Communication: Building Confidence and Trust Transparency is central to Web3Bay’s presale strategy. By clearly outlining each stage and openly communicating pricing, token availability, and overall progress, Web3Bay is building a relationship of trust with its supporters. Potential investors can easily see where the project stands, what’s coming next, and how their participation fits into the overall vision. The gradual token release and ongoing updates help prevent misinformation or confusion that can sometimes occur during rapid token sales. Instead of rushing the process, Web3Bay ensures its backers are well-informed, increasing confidence and reducing uncertainty. This commitment to transparency, combined with a well-structured presale, strengthens Web3Bay’s standing as the highest potential crypto. A Path to Stability: Beyond the Initial Launch Web3Bay’s 28-stage presale is more than just a fundraising mechanism; it’s a carefully designed roadmap aimed at fostering long-term growth and market stability. The gradual reduction in token availability supports price integrity, the measured price increases build momentum and trust, and the ongoing transparency reinforces community confidence. With $970,000 already raised, 250 million tokens sold, and the price per token steadily increasing, Web3Bay’s presale structure is demonstrating its effectiveness. Early participants are positioned for significant returns, and the project is on track to achieve a launch price that reflects genuine market interest rather than short-lived speculation. This structured, transparent approach to fundraising and token distribution not only supports a successful launch but also lays a strong foundation for continued success. With its clear vision and measured strategy, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the highest potential crypto , potentially benefiting both its early backers and the wider community.

33767162,[object Object],1738713640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Prediction: ‘Channel Down’ Formation Shows Why A Bounce Above $0.3 Is Expected,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bounce-above-0-3-ahead/,"Crypto analyst TradingShot has identified a pattern on DOGE’s chart that shows why a bounce above $0.3 is expected for the Dogecoin price . This provides some optimism regarding the foremost meme coin, which was one of the most affected by the recent downtrend in the crypto market. ‘Channel Down’ Formation Shows Why The Dogecoin Price Could Bounce Above $0.3 In a TradingView post , TradingShot highlighted a ‘channel down’ formation, which showed that the Dogecoin price could bounce above $0.3. The analyst explained that DOGE is trading within a 2-month Channel Down, which on the wider scale may be a Bull Flag for this Bull Cycle. He added that regardless of the timeframe, DOGE’s price was sold aggressively and hit its 200-day Moving Average (MA) for the first time since October 25, 2024. On the other hand, TradingShot remarked that if this pattern is just a 1-day Channel down, then the low that the Dogecoin price recorded on Monday is technically a bottom on the pattern’s lower lows trend-line. He noted that the previous one, recorded on December 20, 2024, rebounded towards almost the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level . In line with this, with DOGE in oversold territory, the crypto analyst asserted that he expects the new bullish leg for the Dogecoin price to target $0.3800, just below the 0.786 Fib level. This provides some optimism regarding the foremost meme coin, which recorded a 40% decline and dropped to as low as $0.20 following the wave of sell-offs in the crypto market over the weekend. The Dogecoin price has since recovered following the pause on tariffs by the US, Mexico, and Canada. However, the foremost meme coin remains below the psychological $0.30 price level. A bounce above this price level could again put DOGE in bullish territory and lead to a continuation of its bull run. DOGE Should Begin Its Next Leg Soon In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the Dogecoin price should begin the next leg of its bull run soon enough. This came as he opined that DOGE had just completed the second major correction of its bull cycle. The analyst noted that this price action is very similar to the last cycle, even with the decline in terms of percentage. Kevin Capital asserted that if all goes well with the Bitcoin price , the Dogecoin price should begin its next leg soon. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that Dogecoin’s MACD signals a bullish crossover on the 4-hour chart. He added that DOGE is gaining upward momentum and could reverse into a bull run again. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.26, up over 13% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|2-Month Channel Down|Bull Flag Formation|Bullish Crossover|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Fibonacci Retracement|Kevin Capital|MA|MACD|meme coin|moving average|Trader Tardigrade|TradingShot,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-05 00:00:40

Could 2025 bring another golden opportunity? Top analysts say RCO Finance (RCOF), Sui (SUI), and (XRP) might be the next big winners. They believe these must buy altcoins can turn a small $1,000 investment into $1 million. Let’s look at why experts are so confident. 1. RCO Finance Some say RCO Finance could be the next big name in crypto. It’s a DeFi trading platform that stands out because it brings AI into finance. This makes trading easier for everyone and removes some of the usual barriers that stop people from getting involved. A key feature of RCO Finance’s offering to traders is its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This is a tool that helps you make better decisions by trading how you like, based on your risk tolerance and goals. Think of it as a portfolio manager, but one that is automated such that you are profitable without the heavy lifting that comes with personal trading or the fees that come with portfolio managers. In early 2024, many traders lost money when Telegram-based coins crashed after Notcoin launched. With the robo advisor, they could have avoided big losses. What’s more, the platform prioritizes security by conducting regular audits of its smart contracts. SolidProof , a trusted Web3 auditor, conducts these audits to guarantee the safety of investors’ funds. Another thing that makes RCO Finance different is that it doesn’t require KYC, which protects user privacy. It also lets users stake their assets and earn rewards. This can help investors grow their money over time without needing to do much. The platform recently launched its beta version and is letting users test its AI-driven tools. More updates are expected, which could increase interest even further. With strong security measures in place, traders have another reason to consider RCOF as a key pick for Q1 2025. 2. Sui In the world of blockchain, speed is more than just a bonus. It’s something platforms need to compete. That’s where SUI comes in. It can handle huge amounts of transactions without slowing down. Many developers and companies see it as one of the best crypto to buy because it works faster than others still using old methods. But speed isn’t the only thing SUI brings to the table. It also makes life easier for developers. Imagine a small team in Latin America trying to build an app for gig workers. With SUI, they can do it without struggling with slow networks or system crashes. This is a big deal for anyone working on new projects in the crypto world. Meanwhile, SUI’s price movement has been slow recently. SUI is valued at $3.74, a 3.36% decrease in its value from last week. Sui’s recent integration into Phantom Wallet will increase its availability and usage, making SUI one of the must buy altcoins. This could push its price to $5 soon. 3. XRP One of XRP’s biggest strengths is speed. The network can handle over 1,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the crypto world. It also keeps costs low, which is why many see it as one of the must buy altcoins for quick payments. Businesses and individuals looking for a reliable way to send money worldwide find it useful. XRP continues to be a popular choice. Its speed, low fees, and ability to handle many transactions make it stand out. Ripple’s latest XRP Markets Report showed that the company held 4,485,366,320 XRP at the end of 2024, giving investors insight into the current coin’s price and market trends. XRP’s performance has been dropping recently. XRP is trading at $2.88, which indicates a 4.95% fall from last week. Moving forward, some experts predict an uptrend for XRP due to the possibility of an XRP ETF soon. This could push the value of XRP to $4, making it one of the must buy altcoins. RCOF Becomes One of the Must Buy Altcoins: Join Now and See Your $1k Rise to $1 Million The RCOF presale is catching the interest of many crypto traders. Some believe it could become a major name in the market. So far, RCO Finance has raised more than $12 million, moving into the fifth stage of its presale. Right now, the RCOF token costs $0.10. Experts think that when it officially launches, the price could jump to somewhere between $0.40 and $0.60. If that happens, early investors might see a return of over 670%, making it one of the must buy altcoins. Some analysts are even more confident. They believe they could easily turn an investment of $1,000 into $1 million quickly. With so much talk around the RCOF token, many traders are keeping a close eye on it.

BlockDAG’s Biggest Offer Turns Up the Heat! SOL Price Analysis Hints at Recovery & XRP Supply Debate Resurfaces,https://thecoinrise.com/350-more-bdag-blockdags-biggest-offer-turns-up-the-heat-sol-price-analysis-hints-at-recovery-xrp-supply-debate-resurfaces/,"Solana, XRP, and BlockDAG are shaping up as strong contenders for the best crypto to buy now, each making headlines with key developments. The latest Solana (SOL) price analysis highlights its potential for recovery after briefly dipping below $195, with investors watching resistance levels to determine its next move. Meanwhile, discussions around XRP supply continue, sparking fresh debates about its total token limit. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing all the attention with its biggest offer yet — the FINALCALL700 bonus. This offer is fueling its record-breaking presale, offering a massive 350% extra BDAG with every purchase. With $191.5 million already raised and demand surging, early buyers rush to lock in this limited-time opportunity before BDAG’s price climbs. Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Recover After Dropping Below $195? The recent Solana (SOL) price analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency recently dropped below $195 before making a swift recovery. This decline followed a rejection near $280, sparking concerns about short-term movement. Despite the pullback, analysts believe the asset still has room for upward momentum, provided key resistance levels are broken. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests an oversold market, which could support a potential rally. For Solana to reach $500, it must first surpass resistance at $280 and $400, while maintaining support above $180 and $200. The Solana price analysis also highlights Bitcoin’s influence, as broader market trends continue to impact its trajectory. XRP Supply Debate: Why 100 Billion Cap Is Permanent Discussions around the XRP supply have resurfaced, with some questioning whether Ripple holds the ability to create additional tokens beyond the 100 billion originally issued. However, XRPL validator Vet has clarified that the network’s design prevents any increase in supply. The XRP Ledger includes an “invariant checker,” a security feature that ensures no new tokens can be minted. Unlike Bitcoin, which once faced an accidental inflation bug, XRPL’s structure makes such an issue highly unlikely. Additionally, XRP’s supply is decreasing over time due to transaction fees that burn small amounts with each transaction, reinforcing the token’s scarcity. FINALCALL700: 350% Bonus Drives BlockDAG’s $191.5M Presale BlockDAG’s presale is reaching new heights, and its latest offer, FINALCALL700, is making it even more appealing. For a limited time, every BDAG purchase comes with a 350% extra coin bonus, making this the most rewarding offer in BlockDAG’s history. Traders looking to maximise their holdings before launch are moving quickly, as this bonus significantly increases their BDAG count. For example, a $1,000 BDAG purchase with FINALCALL700 results in $4,500 worth of BDAG, an opportunity rarely seen in early-stage crypto sales. The BDAG coin presale has already raised $191.5 million and sold over 18.3 billion coins, making it one of the largest in the market. BDAG’s price has surged 2380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, fueling strong demand. The combination of its rapid growth and FINALCALL700 has many traders calling it the best crypto to buy now, as presale participation continues accelerating. The bonus isn’t just an extra incentive—it’s actively driving momentum, pushing BlockDAG toward new milestones as interest skyrockets. But what does the future hold for BDAG holders once the presale ends? Analysts predict a $1 price right after launch, positioning BDAG as a strong long-term contender. The FINALCALL700 may be the best chance to stake up on BDAG coins before prices climb even higher, but it won’t last forever. With demand accelerating, those still on the sidelines risk watching this opportunity slip away as BDAG moves toward its next phase. Final Thoughts: Where SOL, XRP & BDAG Stand Now? As the market continues to shift, each of these contenders presents a unique opportunity. The Solana (SOL) price analysis suggests a potential rebound, but breaking resistance levels will be key to its next rally. The XRP supply remains fixed at 100 billion, confirming its scarcity as discussions around its tokenomics settle. However, BlockDAG’s momentum is on another level. With FINALCALL700 offering 350% extra BDAG, demand is high and the presale has skyrocketed past $191.5 million. Analysts predict BDAG will hit $1 post-launch, making this presale phase a rare entry point for those looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Once the FINALCALL700 bonus disappears, so does the chance to secure extra BDAG coins at this affordable price.

The company has reportedly enlisted Jefferies Financial Group Inc. to assist with the potential listing. If the IPO happens, Bullish will go public among several cryptocurrency companies as hope rises that President Donald Trump will be friendly to crypto. Led by Chief Executive Officer Tom Farley, the exchange is growing internationally, with offices in the U.S., Hong Kong, Singapore, Gibraltar, and the Cayman Islands. Bullish pursues IPO as market conditions improve An IPO would see Bullish joining a growing number of companies in the sector moving ahead with plans to go public amid expectations that President Donald Trump will pursue a pro-crypto agenda. The firm once revealed its plans to go public in 2021 via an SPAC, only to shelve those plans. The new IPO discussions reflect the company’s shift in approach as market conditions improve and the regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies becomes more defined. Bullish is a subsidiary of Block.one, a blockchain software company subsidiary whose backers include Thiel, Alan Howard, Louis Bacon, and Richard Li. Block.one, whose co-founder and CEO Brendan Blumer also serves as Bullish’s chairman, launched the company in 2021 and capitalized Bullish with about $10 billion in digital assets and cash. Crypto firms set to reenter IPO market as regulatory landscape shifts Going public via an IPO was challenging for crypto firms under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chair Gary Gensler, was slow to review filings from companies like Circle, which initially pursued a public listing through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. However, following the collapse of FTX and the resulting investor skepticism toward the crypto market, Circle abandoned its plans in December 2022. Over the past four years, big crypto firms haven’t had much hope of going public, but all that’s set to change in January. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to reverse course on President Joe Biden’s digital asset crackdown is spurring hope that the initial public offering market could soon open to stablecoin provider Circle Internet Financial, trading platform Kraken, and other firms that have said they’d like to go public. Recently, Circle refiled for a traditional IPO, and there’s ample reason to think the stars will align for the firm and others like it to be successful this time. A representative of the firm said: Due to the nature of the registration process, we cannot comment. I can say that becoming a public company has always been a part of Circle’s core strategy, underscoring our commitment to trust and transparency. Circle spokesman. The Bullish IPO discussions are ongoing, and details, including timing and valuation, remain subject to change. Additional banks may also be brought in to support the offering. The representatives of Bullish and Block.one have not yet responded to the requests for comment, and a spokesman for Jefferies has declined to comment. Bullish’s IPO plans align with those of other crypto companies returning to the public markets. With more definitions of regulations and the positive shift in the investor’s mindset, more companies are expected to go for the public market.

Though no official information has been released concerning the IPO, Bloomberg reported that the Peter Thiel-backed firm may advance this push this year. Bullish Global IPO Is Not a Surprise According to the Bloomberg report , citing people familiar with the IPO , Bullish Global allegedly works with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. on the potential listing. Before this time, Bullish Global has been considering going public. Almost four years ago, it announced its intention to go public through a Special-Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). Despite the lofty plans, the firm soon broke from this move. According to the same sources, which requested to be anonymous due to the confidentiality of information, there are ongoing deliberations on the matter. However, they also clarified that details of the offering could change, which may include adding more banks to the existing lineup. Bullish Global made the news last year when it acquired the crypto media site Coindesk. Despite the claims of editorial independence, the platform has had to deal with management and editorial conflicts of interest. Bullish IPO and Top Crypto Candidates Beyond the Bullish IPO plans, many organizations are gradually moving towards going public. Popular stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial is still mulling the possibility of going public in the United States. Meanwhile, another Peter Thiel-backed firm, Bitpanda, has its sights set on public listing. In the case of Bitpanda, it has collaborated with Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise it on its next step. The crypto industry is advancing, with companies recording impressive earnings amid the turn of the bull run. According to Galaxy Research, at least four companies are on track to go public this year. Besides Circle, it named Fireblocks, Chainalysis, and Kraken the likely candidates to go public. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings’ CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed, against broad industry clamor, that there are no IPO plans . Should the Galaxy IPO come true, these firms will join Coinbase, MARA Holdings, and other crypto-native firms in the stock market. Favorable Crypto Policies To Help Noteworthy, President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance may have revived the US companies’ faith toward going public. It is worth noting that Thiel was one of those who supported the Republican politician around the time of his campaign. With the spotlight on the industry, regulatory shifts may also favor the service providers to go public. Bullish Global and Circle, with failed SPAC moves, may finally gain the IPO pathway to going public.

His mission was to explain how President Trump’s administration plans to push the US into crypto dominance after years of chaos under Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto regime. Instead of providing the hard-hitting regulatory clearances everyone expected, Sacks played it safe with broad strokes, vague assurances, and a lot of talk about “the golden age of digital assets.” Sacks opened with gratitude, thanking leaders from both the House and Senate, including Chairmen Tim Scott, French Hill, John Boozman, and GT Thompson, who were all standing right beside him as you can see in the video below. “The president set this as a week-one priority,” Sacks said. “We’re committed to ensuring American dominance in digital assets.” Trump’s crypto vision triggers regulatory shake-up Trump’s executive order laid the groundwork for the Crypto Czar’s mission, which is to craft a federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, particularly stablecoins. Sacks pointed to the working group established under the executive order, which includes big names like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick, and incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by crypto-friendly commissioner Mark Uyeda until Paul Atkins gets Senate-confirmed, has also created a dedicated crypto task force, which is led by ‘Crypto Mom’ Hester Peirce, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. Sacks took a moment to vent about the damage done by the SEC’s previous approach. “I’ve talked to many founders who told me their biggest problem is regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “They were prosecuted without being told what they did wrong. Some were even debanked personally just for founding a crypto company.” Sacks blamed this hostility for pushing innovation offshore, something he and the administration are desperate to reverse. The Crypto Czar also made it clear that he wholeheartedly believes all financial assets are going digital, whether regulators are ready or not. “Just like every analog industry became digital, financial assets will follow,” he said. “We don’t want that innovation happening in other countries.” To drive the point home, Sacks referenced FTX’s collapse, which he said was proof of the dangers of offshore operations. “The biggest fraud in crypto history happened in the Bahamas,” he reminded the room. “Keeping innovation onshore means better consumer protection.” Stablecoins come first as Congress warms up to crypto Sacks repeatedly pointed out the importance of stablecoins in the administration’s strategy. He mentioned the bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, which plans to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins that would maintain the US dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency, as Cryptopolitan reported yesterday. “Stablecoins could create trillions in demand for US Treasuries and potentially lower long-term interest rates,” Sacks explained. French Hill, who is the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, confirmed that stablecoins would be prioritized over other crypto issues. “We’re moving fast on this,” Hill said. “Bipartisan support between the House and Senate is already in place, and we’ve learned from past efforts.” He referenced last year’s bipartisan success when 71 Democrats joined House Republicans to pass stablecoin legislation in the House, though it stalled in the Senate. Hill also praised Hester’s involvement. “Hester brings a clear-headed approach to crypto regulation,” he said. John Boozman, who is the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, explained why his committee, typically focused on farming, has a role in crypto regulation. “The CFTC oversees commodities, and some digital assets fall under that category,” he said. Boozman promised that collaboration between the SEC and CFTC would prevent jurisdictional battles from delaying progress. “We’ve worked separately before, but now we’re coming together with purpose.” AML laws under scrutiny; Bitcoin reserve under consideration Fred Peterson from Punchbowl News asked Sacks whether crypto-specific AML measures were on the table. Sacks responded cautiously. “We’re open to discussions,” he said, “but this isn’t just about digital assets. Bad actors exist in all financial systems.” One of the more intriguing moments came when Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schwanberger asked about Trump’s campaign trail promise to explore a Bitcoin reserve. Sacks confirmed that: “The president instructed us to look into it. We’re still waiting for some key officials to be confirmed, but this is one of the first things we’re reviewing.” He clarified that while a Bitcoin reserve is being explored, a crypto sovereign wealth fund would require separate discussions. GT Thompson, who is Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said Congress is in sync with the White House’s goals, so any and all expectations of pto-crypto legislations are allowed.

From Dogecoin’s explosive rise to Shiba Inu’s unforgettable bull run, meme coins have consistently turned small investments into life-changing gains. And most recently, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) proved once again that meme coin magic is very much alive, making early investors massive returns in record time. But here’s the thing—crypto never sleeps, and a new golden opportunity is already knocking. With its bulls-backed community, staking rewards, and Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already live, BTFD Coin (BTFD) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s shaping up to be a movement. If you missed CHILLGUY’s rocket ride, don’t let history repeat itself—BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to join in February 2025 , gearing up to be the next legendary meme coin to watch. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad and Staking—A Community-Backed Powerhouse BTFD Coin isn’t just about memes and hype—it’s about community-driven growth, smart tokenomics, and explosive earning potential. While CHILLGUY had its run, BTFD’s Bulls Squad is setting a new standard for meme coin engagement and rewards. The Bulls Squad is a referral program designed to bring early believers massive rewards. Think of it like this: you refer friends, they buy BTFD, and you earn free tokens. It’s simple, it’s lucrative, and it’s already making waves.

Listing price is $0.0006 and the projected price after launch is $0.006. If you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.00016, you’d get 62.5 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its predicted post-launch price of $0.006, that stash would be worth a massive $375,000! That’s enough to wipe out debt, put a down payment on a house, or even buy a Tesla. But to catch this wave, you’ve got to act fast. The price is set to increase with every stage, and with demand surging, the chance to grab BTFD at these low levels won’t last. How to Buy BTFD Coin?

While many altcoins struggle to recover, BTC has rebounded quickly from its lows, reinforcing its position as the leading asset. Yesterday’s price action further confirmed that Bitcoin is still in control, and the long-anticipated altseason may be delayed until altcoins can catch up with BTC’s momentum. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s resilience. He noted that BTC is much stronger than anything else in the market and still looks perfectly fine when zooming out. According to Daan, Bitcoin’s demand remains significantly higher than other assets, especially during times of uncertainty. This is evident in the recent market movement, where BTC recovered swiftly while most altcoins remained stagnant or continued to drop. Daan’s analysis reveals that Bitcoin is currently trading within a defined range, with an all-time high (ATH) of $109K at the upper boundary and strong support at the $90K level. As long as BTC holds within this range, the potential for another breakout remains high. If bulls manage to push BTC above the ATH, a new bullish phase will begin, potentially leaving altcoins further behind.

The recent data from major on-chain analytics platforms reveals that Bitcoin accumulation remains strong among whales, with large holders continuing to add BTC despite market uncertainty. Unlike previous market cycles, where retail investors drove price surges, this rally appears to be fueled by institutions and long-term holders, making it more sustainable. Testing Key Demand Levels Bitcoin is testing crucial liquidity below the $100K mark, currently trading at $99,400 and attempting to find a strong footing before its next move. Price action remains highly unpredictable and volatile, with investors closely watching key levels for signs of a potential breakout or further downside. For BTC to confirm short-term strength, it must reclaim the $100K mark and hold it as support. This level is a psychological and technical barrier that, once secured, could trigger renewed bullish momentum. If Bitcoin struggles to maintain this level, further consolidation below $100K could follow, delaying any breakout attempts. The $98K level is another crucial support zone. As long as BTC stays above this mark, a push back above $100K remains highly likely. Losing this level could lead to a deeper retracement, testing lower demand zones before another attempt to reclaim higher levels.

A successful breakout above this level would set the stage for a massive rally toward all-time highs, opening the door for BTC to enter price discovery once again.

HTX was formerly known as Huobi. The disclosure came in the middle of a string of posts on X touting the Decentralized USD (USDD), a stablecoin backed by subsidies of Sun’s Tron platform. In one of the posts, Sun says (translated from Chinese) that “even if Li Lin uses it, he can leave unscathed; USDD will give him every penny of the interest!” In the post, Sun continues by saying Li “concealed due diligence materials, creating a $30 million hole internally.” Furthermore: “I discovered it, exposed it, and after being exposed, he [Li] tried to weasel out of it and didn’t pay a cent.” Sun ended up lending the company money to cover the loss. “Fortunately, I had money back then,” he concluded. Sun has been posting heavily about USDD as Tron plans to issue a new version of USDD — USDD 2.0 — that will offer 20% APY on staking. Sun and Li’s numerous issues This is not the first issue that has arisen with the October 2022 sale of Li’s share in Huobi. In May 2023, Sun alleged that Li’s brother Li Wei obtained a large quantity of Huobi’s native HT token at no cost “through improper means” in a now-deleted X post. Sun promised to recover and destroy Li Wei’s HT, despite also claiming that Lin Wei sold the token. In June 2023, Li Lin filed suit against Huobi Global in Hong Kong, claiming his X-Spot company. Li Lin alleged that his company owned the rights to the Huobi trademark, despite the sale of his shares. According to Bloomberg, Li Lin went on to co-found New Huo Technology Holdings digital asset service platform. Harvard has called him the 39th most generous philanthropist in China. Justin Sun stays busy with finance and art The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Sun in March 2023 for the sale of purported crypto securities. Sun has invested over $30 million in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, where he already served as an adviser. Sun is probably best known to the public for his purchase for $6.2 million of a conceptual artwork that consisted of a banana taped to wall. He went on to eat the banana.
