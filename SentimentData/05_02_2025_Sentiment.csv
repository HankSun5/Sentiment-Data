This early recognition places Litecoin ahead of other pending altcoin ETFs for Solana and XRP, sparking optimism that LTC might become the next asset to grab mainstream attention. Meanwhile, analysts highlight two other standouts this February: Sui, a newly rebranded chain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin bridging daily financial needs. Below is a closer look at what’s fueling Litecoin’s renewed hype and why some believe Sui and Remittix(RTX) might also be top movers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Acknowledgment: A Big Win Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, originally forked from the Bitcoin blockchain, just saw a 17% price jump after the SEC recognized Canary Capital’s application to launch a Litecoin ETF. Observers say this puts it ahead of Solana and XRP, which also have filings in the works but haven’t received the same nod yet. If the ETF gets approval, it could usher in a wave of mainstream capital, potentially returning LTC to price levels unseen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunasremarked that this filing is already checking most boxes, feeding rumors of a relatively smooth path toward final approval. Critics note that parallels between Litecoin and Bitcoin might make regulators more comfortable green-lighting an LTC-focused product. Many also expect the current SEC administration to be friendlier to crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s stance on digital assets. Should the ETF pass, it may also further normalize crypto within traditional finance circles. That official confidence can ripple outward, boosting liquidity and consumer adoption across the sector. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders in their own right, the race for altcoin ETFs appears to favor LTC at the moment. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Two Other Altcoins Grabbing Headlines Amid the ETF talk, analysts are also singling out Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential top performers in February. Sui, fresh from a rebrand, wants to boost transaction speeds and scale for dApps, making it attractive to developers who are chasing fast networks. However, the more consumer-facing star might be Remittix (RTX), a PayFi solution bridging FIAT and crypto for cross-border payments. Imagine a traveling event organizer in Latin America, frequently wiring funds to overseas partners. Conventional methods hurt with hefty fees; Remittix (RTX), by contrast, provides quick wallet-to-cash methods without typical bank overhead. So far, Remittix (RTX) has raised over $10.5 million and sold roughly 430 million tokens. One token is now selling for $0.0512. The altcoin’s real-world benefits—lower wire costs, more straightforward cross-border flows—could help it stand out in a sector often dominated by purely tech-driven or comedic tokens. Observers see this PayFi approach as possibly mirroring the early success of major players like XRP but focusing more on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF ushers in a fresh wave of crypto positivity, watchers believe tokens addressing daily financial needs—like Remittix(RTX)—may ride the tide exceptionally well. Conclusion: What Sets February’s Winners Apart? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is an essential step toward mainstream crypto integration, overshadowing altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP that remain unacknowledged. Meanwhile, coins like Sui emphasize high-speed networks, and Remittix(RTX) focuses on bridging everyday finance for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. With LTC’s climb already impressing investors, the door is open for these lesser-known gems to capture attention in a bullish February. Whether you’re watching the ETF race or hunting for the next big PayFi breakout, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its mission to reduce cross-border friction could spark the same mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems flourish.

This early nod gives Litecoin an edge over other pending altcoin ETFs like those for Solana and XRP, raising hopes that LTC could be the next cryptocurrency to gain widespread popularity. Meanwhile, analysts are also spotlighting two other notable contenders this February: Sui, a newly rebranded blockchain, and Remittix(RTX), a PayFi altcoin addressing everyday financial needs. Below, we delve into what’s driving Litecoin’s renewed enthusiasm and why Sui and Remittix(RTX) are also seen as potential top performers. Litecoin’s Early ETF Nod: A Significant Lead Over Solana & XRP Litecoin, which originated as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, has recently experienced a 17% price increase after the SEC acknowledged Canary Capital’s proposal for a Litecoin ETF. Analysts point out that this development places it ahead of Solana and XRP, which have yet to receive similar recognition for their filings. Should the ETF receive approval, it could attract substantial mainstream capital, potentially elevating LTC to prices not seen since 2021. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas noted that the current filing meets most requirements, fueling speculation that final approval might be relatively straightforward. Critics argue that the similarities between Litecoin and Bitcoin could make regulators more inclined to approve a product focused on LTC. There’s also an expectation that the current SEC leadership might be more favorable towards crypto, given acting Chair Mark Uyeda’s positive stance on digital assets. If the ETF is approved, it could further legitimize crypto within traditional financial sectors, boosting liquidity and wider adoption. Although Solana and XRP remain strong contenders, the current race for altcoin ETFs seems to favor LTC for now. Sui and Remittix (RTX): Other Altcoins Making Waves As discussions around ETFs continue, analysts are also focusing on Sui and Remittix(RTX) as potential stars in February. Sui, having undergone a rebrand, aims to enhance transaction speeds and scalability for dApps, making it appealing to developers seeking fast networks. On the other hand, the more consumer-oriented Remittix (RTX) emerges as a PayFi solution that connects FIAT and crypto for international payments. Consider a traveling event planner in Latin America who often sends money to international partners. Traditional methods can be costly with high fees, whereas Remittix (RTX) offers quick wallet-to-cash options without the usual bank fees. To date, Remittix (RTX) has amassed over $10.5 million and sold about 430 million tokens. Each token is currently priced at $0.0512. The practical advantages of this altcoin—such as reduced wire transfer costs and easier cross-border transactions—could help it stand out in a market often dominated by tech-centric or meme-based tokens. Analysts see this PayFi model as potentially echoing the initial success of major players like XRP but with a stronger focus on grassroots adoption. If LTC’s ETF brings a new wave of positivity to the crypto world, those focusing on everyday financial solutions—like Remittix(RTX)—could benefit significantly. Conclusion: What Distinguishes February’s Top Picks? Litecoin’s ETF momentum is a crucial step towards mainstream crypto adoption, overshadowing unacknowledged altcoin ETF filings for Solana and XRP. Meanwhile, altcoins like Sui focus on high-speed networks, while Remittix(RTX) aims to bridge daily financial needs for consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. As LTC’s ascent already impresses investors, there’s potential for these under-the-radar coins to gain attention in a promising February. Whether you’re observing the ETF contest or searching for the next significant PayFi breakthrough, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX)—its goal to ease cross-border transactions could ignite the same kind of mainstream interest that helps entire ecosystems thrive.

The cryptocurrency has recently seen increased buying interest, with firms adding DOGE to their holdings. At press time, Dogecoin price was down 10% trading at $0.2637, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $4.36 billion. Despite recent volatility, market watchers anticipate an upward trend based on historical price patterns and renewed institutional interest. Will Dogecoin’s Price Rally 300%? Dogecoin has experienced notable price fluctuations, with a recent 10.94% decline in the last 24 hours. However, analysts remain optimistic, pointing to a potential breakout. In the last week, DOGE price has plummeted by 17% in the last week and 31% in the long term startetgy. Traders have observed similarities between the current market cycle and the 2020-2021 bull run, where Dogecoin underwent two major corrections before a strong price surge. Crypto analyst Javon Marks has projected a rise to $0.6533, an increase of over 80% from current levels. He further suggests that a move beyond this threshold could push Dogecoin above $1.25, representing a 333% gain. Another analyst, Kevin, has also identified patterns aligning with the previous bull cycle, reinforcing the outlook for a strong recovery. Institutional Investors Show Renewed Interest in Dogecoin Companies are beginning to accumulate Dogecoin, signaling growing confidence in its long-term potential. Neptune Digital Assets, a blockchain company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, has recently acquired 1,000,000 Dogecoin tokens through a strategic derivative purchase. The firm acquired DOGE at an average price of $0.37 per token on December 27, 2024. Neptune has also expanded its crypto portfolio with a recent purchase of 20 Bitcoin at an average price of $99,833 per BTC. This move aligns with the company’s strategy of strengthening its digital asset holdings. Neptune’s CEO, Cale Moodie, stated that the firm remains committed to acquiring more assets while managing leverage risk. This move follows Grayscale’s launch of a Dogecoin Trust early Friday morning, providing institutional and accredited investors with a regulated way to invest in the cryptocurrency. DOGE Price Historical Patterns Hint at Breakout Market analysts have compared Dogecoin’s current cycle to previous trends, noting similarities in price corrections and rebounds. The previous bull run saw two major corrections before Dogecoin surged to new highs. In the ongoing cycle, the cryptocurrency has followed a similar pattern, with the first correction leading to a 65% decline and the second dropping 58.18%. If Dogecoin follows past trends, analysts believe it could experience a strong recovery, potentially reaching $1.25. Some market watchers have set even higher price targets, suggesting that DOGE could rally towards $4 if conditions align with previous growth patterns.

Table of Contents Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum ecosystem updates Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? Diplomatic talks spark ETH recovery Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price has had a rough few days, with a sharp drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3, the lowest it has been since September 2024. The decline came as financial markets reacted to new U.S. tariffs, which took effect on Feb. 1. The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods, leading to uncertainty across global markets, including crypto. Within hours, diplomatic efforts were underway. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on X that he had spoken with Donald Trump and secured a temporary 30-day pause on the tariffs while both countries worked on a broader border security agreement.

Following these developments, market sentiment improved , and Ethereum’s price has rebounded to $2,700 as of this writing on Feb. 4. At one point, ETH briefly touched $2,900 after Trump halted tariffs on Canada and Mexico.

So, what’s really happening in Ethereum’s ecosystem, and how could it impact Ethereum’s price prediction in the days ahead? Let’s dive deeper. Ethereum ecosystem updates Ethereum has been making critical changes to improve scalability and transaction efficiency. Gas limit increase and scalability improvements On Feb. 3, validators approved an increase in Ethereum’s gas limit for the first time since 2021, marking the first adjustment in the post-Merge era. The increase raised the gas limit from 30 million to over 31 million units, with a maximum capacity of 36 million expected soon. Unlike previous changes that required a hard fork, the adjustment took effect automatically after more than half of the validators signaled their support. Gas represents the computational power needed to execute transactions and smart contracts on Ethereum. Every action on the network incurs a gas cost, and the gas limit determines the total computational work that can be processed in a single block. When transaction volume exceeds this limit, users either wait for inclusion in a later block or pay higher fees to have their transactions prioritized. Raising the gas limit increases the number of transactions and operations that can fit within a block, improving overall throughput and easing congestion. The change also allows more complex decentralized applications to function smoothly, benefiting the growing ecosystem of financial applications, NFT platforms, and on-chain services. However, while raising the gas limit helps improve transaction capacity, it does not address Ethereum’s core limitations in cost and speed. For instance, Ethereum handles 1 to 1.5 million daily transactions, while Solana processes between 60 and 65 million. The difference is substantial, with Solana not only processing exponentially more transactions but also doing so at a fraction of the cost, making long-term scalability a persistent challenge. Ethereum’s market position and competitive challenges To address these concerns, Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade, set to go live in early 2025, is expected to enhance network scalability further, particularly for layer-2 solutions. A key part of this upgrade involves increasing the blob target from three to six. Blobs are large data packets used in layer-2 scaling solutions, allowing them to store transaction data temporarily rather than writing it directly onto Ethereum’s main chain. Expanding blob capacity effectively increases the throughput of layer-2 networks, making them faster and cheaper. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and zkSync ( ZK ) already play a crucial role in reducing congestion and gas fees for Ethereum users. Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network in terms of total value locked, has seen consistent growth due to its ability to batch multiple Ethereum transactions into a single compressed proof, significantly cutting costs. Optimism follows a similar approach but integrates an incentive model that distributes OP tokens to projects building on its network. zkSync, which leverages zero-knowledge rollups, provides an even more advanced scaling solution, offering near-instant transactions with lower fees. While these layer-2 solutions help alleviate Ethereum’s congestion issues, they highlight a fundamental contrast between Ethereum and its competition. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on additional layers to scale, other blockchain ecosystems have built-in scalability. Solana, Avalanche ( AVAX ), and even emerging players like Sei ( SEI ) are capable of handling large transaction volumes without requiring external scaling solutions. Beyond technical upgrades, Ethereum’s market position has also been facing pressure. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped to 0.027 as of Feb. 4, its lowest level since March 2021 and nearly 50% lower than a year ago. ETH/BTC price chart | Source: TradingView As Bitcoin continues to gain dominance in both liquidity and investor interest, Ethereum’s relative valuation remains under scrutiny. Can Ethereum hold its ground? Ethereum’s recent price drop to $2,150 on Feb. 3 was not just a reaction to broader economic uncertainty but also served as a market reset, clearing out excessive leverage that had built up in Ethereum’s open interest. “There was a lot of garbage low-quality leverage long open on Ethereum which got closed when price touched the 2100 area,” noted one analyst, highlighting a $4 billion reduction in open interest that ultimately helped stabilize the market. This dump was probably the best thing that happened to Ethereum.

This was a healthy Dump for ETH. pic.twitter.com/bfbdM3SMbM — Emperor👑 (@EmperorBTC) February 3, 2025 With those positions flushed out, Ethereum’s price recovery to $2,700 was driven by spot demand rather than excessive leverage, signaling a healthier foundation for future price movement, he added. From a technical perspective, Ethereum briefly dipped below its 200-week moving average, a significant level that has often acted as a major support zone. “ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025, dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib,” another trader pointed out, referring to key retracement levels that have marked past cycle bottoms. $ETH may have offered the sweetest gift of 2025 dipping below the 200 WMA in the early morning and testing the 0.618 Fib, as it did in August and Sept. Price is already back above the 200 WMA now That being said, getting $ETH around the 200 WMA is the same as buying a Mega Cap… pic.twitter.com/g5xtEAz5Jf — The Long Investor (@TheLongInvest) February 3, 2025 While price has already reclaimed the 200 WMA, previous instances where Ethereum tested this level in August and September 2024 led to strong recoveries. However, the broader macro landscape still presents risks. The recent market dip was triggered by escalating U.S. tariffs, a policy shift that briefly shook global financial markets. While diplomatic resolutions have provided temporary relief, uncertainties remain, particularly around potential retaliatory measures or further economic restrictions. If global liquidity tightens or risk sentiment weakens, Ethereum’s ability to sustain a recovery could face challenges. Another factor to watch is Ethereum’s ability to maintain market dominance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ). The ETH/BTC ratio has been on a downtrend, reflecting a shift in investor preference toward Bitcoin, which has seen stronger institutional flows. Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and the recent gas limit increase could support its ecosystem growth, but these improvements need to translate into tangible benefits for users and developers to sustain long-term demand. Ethereum price prediction: will the downtrend reverse? The latest market reset, which cleared out billions in leveraged positions, has left Ethereum in a healthier position, but what happens next depends on a mix of factors—scalability upgrades, adoption, competition, and economic conditions. Ethereum price prediction 2025 Ethereum’s price action in 2025 is expected to be shaped by its ability to scale efficiently while maintaining strong demand within its ecosystem. DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average of $5,510, with a potential peak of $6,037, while Changelly takes a more bullish stance, predicting an average of $6,124 and a maximum of $7,194. Joe, co-founder of DeAgentAI, told crypto.news that the recent price action fits a broader historical pattern. “Short-term bearish signals—like the one flagged on Feb. 3—often require nuanced interpretation.” He pointed to historical setups from 2023 and 2024 that triggered sharp reversals, suggesting traders should watch for Ethereum’s reaction to key support levels. Ethereum price prediction 2027 If Ethereum continues leading the smart contract space and scaling solutions mature, ETH could see a rise in 2027. DigitalCoinPrice projects an average of $9,580 with a peak at $10,098, while Changelly paints an even stronger outlook, predicting an average of $12,316 and a maximum of $14,527. At the same time, DeFi growth, NFT innovation, and Ethereum’s role in real-world asset tokenization could provide fresh demand for ETH. However, if risk assets face tightening conditions, ETH’s price could face headwinds despite fundamental improvements. Ethereum price prediction 2030 Meanwhile, long-term forecasts see Ethereum reaching levels that once seemed distant. DigitalCoinPrice estimates an average price of $14,829 in 2030, with a high of $15,108, while Changelly provides a much more aggressive projection, predicting an average of $40,055 and a potential peak of $47,066. That being said, long-term predictions always come with risks. Ethereum faces competition from Solana, Avalanche, and emerging blockchain networks, all aiming to offer lower fees and higher speeds. While ETH prediction models remain optimistic, it’s essential to combine technical forecasts with real-world adoption trends before making any long-term commitments.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC and a post on the ministry’s official Telegram channel , the government wants to create a “unified registry” as part of its ongoing efforts to regulate the mining sector. Russia’s Deputy Minister of Energy Yevgeny Grabchak unveiled the proposal at a “working meeting” on mining this week. Why Does Russia’s Energy Ministry Want Crypto Mining Hardware Register? The ministry thinks this measure will help it keep tabs on crypto miners as it looks to “increase the effectiveness of regional bans.” Russian Ministry of Energy officials speak about crypto mining at a meeting on February 3. (Source: Minergo Rossii/Telegram) Moscow is extremely keen to develop its crypto mining sector. Recently, some state-run organs have been given the green light to develop their crypto mining-related projects . These could see crypto mining projects launched in the Russian Far East and in other parts of the country with surplus power. However, Russian decision-makers are worried that a surge in mining could cause power shortages in energy-deficient areas. While US-led export controls on Russia have primarily targeted weapons components and high-end chips, a less threatening product shows just how hard it will be for Donald Trump to squeeze Vladimir Putin’s economy: Japanese grand pianos. https://t.co/P68AgUBjac — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 4, 2025 Power Problems? Some parts of the nation are already experiencing crypto mining-related power shortages. Moscow has responded with regional wintertime bans on mining in several parts of the country. But these bans do not appear to have made much of a dent on the nation’s wide network of “grey” and illegal miners. May operators appear to be flaunting the bans. Thus, the ministry appears to think it will be able to keep tabs on miners by forcing them to report on their mining rig purchases. The TEC-27 power plant near Moscow, Russia. (Source: PJSC Mosenergo/Anna Samarino [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Growth Potential Grabchak’s proposal would see Moscow create a single register of “equipment without which cryptocurrency mining is impossible.” “The fundamental task of the registry will be optimizing the mechanisms for identifying mining activities. This will help us effectively enforce bans on mining in regions where it is prohibited.” Russian Energy Ministry Additionally, the ministry said, the registry could help boost crypto mining in other regions. The registry will help economic growth, including through the introduction of new IT solutions, the ministry added. Russia’s Energy Ministry has spearheaded work on the bans, which some provinces already want to see extended . Furthermore, Grabchak claimed that Russian crypto miners “have increased their electricity consumption by 14% in the past two years.” He added that crypto miners “have used up all available capacity in some areas.” And this means “new consumers (miners)” “cannot connect to these networks,” Grabchak said.

Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced a stablecoin bill today. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said he plans to try to move that bill through Congress before a larger crypto market structure bill. But he added that he hopes to have both on the President’s desk within the administration’s first 100 days. In part, he said, that could be possible because both pieces of legislation have had bipartisan support in the past session of Congress. Sen. Scott pointed out that the market structure bill being worked on in the Senate will be a bipartisan one continuing the work that Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) did in the Senate and the FIT 21 legislation that passed in a bipartisan vote in the House last year.

In his opening remarks, Sacks shared that “the President said in his executive order in the first week that it’s the policy of his administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology and related technologies across all sectors of the economy.” He also reminded the audience that in that executive order, the President established both a working group for digital assets as well as a mandate for the group. “Our objective is to accomplish the task the President assigned for us in his EO, which is to propose a Federal regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States,” said Sacks. The ""Golden Age"" For The Bitcoin And Crypto Industry Begins Sacks also contextualized the significance of this new administration’s not being antagonistic to the Bitcoin and crypto industry, especially in light of what transpired under the Biden administration. “I’ve talked to many founders over the last few years and they’ve told me repeatedly that the number one thing they need from Washington is regulatory clarity,” he said. “They just want to know what the rules of the road are so they can abide by them. We’re coming off frankly four years of arbitrary prosecution and persecution of crypto companies where the SEC wouldn’t tell founders what the rules were and then they would prosecute them. Many founders even told me stories of being debanked personally just because they had founded a crypto company,” he added. Before concluding his opening remarks, Sacks noted that he looks forward to working with the politicians hosting the conference alongside him — Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman French Hill (R-AR), Senator John Boozman (R-AR) and Congressman (R-PA) — in “creating a golden age for digital assets.” Senator Scott began by stating that this “golden age has begun” and that “the good news is that it’s going to get better.” He also noted that he plans to “work synergistically with the House and the Senate, with the White House leading the way” when it comes to passing bills on digital assets. The U.S. At The Forefront Of Bitcoin And Crypto Innovation Rep. Hill stressed that the United States should be leading the way, not falling behind when it comes to the digital asset industry. “We don’t want to be behind in financial technology and digital assets in the United States, [and] our innovators need clarity,” said Rep. Hill. “They need to know what the rules of the road are.” He also stated that he’s forming a working group between the House Financial Services Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, the House Agriculture Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee to craft a clear regulatory framework. Senator Boozman highlighted the fact that not all crypto assets are the same (without necessarily singling bitcoin out). “Some assets are commodities, some are securities,” said Senator Boozman, who noted that different regulatory agencies should oversee different crypto assets accordingly. Rep. Thompson walked the audience through the stages of the Internet, pointing out the fact that the internet today has become the “Internet of value.” “America really was the leader when it came to Internet 1.0, and [with] Internet 2.0, again, it was America that led that for the world,” said Rep. Thompson. “Internet 3.0 is what we’re talking about today, and that’s the Internet of value — and we’re approaching it in a principled way.” This “principled way” includes protecting consumers while still offering innovators in the Bitcoin and crypto industry space to foster innovation, according to Rep. Thompson. “The opportunities [in crypto] are unimaginable,” said Rep. Thompson. “I know that [David Sacks] is laser focused on bringing certainty to digital asset markets.” During a question and answer session, Senator Scott noted that bipartisan efforts are being made around crypto in the Senate. “Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand are coming together for the market structure bill ,” he said. Comments On Anti-Money Laundering Regulation When asked about reconsidering Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws as they pertain to crypto, Senator Scott said he’s open to it. “I think that the broader conversation should not be about digital assets alone,” said Senator Scott. “It’s about bad actors doing bad things by any means necessary.” Rep. Hill chimed in regarding AML regulations, stating that they should exist, much like they do in the analog financial space. Educational Efforts Rep. Thompson brought up the importance of educating those in the House and Senate about crypto assets, given that it’s still a relatively new subject. “Member education is what our first goal is here,” he said. Rep. Hill echoed his sentiment. “A key element now is the education and technical assistance that can be provided to members both in the House and Senate,” he said. Sacks also offered his thoughts on this topic. “Part of what we’re here to do is provide resources on education,” he said, adding that some of the educators can be “luminaries in the industry.” As Sacks spoke on this topic, he also differentiated between Bitcoin and all other crypto assets and networks. “Crypto can be an esoteric subject, and it is good to explain it, to demystify it,” said Sacks. “You’ve got the cryptocurrency itself like bitcoin, [and then other assets that] run on blockchains, which are just distributed ledgers.” The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Before the conference concluded, Sacks also addressed the prospect of the U.S. creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . “One of the things that the President instructed us to do was to evaluate the idea for a Bitcoin reserve,” said Sacks. “So, that is one of the first things we’re going to look at as part of the internal working group in the administration.”",Trump|Politics|Politicians|President Trump|Politics|Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-02-04 23:39:46

KyberSwap, Indexed Finance Fraudster Charged According to the Monday press release , the 22-year-old man broke through KyberSwap’s coding to artificially alter the prices within the protocol’s liquidity pools. “Medjedovic then calculated precise combinations of trades that would cause the KyberSwap AMM to “glitch,” in his words, allowing him to steal tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from the liquidity pools,’ the United States Attorney’s Office states. Shortly after the hack, Medjedovic attempted to extort KyberSwap’s developers for control of the platform and its DAO, ultimately stealing $48.8 million worth of coins from the crypto collective.

In an October 2021 incident, Medjedovic manipulated prices on Indexed Finance’s index pools using borrowed cryptocurrencies, resulting in over $16.5 million being drained from investors. The following year, the now-indicted Medjedovic conspired with an unnamed accomplice to launder the pocketed funds through fraudulent crypto exchange accounts while further hiding their origins through the use of a crypto mixer. “Hackers can at times be painted in a flattering light by pop culture, some admiring their skills and acumen,” stated FBI Assistant Director in Charge Dennehy. “They’re stealing money that isn’t theirs, and they’re breaking the laws of this country.” “We allege Andean Medjedovic violated several of those laws, and he, along with all the other cyber criminals who believe they’re untouchable will face justice,” he added.

According to reports, the U.S. Attorney’s Office allegedly believes that the one-time University of Waterloo student is currently on the lam from the charges somewhere outside of the United States. Medjedovic has been charged with one count of money laundering, one count of money laundering conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, and one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer.

The vote will determine whether the exchange resumes trading or undergoes liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. If approved, the restructuring plan could see trading recommence by April 2025, with initial payouts starting within 10 business days. WazirX Creditors To Vote On Restructuring Plan According to a recent statement from the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, creditors will vote on a restructuring plan to recover losses from the WazirX hack. The proposed plan outlines a 52% immediate debt settlement, with the remaining 48% to be paid from future profits and asset recoveries. The vote follows approval from the Singapore High Court, allowing WazirX creditors to decide the exchange’s future. If the plan is accepted by at least 75% of creditors, trading may resume by April 2025, and payouts will begin within 10 business days. In addition, the development comes days after the Singapore High Court granted WazirX approval in late January to convene a Scheme meeting. This meeting will allow creditors to vote on the proposed recovery plan, facilitating a structured repayment of unstolen funds. What Happens If Plan Fails? If WazirX creditors reject the restructuring plan, the exchange will undergo liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act. This could postpone repayments until 2030, significantly reducing the chances of full recovery for affected users. Industry experts have warned that liquidation could lead to unpredictable asset distribution. The timeline for payouts would be extended, and the value of recoverable assets could decrease due to market volatility and operational challenges. Source: X Planned Recovery Measures And Future Operations To facilitate debt repayments and restore operations, WazirX plans to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) and introduce recovery tokens. The proposal also includes periodic buybacks to stabilize the platform and improve financial sustainability. Moreover, the restructuring plan will allocate Net Liquid Platform Assets to creditors as part of the recovery process. The company has been working closely with the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to ensure faster distribution and prevent prolonged delays in fund recovery. The vote will determine whether the Indian exchange can resume trading or enter a liquidation process. The restructuring plan is an alternative to liquidation. It offers creditors a more immediate path to fund recovery. With over 4.4 million creditors involved, the voting process is a crucial moment for the Indian exchange Meanwhile, WazirX continues its efforts to recover stolen funds, freezing $3 million in assets as part of its recovery plan. Founder Nischal Shetty emphasized that this is just the beginning, reaffirming the platform’s commitment to retrieving lost crypto.

According to the team, the upgrade “turns the Uniswap protocol into a platform for developers”. At the heart of the new version are special hooks contracts with detailed parameter customization for pools, swaps, fees and order interactions. The creators noted that v4 is the cheapest version of the protocol to date. Organizing pools will be 99.9% cheaper than the previous iteration, Uniswap v3. Swap users have been promised savings on multicast exchanges. According to a statement from the team, the development utilized suggestions from “hundreds of community members.” The update code went through nine security audits, and as part of the bounty program, the company paid out $15.5 million. No critical vulnerabilities were found. In July 2023, the Uniswap team announced that it would launch the fourth version of the protocol within four months of the Dencun hardfork on the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly before that, the creators published a “draft” of the v4 code, which had not yet undergone a number of audits and refinements.

Key support levels are $4.55, $4.28, and $3.60, crucial for stability. Experts believe Polkadot may surge past $50, possibly revisiting its $55 high. Polkadot (DOT) has taken a hit, with its price dropping sharply and leaving many to wonder what’s next. This isn’t just a small dip—it’s a major setback for the cryptocurrency, causing some concern about its short-term future. Before this drop, Polkadot had been trading above $6, riding a wave of optimism, with its price rising over 12% amid hopes that a Polkadot exchange-traded fund (ETF) could soon launch in the United States. The excitement kicked off last week when digital asset manager 21Shares filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission to launch a Spot Polkadot ETF. Polkadot Price: Key Levels to Watch Polkadot is currently in a correction phase after reaching a high. The price is currently trading near the $4.80 level and is trying to break above the $5 target. DOT closed the previous session at $5.14 and key resistance levels are at $6.10 and $5.94.

It’s about building trust, establishing value, and setting the stage for long-term success. Web3Bay is taking a methodical, transparent approach with its 28-stage token presale, aiming to balance supply and demand while solidifying its position as the highest potential crypto. This strategic roadmap is not just about raising capital; it’s about fostering sustainable growth and investor confidence. The current stage, Stage 4, illustrates this carefully planned progression. Web3Bay has already garnered significant interest, raising $1.07 and distributing 270 million tokens. At the current price of $0.004562625 per token, early adopters have the opportunity to participate at a favorable entry point. The projected ROI at launch is over 6,400%, a compelling figure that underscores the potential of this structured model. Strategic Token Allocation: Fueling Long-Term Value What distinguishes Web3Bay’s presale is its emphasis on controlled token availability. Each stage brings a reduction in the number of tokens offered, creating a sense of scarcity that can contribute to price stability at launch. Early stages might release a greater volume of tokens, but subsequent stages gradually tighten the supply. This approach not only rewards early believers in the project’s vision but also helps prevent market saturation. By the final stages, the limited availability is designed to maintain demand and support price integrity – qualities often associated with the highest potential crypto. This systematic approach stands in contrast to many “all-at-once” token sales that can flood the market, often leading to volatile price swings. Web3Bay’s stage-based strategy offers a clear, predictable structure. It ensures that the project enters the market with a balanced, sustainable ecosystem, avoiding a sudden influx of tokens that could create instability. This controlled release schedule positions Web3Bay as the highest potential crypto. A Foundation for Future Growth: More Than Just Fundraising Fundraising and token distribution are just the initial steps. Web3Bay’s structured presale is part of a broader roadmap designed to achieve the project’s long-term objectives. By carefully scaling funding through incremental price increases, Web3Bay can concentrate on sustainable development rather than relying solely on initial hype. This strategy provides the team with the resources needed to fulfill its promises while building confidence among investors and future users. Each stage builds upon the previous one, generating natural momentum. As the price gradually increases, it reflects the growing interest and trust in the project. The staged structure also provides opportunities for Web3Bay to regularly update its community, keeping them informed and engaged. By the time the project launches, it will have a solid foundation, a strong community base, and a price that more accurately reflects its market potential. This measured approach is a key factor in Web3Bay’s potential as a highest potential crypto. Open Communication: Building Confidence and Trust Transparency is central to Web3Bay’s presale strategy. By clearly outlining each stage and openly communicating pricing, token availability, and overall progress, Web3Bay is building a relationship of trust with its supporters. Potential investors can easily see where the project stands, what’s coming next, and how their participation fits into the overall vision. The gradual token release and ongoing updates help prevent misinformation or confusion that can sometimes occur during rapid token sales. Instead of rushing the process, Web3Bay ensures its backers are well-informed, increasing confidence and reducing uncertainty. This commitment to transparency, combined with a well-structured presale, strengthens Web3Bay’s standing as the highest potential crypto. A Path to Stability: Beyond the Initial Launch Web3Bay’s 28-stage presale is more than just a fundraising mechanism; it’s a carefully designed roadmap aimed at fostering long-term growth and market stability. The gradual reduction in token availability supports price integrity, the measured price increases build momentum and trust, and the ongoing transparency reinforces community confidence. With $970,000 already raised, 250 million tokens sold, and the price per token steadily increasing, Web3Bay’s presale structure is demonstrating its effectiveness. Early participants are positioned for significant returns, and the project is on track to achieve a launch price that reflects genuine market interest rather than short-lived speculation. This structured, transparent approach to fundraising and token distribution not only supports a successful launch but also lays a strong foundation for continued success. With its clear vision and measured strategy, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the highest potential crypto , potentially benefiting both its early backers and the wider community.

Could 2025 bring another golden opportunity? Top analysts say RCO Finance (RCOF), Sui (SUI), and (XRP) might be the next big winners. They believe these must buy altcoins can turn a small $1,000 investment into $1 million. Let’s look at why experts are so confident. 1. RCO Finance Some say RCO Finance could be the next big name in crypto. It’s a DeFi trading platform that stands out because it brings AI into finance. This makes trading easier for everyone and removes some of the usual barriers that stop people from getting involved. A key feature of RCO Finance’s offering to traders is its AI-powered Robo Advisor. This is a tool that helps you make better decisions by trading how you like, based on your risk tolerance and goals. Think of it as a portfolio manager, but one that is automated such that you are profitable without the heavy lifting that comes with personal trading or the fees that come with portfolio managers. In early 2024, many traders lost money when Telegram-based coins crashed after Notcoin launched. With the robo advisor, they could have avoided big losses. What’s more, the platform prioritizes security by conducting regular audits of its smart contracts. SolidProof , a trusted Web3 auditor, conducts these audits to guarantee the safety of investors’ funds. Another thing that makes RCO Finance different is that it doesn’t require KYC, which protects user privacy. It also lets users stake their assets and earn rewards. This can help investors grow their money over time without needing to do much. The platform recently launched its beta version and is letting users test its AI-driven tools. More updates are expected, which could increase interest even further. With strong security measures in place, traders have another reason to consider RCOF as a key pick for Q1 2025. 2. Sui In the world of blockchain, speed is more than just a bonus. It’s something platforms need to compete. That’s where SUI comes in. It can handle huge amounts of transactions without slowing down. Many developers and companies see it as one of the best crypto to buy because it works faster than others still using old methods. But speed isn’t the only thing SUI brings to the table. It also makes life easier for developers. Imagine a small team in Latin America trying to build an app for gig workers. With SUI, they can do it without struggling with slow networks or system crashes. This is a big deal for anyone working on new projects in the crypto world. Meanwhile, SUI’s price movement has been slow recently. SUI is valued at $3.74, a 3.36% decrease in its value from last week. Sui’s recent integration into Phantom Wallet will increase its availability and usage, making SUI one of the must buy altcoins. This could push its price to $5 soon. 3. XRP One of XRP’s biggest strengths is speed. The network can handle over 1,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the crypto world. It also keeps costs low, which is why many see it as one of the must buy altcoins for quick payments. Businesses and individuals looking for a reliable way to send money worldwide find it useful. XRP continues to be a popular choice. Its speed, low fees, and ability to handle many transactions make it stand out. Ripple’s latest XRP Markets Report showed that the company held 4,485,366,320 XRP at the end of 2024, giving investors insight into the current coin’s price and market trends. XRP’s performance has been dropping recently. XRP is trading at $2.88, which indicates a 4.95% fall from last week. Moving forward, some experts predict an uptrend for XRP due to the possibility of an XRP ETF soon. This could push the value of XRP to $4, making it one of the must buy altcoins. RCOF Becomes One of the Must Buy Altcoins: Join Now and See Your $1k Rise to $1 Million The RCOF presale is catching the interest of many crypto traders. Some believe it could become a major name in the market. So far, RCO Finance has raised more than $12 million, moving into the fifth stage of its presale. Right now, the RCOF token costs $0.10. Experts think that when it officially launches, the price could jump to somewhere between $0.40 and $0.60. If that happens, early investors might see a return of over 670%, making it one of the must buy altcoins. Some analysts are even more confident. They believe they could easily turn an investment of $1,000 into $1 million quickly. With so much talk around the RCOF token, many traders are keeping a close eye on it.

BlockDAG’s Biggest Offer Turns Up the Heat! SOL Price Analysis Hints at Recovery & XRP Supply Debate Resurfaces,https://thecoinrise.com/350-more-bdag-blockdags-biggest-offer-turns-up-the-heat-sol-price-analysis-hints-at-recovery-xrp-supply-debate-resurfaces/,"Solana, XRP, and BlockDAG are shaping up as strong contenders for the best crypto to buy now, each making headlines with key developments. The latest Solana (SOL) price analysis highlights its potential for recovery after briefly dipping below $195, with investors watching resistance levels to determine its next move. Meanwhile, discussions around XRP supply continue, sparking fresh debates about its total token limit. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing all the attention with its biggest offer yet — the FINALCALL700 bonus. This offer is fueling its record-breaking presale, offering a massive 350% extra BDAG with every purchase. With $191.5 million already raised and demand surging, early buyers rush to lock in this limited-time opportunity before BDAG’s price climbs. Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Recover After Dropping Below $195? The recent Solana (SOL) price analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency recently dropped below $195 before making a swift recovery. This decline followed a rejection near $280, sparking concerns about short-term movement. Despite the pullback, analysts believe the asset still has room for upward momentum, provided key resistance levels are broken. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests an oversold market, which could support a potential rally. For Solana to reach $500, it must first surpass resistance at $280 and $400, while maintaining support above $180 and $200. The Solana price analysis also highlights Bitcoin’s influence, as broader market trends continue to impact its trajectory. XRP Supply Debate: Why 100 Billion Cap Is Permanent Discussions around the XRP supply have resurfaced, with some questioning whether Ripple holds the ability to create additional tokens beyond the 100 billion originally issued. However, XRPL validator Vet has clarified that the network’s design prevents any increase in supply. The XRP Ledger includes an “invariant checker,” a security feature that ensures no new tokens can be minted. Unlike Bitcoin, which once faced an accidental inflation bug, XRPL’s structure makes such an issue highly unlikely. Additionally, XRP’s supply is decreasing over time due to transaction fees that burn small amounts with each transaction, reinforcing the token’s scarcity. FINALCALL700: 350% Bonus Drives BlockDAG’s $191.5M Presale BlockDAG’s presale is reaching new heights, and its latest offer, FINALCALL700, is making it even more appealing. For a limited time, every BDAG purchase comes with a 350% extra coin bonus, making this the most rewarding offer in BlockDAG’s history. Traders looking to maximise their holdings before launch are moving quickly, as this bonus significantly increases their BDAG count. For example, a $1,000 BDAG purchase with FINALCALL700 results in $4,500 worth of BDAG, an opportunity rarely seen in early-stage crypto sales. The BDAG coin presale has already raised $191.5 million and sold over 18.3 billion coins, making it one of the largest in the market. BDAG’s price has surged 2380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, fueling strong demand. The combination of its rapid growth and FINALCALL700 has many traders calling it the best crypto to buy now, as presale participation continues accelerating. The bonus isn’t just an extra incentive—it’s actively driving momentum, pushing BlockDAG toward new milestones as interest skyrockets. But what does the future hold for BDAG holders once the presale ends? Analysts predict a $1 price right after launch, positioning BDAG as a strong long-term contender. The FINALCALL700 may be the best chance to stake up on BDAG coins before prices climb even higher, but it won’t last forever. With demand accelerating, those still on the sidelines risk watching this opportunity slip away as BDAG moves toward its next phase. Final Thoughts: Where SOL, XRP & BDAG Stand Now? As the market continues to shift, each of these contenders presents a unique opportunity. The Solana (SOL) price analysis suggests a potential rebound, but breaking resistance levels will be key to its next rally. The XRP supply remains fixed at 100 billion, confirming its scarcity as discussions around its tokenomics settle. However, BlockDAG’s momentum is on another level. With FINALCALL700 offering 350% extra BDAG, demand is high and the presale has skyrocketed past $191.5 million. Analysts predict BDAG will hit $1 post-launch, making this presale phase a rare entry point for those looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Once the FINALCALL700 bonus disappears, so does the chance to secure extra BDAG coins at this affordable price.

The company has reportedly enlisted Jefferies Financial Group Inc. to assist with the potential listing. If the IPO happens, Bullish will go public among several cryptocurrency companies as hope rises that President Donald Trump will be friendly to crypto. Led by Chief Executive Officer Tom Farley, the exchange is growing internationally, with offices in the U.S., Hong Kong, Singapore, Gibraltar, and the Cayman Islands. Bullish pursues IPO as market conditions improve An IPO would see Bullish joining a growing number of companies in the sector moving ahead with plans to go public amid expectations that President Donald Trump will pursue a pro-crypto agenda. The firm once revealed its plans to go public in 2021 via an SPAC, only to shelve those plans. The new IPO discussions reflect the company’s shift in approach as market conditions improve and the regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies becomes more defined. Bullish is a subsidiary of Block.one, a blockchain software company subsidiary whose backers include Thiel, Alan Howard, Louis Bacon, and Richard Li. Block.one, whose co-founder and CEO Brendan Blumer also serves as Bullish’s chairman, launched the company in 2021 and capitalized Bullish with about $10 billion in digital assets and cash. Crypto firms set to reenter IPO market as regulatory landscape shifts Going public via an IPO was challenging for crypto firms under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chair Gary Gensler, was slow to review filings from companies like Circle, which initially pursued a public listing through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. However, following the collapse of FTX and the resulting investor skepticism toward the crypto market, Circle abandoned its plans in December 2022. Over the past four years, big crypto firms haven’t had much hope of going public, but all that’s set to change in January. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to reverse course on President Joe Biden’s digital asset crackdown is spurring hope that the initial public offering market could soon open to stablecoin provider Circle Internet Financial, trading platform Kraken, and other firms that have said they’d like to go public. Recently, Circle refiled for a traditional IPO, and there’s ample reason to think the stars will align for the firm and others like it to be successful this time. A representative of the firm said: Due to the nature of the registration process, we cannot comment. I can say that becoming a public company has always been a part of Circle’s core strategy, underscoring our commitment to trust and transparency. Circle spokesman. The Bullish IPO discussions are ongoing, and details, including timing and valuation, remain subject to change. Additional banks may also be brought in to support the offering. The representatives of Bullish and Block.one have not yet responded to the requests for comment, and a spokesman for Jefferies has declined to comment. Bullish’s IPO plans align with those of other crypto companies returning to the public markets. With more definitions of regulations and the positive shift in the investor’s mindset, more companies are expected to go for the public market.

Though no official information has been released concerning the IPO, Bloomberg reported that the Peter Thiel-backed firm may advance this push this year. Bullish Global IPO Is Not a Surprise According to the Bloomberg report , citing people familiar with the IPO , Bullish Global allegedly works with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. on the potential listing. Before this time, Bullish Global has been considering going public. Almost four years ago, it announced its intention to go public through a Special-Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). Despite the lofty plans, the firm soon broke from this move. According to the same sources, which requested to be anonymous due to the confidentiality of information, there are ongoing deliberations on the matter. However, they also clarified that details of the offering could change, which may include adding more banks to the existing lineup. Bullish Global made the news last year when it acquired the crypto media site Coindesk. Despite the claims of editorial independence, the platform has had to deal with management and editorial conflicts of interest. Bullish IPO and Top Crypto Candidates Beyond the Bullish IPO plans, many organizations are gradually moving towards going public. Popular stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial is still mulling the possibility of going public in the United States. Meanwhile, another Peter Thiel-backed firm, Bitpanda, has its sights set on public listing. In the case of Bitpanda, it has collaborated with Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise it on its next step. The crypto industry is advancing, with companies recording impressive earnings amid the turn of the bull run. According to Galaxy Research, at least four companies are on track to go public this year. Besides Circle, it named Fireblocks, Chainalysis, and Kraken the likely candidates to go public. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings’ CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed, against broad industry clamor, that there are no IPO plans . Should the Galaxy IPO come true, these firms will join Coinbase, MARA Holdings, and other crypto-native firms in the stock market. Favorable Crypto Policies To Help Noteworthy, President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance may have revived the US companies’ faith toward going public. It is worth noting that Thiel was one of those who supported the Republican politician around the time of his campaign. With the spotlight on the industry, regulatory shifts may also favor the service providers to go public. Bullish Global and Circle, with failed SPAC moves, may finally gain the IPO pathway to going public.

39928573,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=668671,1738714433,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39928573.jpeg,White House Crypto Czar David Sacks holds “disappointing” first press conference,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/white-house-crypto-czar-david-sacks-holds-disappointing-first-press-conference/,"David Sacks, the newly appointed White House Crypto Czar, walked into his highly anticipated press conference on Capitol Hill today and left many in the crypto community frustrated. His mission was to explain how President Trump’s administration plans to push the US into crypto dominance after years of chaos under Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto regime. Instead of providing the hard-hitting regulatory clearances everyone expected, Sacks played it safe with broad strokes, vague assurances, and a lot of talk about “the golden age of digital assets.” Sacks opened with gratitude, thanking leaders from both the House and Senate, including Chairmen Tim Scott, French Hill, John Boozman, and GT Thompson, who were all standing right beside him as you can see in the video below. “The president set this as a week-one priority,” Sacks said. “We’re committed to ensuring American dominance in digital assets.” Trump’s crypto vision triggers regulatory shake-up Trump’s executive order laid the groundwork for the Crypto Czar’s mission, which is to craft a federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, particularly stablecoins. Sacks pointed to the working group established under the executive order, which includes big names like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick, and incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by crypto-friendly commissioner Mark Uyeda until Paul Atkins gets Senate-confirmed, has also created a dedicated crypto task force, which is led by ‘Crypto Mom’ Hester Peirce, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. Sacks took a moment to vent about the damage done by the SEC’s previous approach. “I’ve talked to many founders who told me their biggest problem is regulatory uncertainty,” he said. “They were prosecuted without being told what they did wrong. Some were even debanked personally just for founding a crypto company.” Sacks blamed this hostility for pushing innovation offshore, something he and the administration are desperate to reverse. The Crypto Czar also made it clear that he wholeheartedly believes all financial assets are going digital, whether regulators are ready or not. “Just like every analog industry became digital, financial assets will follow,” he said. “We don’t want that innovation happening in other countries.” To drive the point home, Sacks referenced FTX’s collapse, which he said was proof of the dangers of offshore operations. “The biggest fraud in crypto history happened in the Bahamas,” he reminded the room. “Keeping innovation onshore means better consumer protection.” Stablecoins come first as Congress warms up to crypto Sacks repeatedly pointed out the importance of stablecoins in the administration’s strategy. He mentioned the bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, which plans to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins that would maintain the US dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency, as Cryptopolitan reported yesterday. “Stablecoins could create trillions in demand for US Treasuries and potentially lower long-term interest rates,” Sacks explained. French Hill, who is the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, confirmed that stablecoins would be prioritized over other crypto issues. “We’re moving fast on this,” Hill said. “Bipartisan support between the House and Senate is already in place, and we’ve learned from past efforts.” He referenced last year’s bipartisan success when 71 Democrats joined House Republicans to pass stablecoin legislation in the House, though it stalled in the Senate. Hill also praised Hester’s involvement. “Hester brings a clear-headed approach to crypto regulation,” he said. John Boozman, who is the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, explained why his committee, typically focused on farming, has a role in crypto regulation. “The CFTC oversees commodities, and some digital assets fall under that category,” he said. Boozman promised that collaboration between the SEC and CFTC would prevent jurisdictional battles from delaying progress. “We’ve worked separately before, but now we’re coming together with purpose.” AML laws under scrutiny; Bitcoin reserve under consideration Fred Peterson from Punchbowl News asked Sacks whether crypto-specific AML measures were on the table. Sacks responded cautiously. “We’re open to discussions,” he said, “but this isn’t just about digital assets. Bad actors exist in all financial systems.” One of the more intriguing moments came when Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schwanberger asked about Trump’s campaign trail promise to explore a Bitcoin reserve. Sacks confirmed that: “The president instructed us to look into it. We’re still waiting for some key officials to be confirmed, but this is one of the first things we’re reviewing.” He clarified that while a Bitcoin reserve is being explored, a crypto sovereign wealth fund would require separate discussions. GT Thompson, who is Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said Congress is in sync with the White House’s goals, so any and all expectations of pto-crypto legislations are allowed.

From Dogecoin’s explosive rise to Shiba Inu’s unforgettable bull run, meme coins have consistently turned small investments into life-changing gains. And most recently, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) proved once again that meme coin magic is very much alive, making early investors massive returns in record time. But here’s the thing—crypto never sleeps, and a new golden opportunity is already knocking. With its bulls-backed community, staking rewards, and Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already live, BTFD Coin (BTFD) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s shaping up to be a movement. If you missed CHILLGUY’s rocket ride, don’t let history repeat itself—BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to join in February 2025 , gearing up to be the next legendary meme coin to watch. BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad and Staking—A Community-Backed Powerhouse BTFD Coin isn’t just about memes and hype—it’s about community-driven growth, smart tokenomics, and explosive earning potential. While CHILLGUY had its run, BTFD’s Bulls Squad is setting a new standard for meme coin engagement and rewards. The Bulls Squad is a referral program designed to bring early believers massive rewards. Think of it like this: you refer friends, they buy BTFD, and you earn free tokens. It’s simple, it’s lucrative, and it’s already making waves. Imagine stacking up tokens just by bringing in more people to the movement—it’s like growing your own crypto empire before the token even lists! But that’s not all. BTFD Coin also features a Play-to-Earn game that went live on January 1st, 2025, letting users battle, trade, and earn tokens while having fun. And if staking is more your style, BTFD offers a whopping 90% APY, making it one of the best new meme coins to join in February 2025, offering one of the best passive income opportunities in the meme coin market today. Now, let’s talk numbers—Stage 14 is here, and BTFD is currently sitting at just $0.00016 per token. But this price won’t stick around for long. With over $5.93 million already raised, 69 billion tokens sold, and more than 10,200 bullish holders, the BTFD army is only getting stronger. How big could BTFD get? Let’s do the math. Listing price is $0.0006 and the projected price after launch is $0.006. If you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.00016, you’d get 62.5 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its predicted post-launch price of $0.006, that stash would be worth a massive $375,000! That’s enough to wipe out debt, put a down payment on a house, or even buy a Tesla. But to catch this wave, you’ve got to act fast. The price is set to increase with every stage, and with demand surging, the chance to grab BTFD at these low levels won’t last. How to Buy BTFD Coin? Set up your bullish wallet – Get MetaMask or Trust Wallet and secure your keys. Load up with BNB or ETH – You’ll need these to swap for $BTFD. Connect your wallet – Head to the presale page and get ready. Buy BTFD – Select your purchase amount and confirm. Receive your BTFD – Tokens will be claimable before listing. Stay updated – Staked rewards and game earnings will vest after launch.

With its laid-back branding, massive community engagement, and a dedicated meme culture, CHILLGUY attracted thousands of investors who saw their portfolios skyrocket.

The hype is building, the numbers are solid, and the Bulls Squad is turning early believers into crypto heavyweights.

The price dropped over 9% in just a few hours, hitting a low of $91,530, only to bounce back by more than 12% following reports that President Trump is negotiating with Mexico and Canada to lift tariffs. This shift in sentiment quickly fueled renewed optimism across the market. Related Reading: Solana Retraces TRUMP Meme Pump Gains – But Technicals Suggest A $300 Run Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s resilience amid uncertainty. He noted that BTC still looks much stronger than anything else in the market, maintaining a solid uptrend when viewed from a broader perspective. Despite the aggressive sell-off, Bitcoin remains structurally sound, with strong demand levels preventing deeper corrections. With BTC trading back above key levels, investors are watching closely to see if the cryptocurrency can sustain this momentum and push toward all-time highs. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can solidify its position as the dominant asset in the market or if further volatility will test its strength again. For now, Bitcoin appears to be leading the market recovery, proving its resilience once more. Bitcoin Holding Bullish Price Action Despite recent volatility and aggressive selling pressure, Bitcoin continues to show strength compared to altcoins, proving its dominance in the market. While many altcoins struggle to recover, BTC has rebounded quickly from its lows, reinforcing its position as the leading asset. Yesterday’s price action further confirmed that Bitcoin is still in control, and the long-anticipated altseason may be delayed until altcoins can catch up with BTC’s momentum. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s resilience. He noted that BTC is much stronger than anything else in the market and still looks perfectly fine when zooming out. According to Daan, Bitcoin’s demand remains significantly higher than other assets, especially during times of uncertainty. This is evident in the recent market movement, where BTC recovered swiftly while most altcoins remained stagnant or continued to drop. Daan’s analysis reveals that Bitcoin is currently trading within a defined range, with an all-time high (ATH) of $109K at the upper boundary and strong support at the $90K level. As long as BTC holds within this range, the potential for another breakout remains high. If bulls manage to push BTC above the ATH, a new bullish phase will begin, potentially leaving altcoins further behind. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Another key factor driving Bitcoin’s dominance is institutional interest. The recent data from major on-chain analytics platforms reveals that Bitcoin accumulation remains strong among whales, with large holders continuing to add BTC despite market uncertainty. Unlike previous market cycles, where retail investors drove price surges, this rally appears to be fueled by institutions and long-term holders, making it more sustainable. Testing Key Demand Levels Bitcoin is testing crucial liquidity below the $100K mark, currently trading at $99,400 and attempting to find a strong footing before its next move. Price action remains highly unpredictable and volatile, with investors closely watching key levels for signs of a potential breakout or further downside. For BTC to confirm short-term strength, it must reclaim the $100K mark and hold it as support. This level is a psychological and technical barrier that, once secured, could trigger renewed bullish momentum. If Bitcoin struggles to maintain this level, further consolidation below $100K could follow, delaying any breakout attempts. The $98K level is another crucial support zone. As long as BTC stays above this mark, a push back above $100K remains highly likely. Losing this level could lead to a deeper retracement, testing lower demand zones before another attempt to reclaim higher levels.

HTX was formerly known as Huobi. The disclosure came in the middle of a string of posts on X touting the Decentralized USD (USDD), a stablecoin backed by subsidiaries of Sun’s Tron platform. In one of the posts, Sun says (translated from Chinese) that “even if Li Lin uses it, he can leave unscathed; USDD will give him every penny of the interest!” In the post, Sun continues by saying Li “concealed due diligence materials, creating a $30 million hole internally.” Furthermore: “I discovered it, exposed it, and after being exposed, he [Li] tried to weasel out of it and didn’t pay a cent.” Sun ended up lending the company money to cover the loss. “Fortunately, I had money back then,” he concluded. Sun has been posting heavily about USDD as Tron plans to issue a new version of USDD — USDD 2.0 — that will offer 20% APY on staking. Sun and Li’s numerous issues This is not the first issue that has arisen with the October 2022 sale of Li’s share in Huobi. In May 2023, Sun alleged that Li’s brother Li Wei obtained a large quantity of Huobi’s native HT token at no cost “through improper means” in a now-deleted X post. Sun promised to recover and destroy Li Wei’s HT, despite also claiming that Lin Wei sold the token. In June 2023, Li Lin filed a suit against Huobi Global in Hong Kong, claiming that his X-Spot company owned the rights to the Huobi trademark, despite the sale of his shares. According to Bloomberg, Li Lin went on to co-found New Huo Technology Holdings digital asset service platform. Harvard has called him the 39th most generous philanthropist in China. Justin Sun stays busy with finance and art The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Sun in March 2023 for the sale of purported crypto securities. Sun has invested over $30 million in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, where he already served as an adviser. Sun is probably best known to the public for his purchase for $6.2 million of a conceptual artwork that consisted of a banana taped to wall. He went on to eat the banana.

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

Starting at approximately $0.52 in November 2024, XRP’s price jumped to around $2.46 by early 2025, marking an increase of nearly 373%. It’s currently sitting at $2.65, which means more than a 400% increase over one year. This gave rise to all kinds of speculation about whether XRP would achieve a big breakout against BTC. If we take a look at the monthly price chart (courtesy of CoinMarketCap), it’s noticeable that XRP has been performing very well. However, this can always change when it comes to cryptocurrencies, though some experts and well-known traders have a positive stance regarding future developments. Expert Opinion: Bullish, but Cautious For instance, a few days ago, Peter Brandt said on X that even though he doesn’t care about XRP, there is no other way right now to define the chart other than a bull flag.

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 345,000 YouTube subscribers that Sui ( SUI ) may be repeating a historic pattern that could lead to a collapse. According to Pizzino, SUI saw an overbalance in time and price following its collapse to a low of $2.38. Pizzino explains that the overbalance means SUI went down longer in price and further in time than any corrective period it witnessed during this bull market. With the current setup, the trader says SUI may be following in the footsteps of its April to August 2024 price action when it initially crashed from about $2 to below $1 before witnessing another deep corrective move. “[Sui is] trying to hold the 50% level similar to what it did last time [in April 2024]. Okay, that was a 58% decline into this freak bottom ($0.43 in August 2024). So see that dump into this level. It’s almost exactly the same guys.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube He says if Sui cannot hold $2 as support on the daily chart it may dip to $1.60 or even lower, which would be in line with the 2024 pattern. “So if you get these next couple of panic lows, I’d be looking somewhere around back to $1.60, maybe even $1.10, $1.20 at those previous tops, maybe back down into that zone [around $0.73]. But we won’t worry about those yet. Let’s see if it actually gets back down to the $2 level.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube SUI is trading for $3.60 at time of writing, up 14% in the last 24 hours. ?

As 2025 unfolds, Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) remain popular choices, but a new contender, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is making waves with its AI-driven decentralized wallet and smart trading solutions. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale already attracting major interest, the question is clear: Will Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) keep up, or is WLTQ the next big thing? Let’s dive in and uncover what 2025 holds for these three altcoins and why WallitIQ (WLQT) could be your best bet right now. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Promising Future: The Presale Surge And What It Means For 2025 The ongoing presale for WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been a success, with the presale rapidly gaining traction. Investors are flocking to secure the token before the price rises further. With the presale gaining momentum, the future looks promising, and the project is gearing up for a major leap in 2025. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is a clear indicator of the project’s growing popularity and potential. With more people flocking to join, the presale continues to raise substantial funds, and with its ongoing pace, experts predict that WLTQ could see a substantial surge in value by 2025. As more investors jump on board, the presale success is just the beginning . This decentralized wallet is designed to improve the DeFi experience, making it easier for users to trade, invest, and participate in crypto markets. Features like exclusive airdrops, community rewards, AI chatbots, and performance tracking make the platform more than just a wallet; it’s a fully integrated ecosystem designed for both crypto enthusiasts and serious investors. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is redefining the way people interact with digital assets through its AI-powered, decentralized crypto wallet. With its focus on security, speed, and user-friendly features, the platform includes an MVP of Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App offering faster and safer crypto transactions. Additionally, transaction security is guaranteed through a Solidproof audit, affirming the safety of its ecosystem. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) tokenomics are designed for long-term growth and sustainability. With a limited supply of WLTQ tokens, early investors have a prime opportunity to secure their stake in the ecosystem. As the presale nears completion, WLTQ is poised to launch on major exchanges and is already listed on CoinMarketCap at a price of $0.0420 , increasing its visibility in the crypto market . XRP’s Path To New Heights In 2025 In 2024, XRP (XRP) broke its resistance and traded above $2, fueled by market optimism. Many experts predict a bullish 2025, with XRP (XRP) potentially reaching $5 or even $7 by mid-year. Key drivers of this growth include the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, bringing clarity to investors. Additionally, Ripple’s new RLUSD stablecoin is gaining momentum, and the potential approval of an XRP (XRP) ETF could attract institutional interest. With major players like Canary Capitals seeking approval, this could drive XRP (XRP) to new price heights, solidifying its position in the future of finance. Dogecoin’s Future: Potential For Growth Or Decline By 2025 Dogecoin, initially created as a meme coin, has evolved into a widely recognized cryptocurrency. As of the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.33 . Analysts have mixed predictions for its future; some anticipate that if social media hype and community support persist, Dogecoin could surpass $1. Conversely, a decline in interest might see it revert to around $0.10. However, not everyone is optimistic. Another big Dogecoin price prediction says the coin could crash down to $0.10 by 2025 if meme-driven momentum evaporates. Dogecoin fans shrug that off, claiming that a loyal community can push any dip back up, but some watchers say new tokens like WallitIQ (WLTQ) might lure investors away. What’s Next For Crypto Investors? As we look ahead to 2025, the crypto landscape is full of potential , but only a few projects stand out from the crowd. While Dogecoin and XRP (XRP) may have had their moments, they’re facing increasing competition from projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ), a game-changer in the world of decentralized finance. With its presale already generating massive excitement, WallitIQ (WLTQ) represents a promising investment opportunity, and this is the perfect time to get in early and secure your share of the tokens.

MANTRA has sharply bounced back from a significant price point, doubling its value for all holders. A recent review of Ethereum prices suggests a potential fall to $2,913 if it slips below $3,023. Web3Bay stands out by reducing doubts entirely. It hands control over its holders with trustless smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring openness. The platform’s presale success, raising over $1 million with 280 million tokens sold, signals strong market adoption. Web3Bay isn’t just attracting users; it’s drawing them into a transformative future. Mantra Surges 60%: What’s Next? The 60% increase in MANTRA demonstrates a strong recovery from an essential support level, securing 100% profits for all its holders. This achievement boosts investor confidence as MANTRA utilizes the latest technological innovations. Transaction activities on top exchanges like Binance ($746.8M) and OKX highlight vibrant market participation. With a positive market outlook and solid technological backing, MANTRA’s rise seems to have strong market and technological support. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Battle for $3,000 Current Ethereum price analyses indicate significant stress, with a recent 6.8% drop pushing it near the crucial $3,000 threshold. The market has seen $850 million in liquidations, emphasizing a growing bearish view. Data on Ethereum derivatives points to caution, with a decline in open interest and a drop in the long-to-short ratio, signaling waning confidence. If Ethereum breaks below $3,023, it could test $2,913, though any rebound around this level could provide temporary relief. How Web3Bay Ensures Trustless, Profitable, and Fair E-Commerce Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce with a safer, more effective, and cost-friendly platform powered by smart contracts. These contracts execute on their own, ensuring precision and fairness without the possibility of external tampering. By committing to relinquish ownership after distributing non-team tokens, Web3Bay guarantees a system free from central control, promoting transparency and fairness. At the core of Web3Bay’s operational model are the 3BAY token holders, who play an active role in guiding the platform’s decisions. They have a say in everything from fee structures to new feature integrations, making every important decision community-driven. Web3Bay is set to evolve into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enhancing its flexibility and maintaining its user-focused ethos. This transition is already garnering global interest. The presale for this web3 crypto has crossed the $1 million mark, with over 280 million tokens claimed. Investors getting in before the close of Stage 4 at a presale price of $0.004562625 per token have the prospect of a 4,200% gain upon launch, with a target price of $0.1959 per token. Final Say! The 60% surge in Mantra underscores the potential of robust technology and solid fundamentals, whereas Ethereum’s price faces increasing uncertainty. With substantial trading on Binance alone, Mantra’s climb reflects a solid foundation. Conversely, Ethereum risks falling to $2,913 without strong support at $3,023. While one shows stability, the other is uncertainty, yet Web3Bay provides a unique narrative. With an upcoming price increase at launch, early investors in this web3 crypto might realize a 4,200% return. However, with limited time left in presale Stage 4, timing is critical for those looking to invest.

After briefly rising above the $100,000 price mark on Tuesday, BTC has since fallen back and now hovers just above $99,000. The rebound that initially raised market sentiment appears to have been short-lived, as the cryptocurrency struggles to regain the upward momentum needed to break through higher resistance levels. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Price Crash Could Be a Buying Opportunity for Big Players Bitcoin Smart DCA Flashes—What This Means While BTC faces these ups and downs, Darkfost, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlighted a potential opportunity for investors employing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. According to Darkfost, the Smart DCA indicator was recently triggered, suggesting that current price levels may be a “favorable” entry point for those looking to accumulate BTC over time. Darkfost explained that by comparing Bitcoin’s average price to its short-term realized price—ranging from one week to one month—this indicator aims to identify optimal zones for long-term accumulation. The analyst added: When executed properly, a DCA strategy can generate substantial returns in the short, mid, or long term, depending on the investor’s goals. However, this indicator should be used alongside other metrics and a broader market analysis for optimal accuracy and effectiveness. Signs of Bullish Momentum Emerge While short-term price fluctuations have rattled some investors, other analysts point to underlying trends that hint at bullish potential. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Onatt, observed that buyer activity is beginning to outweigh selling pressure. Related Reading: After The Bitcoin Crash: Will It Rise Or Drop Again? 5 Key Indicators Using data from Coinbase, Onatt noted a visible premium indicating strong demand for Bitcoin, even in the face of recent volatility. Furthermore, negative funding rates—driven by approximately $2 billion in long liquidations—suggest a market environment where buyers are taking advantage of discounted prices to position themselves for a potential upward movement. Onatt also explained: Bitcoin’s upward momentum remains likely as long as USDT dominance stays below 4.65%, signaling continued market confidence and potential for further recovery. Adding to this sentiment, analyst Ali identified a critical demand zone for Bitcoin between $96,475 and $99,360. According to Ali, as long as this range holds as a support level, the market outlook favors the bulls. A breakout above the $102,350 to $103,900 supply zone could further strengthen the bullish case, potentially setting the stage for a sustained recovery. #Bitcoin $BTC has reclaimed a critical demand zone between $96,475 and $99,360 as support. As long as this level holds, the odds favor the bulls; especially if the $102,350–$103,900 supply wall breaks. pic.twitter.com/FLpwRqYVuu — Ali (@ali_charts) February 4, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-05 02:00:45

This abysmal performance has seen crypto analysts predict that DOGE could continue plunging. As a result, investors are flocking to RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging AI altcoin that has raised over $12.73 million during its ongoing public presale. Why are Dogecoin (DOGE) investors pivoting toward RCO Finance (RCOF)? Let’s find out! Dogecoin Price Dumps 25% In A Week: What’s Next? Dogecoin has performed dismally over the past week, tumbling by double digits. On January 27, the Dogecoin price was trading at around $0.3335. After trading around this range for days, the Dogecoin price experienced a sharp drop on February 2. This slump came after Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the $100,000 support level, triggering a bearish trend in the altcoin market. The resulting downtrend saw Dogecoin (DOGE) trade as low as $0.2477 on February 3. Notably, this price means Dogecoin (DOGE) has plunged 25% in a week. Moreover, experts expect the Dogecoin price to plummet further as investors migrate to tokens with better prospects. RCO Finance: A Trading And Investment Hub With AI Features With the Dogecoin price grappling with the renewed bearish trend in the crypto market, investors are searching for alternative investments to hedge against further losses. To address this need, investors are flocking to RCO Finance , a budding DeFi platform that supports over 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). By combining the crypto and TradFi industries, RCO Finance lets you create a robust investment portfolio that can withstand the current bear market. While this offering is impressive, it mainly complements RCO Finance’s top feature, an AI-powered robo advisor. The robo advisor is RCO Finance’s flagship feature because it leverages machine learning and advanced algorithms to analyze data from prominent sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. With the carefully curated data, the robo advisor is able to offer custom investment insights based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. These recommendations can tell you when to enter, double down, or exit positions for the highest possible returns and minimal risk exposure. For example, the robo advisor could have suggested purchasing Dogecoin (DOGE) before the Q4 2024 rally. Also, the robo advisor could have prompted you to sell before the Dogecoin price crashed. RCO Finance designed its robo advisor with you in mind. To this end, RCO Finance allows you to customize your trading station, giving the robo advisor the power to trade on your behalf. This feature saves you the time and effort needed to find high-potential investments early. Thus far, RCO Finance has launched its beta platform , allowing you to interact with the robo advisor and other features early. Notably, RCO Finance has rolled out its beta platform while still running its presale. This milestone explains why this budding DeFi platform has already onboarded over 10,000 users. RCOF: A One-Of-A-Kind Investment Opportunity As the Dogecoin price continues crashing, investors are shifting to RCOF to hedge against more losses. DOGE investors and other crypto enthusiasts are rushing to buy RCOF because it is a safe investment. It is worth noting that SolidProof, a leader in blockchain security, audited RCOF’s smart contract and found it was vulnerability-free. The crypto space is also buzzing about RCOF because of its robust tokenomics. Notably, RCOF is a deflationary token with a maximum supply of 800 million tokens. This tokenomics model positions RCOF for tremendous growth as the RCO Finance ecosystem scales. As of February 3, RCOF was in Stage 5 of its presale. RCOF’s price during this stage is $0.1. This price is set to jump to $0.13 when RCOF kickstarts Stage 6. Also, RCOF is poised to generate more gains for Stage 5 investors, seeing as its listing price is $0.4-$0.6. Astonishingly, experts foresee RCOF surging 12,000% in Q1 2025. In doing so, RCOF will have mirrored the 12,800% climb in the Dogecoin price in 2021. This forecast explains why you should snag this rare opportunity and join the RCOF presale today!

NEAR Protocol has faced significant price fluctuations, with its value dropping over 12% in the past session, reflecting the market’s volatility. Despite this, analysts see NEAR as a long-term blockchain contender due to its ability to recover rapidly from market downturns. Polkadot continues to establish itself as a multichain champion, enabling different blockchains to communicate and interact. By introducing parachains, it has given developers the freedom to create custom blockchains that enhance blockchain efficiency and adoption. Among these strong contenders, Qubetics stands out with its innovative Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This project is tackling the inefficiencies of traditional financial systems, offering seamless interoperability and a transparent, secure trading environment. With a thriving presale, selling over 460 million tokens and raising $11.9 million, Qubetics is rapidly becoming a must-watch crypto project. Qubetics – Revolutionizing Real World Asset Tokenization Traditional financial markets often struggle with inefficiencies, high transaction fees, and slow settlements. Qubetics is set to change that by introducing a blockchain-based Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. By allowing businesses and individuals to tokenize tangible assets such as real estate, fine art, and commodities, Qubetics is opening up new investment opportunities. How Qubetics’ Tokenization Marketplace Works Imagine owning a fraction of high-value real estate without needing massive capital. Qubetics allows investors to buy, sell, and trade tokenized assets seamlessly, democratizing access to valuable assets that were once exclusive to large financial institutions. For businesses, this platform offers greater liquidity by enabling quicker asset transfers without relying on traditional banking intermediaries. This means companies can raise funds by selling tokenized shares of their assets while investors gain exposure to diversified, high-value markets. TICSScan – Empowering Blockchain Transparency A vital part of the Qubetics ecosystem is TICSScan, a blockchain explorer that provides in-depth insights into transaction activity, validator performance, and smart contract management. This transparency ensures that every transaction on the Qubetics blockchain is verifiable, enhancing trust within the ecosystem. Qubetics Presale – A Golden Opportunity Currently, in its 20th stage, the Qubetics presale has already attracted over 18,300 holders. With tokens priced at $0.0667, analysts are optimistic about its growth trajectory, expecting significant adoption upon its mainnet launch. Polkadot – The Multichain Champion Polkadot is redefining blockchain interoperability, allowing multiple chains to work together in a unified ecosystem. Instead of separate blockchains operating in silos, Polkadot’s parachain structure connects them, ensuring seamless data sharing and scalability. Parachains enable projects to create custom blockchains optimized for specific use cases while still benefiting from Polkadot’s security and scalability. This means that DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise applications can build on Polkadot without facing the same congestion issues as single-chain networks. With a rapidly expanding developer community and major partnerships, Polkadot is one of the most robust blockchain networks today. As enterprises and governments seek scalable blockchain solutions, Polkadot is positioning itself as a leader in real-world blockchain integration. NEAR Protocol – A Scalable Blockchain for the Future NEAR Protocol has gained traction as one of the most developer-friendly blockchain platforms. Despite recent price volatility, NEAR continues to show resilience with significant recovery patterns. This Layer-1 blockchain is designed for speed, low fees, and scalability. By utilizing sharding technology, NEAR ensures that transactions are processed efficiently without causing network congestion. This makes it an ideal blockchain for DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and decentralized marketplaces. While NEAR has experienced recent price fluctuations, its ability to recover quickly shows strong market demand. As adoption increases, this blockchain is expected to maintain its status as one of the top cryptos to join now. Why Real World Asset Tokenization is the Future With growing adoption of blockchain technology, real-world asset tokenization is set to disrupt traditional finance. Qubetics is leading this movement, ensuring seamless interoperability between physical and digital assets. As blockchain transparency becomes increasingly essential, TICSScan plays a crucial role in providing users with real-time insights into transactions and network activity. Conclusion – The Future of Crypto is Here For those looking to invest in transformative blockchain projects, Qubetics , Polkadot, and NEAR Protocol stand out as the top cryptos to join now. Whether it’s Qubetics’ asset tokenization marketplace, Polkadot’s multichain capabilities, or NEAR’s scalability solutions, these projects are shaping the future of decentralized finance.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.10 Market cap $907,369,647.51 Trading volume $62,296,802.87 Circulating supply 1,028,555,202 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.8428 24-hour high $0.9342 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.27% 50-day SMA $1.272 14-Day RSI 32.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.941 Tezos price analysis: XTZ shows signs of recovery despite broader bearish momentum TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 5% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.774, and resistance is at $1.109. Tezos shows signs of short-term recovery. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ continues to trend lower The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on February 5 shows a continued dip in the price. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.88, below the 20-day SMA and just above its critical support of around $0.774. XTZ continues to trend lower The MACD indicator, with a bearish crossover, also confirms the selling pressure observed on the chart. The RSI (33.51) reflects an oversold market, indicating strong selling pressure and a possible rebound. If buyer interest does not return soon, XTZ could break below $0.774. The coin must break past resistance at $1.109 for a recovery to be confirmed. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Slight buying pressure is present for XTZ The 4-hour chart shows a slight recovery, trading above the lower Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands are slightly expanding, suggesting increased volatility in the short term and possible recovery. Slight buying pressure is present for XTZ The CMF indicator shows some capital inflow and mild buying pressure, although limited. On the other hand, the MFI suggests a balance between sellers and buyers, indicating potential consolidation. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.790, it might move toward lower support levels. XTZ must move back above the middle Bollinger Band at $0.905 to confirm a recovery. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.0404 SELL SMA 5 $1.0611 SELL SMA 10 $1.1080 SELL SMA 21 $1.1870 SELL SMA 50 $1.2729 SELL SMA 100 $1.1756 SELL SMA 200 $0.9411 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.1551 SELL EMA 5 $1.1987 SELL EMA 10 $1.2557 SELL EMA 21 $1.3073 SELL EMA 50 $1.2899 SELL EMA 100 $1.1612 SELL EMA 200 $1.0313 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ is struggling to break past resistance around $0.9 – $1, which it needs to clear to continue its recovery. However, with the capital inflow observed in the short term, the price could trend higher and may even break past $1.10. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after a failed attempt at the 0.915 resistance level—a move spurred by sellers disposing of their coins and taking a profit. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover?

The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286.

These two projects have caught the attention of traders, but another rising star is quickly making waves— Lightchain AI , which has now raised $14 million in its presale, positioning itself as a top contender for high-growth investments in 2025. As established players like Solana and Kaspa ride the bullish momentum, Lightchain AI is proving that early-stage investments can deliver massive ROI, making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens in the market. Solana and Kaspa – Altcoin Market Leaders Solana (SOL) has been a dominant force in the crypto market, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. With increasing adoption from both developers and institutions, Solana’s price surge reflects the growing demand for scalable Layer-1 blockchains. Meanwhile, Kaspa (KAS) has gained traction for its blockDAG technology, which enhances transaction throughput without compromising decentralization. This innovation has fueled its rapid rise, making it one of the strongest performers in the altcoin sector. While these projects continue to attract investor interest, Lightchain AI is emerging as a serious competitor, offering a unique combination of AI-powered blockchain technology that could drive long-term adoption. Lightchain AI – Newcomer Making an Impact Lightchain AI stands out from traditional altcoins by bridging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, introducing decentralized AI processing with a focus on innovation. Its privacy-preserving AI infrastructure ensures secure and efficient data computations, making it a unique solution in the evolving tech landscape. By addressing the growing demand for AI-driven blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is carving a niche in the industry. A key feature is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which replaces traditional mining with AI computations. Network nodes perform tasks such as model training and inference, which are cryptographically verified for accuracy before being added to the blockchain. This innovative system ensures efficiency and reliability while pushing the boundaries of blockchain capabilities. The Future of High-Growth Crypto Investments Solana and Kaspa are still leading the way in the altcoin market, but Lightchain AI’s explosive presale growth is turning heads as a potential top early-stage investment for 2025. Lightchain AI’s cutting-edge parallelized architecture lets multiple AI tasks run at the same time, reducing latency and boosting performance. This makes it perfect for real-world applications. With its presale already hitting an impressive $14 million, Lightchain AI is building strong market confidence and earning its spot as a rising star in the competitive blockchain space. Thanks to its innovative tech and fast-growing momentum, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming one to watch in the next wave of high-growth crypto assets.

Back then, a flurry of tweets and memes turned casual holders into overnight millionaires. Today, a fresh contender, RCO Finance, is catching buzz, claiming it can top DOGE’s success with AI-driven innovation. If you missed out on Dogecoin’s explosive run or are simply tired of waiting for a second wave, you’re not alone. Many DOGE faithful are now exploring RCO Finance to invest in a project with more than just meme appeal. Keep reading to see why these two tokens are being compared—and why RCOF might reshape your crypto game. Dogecoin’s Legacy and the 2021 Rally Glow Dogecoin soared in 2021 thanks to viral social media hype and celebrity endorsements. Prices leaped faster than most experts ever imagined, going on a 21,000% rally and creating a new generation of crypto believers. Even after a cooldown, DOGE remains a household name, albeit one that rides market sentiment. Some holders are waiting for another big run, but things have quieted. Meme-driven mania can resurface, yet there’s no guarantee lightning will strike twice. That uncertainty has Dogecoin investors scanning for new opportunities, hoping to replicate the thrilling upswing that defined DOGE’s 2021 Rally. RCO Finance: A New Vision for DeFi While Dogecoin relies on community buzz, RCO Finance stands on real-world utility and AI-driven insights. Thanks to a non-KYC approach, this project lets you buy assets like shares and real estate straight with crypto. Audited by SolidProof , the platform has drawn over 10k users who are impressed by its transparency. The AI-powered Robo Advisor is at the core, which helps you make more intelligent trades by evaluating live market data. Suppose You spot a trending altcoin that seems ready to pop. You consult the Robo Advisor, which has been monitoring trading volumes and social media buzz. It reveals that network congestion is currently high, pushing up gas fees. Rather than diving in and wasting money on fees, the AI advises you to wait a few hours. Later, when traffic dips, you execute your trade at a lower cost and keep more profits. This hands-on approach shows why many believe RCO Finance could match or surpass the hype Dogecoin experienced during its 2021 Rally. All this is available to test on RCOF’s Beta Platform , a rare treat for an ongoing presale. Presale Details and Future Potential RCOF is in its fifth presale phase, priced at $0.1. It’s already raised close to $13 million, reflecting strong interest from those chasing the next major breakout. Some analysts hint at a 1,000x gain once it hits leading exchanges, and rumors of a $100K giveaway only add to the excitement. Add 50x leverage options and a 30% bonus for early birds, and you can see why investors are flocking to RCO Finance. While Dogecoin’s success was primarily meme-powered, RCOF builds its case on real features, AI technology, and a robust roadmap designed to stand the test of time. Ready to Embrace the Next Big Thing? Dogecoin’s 2021 Rally will forever stand as a highlight in crypto history. But RCO Finance offers more sustainable prospects, guided by data and AI. If you’ve been waiting for a coin that doesn’t rely on social media whimsy, RCOF might be your answer. The presale won’t last forever, and if the hype is justified, early participants could see massive rewards. Maybe this is your chance to jump aboard a project combining cutting-edge AI with a real plan to change DeFi. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by—especially if you missed Dogecoin’s legendary surge.

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

The days of shrugging off these so-called “joke” tokens are long gone. Just ask those who got in early on Notcoin—life looks pretty different when your meme coin investment pays off. But here’s the real question: what if you missed those golden opportunities? What if you could go back in time and grab those early presale prices before they exploded? Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the meme coin that’s turning heads and sending shockwaves across the crypto space. With its viral presale gaining momentum and an eye-watering 90% APY on staking, BTFD is offering a second chance for those who feel like they missed out. The time to act is now because, as history shows, meme coins with strong hype and community backing tend to skyrocket once they hit the open market. . Notcoin: The One That Got Away Notcoin was one of those projects that flew under the radar at first but quickly became one of the most talked-about meme coins of its time. What started as a fun, gamified token quickly turned into a high-return investment for early adopters. Those who got in at the ground floor saw their holdings multiply, leaving latecomers regretting their hesitation. This is the classic story of crypto investing—blink, and you miss it. By the time the mainstream caught onto Notcoin’s potential, prices had already surged. The biggest winners? Those who had the guts to jump in early. The rest? Well, they’re the ones kicking themselves, wishing they had seized the opportunity when it was dirt cheap. But here’s the thing: history has a way of repeating itself, and if you felt the sting of missing out on Notcoin, there’s good news—BTFD Coin is here, and it’s looking even more promising. Unlike Notcoin, which relied primarily on hype, BTFD backs its momentum with tangible staking rewards and a presale that’s already raising eyebrows. The writing’s on the wall: early adopters of BTFD could be looking at the same kind of gains, if not bigger. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Notcoin’s success is a lesson—those who wait, miss out. And with BTFD following a similar trajectory, the question is: are you going to make the same mistake twice? 2. BTFD Coin: The New King of Meme Coin Gains If you missed out on Notcoin, consider this your redemption shot.

Those who got in early have already seen their initial investment multiply, and with BTFD’s listing price set at $0.0006, the upside potential remains massive. Unlike Notcoin, where gains relied purely on market speculation, BTFD is rewarding its investors even before launch with lucrative staking returns. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s doing everything right.

This restructuring is one of the first concrete moves by President Trump’s administration to diminish the regulation of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Early executive orders of Trump’s administration aimed to promote crypto growth and prevent over-regulation. Some of the changes include the fact that some members of the crypto enforcement team are being moved to different divisions within the SEC, one high-profile lawyer has been taken out of the enforcement division, and one could say a demotion. The regulatory firm did not comment on the restructuring when asked. Trump shifts to crypto support as SEC leadership overhaul signals new regulatory approach During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump, a previous cryptocurrency skeptic, changed his position to support digital assets and was endorsed by the crypto community, which had considered former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as an enemy. The current acting SEC chair, Mark T. Uyeda, has shown crypto-friendly tendencies and has made several notable alterations to the agency’s leadership, including forming a team to review the SEC’s tactics regarding digital assets. This team is headed by Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner and a known crypto advocate, who has recently expressed disappointment with the watchdog’s previous handling of crypto regulation. The team calls it legally ambiguous and unworkable. Peirce wants to develop a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and helps avoid fraud. Uncertainty looms over crypto enforcement as SEC reshuffles It is currently unknown how this downsizing will affect ongoing enforcement actions, including a high-profile case launched against Coinbase in 2023. The regulator accused Coinbase of providing exchange services without being registered with the SEC, which was in violation of federal securities laws. However, the company has argued that many digital assets are not securities — a position the crypto industry has rejected. The crypto enforcement unit at the SEC was created during Trump’s first term and was greatly enhanced during Gensler’s tenure. When Biden took over in May of this year, the agency had already essentially doubled the size of the team responsible for cracking down on fraudulent and unregistered crypto-asset offerings and had brought more than one hundred enforcement actions. During that time, Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a lawyer with strong crypto industry ties, to succeed Gensler as SEC chair. At the time of this writing, awaiting Senate Banking Committee confirmation is Atkins, an advocate of a less stringent regulatory regimen.

ETH is showing positive signs but faces many hurdles near the $2,880 level. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,550 zone. The price is trading below $2,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,880 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Faces Hurdles Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it dropped heavily below $2,500, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH tested the $2,120 zone and recently started a recovery wave. The price was able to surpass the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels. It even climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,402 swing high to the $2,127 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $2,900 zone. The price failed to clear the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,402 swing high to the $2,127 swing low. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,800 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,880 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,120 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,640 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

However, the US proceeded with its 10% tariffs on China, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The escalation has pushed BTC back below the critical $100,000 price level. Bitcoin Suffers Amid Trade Wars After a volatile 24 hours filled with uncertainty surrounding US trade tariffs on Mexico and Canada, BTC experienced a short-lived relief rally to $102,000. This came after US President Donald Trump announced a 30-day delay in imposing tariffs on the two North American nations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Shows Market Far From Overheating – Details However, today’s implementation of US tariffs on China triggered a sharp downturn, causing BTC to break below the $100,000 level. In response, China’s Ministry of Finance announced new countermeasures. Starting February 10, China will impose an additional 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on agricultural equipment, crude oil, and certain vehicles. Additionally, Beijing has accused the US of violating World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations with its one-sided tariff policies. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce also stated that it would tighten export controls on key raw materials, including molybdenum, indium, bismuth, tellurium, and tungsten, citing national security concerns. With trade tensions escalating between the US and China, analysts predict heightened volatility in the crypto market in the coming days. Well-known crypto strategist Michael van de Poppe shared his outlook: Bitcoin bounced back swiftly and is currently acting within the range. I assume we’ll see new ATHs in February and it’s quite normal to correct after such a strong bounce. Volatility through the roof, but, as long as Bitcoin remains above $93K, a new ATH is likely. Meanwhile, crypto trader and investor Phoenix suggested that BTC could establish a new trading range amid the ongoing trade war. However, history suggests that heightened tariffs could spell trouble for cryptocurrencies. Web3 enthusiast merts.eth pointed out in an X post that BTC plummeted 65% in 2018 when Trump first initiated a trade war with China. The effects were not limited to digital assets, as the S&P 500 also dropped 12% in the weeks following the implementation of tariffs. More Downside For BTC? As Bitcoin struggles to hold the $100,000 price level, concerns are mounting about another potential breakdown in price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out that if BTC fails to hold the $97,190 support level, there could be more pain for the top digital asset.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. Can WIF attain new heights in 2025? Will Dogwifhat reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.831 Market cap $831,938,350.39 Trading volume $498,378,469.08 Circulating supply 998,841,559.49 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.8525 24-hour low $0.7486 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 21.40% 50-day SMA $1.761 14-Day RSI 27.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 8/30 (27%) 200-Day SMA $2.21 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: Bulls re-enter the market as green candles surface TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis suggests a recovery despite broader bear market. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $1.173. WIF’s support level is present at $0.747. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF trades below 20-day SMA, slight uptrend appears The 1-day chart for WIF on February 5 shows the coin trading below the 20-day SMA at $0.998, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests ongoing bearish momentum, confirming that the slight bullish turn is not solid enough. WIF trades below 20-day SMA, slight uptrend appears The RSI at 29.78 indicates the asset is in oversold territory, hinting at a potential bounce if buyers solidify their position. A break above $0.998 could signal further upside, while rejection risks a fall to support near $0.747.

TrumpCoin (DJT) is one such project that skyrocketed on the day of Trump’s inauguration, but quickly crashed soon after. Meanwhile, the more established Pepe (PEPE) has also seen losses, highlighting the inherent volatility within the meme coin space. Many investors are now seeking utility-focused projects and Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a top choice. This powerful PayFi solution takes a pragmatic approach to dealing with issues in the global payments space, offering a modern alternative to outdated systems. So why is Remittix seeing so much attention and how will TrumpCoin and Pepe perform in Q1 of 2025? TrumpCoin Continues To Decline TrumpCoin is trading at approximately $0.000277, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $43,210. The coin has seen a slight decline of about 2.57% in the past day. Since its launch in mid January, TrumpCoin experienced an initial surge, reaching a peak of $0.0024 on January 19. Early data indicates that some of the largest holders of TrumpCoin have realized substantial returns. Approximately 33% of the top 15 holders had fully exited their positions by late January, with one investor achieving a 91% return. Notably, some investors reported returns exceeding 10,000% with one reaching nearly 19,000%, while still retaining significant portions of their holdings. However, the launch of TrumpCoin has prompted mixed reactions. While some view it as an innovative venture into the crypto space, others express concerns over potential ethical and legal implications. Critics argue that such initiatives could undermine the credibility of both the cryptocurrency market and political institutions. Pepe Posts 15% Loss In 24 Hours Pepe (PEPE) has seen a steep 15% loss in the last 24 hours, plummeting down to $.00001041. Pepe is still up by 1,020% over the past year, though recent losses have brought the project’s future into question. Pepe continues to suffer from its large whale holding with roughly 47.82% of its holding base made up by whales and 52% by regular traders. This adds another layer to Pepe’s volatility with big-sell offs becoming commonplace in times of market uncertainty. Remittix (RTX): Making Crypto as Easy to Use as Cash Crypto was supposed to revolutionize finance, yet most people still cannot spend it in their day-to-day lives without great hassle. If you want to cash out, pay bills or send money abroad, you’re forced to deal with high fees, slow processing times and complicated workarounds. Ultimately, crypto isn’t as practical as it should be. Remittix (RTX) is changing that. It allows users to convert over 40 different cryptocurrencies into FIAT instantly and send the money directly to any bank account worldwide with no delays, no hidden fees, just simple, fast transactions. Whether you’re a freelancer needing to cash out your earnings, a trader looking to move profits into FIAT, or someone sending money to family across borders, Remittix makes the process effortless. The benefits go even further. 1.4 billion people worldwide don’t have access to a bank account, but many have crypto wallets through mobile apps. With Remittix, they can receive funds in digital assets and withdraw them in cash via remittance services like Western Union, breaking down financial barriers and increasing global accessibility. Remitttix Presale Booms, Surpassing $10.7 Million The Remittix (RTX) presale has taken the crypto space by storm, surpassing $10.7 million raised in record time. Tokens are currently up for grabs for just $0.0539, creating an ideal entry point for proactive investors. The project’s deep value proposition has prompted analysts to anticipate a steep 800% price rise during the presale phase alone with further growth after the launch. For those who want to push the boundaries of what is possible in PayFi, this market disruptor is not a project to sleep on in 2025.

Republican lawmakers are stepping up their efforts to bring clear rules to the crypto industry, forming a bicameral working group to push legislation on stablecoins and digital asset market structures. The move, announced on Feb. 4 at a Capitol Hill press conference, marks a coordinated effort between key House and Senate leaders to create a structured framework for crypto regulation, an issue that has remained in legal limbo for years. 🚨Chairman @RepFrenchHill : ""In the 119th Congress, we have a bicameral project for both a stablecoins bill and a regulatory framework that will bring clarity to digital assets in the United States."" Watch more📺 pic.twitter.com/HIxvssZTS5 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) February 4, 2025 The working group includes members from four major committees—the House Financial Services Committee, the House Agriculture Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, and the Senate Agriculture Committee—showing that lawmakers see crypto regulation as an issue that spans multiple sectors of financial oversight. Representative French Hill of Arkansas, along with Senators Tim Scott and John Boozman and Representative Glenn Thompson, will play leading roles in shaping these policies, drawing from existing legislative efforts while introducing new proposals.

Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott has made it clear that speed is a priority , saying he wants to push the crypto bills through the Senate within the first 100 days of the congressional session. Conversations with Democratic colleagues are already underway, raising the possibility that some elements of these bills could gain bipartisan support. At the press conference, David Sacks , Trump’s crypto and artificial intelligence czar, spoke about the broader vision for digital assets, calling this a key moment to create a “golden age” for crypto in the U.S. His role extends beyond Congress, as he is also overseeing a separate initiative within the White House to assess the possibility of a government-held Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. Trump’s executive order on Jan. 23 laid the foundation for that discussion, along with directives to prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency. For years, the lack of clear rules has driven many crypto firms to set up operations overseas, where regulations have been more clearly defined. If successful, this working group could finally give the crypto industry the clarity it has long been waiting for.

Speaking to Cointelegraph , Yun emphasized that this choice was not a limitation but a necessity , given TON’s ability to handle Telegram’s massive user base of 950 million . In January 2024 , Telegram announced that TON would be the exclusive network for its Mini Apps , sparking mixed reactions from the crypto community. However, Yun defended the move, arguing that blockchains without sharding lack the scalability for mass adoption and that alternative solutions often compromise security . Why Did Telegram Choose TON as Its Exclusive Blockchain? 1. Security & Scalability for 950 Million Users TON uses sharding , allowing it to handle Telegram’s large-scale transactions efficiently. Other blockchains may struggle with congestion and higher transaction costs . 2. Mass Adoption Requires High-Performance Blockchain Infrastructure Telegram aims to make Web3 services user-friendly . TON’s architecture ensures faster transaction speeds and lower fees . 3. Telegram’s Long-Term Vision for Blockchain Integration Originally developed by Telegram , TON aligns with its Web3 strategy . TON-based Mini Apps will offer decentralized services to millions of Telegram users. Will Telegram’s TON Exclusivity Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? Bullish for TON: Telegram’s endorsement boosts TON’s credibility and adoption . More developers may build on TON , leading to a stronger ecosystem . Increased use cases for TON-based payments, gaming, and social apps . Concerns & Criticism: Some developers worry about Telegram limiting blockchain choices . Other Layer 1 blockchains could lose potential integration opportunities. Regulatory scrutiny may increase as TON’s influence grows. Despite making TON the default blockchain for Mini Apps , Telegram bots will continue to support multiple blockchains , ensuring some level of interoperability. Conclusion Steve Yun’s defense of Telegram’s exclusive TON adoption highlights its strategic importance for scalability, security, and mass adoption . While the move has sparked debate , it positions TON as a major player in the Web3 ecosystem , potentially accelerating crypto adoption among Telegram’s 950 million users .

Andrew Kang , co-founder of Mechanism Capital , has predicted that Ethereum (ETH) could fall to between $2,200 and $2,400 if the U.S.-China trade dispute intensifies . Kang also noted that ETH faces short-term resistance between $2,900 and $3,000 , suggesting that macro uncertainties could weigh on Ethereum’s price action in the coming weeks. Why Could Ethereum Drop to $2.2K–$2.4K? Several factors could contribute to a potential ETH price decline : 1. Rising U.S.-China Trade Tensions China recently imposed new tariffs on U.S. goods , escalating the trade conflict. Uncertainty in global markets could lead to a sell-off in risk assets , including Ethereum. 2. Resistance at $2.9K–$3K Levels Kang highlighted that Ethereum faces key resistance in the $2,900–$3,000 range . If ETH fails to break through, a pullback to lower support levels is likely. 3. Broader Crypto Market Weakness Bitcoin dominance remains high , suggesting altcoins like ETH may struggle . Macroeconomic factors , including interest rate expectations , could add pressure on ETH. Can Ethereum Hold Above $2.4K? Bullish Scenario (ETH Holds Above $2.4K): If institutional demand for ETH ETFs continues, Ethereum could remain stable. Ethereum network upgrades (like Dencun) may provide long-term support . A weaker U.S. dollar or improved trade conditions could push ETH higher. Bearish Scenario (ETH Falls to $2.2K–$2.4K): Further trade war escalation could lead to a broader risk-off sentiment . If Bitcoin retraces , Ethereum could follow suit. Profit-taking at $2.9K–$3K resistance could push ETH lower. Conclusion Andrew Kang’s Ethereum forecast highlights the potential downside risk for ETH amid U.S.-China trade tensions . While ETH faces resistance at $2.9K–$3K , a major escalation in trade disputes could trigger a drop to $2.2K–$2.4K . Traders should closely monitor global macro trends and Ethereum’s key support levels in the coming weeks.

This move comes as retaliation for the 10% tariff the U.S. imposed on Chinese imports . Breakdown of China’s New Tariffs: 10% tariff on oil and agricultural machinery . 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) . This decision further escalates trade tensions between the U.S. and China , impacting energy, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors . Why Is China Imposing These Tariffs? 1. Retaliation Against U.S. Trade Policies The U.S. recently implemented a 10% tariff on Chinese goods . China’s countermeasure aims to protect its economic interests . 2. Strengthening Domestic Energy & Industrial Sectors By taxing U.S. energy imports , China may push for more domestic energy production . The tariffs on agricultural machinery could benefit China’s local manufacturers . 3. Increasing Leverage in Trade Negotiations The move signals China’s willingness to retaliate in ongoing trade talks . The U.S.-China trade war has historically led to economic uncertainty for global markets. Impact on the Global Economy & Markets Potential Negative Effects: Increased costs for U.S. energy and machinery exports to China. Greater uncertainty in global trade , impacting stock and commodity markets. Possible escalation of a broader U.S.-China trade conflict . Possible Positive Outcomes: China may boost domestic production in affected industries. The U.S. could seek alternative buyers for its coal, LNG, and machinery exports. Potential future trade negotiations could lead to a resolution. Conclusion China’s decision to impose up to 15% tariffs on U.S. goods signals escalating trade tensions between the two economic superpowers. As both nations adjust tariff policies , investors and businesses should prepare for potential market volatility in the energy, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors . If tensions continue, global supply chains and trade flows could face significant disruptions.

This move could mark a significant step toward institutionalizing Cronos (CRO) by making it available through traditional financial products. While details remain limited , this announcement indicates that Crypto.com is exploring ways to expand CRO’s accessibility to a broader investor base . Why a Cronos ETF Matters for CRO Adoption 1. Increased Institutional Interest in CRO ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to CRO without directly holding the asset. A regulated Cronos ETF could bring greater legitimacy to CRO. 2. Crypto.com’s Push for Mainstream Adoption Crypto.com is heavily investing in CRO adoption through partnerships, staking rewards, and DeFi integrations. A Cronos ETF would align CRO with institutional-grade crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. 3. Potential Market Impact If approved, a Cronos ETF could drive significant demand for CRO . Similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , the listing of a CRO ETF could boost Cronos network adoption . Challenges & Considerations for a Cronos ETF Regulatory Uncertainty The SEC has been hesitant to approve altcoin-based ETFs , making approval uncertain. Market Demand for CRO Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum , CRO has a smaller institutional presence , which could impact ETF viability. Competition from Other Crypto ETFs More established altcoins like Solana and XRP may receive ETF approvals before CRO . Conclusion Crypto.com’s decision to include a Cronos ETF in its 2025 roadmap highlights its long-term vision for CRO adoption . While regulatory challenges remain , the move could position Cronos for institutional exposure if approved. As more details emerge, investors should monitor Crypto.com’s progress and regulatory developments surrounding altcoin-based ETFs .

Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, often referred to as “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance on digital assets, the task force aims to address long-standing uncertainties in the crypto space. What SEC Can & Can’t Do? In a recent statement , Peirce outlined that the Crypto Task Force has a big job ahead. One of its main goals is to settle the long-debated question of whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities. The crypto Task Force webpage is live. Join us for the drive (toward crypto clarity): https://t.co/o2jzNUhJ5D and https://t.co/9AwTYkmOCw — Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) February 4, 2025 It also aims to create a smoother registration process for crypto firms, a task that has been a challenge under existing SEC rules. Another key focus is crypto lending and staking programs, two areas that have faced regulatory scrutiny. The task force will determine how these activities fit into the current legal framework and whether any adjustments are needed. Additionally, the SEC will work to define its role in the crypto space and clarify which aspects of the market fall outside its authority. Clearing the Path for Innovation This change in direction comes just weeks after Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair. His leadership was marked by a strict “regulation by enforcement” strategy, which many in the industry criticized for being unclear and overly aggressive. Peirce compared the SEC’s previous handling of crypto regulations to a chaotic road trip—full of sudden stops, unclear directions, and an uncertain destination. However, Peirce noted that the new task force will focus on creating fair and transparent rules rather than simply punishing companies after the fact. Focus on Other Crypto ETFs In addition to regulatory clarity, Peirce also mentioned that the SEC is also reviewing applications for new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, the agency is now considering funds for other cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. In addition, there are proposals to introduce new features for crypto ETFs, such as staking rewards for investors. Peirce promised that the SEC would provide clear explanations for its decisions on these applications.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 04:53:51

On Feb. 4, Robinhood pulled the plug on its Super Bowl betting contracts just a day after launch, following a request from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has formally requested that Robinhood Derivatives, LLC (RHD) “not permit customers to access” sports event contracts. While we continue to work with the CFTC to understand their concerns, we are suspending the rollout of the Pro… — Robinhood Comms (@RobinhoodComms) February 4, 2025 The move comes as regulators grow increasingly wary of event-based trading products, particularly those tied to major sporting events. The product, launched in partnership with prediction market platform Kalshi , allowed users to bet on the outcome of the Feb. 9 Super Bowl matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs. Only about 1% of Robinhood’s customers had access to the contracts before they were suspended. Those who had already placed bets will be able to either close their positions or see them through to settlement, but no new trades will be allowed. Robinhood, frustrated with the turn of events, stated in a tweet that it had been in “regular communication” with the CFTC about its plans and was disappointed by the outcome. The company did not disclose the exact reasoning behind the CFTC’s intervention, but the decision comes amid broader regulatory scrutiny of event-based contracts. You might also like: Polymarket users spin $16m volume on Trump’s picks Just two days ago, the agency launched an inquiry into Crypto.com and Kalshi, questioning whether their own Super Bowl contracts complied with derivatives laws. Robinhood isn’t new to event-based trading. In October 2024, the company made its first move into the space with contracts tied to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. That launch followed a court ruling in favor of Kalshi, which had challenged the CFTC’s attempts to block election-based prediction markets. The legal victory allowed Kalshi to continue offering election contracts, but it did little to resolve the regulatory gray area surrounding event-based derivatives. A CFTC spokesperson reinforced its concerns, stating that it will “exercise its oversight authority to the fullest extent” to ensure firms comply with derivatives laws, Reuters reported . The agency is taking a hard look at whether these products fall under traditional derivatives rules or if they should be treated as a different class of financial instruments. For Robinhood, this latest hurdle may not mark the end of its push into the space. The company has indicated plans to launch a more expansive event contracts platform later this year, signaling that it still sees opportunity in the market.

SOL price is consolidating and might face resistance near the $215 and $220 levels. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $215 and $212 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $212 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel or a bullish flag forming with resistance at $213 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $220 zone. Solana Price Faces Resistance Solana price struggled to clear the $250 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $220 and $200 support levels. It even dived below the $180 level. The recent low was formed at $175 before the price climbed and tested the $220 resistance. A high was formed at $220 and the price is now consolidating. There was a drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $175 swing low to the $220 high. Solana is now trading below $220 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $212 level. There is also a short-term declining channel or a bullish flag forming with resistance at $213 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $215 level. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $232. Any more gains might send the price toward the $250 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $215 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $202 zone. The first major support is near the $198 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $175 swing low to the $220 high. A break below the $198 level might send the price toward the $192 zone. If there is a close below the $192 support, the price could decline toward the $175 support in the near term.

The SEC Office of Inspector General (SEC OIG) completed the report more than a year ago, but the SEC has yet to release it or provide related documents despite multiple Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The lawsuit, filed today, calls on the SEC to disclose the final report, which examines potential conflicts of interest involving William Hinman, the former Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance, and his role in the agency’s decisions on cryptocurrencies. Of particular concern is Hinman’s ties to his former law firm, Simpson Thacher, which had an interest in promoting Ether (ETH) over other cryptocurrencies. Watchdog sues to force @SECGov to release the IG report on its investigation into former Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman https://t.co/b5osUpwCrk — CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) February 4, 2025 Empower Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group, has been pushing for greater transparency from the SEC since August 2021, when it first requested communications between SEC officials and cryptocurrency entities. Over the past few years, the group has filed multiple lawsuits to secure access to documents, including those tied to Hinman’s 2018 speech declaring Ether not to be a security, while other similar cryptocurrencies were classified as unregistered securities. Tristan Leavitt, president of Empower Oversight, criticized the SEC’s ongoing delays, calling its refusal to release the report “suspicious” and stressing the public’s need for transparency in light of the agency’s role in regulating the growing cryptocurrency sector. With the SEC’s internal watchdog report still not released, Empower Oversight’s legal efforts continue as they press for clarity on the agency’s handling of conflicts of interest and cryptocurrency enforcement decisions.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 05:10:59

Crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) recently shared an updated chart and analysis on X, providing insights into the projected price movements of XRP based on Elliott Wave Theory. His analysis highlights an intermediate cycle targeting $5.85 and a primary cycle suggesting a long-term target of $18.22. The analyst has previously predicted these targets , and his updated analysis shows a clearer picture of XRP’s potential path. XRP had a 4th Wave on his Intermediate Cycle, which I highlighted in Dark Blue, aiming for $5.85 with the 5th Wave. On the other hand, Primary Cycle Waves, highlighted in Light Blue, still aim for $18.22. (Not Financial Advice) I have used the same structure since July 23,… pic.twitter.com/CZXFSRyftb — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 3, 2025 The Path to $5.85 Dark Defender’s analysis identifies XRP’s current position in an Elliott Wave cycle. He notes that XRP is in the fourth wave of its intermediate cycle, with an anticipated fifth wave pushing the price toward $5.85. This prediction is based on Fibonacci retracement levels, with 261.80% Fibonacci support aligning with the $5.85 mark. As of the latest update, XRP has broken through a key monthly resistance level, reinforcing the possibility of an upward movement. The digital asset enjoyed a monthly close above $3 for the first time, and despite the decline over the past few days, Dark Defender remains unfazed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Long-Term Outlook of $18.22 In addition to the short-term projection, Dark Defender mapped out a broader primary cycle, suggesting XRP could eventually reach $18.22. This price level corresponds to a 361.80% Fibonacci extension, a common measurement used in technical analysis to predict potential high points in strong bullish trends. He mentioned that his structural analysis has been consistent since July 2024, when XRP was valued at around $0.40 to $0.50. “We are following it as the Northern Star,” he stated, affirming confidence in his long-term projections. Market Context and Considerations XRP has experienced significant volatility over the past few days, largely influenced by broader market trends. A notable analyst also drew attention to potential market manipulation , which contributed heavily to the digital asset’s brief dip below $2. While Dark Defender’s approach is grounded in technical analysis, it does not account for external factors that could drastically change its trajectory. Despite this, the community is still optimistic, and Dark Defender is confident that XRP will hit these targets in this cycle.

The firm warned through a blog post that holding people responsible for systems and actions over which they don’t have jurisdiction leads to obstructive outcomes. Part of the statement read: Unfortunately, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has ignored this distinction and is attempting to do just that by holding software developers responsible for the actions of third parties that use neutral tools the developers created but no longer control. A16z Trump’s biggest policy priority should be decoding the legally correct meaning of control A16z further asked the new administration to prioritize “codifying the proper and legally correct understanding of ‘control’ in law” as it would help users, DOJ, and software developers understand control in a legal context. In past legal actions, US prosecutors have targeted cryptocurrency developers for activities conducted on their platforms by others. A16z compared this to holding a car manufacturer accountable for actions by a careless driver that led to a crash. They pointed out that the action doesn’t make sense: You can’t blame the carmaker for the accident when someone crashes a car he bought from them. That analogy is quite obvious for vehicles, but cryptocurrency handles it differently. In recent cases like United States v. Storm and Rodriguez , the DOJ has prosecuted the blockchain developers and compared them to unlicensed money transmitters. Critics counter that this approach misunderstands the fundamental nature of control in decentralized systems since developers typically have no direct control over the software once it has been deployed. The move to unpack “control” is critical to determining whether crypto firms qualify as money-transmitting entities guided by specific rules and regulations. According to its website, A16z’s portfolio of venture investments includes over 100 crypto companies, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap. Fed’s stance on crypto is bound to change during Trump’s administration During the tenure of former President of the United States Joe Biden, federal agencies were very strict with crypto cases. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the financial regulator, has opened more than 100 cases against companies and people who have raised money through crypto, claiming they broke US laws. However, things are expected to change during President Trump’s administration. The president seems accommodating toward crypto and promised to make the US the world’s crypto capital. So far, Trump has replaced SEC leadership with more crypto-friendly appointees.

These Top Crypto Presales Could 1000x By The End Of The Year appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto investors are no strangers to chasing the next high returning crypto. Many who missed the hype surrounding $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens are now looking for a presale project with the potential to deliver massive gains. This is where $UNOMAI comes into play. This presale could redefine the meme-coin market and potentially 1000x by year’s end. With a bold vision, innovative technology, and a first-of-its-kind ecosystem, $UNOMAI is quickly becoming the most talked-about crypto investment of 2025. The Vision: The United Nations of Memes $UNOMEME is more than a meme token—it’s an ecosystem. Its mission? To unite fragmented meme communities into a single governance structure called the United Nations of Memes. By fostering collaboration instead of competition, $UNOMEME aims to create a seamless trading environment, solving one of the biggest challenges in meme trading today: fragmentation. For those who saw the frenzy around $TRUMP and $MELANIA, imagine the potential of a token that bridges all major meme markets under one banner. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about long-term value and sustainability. Why $UNOMAI Stands Out Unlike traditional meme tokens that rely solely on hype, $UNOMAI introduces real utility with high-leverage trading (up to 1000x), smooth cross-chain transfers, and attractive staking rewards of 35% APY – creating a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for traders and long-term holders. High-Leverage Trading Access up to 1000x leverage with lightning-fast cross-chain executions. This maximizes profit potential while capturing opportunities across diverse markets, offering the aggressive upside that meme investors crave. Cross-Chain Accessibility The Universal Bridge connects Ethereum and Solana for instant, low-fee transfers.

Prosperity Program Rewards Staking $UNOMAI offers 35% APY plus daily profit sharing and community perks. Unlike speculative tokens, $UNOMAI provides consistent returns, combining long-term growth with daily liquidity for strategic reinvestment. Tokenomics: Built for Growth With 30% allocated to rewards and 47.5% for infrastructure, the tokenomics ensure both scalability and community benefits. Transparent governance builds trust, while strategic allocations fuel sustainable development and investor security Turning Meme Market Fragmentation into Sustainable Growth Presale investments in crypto have consistently delivered massive returns, and $UNOMAI is primed for explosive growth through its first-mover advantage, practical utility, and vast market potential. By uniting fragmented meme communities like Doge, Pepe, and Shiba under a shared financial ecosystem, $UNOMAI addresses the industry’s liquidity challenges and fosters collective growth. Its high-utility features, including 1000x high-leverage trading, seamless cross-chain access via the Universal Bridge, and a 35% APY staking program, appeal to both short-term traders and long-term investors. These offerings create diverse opportunities, from capturing quick gains to earning passive income. As the multi-billion-dollar meme-coin market expands, $UNOMAI offers more than speculative hype—delivering sustainable rewards and long-term growth potential, unlike the fleeting excitement seen with $TRUMP and $MELANIA. $UNOMAI Is the Next Big Thing If you missed the boat on $TRUMP and $MELANIA, don’t let $UNOMAI slip through your fingers. This presale offers the potential for exponential growth, backed by innovative features and a clear vision for the future. With the promise of uniting meme communities, rewarding stakeholders, and creating a seamless trading experience, $UNOMAI is shaping up to be the top crypto presale of the year.

While prices briefly rebounded after President Donald Trump announced a 30-day delay on new tariffs, some analysts warn that Bitcoin could still face a correction below $90,000 if geopolitical risks intensify. Bitcoin ETFs See Unprecedented Growth Despite the bloodbath in Satoshi Street in the last few weeks, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded a record-breaking month. January saw over $5.25 billion in net inflows, surpassing the $4.53 billion recorded in December 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $3.23 billion in inflows, bringing its total assets to $59.39 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $1.28 billion, pushing its total net assets to $21.76 billion. The Kobeissi Letter reported that net inflows hit around $4.5 billion in January alone, making it one of the best months on record. Since their launch in January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $40 billion in total inflows, pushing assets under management (AUM) beyond $125 billion for the first time. The Kobeissi Letter also highlighted that Bitcoin ETF holdings have doubled in just four months, signaling strong investor confidence in crypto-based financial products. This rapid growth also brings Bitcoin ETFs closer to the level of spot gold ETFs, which have been trading for over two decades. The comparison suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a legitimate store of value, similar to gold. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto.com Plans CRO Spot ETF Launch and New Financial Products in 2025 , Strong Institutional Backing Signals More Growth Bitcoin ETFs had a strong end to January, pulling in nearly $1 billion in just two days. BlackRock’s iBIT led the inflows with $685.3 million. Despite some volatility, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan remains optimistic, predicting that total ETF inflows could surpass $50 billion by the end of the year. While some days saw outflows, the overall trend points to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Beyond the ETFs, Bitcoin adoption is growing across the U.S. Oklahoma recently proposed a bill to allow Bitcoin payments for state employees, businesses, and individuals, a move that could pave the way for broader crypto acceptance. Other states are also exploring similar legislation, further integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. With institutional demand surging and regulatory clarity improving, Bitcoin ETFs are proving to be a major driver of crypto adoption in traditional finance, setting the stage for continued growth throughout 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, the SEC is reassessing its stance on crypto assets, and Commissioner Hester Peirce revealed plans for potential retroactive relief and a more predictable regulatory framework. The agency is also scaling back its crypto enforcement unit after several key leadership departures. Crypto Legislation Could See a Breakthrough Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director under Donald Trump, believes that US lawmakers will look to get on the good side of the crypto community ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In an interview with the Financial Times on Feb. 4, Scaramucci suggested that members of Congress, particularly those facing competitive primaries and elections in swing districts, will want to establish a track record of supporting crypto-related legislation before the next electoral cycle. He speculated that Congress could push forward a wave of legislative activity before its holiday recess in 2025, possibly including a long-awaited crypto market structure bill. Scaramucci said lawmakers might move on crypto regulation as early as November 2025, but if they failed to act by then, it will likely still happen in his proposed timeframe. Scaramucci has been a very outspoken critic of Trump in the 2024 election, and firmly believes his pro-crypto stance was purely transactional rather than genuine support for the industry. He went further by describing Trump as “unwell” and warning of the dangers of the political power he has accumulated. His comments only added to the debate over how crypto is shaping political alignments in Washington, particularly as industry-backed political action committees (PACs) begin to play a much larger role in influencing elections. Special interest groups and PACs are expected to have a huge impact on the 2026 elections, especially as candidates try to appeal to more crypto-focused voters. The Fairshake PAC spent around $131 million in the 2024 US elections to support pro-crypto candidates, and plans to continue its efforts into the midterms. The growing financial backing of the industry also suggests that lawmakers may face more pressure to take clear positions on digital assets. Scaramucci also weighed in on Trump’s controversial entry into the meme coin market by calling the launch of the TRUMP token damaging to the industry. The President introduced the token on Jan. 17, just before returning to office, which led to a massive surge in market cap that briefly exceeded $15 billion before dropping. TRUMP market cap since its launch (Source: CoinMarketCap ) He compared the project to the scams that have plagued the crypto space for years now, and argued that it reflects poorly on an industry that is already fighting for legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and the public. SEC Explores New Approach to Crypto Assets The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking a new approach to regulating the crypto sector, which includes reassessing the security status of digital assets and considering retroactive relief for certain token offerings. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce issued a statement on Feb. 4 revealing that the White House’s newly announced Crypto Task Force is recommending SEC action to grant temporary prospective and retroactive relief for coin or token offerings, provided they meet specific conditions. SEC statement These conditions include updating and providing necessary disclosures and agreeing not to contest the commission’s jurisdiction in cases involving alleged fraud related to the purchase and sale of crypto assets. She also shared that the task force is reconsidering the classification of certain assets as securities, and acknowledging that the legal status of crypto assets is very crucial when it comes to addressing broader regulatory concerns. The election of Donald Trump in November started a major shift for the crypto industry as his administration moved quickly to reshape regulatory oversight. Trump appointed Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as the new SEC chair, introduced a special advisory role focused on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, and signed an executive order to establish a digital asset working group. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes the administration will also prioritize passing stablecoin regulations , which he considers essential to maintain the US dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency. Lawmakers are also actively pushing for clearer regulatory guidelines. Republican Representative Tom Emmer stated that passing comprehensive market structure and stablecoin legislation will be a key priority for Congress. With growing interest from traditional financial institutions, clearer rules could accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan indicated that banks are particularly focused on crypto payments, and suggested that if digital transactions become more established, the banking sector will aggressively move into the space. SEC Scales Back Crypto Enforcement Unit The US SEC is also reportedly scaling back its dedicated crypto enforcement unit by reassigning some of its 50 staff members to other departments in the agency. According to a Feb. 4 report from The New York Times, multiple sources confirmed that one of the unit’s top lawyers has already been moved from the SEC’s enforcement arm. However some insiders viewed it as an unfair demotion. The report was published very shortly after SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce outlined the new shift in the agency’s regulatory approach to digital assets, including the reassessment of the security status of crypto assets and the possibility of retroactive relief for certain token offerings. Peirce compared the SEC’s previous enforcement-driven strategy to a chaotic road trip that frequently slammed on the brakes, and shared that the new Crypto Task Force plans to create a much more stable and predictable regulatory environment. The SEC’s crypto enforcement unit played a big role in cracking down on noncompliance in the industry by bringing 33 enforcement actions against 90 defendants in 2024 alone, according to Cornerstone Research . However, recent developments indicate that there will be a broader leadership shift at the agency, which has gained a lot of momentum since Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. (Source: Cornerstone Research ) A series of high-profile departures also completely reshaped the SEC’s enforcement landscape, including the resignation of Chief Enforcement Officer Gubir Grewal in October of 2024. Grewal was a strong advocate for aggressive crypto oversight, and recommended more than 100 enforcement actions against major industry players. His departure started speculation that the agency may be adopting a softer regulatory stance. Sanjay Wadhwa, who was promoted to acting director of the enforcement division, also left the SEC on Jan. 31 after more than two decades at the agency. Meanwhile, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler officially resigned on Jan. 20, which coincided with Trump’s return to office. These leadership changes and a potential reduction in crypto enforcement efforts suggest that the regulatory approach to digital assets in the US is in the middle of a major transformation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-05 05:44:58

Senator Sandra O’Brien has introduced a proposal that would allow the state’s treasurer to invest in Bitcoin, making Ohio one of the growing number of U.S. states embracing digital assets. Ohio’s Plan for a Bitcoin Reserve Senate Bill 57, introduced on January 28 and referred to the Financial Institutions, Insurance, and Technology Committee a day later, seeks to establish the “Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Fund.” I just introduced legislation to create an Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Fund. The crypto world is here, and Ohio needs to be a leader. Crypto will be a major part of President Trump’s term. When his working group issues recommendations, Ohio will be ready. — State Senator Sandra O'Brien (@OBrienOH32) January 28, 2025 If passed, this law will allow the state to invest public funds solely in Bitcoin while ensuring that these holdings are securely stored for at least five years. Senator O’Brien believes that Ohio must take a leadership role in crypto adoption. She emphasized on social media that “the crypto world is here, and Ohio needs to be a leader.” She also noted that with President Donald Trump’s growing interest in digital assets, Ohio must be prepared for potential federal-level crypto policies. Bitcoin for Payments and Donations The bill doesn’t stop at just investing in Bitcoin. It also proposes that Ohio state agencies and government entities accept Bitcoin for payments, including taxes, fees, and fines. Once received, the funds will be converted into Bitcoin and stored in the reserve. Additionally, Ohio residents, state agencies, and universities will have the option to donate Bitcoin to the fund. The bill even suggests creating a recognition program to honor major contributors, further encouraging Bitcoin adoption at the state level. Other US State Joining Too This isn’t Ohio’s first attempt to embrace Bitcoin. In December, Ohio House Republican leader Derek Merrin introduced a similar bill, HB 703, which would give the state treasurer the option to allocate Bitcoin to a reserve fund, Merrin argued that the devaluation of the U.S. dollar makes it essential for states to explore alternative assets like Bitcoin. Ohio isn’t the only state pushing for crypto adoption. Across the U.S., other states like Utah and Arizona are also advancing bills to allow public funds to be invested in cryptocurrencies. In total, more than twelve U.S. states are considering legislation to allow Bitcoin reserves.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 05:58:26

A report by ARK Invest highlighted Bitcoin’s declining volatility and the rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs, while research from Mempool suggested that the adoption of inscriptions could drive Bitcoin’s average block size to 4MB. As regulatory discussions around stablecoins gained traction in Congress, the evolving digital asset landscape signaled a shift toward broader institutional adoption and increased blockchain utility. Bitcoin’s Block Size Could Reach 4MB Amid Widespread Inscriptions Adoption, Mempool Research Reports The Bitcoin network could see its average block size grow significantly, potentially reaching 4 megabytes (MB) per block, as inscriptions gain wider adoption, according to a new report published by Mempool Research on Feb. 4. This represents a substantial increase from the current average block size of just over 1.5 MB. The findings highlight the potential scalability implications of inscriptions—a method that efficiently encodes arbitrary data within Bitcoin blocks. If widely adopted, these inscriptions could push Bitcoin’s total blockchain size to 1 terabyte (TB) as early as 2026, though Mempool Research estimates a more likely timeframe between 2027 and 2029. Bitcoin’s block size has been a hotly debated topic in the cryptocurrency space for years. Larger block sizes allow more data to be stored per block, increasing the network’s ability to process transactions. However, they also pose scalability challenges, as more storage and bandwidth are required to maintain a full node. Currently, Bitcoin blocks are limited to 4 MB of raw data, with most blocks averaging around 1.5 MB. However, since the 2021 Taproot upgrade, some blocks have stored as much as 2.4 MB of data. Taproot’s implementation enabled more efficient transaction encoding, leading to increased usage of Bitcoin’s block space for novel applications such as inscriptions. Mempool Research’s report outlines two key scenarios: A return to pre-inscription dynamics, resulting in slower block size growth. A future with widespread adoption of inscriptions, which could push average block sizes toward 4 MB. With larger block sizes, Bitcoin’s total blockchain could surpass 1 TB within a few years, requiring significant storage capacity for full node operators. Bitcoin’s block size limitations contrast starkly with newer blockchain networks like Solana, which can theoretically store up to 128 MB per block, according to the Solana Foundation. This massive difference allows Solana to process thousands of transactions per second, while Bitcoin remains constrained by its 10-minute block time and relatively smaller block capacity. The competition from high-performance blockchains like Solana sheds light on Bitcoin’s challenges in maintaining its dominance as both a store of value and a functional transaction network. However, Bitcoin’s unparalleled security and decentralization remain key advantages. The Role of Taproot and Bitcoin DeFi in Scaling the Network Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade laid the groundwork for innovations in smart contracts, inscriptions, and Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi). While Bitcoin was originally designed as a peer-to-peer payment system, its ecosystem has evolved, now supporting NFTs, layer-2 solutions, and other DeFi applications. Industry experts predict that Bitcoin-native DeFi will be a major theme in 2025, with institutions increasingly interested in Bitcoin as a programmable asset. Platforms built on Bitcoin’s network, such as Stacks and RSK, are enabling DeFi functionalities while benefiting from Bitcoin’s security. However, Bitcoin still faces competition from networks that offer far greater block space and lower transaction costs. In September 2023, Celestia—a layer-1 network specializing in data availability—announced a roadmap aiming to scale its block size to an unprecedented 1 gigabyte. If successful, this could create new challenges for Bitcoin’s long-term competitiveness. As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, the network must balance scalability, security, and decentralization. While larger block sizes can increase transaction capacity, they also introduce new trade-offs, such as increased storage requirements for node operators and potentially higher fees. The Mempool Research report suggests that widespread adoption of inscriptions could drive Bitcoin into a new era of growth, pushing its blockchain storage requirements beyond previous expectations. Whether Bitcoin will fully embrace these advancements or remain constrained by its original design remains a topic of debate within the community. With institutions increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and the rise of Bitcoin-native DeFi, the network’s ability to scale will be a defining factor in its future success. Bitcoin and Stablecoins Dominate 2024 as Digital Assets Enter a New Era: ARK Invest Report 2024 was a landmark period for digital assets, with Bitcoin achieving historic stability and stablecoin transaction values surpassing those of financial giants Visa and Mastercard. These insights are part of ARK Invest’s recently released Big Ideas 2025 report, which outlines key trends and developments in the cryptocurrency space. According to the report, Bitcoin’s annualized volatility fell below 50% in 2024—a record low for the leading digital asset. This marked a sharp contrast to previous years when Bitcoin’s volatility hovered around 80% in 2022 and exceeded 100% in 2018. Alongside reduced volatility, Bitcoin delivered a stellar 122.2% return in 2024, reinforcing its growing status as a reliable investment vehicle. A major factor behind Bitcoin’s success in 2024 was the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. Approved in January, these ETFs marked the “most successful ETF launch in history,” according to ARK Invest. By the end of the year, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had accumulated over $100 billion in net assets, demonstrating strong institutional demand. The introduction of these ETFs provided traditional investors with a regulated and accessible means of gaining exposure to Bitcoin, which played a pivotal role in stabilizing the asset's price movements. Another key milestone was Bitcoin’s inflation rate falling to 0.9% after its quadrennial halving event in April. For the first time in history, Bitcoin’s issuance rate dipped below that of gold’s long-term supply growth, reinforcing its status as ”digital gold” and a hedge against inflation. While Bitcoin solidified its position as a store of value, stablecoins emerged as a dominant use case for blockchain technology. ARK Invest’s report highlights that stablecoin transactions reached an annualized value of $15.6 trillion in 2024—equivalent to 119% of Visa’s transaction volume and 200% of Mastercard’s. Stablecoin adoption also saw a massive surge in transaction volume, hitting 110 million transactions per month. Although this still represents a small fraction of Visa’s and Mastercard’s transaction count (0.41% and 0.72%, respectively), the value per transaction was significantly higher than those processed by traditional payment networks. The rapid growth of stablecoins has been driven by their low transaction costs, fast settlement speeds, and increasing regulatory clarity, making them an essential tool for cross-border payments, remittances, and on-chain transactions. Regulatory Landscape: Stablecoin Framework Gains Momentum As stablecoins gained prominence, US lawmakers ramped up efforts to establish a clear regulatory framework for these digital assets. Stablecoin regulation became a top priority for pro-crypto Republicans in Congress, with multiple legislative proposals introduced throughout the year. Before the November 2024 presidential election, Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2024, building on previous proposals by former House member Patrick McHenry. Earlier in the year, bipartisan efforts were also evident, as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D) and Cynthia Lummis (R) introduced a bill aiming to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Following the Republican Party’s sweep of both houses of Congress in November, passing legislation to clarify crypto market structure and stablecoin regulations became a top priority. Republican Representative Tom Emmer emphasized that regulatory clarity would be critical for fostering innovation and maintaining the US’s leadership in financial technology. Miller Whitehouse-Levine, head of the DeFi Education Fund, told Bloomberg that there is now broad bipartisan consensus in Congress regarding stablecoin regulation. With stablecoins playing an increasingly critical role in the global economy, lawmakers are under growing pressure to balance innovation with consumer protection. As the crypto industry goes into 2025, Bitcoin and stablecoins appear poised to dominate the next wave of digital asset adoption. The success of Bitcoin ETFs, the network’s declining volatility, and stablecoins surpassing traditional payment giants signal that blockchain-based finance is moving toward mainstream acceptance. Looking ahead, several key developments will shape the industry: Bitcoin’s halving effects: With the April 2024 halving reducing new Bitcoin issuance, supply constraints could drive further price appreciation. Stablecoin regulation: The implementation of clear US stablecoin regulations could accelerate adoption and institutional use cases. Decentralized finance (DeFi) growth: The maturation of Bitcoin-native DeFi and increasing integration of stablecoins into financial systems could unlock new blockchain applications. With the combination of growing institutional adoption, a more favorable regulatory environment, and technological advancements, 2025 is set to be another transformative year for digital assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-05 06:00:00

33767162,[object Object],1738735241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Barstool’s Dave Portnoy Buys The XRP Dip: Drops $1 Million Bet,https://bitcoinist.com/barstool-dave-portnoy-buys-xrp-dip/,"Barstool Sports founder and social media personality Dave Portnoy has doubled down on his crypto investments, revealing during a livestream on February 3 that he purchased an additional $1 million worth of XRP. Why XRP? Portnoy, known for his unapologetic approach to trading and gambling, made the announcement as he discussed Monday’s market’s downturn. “Okay, here’s my announcement. I just bought another million of XRP,” he said . This isn’t the first time Portnoy has made waves with a high-stakes crypto investment. In mid-December 2024, he disclosed on a livestream that he had already accumulated $1.3 million worth of XRP, alongside $1.5 million in Bitcoin. During that livestream, Portnoy expressed his frustration with missing out on early rallies but maintained his commitment to long-term holds rather than active trading. “I know XRP is up over 400%… I’m always late to these runs. I’m just gonna bet it and set it. I’m not trading, I’m just gonna hold it.” His investment philosophy appears to lean toward high-risk, high-reward plays, with XRP being his chosen asset for outsized gains. “As a gambler myself, I want the 10X coin like XRP. Bitcoin won’t do that anytime soon.” Portnoy’s first purchase coincided with the launch of RLUSD (Ripple USD) , a stablecoin aimed at enhancing liquidity within the ecosystem. Acknowledging the growing excitement around RLUSD, Portnoy highlighted XRP’s speculative potential. Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has been a crucial factor contributing to the price surge in the past months. Many traders, including Portnoy, see the asset as a high-risk, high-reward bet due to the ongoing regulatory developments, potentially an end to the case under the new SEC chairman Paul Atkins . Portnoy’s latest $1 million acquisition came amid Monday’s market pullback, with Bitcoin and altcoins experiencing a sharp drop followed by steep recovery rallies. The altcoin saw a sharp decline after a multi-month surge, but printed a highly bullish daily candle with a 32% wick. The downturn can be attributed to the market’s reaction to President Donald Trump’s implementation of tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. The announcement of these tariffs, which included a 25% tariff on goods from both nations and a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, sent shockwaves through the entire financial market. This drop was part of a broader crypto market correction, with Bitcoin also falling as low as $91,200, and other altcoins like Ethereum and Dogecoin seeing double-digit plunges. The crypto market faced over $2 billion in liquidations, highlighting the panic and uncertainty these tariffs introduced into the market. However, the reversal was quick when Trump announced the first deal with Mexico.

Additionally, the spot Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of nearly 11K ETH. With these bullish developments, will Ethereum price recover losses and revisit $3,000? Can Ethereum Price Revisit $3,000 Anytime Soon? On Monday, Ethereum price crashed 27%, setting a daily low of $2,080. Massive liquidations, short positions covering and investors buying dips led to a 38% bounce on the same day. Due to the sudden crash and recovery, there is a large wick on the daily chart. More often than not prices typically retrace toward the wick’s midpoint before a full-blown recovery rally. If such an outlook should unfold, investors can expect ETH’s value to crash another 10% to $2,474, which is the midpoint of the wick. A revisit to this level could lead to a revisit of the $3,000 psychological level if the price stabilizes around $2,400 to $2,500. ETH/USDT 1-day chart Supporting this outlook is IntoTheblock’s IOMAP (In/Out of the Money Around Price) indicator. This metric shows that the next key support area is $2,438, where roughly 2.71 million addresses bought 58.55 million ETH at an average price of $2,438. This level coincides with wick’s midpoint, adding credence to a 10% crash for Ethereum price. ETH IOMAP While technicals suggest a correction on the lower time frames, a decline in the supply of ETH held on exchanges and ETF inflows suggests a bullish outlook from a big-picture perspective. 340K ETH leaves Exchanges Ethereum price is influenced by the supply of ETH held on exchanges. According to Santiment , a data analytics platform, the supply of ETH on exchanges dropped from 10.86 million to 10.52 million between February 2 and 5. Roughly 340K ETH worth $920 million left exchanges. Still, this is not bullish for ETH when looking at the big picture. While the supply of ETH steadily declined after November 28, 2024, it stopped on January 21 and reversed, noting an inflow of 210K ETH in the next 12 days. Hence, the recent outflow, might seem bullish if isolated, but does not mean it is positive development that could support ETH price recovery. ETH held on exchanges Despite such a brutal sell-off, Ethereum ETFs saw an inflow of 10,980 ETH on February 4, according to CoinGlass data . Since January 30, the inflows have been positive, which is an optimistic development considering Ether’s 2024 performance. ETH ETF Sees Inflows ETH Netflows All in all, the big-picture perspective remains bullish, with the short-term outlook expecting a correction in Ethereum price. A good place for buying dips is $2,400 to $2,500 as suggested by both technical and on-chain analysis.

The Ripple token fall comes as the XRP Ledger halted blockchain production for nearly an hour on Tuesday. However, Ripple CTO David Schwartz has confirmed that the network has recovered and is almost back to normalcy. XRP Price Drops Amid XRP Ledger Downtime On Tuesday, the XRP Ledger faced some downtime for an hour before resuming operations. However, the development was enough to send XRP price down by 8% to its crucial support of $2.50. With the XRP Ledger halting the block production for an hour, the network activity froze at the ledger height of 93927173. The Ledger has once again resumed normal operations without reporting any loss of transactions or assets. Ripple CTO David Schwartz acknowledged the development stating: “We don’t know exactly what caused the issue yet”. He further noted that although the consensus was running, the validations were not published which caused the network to drift apart. “Validator operators manually intervened to choose a sane starting point and begin publishing validations from there,” he added. Ripple Community Celebrates Quick Network Recovery Commenting on the network recovery, the Ripple CTO referred to the Unique Node List (UNL), a core component of the XRPL consensus mechanism. “Very few UNL operators actually made any changes, as far as I can tell, so it’s possible the network spontaneously recovered. I’m not sure yet,” said Schwartz . Other community members have backed Ripple for this quick recovery. Edo Farina, head of XRP Healthcare, the first healthcare platform built on the XRP Ledger said: “The $XRP Ledger has been operational for over 110,000 hours since its launch in 2012. With today’s halt, the total downtime where validators failed to agree on transactions reached about 2 hours. That’s 99.999% of efficiency. The MOST efficient blockchain in existence!” He further clarified that the Ripple network halt wasn’t typically the outcome of network congestion but instead related to the consensus mechanism. Last week, the XRP Ledger implemented the AMMClawback amendment, a significant upgrade aimed at bolstering the regulatory compliance of its Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools. Will XRP Price Bounce Back Again? As of press time, XRP price is down 7.3%, trading at $2.51, with daily trading volumes crashing 41% to $13.11 billion. Furthermore, the Coinglass data shows that XRP futures open interest is down 12.2% to $3.65 billion while the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $21 million. Earlier this week, Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP amid discussion around XRP reserves. Since the beginning of 2025, XRP has seen strong inflows. Coinshares report shows that the Ripple cryptocurrency has solidified its position as the second-best performing altcoin, recording year-to-date (YTD) inflows of $105 million. Notably, the digital asset attracted $15 million in inflows just last week, underscoring growing investor interest. Additionally, the push for introducing spot XRP ETF by asset managers Grayscale and Canada’s Purpose Investments has further drawn institutional interest.

However, the network recovered on its own without requiring major interventions from validators. According to Schwartz, while consensus was running, validations weren’t being published, “causing the network to drift apart.” “Very few UNL operators actually made any changes, as far as I can tell, so it’s possible the network spontaneously recovered,” he added. A Unique Node List (UNL) is a core component of the XRPL consensus mechanism that acts as a trusted validator directory to ensure network integrity and transaction finality. The network is now recovering. We don’t know exactly what caused the issue yet. Super-preliminary observation: It looked like consensus was running but validations were not being published, causing the network to drift apart. Validator operators manually intervened to choose a… — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) February 4, 2025 A Rare Ripple Outage “Once servers started seeing a few validations from a few sources, they were able to build enough consensus to pull the network over to a coordinated ledger stream after the last ledger the network managed to validate,” explained Schwartz, who added that these were all preliminary findings. He confirmed that no assets on XRPL were lost, adding, “It just caused ledgers not to be seen as trusted for about an hour.” The incident occurred during a period of changes for the network as it recently reduced its base reserve requirement from 10 XRP to 1 XRP. Additionally, the validator structure was modified in 2023 to reduce Ripple’s influence to 2 out of 35 validators. The network had faced other technical issues in recent months, including a node crash in November 2024 and full history node failures in September requiring emergency patches. XRP Price Tanks XRP prices have taken a hit, dumping 10% on the day in a fall to $2.45 following the incident. The cross-border payment token was trading at $2.49 at the time of writing, down 26% from its 2025 high of $3.38 in mid-January. XRP fell back to $2 following the imposition of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs over the weekend but managed to recover to almost $2.80 on Feb. 4. Ripple’s native token has performed very well in the recent crypto rally, having gained almost 400% since the same time last year. Nearly all of those gains have come in the past three month,s with the change in guard in American politics promising a brighter future for crypto companies.

The project has rapidly emerged as a go-to platform for traders, reaching 250,000 monthly active users and over 500,000 total users. With a 96.3% month-on-month growth rate in app installs, Best Wallet has seen an impressive 658% increase in total installations since its launch in November 2024. With investor interest still high, funding for Best Wallet has surged by $500,000 in just the past five days, further accelerating its momentum. Currently, early adopters can acquire $BEST tokens at $0.02385, but this round closes in less than 13 hours, after which the price will increase as the project moves into its next phase. Best Wallet’s Pick: Pepe Unchained Delivers The steady influx of capital into Best Wallet reflects growing confidence in the platform, fueled in part by the success of its “Upcoming Tokens” project screener, which spotlighted Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) last year. Over the past 13 days, $PEPU has surged by 142%, rewarding early investors who followed Best Wallet’s presale recommendation. Those who got in early and held their tokens have seen returns exceeding 203% since January 20. Pepe Unchained made history as the first meme coin to raise over $73 million in its presale, making it the top presale of 2024. A key factor behind its early success was its inclusion in Best Wallet’s “Upcoming Tokens” feature, which helps users discover high-potential projects in the crowded crypto space. Best Wallet has consistently identified promising opportunities, and Pepe Unchained is no exception. Investors who followed its recommendation have remained in profit since the token’s launch. Initially priced at $0.008 during presale, $PEPU is now trading at $0.02004, delivering over 150% returns to early backers. PEPU $0.0195 USD price today, Pepe Unchained live chart, forecast | DEXTools Although the token has retraced from its peak of $0.06858, where early investors saw gains of over 757%, those who bought on January 20 have still more than doubled their investment.

MetaMask’s new Gas Station eliminates this hassle by covering fees within the swap process itself. On Feb. 5, MetaMask introduced “Gas Station,” a new feature aimed at addressing one of the most frustrating roadblocks in the Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem—insufficient gas fees preventing transactions from going through. No ETH for gas? No problem. ⛽️ You can now pay for gas with the token you're swapping. pic.twitter.com/rBNW3ymL65 — MetaMask.eth 🦊🫰 (@MetaMask) February 4, 2025 Since network fees must be paid in ETH, users without a sufficient balance often find themselves stuck, forced to go through the time-consuming process of purchasing ETH from an exchange and transferring it to their wallet before they can proceed. With its new Gas Station feature, users can now complete token swaps without needing to maintain a separate ETH balance for gas. Instead, transaction fees are included directly in the swap quote, eliminating the need for last-minute ETH top-ups and making the process smoother. The feature is currently live on the MetaMask browser extension for Ethereum’s mainnet, with a mobile rollout planned soon. It supports swaps involving a range of assets, including Tether ( USDT ), USD Coin ( USDC ), Dai ( DAI ), ETH, Wrapped Ethereum ( wETH ), Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), Wrapped Staked Ethereum ( wstETH ), and Wrapped Solana (wSOL). Users simply need to ensure that their swap value is sufficient to cover the gas fees. MetaMask’s update comes at a time when Ethereum itself is undergoing a major change. Validators recently approved an increase in the network’s gas limit, raising it from 30 million to a planned maximum of 36 million gas units. The gas limit determines the amount of computational work that can be processed in a single block, effectively setting the number of transactions that can be included. When the limit is too low and network demand is high, fees surge as users compete for block space. Increasing the gas limit allows more transactions to fit into each block, improving network efficiency and easing congestion. According to on-chain data , the average gas limit has already climbed to 35.5 million units as of Feb. 5. The last time Ethereum made such a change was in 2021, when it doubled the gas limit from 15 million to 30 million. However, this latest increase is particularly notable as the first since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake , marking a big step in the network’s post-Merge evolution.",News|Ethereum|GAS Fee|Metamask,EN,0,0,ETH|USDT|WALLET|BTC|DAI,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-05 06:17:22

According to data from Farside Investors, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $340.7 million on Feb. 4, marking a shift from the outflows recorded the previous day when these investment products saw $234.4 million in net redemptions. BlackRock’s IBIT once again took the lead in inflows with $249 million entering the fund following a day of remaining still. The spot Bitcoin has seen about $40.7 billion in inflows since the launch day. ARK and 21 Shares’ ARKB followed with $56.1 million in inflows. Other ETFs that experienced net positive flows included Grayscale’s GBTC, which drew in $19.5 million, and Bitwise’s BITB, which saw a $16.1 million inflow. The remaining seven ETFs reported no inflows or outflows, indicating a pause in investor activity for those funds. The resurgence of inflows into the 12 Bitcoin ETFs followed President Donald Trump’s agreement with the presidents of Mexico and Canada to suspend the controversial 25% tariffs on both nations for one month. This was accompanied by Trump signing an executive order to establish a first-of-its-kind sovereign wealth fund, sparking speculation within the crypto community that the U.S. may use it to purchase Bitcoin. Following the news, Bitcoin briefly reclaimed the $100,000 key level on Feb. 4, while Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin also posted significant gains, signaling a potential bullish resurgence.

The reaction from market participants fueled fears of a global trade war, causing the crypto market to briefly shed over $500 billion on Feb. 3. At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was exchanging hands at $98,070, down 1.3% over the past day. Commenting on the recent scenario, Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares told crypto.news, that while the tariffs have caused short-term volatility, they “may contribute to a longer-term shift that ultimately benefits Bitcoin.” If the U.S. seeks to “weaken the dollar’s overvaluation while maintaining cheap borrowing costs,” it could lead to increased pressure on the Fed to cut rates, creating a “more accommodative monetary environment.” He emphasized that a weaker dollar, lower Treasury yields, and rising global liquidity could act as catalysts for Bitcoin’s next major rally, reinforcing its position as a hedge against fiat debasement. Mena also pointed out that while the market correction has been sharp, it acts as a “healthy shakeout,” as crypto cycles rarely sustain parabolic runs without pullbacks. Historically, February has been a strong month for Bitcoin, posting positive returns in 12 of the last 14 years, with an average return of 15.66%, per data from CoinGlass. Although these developments may seem negative for Bitcoin in the short term, Mena suggests that “this period of volatility may ultimately set the stage for its next major expansion,” with macroeconomic conditions aligning for Bitcoin to potentially break past previous all-time highs and consolidate within the “$150k-$200k range.” Read more: David Sacks press conference: how will Bitcoin and altcoins react",News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-05 07:06:35

While the bears are constantly exerting more pressure, the submissive behaviour of the bulls may eventually lead the rally towards lower ranges. On the other hand, the whales have also turned bearish on Chainlink, which should be a huge matter of concern for the upcoming LINK price rally. The whale movement is closely monitored, as it is considered one of the best indicators to speculate on the next price action of the token. A greater accumulation raises optimism among the market participants, while a huge drop in their holding could certainly create fear among them. In a recent update, the whales have shed off a huge portion of their holding, which has raised concerns for the next price action. The Santiment data shared by a popular analyst, Ali , shows a massive drop in the LINK whale holdings. They have offloaded nearly 4.3 million LINK in the last 48 hours, which has promoted the bearish activity. This appears to be a quite significant move, probably to tone the market where the small players take advantage of the market volatility. So what’s next for the LINK price rally? Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis The latest rebound from the lows close to $15.5 was supported by over 1659 transactions with a minimum value of $100K. Meanwhile, the unique active LINK address shot up above 9500, which is the highest in the past 4 weeks. Despite this, the drop in whale accumulation, which has dropped from above 200 million to close to 181 million, seems to have dragged levels below the crucial range. The latest pullback has dragged the LINK price below the ascending triangle while the bulls are trying hard to defend the support zone that it held since December. The volume fluctuates, which suggests a rise in volatility. Besides, the RSI continues to form lower highs and lows, indicating a rise in the bearish dominance, while the OBV triggered a bearish divergence before reaching the local highs. These indicators suggest a drop in the strength of the rally, which could further push the prices lower. Currently, the LINK price is strongly holding above $19 support but a lack of bullish candles may initiate a 17% correction close to $15; otherwise, a rebound could elevate the rally beyond $25. The present market dynamics show only a little scope for a bullish reversal and hence, holding the crucial support at $18.97 is mandatory.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|LINK|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:14:01

BTFD Coin’s Explosive Presale and Referral Program Are Still Open,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-not-jumping-on-goatseus-maximus-early-btfd-coins-explosive-presale-and-referral-program-are-still-open/,"Meme coins have become some of the most exciting investments in the crypto space, creating wealth at lightning speed. The latest example? Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), a token that took off before many could even blink. Investors who got in early saw their portfolios surge, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. But crypto never stops moving, and the next big meme coin is already making waves. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and it’s bringing serious heat with its high-reward referral program, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and lucrative staking options. If you’re searching for the top new meme coins to invest in right now , this is your shot at catching a breakout project before it takes off. BTFD Coin’s Explosive Presale and Referral Program — The Bulls Are Charging BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token riding on hype. It’s backed by a thriving community, solid tokenomics, and an innovative referral program that rewards early adopters. Unlike other projects that rely only on social media buzz, BTFD has created a system where holders can earn passive rewards simply by sharing the opportunity. This unique referral program has already driven massive interest, as investors can earn 10% in BTFD tokens at the end of the month if they land in the top 20 referrers. The competition resets every month, giving new and existing investors fresh chances to stack their holdings. The referral structure benefits both referrers and new investors. When someone uses a referral code to buy BTFD, they receive an extra 10% BTFD tokens on purchases of $50 or more. At the same time, the referrer earns 10% of the purchased amount if they make it to the leaderboard. This setup creates an ecosystem where investors actively spread awareness while growing their own holdings. It’s a powerful incentive that’s attracting a flood of new users into the BTFD ecosystem. While the referral program is the standout feature, it’s not the only way to earn. The Play-to-Earn game, which went live on January 1st, 2025, is already rewarding players with BTFD tokens, combining entertainment with real earning potential. For those looking to maximize passive income, staking offers a massive 90% APY, making it one of the most lucrative options in the meme coin space. Between the referral program, gaming rewards, and staking incentives, BTFD Coin is proving itself to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now. Now, let’s talk about why timing matters. BTFD is in Stage 14 of its presale, with tokens currently priced at just $0.00016. But this price won’t stay for long. Once the presale ends, the token will list at $0.0006, and analysts predict a post-launch surge to $0.006. That means an early investment could lead to significant returns . If you put in $5,000 at today’s price, you’d secure 31.25 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD reaches the projected price of $0.006, that investment would be worth $187,500. That’s life-changing money that could be used to buy a new car, fund a dream vacation, or even put a down payment on a house. With over $5.93 million already raised, 69 billion tokens sold, and a growing community of more than 10,200 holders, the demand is rising fast. Those who wait too long will miss out on the best possible entry price. BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now, and this is your chance to get in before the next stage kicks in. Goatseus Maximus Had Its Moment—But That Ship Has Sailed No one can deny that Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) was one of the meme coin success stories in recent months. With a massive community, a strong narrative, and rapid price surges, GOAT created wealth for those who got in early. But early entry is everything. By the time most investors caught wind of GOAT’s potential, the biggest gains had already been made. That’s the nature of meme coins—timing is the difference between catching a moonshot and watching from the sidelines. This is why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now. Unlike GOAT, which already had its moment, BTFD is still in its presale stage. That means you still have a chance to buy in before the big wave hits. The Bottom Line History repeats itself in crypto—those who hesitate often miss the biggest opportunities. If you sat out on Goatseus Maximus and regretted it, BTFD Coin is giving you a second chance to get in before the big run. With its explosive presale, lucrative referral program, and high-stakes potential, BTFD Coin is primed for a breakout. But this window won’t stay open forever— act now before the presale ends and the next stage kicks in. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does the BTFD referral program work? The referral program lets you earn 10% in BTFD tokens when your referral code is used, as long as you make it to the top 20 on the leaderboard. Additionally, your referrals get an extra 10% tokens on their purchases of $50 or more. How much can I make if BTFD Coin hits its projected price? At the current presale price of $0.00016, a $5,000 investment would get you 31.25 million BTFD tokens. If the price hits $0.006, that investment could be worth $187,500.

Notably, in the last one year, the XRP market has showcased an impressive growth of 395%. A recent revelation by Ryan Rasmussen, the head of research at Bitwise Invest, indicates that top institutional players are closely watching developments related to the XRP market. Wealth Management Teams Want XRP, BTC and ETH in Client Portfolios Rasmussen revealed that a prominent wealth management team is interested in allocating XRP in their clients’ portfolios. Emphasising this team’s extreme confidence in the future of top cryptos, he noted that the team personally holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP and many more. SEC’s Approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Boost Industrial Adoption 2024 was an excellent year for the crypto industry, especially for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the last one year, BTC and ETH have surged by at least 129.5% and 18.9%, respectively. The SEC’s BTC Spot ETF approval and its ETH Spot ETF approval were the two significant developments witnessed last year. These developments influenced the entire crypto industry, as they paved the way for the entry of more institutional players into the sector. The total market cap of the cryptocurrency sector experienced an impressive growth of 98.13% in 2024. Interestingly, bettors at Polymarket suggest that there is an 80% probability that an XRP Spot ETF will be approved in 2025. Experts believe that if the SEC gives approval for XRP Spot ETFs, it will not only benefit the XRP market, but also the entire crypto market. Compliance Hurdles Still Exist for Wealth Firms Expressing the uncertainty around whether wealth management firms will use XRP Spot ETF products this year, Rasmussen pointed out that even though Bitcoin Spot ETFs were approved in early 2024, many prominent wealth management firms have not yet approved these products for client portfolios. XRP’s Future: A Quick Analysis Several prominent institutional players have expressed their interest in launching XRP Spot ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is currently considering numerous applications seeking approval for XRP Spot ETFs. Reports suggest that CME Group is planning to launch XRP futures contracts. XRP’s growing institutional interest signals a promising future, especially with potential ETF approvals and CME’s plans for futures contracts. While compliance hurdles still exist for wealth management firms, the increasing demand for XRP, Bitcoin and Etheruem in client portfolios highlights crypto’s expanding role in traditional finance. If the SEC approves XRP Spot ETFs, it could significantly boost adoption, benefiting both XRP and the broader crypto market.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|MARKET|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:16:18

The 20-EMA at $3.58 serves as immediate support, while $3.87 – $4.12 remains a key resistance range. A break below $3.50 could push SUI toward $3.08, while a breakout above $4.12 may drive it toward $4.90. Sui (SUI) has been under pressure after it failed to sustain its position above $4.00, which sparked speculation about its next move. The token entered a critical demand zone that historically triggered buying interest, making it a key level for traders.

The $3.50 demand zone acted as strong support multiple times since December, with each dip drawing buying pressure. If the price held above this level, a bullish reversal could have emerged, potentially leading to a retest of the $3.87 – $4.12 resistance zone.

The case, which began in 2020, centers around allegations that Ripple Labs failed to register its XRP token as a security with the SEC. However, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, recently shared his thoughts on recent regulatory shifts on the case. In an interview with CNBC, when asked about the latest developments in the case, Alderoty said that Ripple was not accused of fraud, market manipulation, or consumer harm. In fact, he pointed out that the SEC has not been able to identify any specific victims of the alleged wrongdoing or any evidence of financial loss. Instead, the lawsuit largely stems from Ripple’s alleged failure to register with the SEC, despite the fact that there was no clear mechanism in place for crypto companies to do so at the time. Alderoty described the case as part of a broader “war on crypto,” a regulatory approach under the previous administration that sought to stifle the growth of the cryptocurrency industry through aggressive enforcement actions. He said that Ripple spent over $150 million defending itself in this case over the course of four years. What’s Next for Ripple? Following the shift in power, the SEC’s stance has begun to change. In the final days of the Trump administration, the SEC filed an appeal in the case, submitting their opening brief just five days before the inauguration. However, with the anticipated confirmation of Paul Atkins as the new SEC chair, Alderoty hopes that the new leadership will take a more measured approach and reconsider the merit of such lawsuits. Ripple’s legal team is still moving forward with their defense, preparing to file a responsive brief in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. However, Alderoty views the ongoing case as background noise in the grander scheme of Ripple’s strategy. He also expressed his belief that continuing with these lawsuits, particularly those that involve “non-fraud, victimless crime” allegations, is a waste of taxpayer money and regulatory resources.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:20:52

Notably, on-chain data by a top crypto analyst revealed that roughly 4 million tokens were dumped in the last 48 hours. In turn, bearish market sentiments bubbled the coin, with its price extending its weekly loss to 15%. Chainlink Whales Offload Heavily Igniting Market Concerns According to an X post by crypto market analyst Ali Martinez on February 5, Chainlink whales dumped 4.13 million tokens to exchanges in the last 48 hours. The massive dump amid the broader crypto market’s recent waning movement has set off severe investor concerns about future performance. Source: Ali Charts, X For context, massive whale dumps to exchanges flag a loss of large-scale investors’ confidence in the asset’s potential. As a result, the future performance remains at risk, with the broader trends further solidifying bearish market sentiments. Crypto Market Wanes Aside from the bearish Chainlink whale activity, another factor threatens the coin’s price. The global crypto realm has seen alarming price drops this week, primarily attributed to trade war speculations amid Trump’s new tariffs. Although postponed for 30 days, the new tariffs still threaten the global markets. In sync with this saga, even the crypto market sees a downtrend, with BTC and altcoins tanking notably in the past 24 hours. LINK price also mirrored a similar action intraday. Chainlink Price On Shaky Grounds? At the time of reporting, LINK price lost nearly 2.5% and exchanged hands at $19.58. The coin’s intraday low and high were $19.37 and $21.26, respectively. As mentioned above, the current waning action aligns with the broader market trend and increased selling pressure amid Chainlink whales’ selloffs. However, recent data by Santiment indicated that LINK has stood out amid the recent market swing down. Notably, the coin witnessed heavy key stakeholder dip buying, with massive on-chain activity recorded below the $20 level. This data has set off contrasting speculations over the asset’s long-term prospects. Source: Santiment, X Also, a recent Chainlink price analysis by CoinGape aligned with Santiment’s data, revealing that the recent dip is a potential buy-the-dip opportunity for investors.

The post presents a hypothetical scenario where owning a single share of XRP would represent 0.000001% ownership in these markets, equating to approximately $62,000. This calculation is based on a comparative analysis of how different asset classes would be valued under similar ownership percentages. The original post references figures showing that 0.000001% of the U.S. stock market equates to $62,204.75, while the same proportion of the M2 money supply is valued at $21,000, and the derivatives market at $12,400. These figures highlight the vast scale of these financial markets and suggest significant potential value for XRP if widely adopted in such sectors. If you own 1 share of XRP, and they use xrp for derivatives, m2 money supply and real estate, you'd own 0.000001%. Thats about $62,000. — John Denver ( Parody ) (@JohnDParody) February 3, 2025 Community Reactions and Speculative Calculations Following Denver’s post, X user QuietConqueror responded with a series of speculative calculations, emphasizing the potential for substantial returns with relatively small holdings of XRP. They noted that holding 20 XRP could theoretically be worth $1,240,000 (20 * $62,000), owning 100 XRP could amount to $6,200,000, and 500 XRP could be valued at $31,000,000. The user suggested that individuals might not need to accumulate large amounts of XRP for it to be financially significant. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, these figures are purely speculative and depend on the assumption that XRP would be integrated into these financial systems at a level that represents a fixed percentage of their total value. While intriguing, this perspective does not account for factors such as liquidity, adoption rates, regulatory constraints, or the mechanics of how XRP would function within these markets. Feasibility of XRP’s Integration into Large Financial Markets The discussion raises an important question: Could XRP realistically be integrated into global markets such as derivatives and M2 money supply at a scale that would justify these valuations? XRP’s primary use case is facilitating cross-border payments and liquidity in financial systems, with its core strength lying in its ability to enable fast and low-cost transactions. While institutions and banks have explored XRP for payments and settlement purposes, its direct role in broader financial markets like derivatives remains speculative.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

The same happened with this crypto trader, earning $4.5M ($4.4 more precisely) in profits after trading in the newly launched ENRON memecoin. Although this high-stakes trade favored him, let’s discuss how this happened. ENRON Memecoin Trade Paid Off, Turning $900k Into $5.3M A crypto trader went all in with the newly launched ENRON meme coin, spending $900k to buy the $11.66M ENRON token. According to the Lookonchain post , the trader acted swiftly and grabbed the opportunity seconds after the creators posted about the contract address. Within less than 30 minutes, the trader sold all the tokens, cashing out $5.3M at the ENRON price peak. More importantly, the crypto investor netted $4.4M in profits from this trade within less than an hour. Apart from the impressive profits, the crypto trader made the right decision about trade placement, significantly as the ENRON price dropped moments after the trader’s sale. The ENRON meme coin commenced trading at a market capitalization of $500M, but soon, it surged to $900M. However, the market’s volatility played its role, dropping the valuation by 70% to $250M within 30 minutes. Not The Only Trader With Such Massive Returns Along with the aforementioned crypto trader, a few others succeeded with their trade on the ENRON memecoin. Another trader spent $1.2M to purchase 10.75M ENRON and sold all within 12 minutes. However, these 12 minutes were enough to yield 246.4% returns, making them a profit of $3.94M. However, the community calls such trades insider jobs. Regardless of the doubts, these two traders have presented the bullish side of the market. Whether this bullishness will persist or fall short with time for this crypto has to be seen. ENRON Price Surged 115% Amid Hype After Donald Trump launched the TRUMP meme coin , more businesses came forward with meme-themed cryptocurrencies. Enron, a powerhouse in the American energy sector before its bankruptcy in 2001, is behind the ENRON token. Satirical performance artist Connor Gaydos publicly announced the token and allocated 20% of its supply to early participants. Interestingly, this token had a seven-day vesting period and a 180-day liner unlock period. This event highlights the crypto landscape taking over the financial ventures and new tokens gaining investors’ attention. At present, ENRON memecoin trades at $0.1654 after its price surged by 114% per Dexscreener. Also, it has a market capitalization of $165.4M and a 24-hour trading volume of $101.6M, showing significant demand. However, it also shows signs of high volatility, so investors must research before getting involved in this or any other crypto token. Bottom Line Meme coins are among the most demanded cryptocurrencies. The aforementioned crypto trader earned $4.4M in profits within just 30 minutes with ENRON memecoin. This points to the profitability of the market if the trades are placed right. However, not all trades go according to expectations and may go entirely wrong as the newly launched tokens possess high volatility.

Trong tuần qua, Bitcoin đã giảm xuống dưới mức 100.000 USD, phù hợp với kỳ vọng về việc giảm biến động và khả năng điều chỉnh thị trường trong ngắn hạn. Mặc dù Bitcoin khởi đầu năm 2025 với mức tăng 10% trong tháng Một, đà tăng trưởng của nó đã chậm lại, với giá giao dịch trong phạm vi 15% trong 65 ngày qua. Thực tế, BTC đã dẫn đầu các thị trường chứng khoán Mỹ trong việc phản ứng với các diễn biến vĩ mô. Cấu trúc hai đỉnh xuất hiện trên cả biểu đồ Bitcoin và S&P 500, nhưng xuất hiện ở BTC trước. Xúc tác mới nhất của thị trường – các thông báo về thuế quan của Trump – đã khiến S&P 500 giảm 0,5% vào thứ Sáu tuần trước và gây ra một đợt sụt giảm rõ rệt hơn đối với Bitcoin. Hệ số tương quan 30 ngày giữa Bitcoin và S&P 500 đã tăng lên mức 0,8, đánh dấu mức cao nhất trong năm tháng. Điều này củng cố quan điểm rằng Bitcoin đang giao dịch giống như một tài sản rủi ro được thúc đẩy bởi các yếu tố vĩ mô. Dù có biến động ngắn hạn, Bitcoin vẫn giữ vững cấu trúc mạnh mẽ trên các khung thời gian dài hơn. Kể từ cuộc bầu cử Mỹ, BTC đã vượt trội so với các thị trường truyền thống, tăng từ 67.000 USD lên hơn 100.000 USD, trong khi các cổ phiếu chỉ phục hồi một cách chập chờn. Biểu đồ BTC/USD 4H. (Nguồn: Bitfinex) Trong bối cảnh này, nền kinh tế Mỹ tiếp tục thể hiện sự bền bỉ thông qua chi tiêu tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và tăng trưởng kinh tế, nhưng cũng đang đối mặt với những trở ngại từ sự bất định về chính sách, gián đoạn thương mại và lạm phát dai dẳng. Cục Dự trữ Liên bang (Fed) đã giữ nguyên lãi suất ở mức 4,25–4,50% vào tuần trước, cho thấy các nhà hoạch định chính sách chưa sẵn sàng nới lỏng điều kiện tiền tệ cho đến khi lạm phát cho thấy xu hướng giảm rõ ràng. Chi tiêu tiêu dùng tăng mạnh vào tháng 12, với mức chi tiêu thực tế tăng 0,4%, củng cố thêm sự tăng trưởng kinh tế nhưng làm phức tạp lộ trình phía trước của Fed. Thay đổi phần trăm hàng tháng của Chỉ số Giá Tiêu dùng Cá nhân (PCE) Lạm phát vẫn cao hơn mục tiêu hai phần trăm của ngân hàng trung ương, với lạm phát PCE cốt lõi dao động ở mức 2,8% so với cùng kỳ năm ngoái. Dù tốc độ tăng lương chậm lại, thị trường lao động thắt chặt và các hạn chế tiềm tàng về nhập cư có thể đẩy chi phí lao động lên cao, gia tăng rủi ro lạm phát. Trong khi đó, tăng trưởng kinh tế kết thúc năm ở mức 2,3% , được hỗ trợ bởi tiêu dùng hộ gia đình mạnh mẽ và chi tiêu chính phủ tăng, mặc dù đầu tư kinh doanh chậm lại và bất ổn thương mại tiếp tục tạo ra rủi ro. Thị trường đã điều chỉnh kỳ vọng cắt giảm lãi suất , định giá khả năng nới lỏng trong ngắn hạn thấp hơn. Với các biến số chính trị và kinh tế đang thay đổi, những tháng tới sẽ là then chốt để xác định liệu Fed có chuyển sang nới lỏng chính sách hay duy trì lập trường thắt chặt để chống lại áp lực lạm phát. Khi nền kinh tế Mỹ đi qua giai đoạn vừa bền vững vừa bất định về chính sách, ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử đang trải qua một điểm uốn riêng – được đánh dấu bằng sự tích lũy mạnh mẽ từ các tổ chức, đổi mới tài chính và hội nhập sâu hơn với cơ sở hạ tầng tài chính truyền thống. Với áp lực lạm phát khiến Fed tạm ngừng hành động, các bên tham gia thị trường đang theo dõi sát sao cách các tài sản kỹ thuật số phản ứng với các xu hướng kinh tế vĩ mô, sự thay đổi chính sách tiền tệ và việc áp dụng ngày càng nhiều của các doanh nghiệp. MicroStrategy tiếp tục tăng cường đầu tư vào Bitcoin , mua thêm 10.107 BTC với giá 1,1 tỷ USD, nâng tổng số lượng nắm giữ lên 158.400 BTC. Công ty cũng đã nộp hồ sơ đăng ký với SEC, cho phép huy động vốn hiệu quả hơn cho các đợt mua Bitcoin trong tương lai. Trong khi đó, Metaplanet , một công ty niêm yết tại Tokyo, đã lập kỷ lục khi huy động được 745 triệu USD để mở rộng dự trữ Bitcoin, củng cố chiến lược “Chỉ Bitcoin và vì Bitcoin” của mình giữa lúc đồng yên suy yếu. Đây là tín hiệu cho thấy niềm tin ngày càng tăng của các tổ chức rằng Bitcoin là một biện pháp phòng ngừa chống lại sự mất giá tiền tệ và bất ổn kinh tế. Đồng thời, Tether đang mở rộng tiện ích của stablecoin USDt trị giá 140 tỷ USD bằng cách tích hợp nó vào mạng Lightning của Bitcoin. Động thái này nâng cao đáng kể cơ sở hạ tầng tài chính của Bitcoin, cho phép giao dịch toàn cầu nhanh hơn và hiệu quả hơn. Bằng cách tận dụng Taproot Assets, Tether đang thu hẹp khoảng cách giữa stablecoin và tính bảo mật của Bitcoin, biến nó thành một mạng lưới thanh toán khả thi hơn chứ không chỉ là nơi lưu trữ giá trị.

The change, first reported by The Washington Post on February 4, signals the company’s approach to national security partnerships as AI becomes more integrated into military and intelligence operations. In a blog post published on Tuesday, Google executives stated that the update was necessary due to AI’s increasing prevalence and the need for technology companies based in democratic nations to support government and defense clients. We believe democracies should lead in AI development, guided by core values like freedom, equality, and respect for human rights. And we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security. Google The company’s previous AI ethos, enacted in 2018, explicitly rejected “weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly “injury people” and “technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms,” have now been removed from its AI Principles website. Google updates AI principles for “national security” Google’s revised principles now state that the company will proceed with AI development where the “overall likely benefits substantially exceed the foreseeable risks and downsides.” The update marks a notable departure from its earlier stance, which emphasized broad ethical considerations and the avoidance of AI applications that could cause harm. Moreover, US tech industry leaders are seemingly working towards improving the country’s AI capabilities, in order to charge ahead in the technological “cold war” between the United States and China. On Monday, Palantir’s Chief Technology Officer, Shyam Sankar, described the AI race as a “whole-of-nation” effort that needs to go past the walls of the Department of Defense, for “America to win.” For years, Google’s restrictions on national security applications of AI made it an outlier among leading AI firms. Other tech giants, including Microsoft and Amazon, have maintained long-standing partnerships with the Pentagon, but newer AI companies are warming up to military ties. Late last year, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced a collaboration with defense contractor Anduril to develop AI technology for the U.S. military. Similarly, Anthropic, the company behind the Claude chatbot, partnered with Palantir to provide AI services to U.S. intelligence agencies through Amazon Web Services. Michael Horowitz, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and former Pentagon official well-versed in emerging technologies, told the WP that Google’s policy change is part of a broader trend. “ Google’s announcement is more evidence that the relationship between the U.S. technology sector and the Defense Department continues to get closer, including leading AI companies ,” he said. “ It makes sense that Google has updated its policy to reflect the new reality .” Controversy over Google’s military and surveillance contracts In 2023, as reported by CNN, Google let go of over 50 employees following a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint cloud computing and AI contract with Amazon to provide services to the Israeli government and military. Executives repeatedly defended the deal, avowing that it did not violate Google’s AI principles. However, documents revealed by The New York Times in December suggested that Google’s agreement with Israel included AI capabilities such as image categorization and object tracking, as well as potential provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. According to the Times , four months before signing onto Project Nimbus, Google executives had privately raised concerns that the deal could damage the company’s reputation and that its cloud services might be linked to human rights violations. At the same time, Google has faced criticism for restricting internal discussions about geopolitical conflicts, including the war in Gaza. Some employees accused the company of suppressing debate while simultaneously deepening its involvement in defense and surveillance-related AI contracts. On social media, following Google’s updated AI principles, netizens are debating whether the tech startup’s plan is to protect the interests of Americans, or its just a ploy to take the biggest piece of cake in government defense contracts. “Sooooo….is AI going to be used for US weapons and surveillance or sold to top bidder?” One X user asked .

Crypto Expert Warns Of Devastating Crash Ahead!,https://coinpedia.org/news/suis-30-drop-just-the-beginning-crypto-expert-warns-devastating-crash/,"The post SUI’s 30% Drop Just the Beginning? Crypto Expert Warns Of Devastating Crash Ahead! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SUI, the native token of the Layer-1 blockchain, has taken a major hit, dropping more than 30% in a month. Such a massive drop has raised concerns among traders, with crypto analyst Jason Pizzino warning that the token might be following a historical pattern that led to a deep crash in the past. Could SUI be on the verge of another major downturn? SUI on the Brink of a Major Crash According to Jason Pizzino’s analysis , the SUI token is displaying an “overbalance in time and price,” meaning its recent decline has lasted longer and fallen further than previous corrections in this market cycle. However, this similar pattern was last seen before a sharp drop in April 2024, when SUI fell 58% from its high. Meanwhile, if it follows the same pattern, it could see another round of panic selling. Pizzino further points out that SUI recently dropped to $2.38 before rising again. He believes that this recovery might not last long, and the price could fall again. And if SUI fails to stay above $2, Pizzino notes it could drop to $1.60 or even between $1.10 and $1.20, returning to its previous low points. Rising Short Sellers Dominance Adding to the concern, traders in the derivatives market seem to be betting against SUI. The token’s funding rate, which measures the cost of keeping a position open, is currently negative at -0.01%. It suggests that short sellers who profit when prices fall are dominating the market. Therefore many traders expect SUI’s price to continue falling in the short term, which could add more downward pressure. As of now, it is trading around $3.58 , reflecting a rise of 5.6% in a day. SUI Price Analysis Technical indicators also point to potential further losses. On the daily chart, SUI has fallen below the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level, signaling weak support. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has turned negative, reflecting the bearish sentiment. If this trend continues, SUI could drop another 25%, sliding to the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $2.49. However, if buyers step in and defend the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, the token might avoid further decline and even recover toward $4.56.",News,EN,0,0,SUI|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 07:46:29

US SEC to Scale Back Its Enforcement Division,https://cryptopotato.com/good-news-for-crypto-us-sec-to-scale-back-its-enforcement-division/,"The SEC is scaling back its special unit of more than 50 lawyers and staff members that were responsible for bringing crypto enforcement actions, according to a Feb. 4 New York Times report citing people with knowledge of the matter. Some of the lawyers in the crypto enforcement unit are being assigned to other departments in the agency, the report noted , adding that one of its top litigators was moved out, with others describing the move as “an unfair demotion.” One of the first things the new SEC chair, Mark Uyeda, did was establish a team to review the regulator’s approach to dealing with digital assets. The new task force is led by pro-crypto Commissioner Hester Peirce. The SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit.

One of President Trump’s first executive orders signed on Jan. 23 was aimed at promoting the growth of crypto and “eliminating regulatory overreach” from financial regulators over the past few years. One of the order’s policies was to provide “regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent decision making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries.” The SEC downsizing news comes hours after Hester Peirce outlined the regulator’s new approach to crypto markets and reconsidering whether certain crypto assets are securities. She said that the task force’s main priorities were examining the security status of crypto assets, identifying areas outside of SEC jurisdiction, addressing token offerings, improving registration pathways, and updating broker-dealer regulations. It would also clarify custody solutions for investment advisers, provide clarity on crypto lending and staking, and review crypto exchange-traded products, she said.

He introduced the GENIUS Act, focusing on stablecoin regulation and establishing clear regulatory frameworks, and announced the formation of a joint House-Senate working group on crypto legislation. The main objectives were to keep crypto innovation within the United States, create regulatory clarity, foster blockchain development, and harmonize regulations across agencies such as the SEC and CFTC . The key takeaway from today’s press conference led by @DavidSacks : Congress is serious about passing stablecoin legislation. ABOUT TIME!

SparkCat, a malware targeting both Android and iOS users, spreads through malicious software development kits embedded in seemingly harmless apps, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky warned in a Feb. 4 report . It uses optical character recognition, a technology that reads text from images, to scan through a victim’s photo gallery, hunting for crypto wallet recovery phrases hidden in screenshots or saved notes. The malware has been active since March 2024, and some of these infected apps, including food delivery and AI-powered messaging apps, were available on Google Play and the App Store. It is also the first known instance of an OCR-based stealer reaching Apple’s platform. How does SparkCat work? On Android, the malware is injected via a Java-based SDK called Spark, which disguises itself as an analytics module. When an infected app is launched, Spark retrieves an encrypted configuration file from a remote GitLab repository. Once active, SparkCat uses Google ML Kit’s OCR tool to scan the device’s image gallery. It searches for specific keywords related to crypto wallet recovery phrases across multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and several European languages. The malware then uploads the image to an attacker-controlled server, either via Amazon cloud storage or a Rust-based protocol, which adds an extra layer of complexity in tracking its activity due to encrypted data transfers and non-standard communication methods. You might also like: Russian gang targets crypto holders with cross-platform spear-phishing malware On iOS, SparkCat operates through a malicious framework embedded in the infected apps, disguised under names like GZIP, googleappsdk, or stat. This framework, written in Objective-C and obfuscated with HikariLLVM, integrates with Google ML Kit to extract text from images in the gallery. To avoid raising suspicion, the iOS version only requests gallery access when users perform specific actions, such as opening a support chat. The report also warned that the “flexibility of the malware” allows it to steal other sensitive data like “content of messages or passwords that could remain on screenshots.” Several users at risk Kaspersky estimates that the malware has infected over 242,000 devices across Europe and Asia. While the exact origin remains unknown, embedded comments in the code and error messages suggest that the malware’s developers are fluent in Chinese. Researchers at Kaspersky urge users to avoid storing important information like seed phrases, private keys and passwords within screenshots. Sophisticated malware campaigns remain a consistent threat within the crypto space, and this is not the first time bad actors have managed to bypass Google and Apple’s store security measures. In September 2024, crypto exchange Binance flagged the “Clipper malware,” which infected devices via unofficial mobile apps and plugins and replaced the victim’s copied wallet address with one controlled by the attacker to trick them into transferring crypto to the wrong destination. Meanwhile, private key theft has dealt serious damage to the crypto industry, being one of the main reasons behind some of its biggest losses yet.

The monthly average network hashrate rose 1% to 785 exahashes per second (EH/s), the bank noted, while mining difficulty fell 2% month-on-month. The month-end, weekly moving average hashrate was 781 EH/s, a 2% decline from the end of December, the report said. ""This is relatively uncommon, and a modest tailwind for bitcoin (BTC) mining economics,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, adding that network difficulty remains 25% higher than before the halving event last April. According to a CoinDesk report from Tuesday , Bitcoin's 7-day moving average hashrate hit an all-time high of 833 exahashes per second (EH/s). Mining profitability also inched higher in January. The bank estimated that miners earned an average of $57,200 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue, an increase of less than 1% from December. The total market cap of the bitcoin miners that the bank tracks rose 5% from the month previous.

XRP’s deflationary model contrasts with Bitcoin’s increasing circulating supply. Tax regulations hinder Bitcoin’s use as currency, favoring investment over spending. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has been in the spotlight lately after claims that Ripple could boost XRP’s total supply beyond its 100 billion token cap. Some critics, especially Bitcoin maximalists, suggest that Ripple might just create additional XRP, weakening its scarcity. But, validators within the XRPL community have offered evidence to dismiss these claims. This discussion touches on a bigger issue in the crypto world: the role of blockchain transparency and supply integrity. Unlike Bitcoin, which once had a bug that generated excess tokens, the XRPL has safeguards that prevent such things from happening.

And Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) holders have found their next best crypto pick, which is FXGuys ($FXG) , a $0.04 altcoin gem waiting to be explored. Experts have chosen $FXG to lead Dogecoin and Solana with a dramatic rise this year. But investors are asking why $FXG is the best crypto to invest in instead of DOGE or SOL. Let’s find out! Solana’s Bull Run Driven by Increased DEXs Volume Data from DefiLlama shows that the DEXs volume of Solana recently reached $13.74 billion. This growth has led Solana’s SOL to see a positive price action over the past month. The Solana token ended December 2024 with a price of $198.68 after dropping 17.15% from its December 1, 2024, price of $239.81. SOL quickly jumped 5.23% to $209.07 in just 48 hours into January. Solana’s SOL extended its price rally further by 25.71% to reach $262.84 by January 25, 2025. However, despite Solana’s recent bullish price movements, investors seeking the best crypto coin to buy now are rushing to accumulate the $FXG coin for its massive growth potential. Whale Activities Sparks Dogecoin’s Growth: Is DOGE the Best Crypto Coin to Buy Now? According to Whale Alert , large crypto holders recently bought 78.57 million DOGE, valued at approximately $29.86 million. This increased interest from large holders has sent Dogecoin’s DOGE into a bull run. DOGE ended December 2024 at $0.32 after losing 27.27% from $0.44 on December 1, 2024. However, DOGE recovered 6.25% to $0.34 in just 48 hours into January 2025. DOGE rose further by 2.90% to reach $0.36 by January 24, 2025.

As we navigate 2025’s crypto market, emerging sectors like Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents could rival memecoins’ narrative mindshare. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) $200 Level Recovery Looks ‘Very Solid’, Is The Bleeding Over? Memecoins Defined 2024’s Crypto Market On Tuesday, Binance Research shared its “Full-Year 2024 & Themes for 2025” report, crowning memecoins as the “Defining Narrative of 2024. The platform highlighted the sector’s outstanding performance last year, which drove significant attention to the crypto market. According to the report, memecoins played a “significant role in onboarding new users to the crypto space and offer a unique way to monetize attention in the social media era.” Additionally, the notion of “so-called ‘blue-chip’ memes” served as a testament to the “growth and diversity of the memecoin market and its structure,” the report noted. The crypto community saw the creation of various sub-sectors within the memecoin space, encapsulating the events that shaped the year. For instance, PolitiFi tokens, which rose amid the American electoral campaign, recorded the many changes in the political landscape through these tokens. This narrative eventually led to the launch of the Solana-based TRUMP memecoin, the first-ever token officially backed by a politician. The memecoin was created in January to “celebrate Courage & Strength” after the July 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump. Binance Research points out that memecoins meteoric rise could be attributed to various factors, including increased transparency and a perception of fairness, accessibility, and addressing users’ frustration with the “low float, high FDV” issue. Additionally, it noted the sector’s high-risk, high-reward nature appears to have fulfilled the industry’s search for the first crypto AAA game. The report argues that the “thrill of creating memecoins of the smallest moments in cultures” trade them into “sky-high valuations” could be perceived as a game, keeping the community invested in the sector and increasing its popularity. AI Agents: The Growing Narrative Second to memecoins, the AI crypto sector took 12.6% of the narrative mindshare in 2024, opening the stage for the market’s “newer fascination,” AI Agents. This sub-sector captured investors’ attention throughout Q3 2024, fueled by Truth Terminal and GOAT’s growing popularity, and became a leading narrative in recent months. AI agents, initially sparked by Truth Terminal and $GOAT, have captured the market since October and become a dominant narrative. Infrastructure providers like Virtuals Protocol (G.A.M.E. framework) and ai16z (ElizaOS framework) have been key players. The sector has also faced backlash from the crypto community. Some investors consider the new trend “worse than other past trends,” arguing that it is “overrated.” Similarly, an anonymous poll showed that Solana founders consider AI agent tokens to be overhyped. Nonetheless, it has continuously evolved and has “lots more in development.” As of this writing, the sector has a market capitalization of $7.84 billion, according to CoinGecko data. What’s Next? Binance Research pointed out the issue of memecoin longevity, as many of the tokens see a rapid rise and fall. It considers that, despite not all tokens having the level of popularity to stand the test of time, memecoins are “likely to have some staying power” in some form. Related Reading: TRUMP Coin Tanks 18%—Even Donald Trump Couldn’t Save It Meanwhile, AI Agents are significantly earlier in their development but share the “power to onboard users (AI is a key topic across business and finance) and monetize attention.” As a result, the growth of the “AI x crypto” intersection is almost certain. The report concludes that the “entry of web2 into AI Agents, and the rapid development and anticipated trajectory of AI x crypto” are some of the key areas to watch this year.

""First Concrete Step Taken, Restructuring Has Started!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-continues-positive-moves-for-cryptocurrencies-first-concrete-step-taken-restructuring-has-started/,"Gary Gensler, known for his anti-cryptocurrency stance, resigned from his position and left the SEC on January 20, the day Trump took office. After Gensler’s departure, the SEC was expected to reduce cryptocurrency enforcement and soften its stance, with interim SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda establishing a task force to loosen regulations. The SEC's newly formed crypto task force is expected to bring more clarity to cryptocurrency regulations. As expectations for the SEC rise, the SEC has decided to downsize its cryptocurrency enforcement unit. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is taking steps to downsize its special unit for cryptocurrency enforcement actions, The New York Times reported, citing five sources familiar with the matter. Accordingly, the SEC has decided to downsize a special unit of more than 50 attorneys and staff members responsible for cryptocurrency enforcement. While it was stated that some lawyers working in the unit in question were reassigned to other departments in the SEC, the change of duties of some key lawyers was seen as an unfair action. While this was the first concrete step taken by the Trump administration regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, it was stated in the statement that some of the lawyers in the sanctions unit were reassigned to other departments. Republican SEC member Hester Peirce recently said that the working group will work to classify different cryptocurrencies and activities, determining which ones qualify as securities. US President Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, known for his long-standing support for cryptocurrencies, as SEC chairman. *This is not investment advice.

Ahead of the planned talk between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing has scheduled to implement a 15 percent tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) among other control measures in the coming days. The short-term macroeconomic uncertainty has impacted major stock indexes in a bearish outlook. With the crypto industry, led by Bitcoin, depicting a positive correlation with major stock indexes, most crypto experts believe taking some profits is prudent. Key Targets for Bitcoin Today To understand how Bitcoin price is likely to perform in the next 24 hours, it is prudent to study the price action for the past three months. From a technical analysis point of view, Bitcoin price has been forming a horizontal channel, whereby the upper range is between $108k and $109k and the lower range is between $89k and $91.5k. In the past few days, Bitcoin price has been forming a falling trend, characterized by lower lows and lower highs. As a result, Bitcoin price is likely to dip below the support level of around $96k again, with a midterm target of about $91k. The bearish sentiment will, however, be invalidated if Bitcoin price breaks out of the falling logarithmic trend in the four-hour time frame. Market Picture The short-term macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the tariff wars has conflicted with the ongoing talks of implementing a strategic BTC reserve in the United States. Already, individual states have front-run the federal government, despite the Donald Trump administration issuing an executive order to help in the creation of a strategic BTC reserve. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT has continued to accumulate more Bitcoins aggressively, whereby it recorded a net cash inflow of $249 million on Tuesday to currently hold about $57.7 billion in net assets.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 08:04:10

On Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order for the Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a fund designed to provide long-term financial stability, economic growth and protection against economic shocks. Palihapitiya says on the social media platform X that the Trump administration can get the project off the ground quickly by capitalizing on assets the US government already holds, including its Bitcoin trove. “I think we can start by slowly selling down our 50% share of TikTok + borrowing against our BTC holdings if we don’t want to sell them. We can then add to this by directing any revenues from land/drilling deals and sales of any real estate from all of the abandoned buildings. This is ~$50-100 billion with little effort over the first two to three years. No borrowing. It should be invested in a mix of index funds, bonds, private equities, hedge funds and venture capital (VC) where VC is less than 10% and should shrink as the denominator gets bigger.” According to Bitcoin Treasuries, the US government currently holds 198,109 BTC worth $19.408 billion. Sovereign wealth funds are government-owned investment funds that typically use excess revenues, often from natural resources like oil, to grow money for the future. While states like Alaska have been running their sovereign wealth funds for years, the federal government itself has never utilized one.

A similar whale sell-off occurred in late January, leading to a price drop from approximately $26 to $22. Since no major negative news about Chainlink has surfaced, this sell-off is likely due to profit-taking, as LINK recently traded above $25, according to CoinGecko . Moreover, the broader crypto market sentiment fuelled by the recent implementation of tariffs by the U.S. President Donald Trump may have played a part. These tariffs, affecting imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, led to increased market volatility and prompted many to liquidate positions in riskier assets such as Chainlink .

With its presale priced at $0.00525 and $13.5 million already raised, Lightchain AI is gaining attention as a promising project in the evolving crypto market. Table of Contents Lightchain AI: Transforming blockchain with AI Solana: Leader in high-speed transactions Polygon: King of layer-2 solutions Cryptocurrency has a history of delivering life-changing gains, and few know this better than traders who made good money during Dogecoin’s (DOGE) 4000% surge back in 2017. Now, these traders are turning their focus to three emerging coins that could potentially replicate that astronomical rise, including the highly talked-about Lightchain AI. With its presale priced at $0.00525 and $13.5 million already raised, Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining attention as a project to watch in 2025. Lightchain AI: Transforming blockchain with AI Lightchain AI is the first name on the list, thanks to its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a pioneering platform that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering smart solutions across various sectors. Its tokenomics ensure sustainability and equitable distribution, with a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens allocated for presale, staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, team, and treasury. Lightchain AI employs a deflationary tokenomics model to enhance the value of its ecosystem. A portion of transaction fees and payments for AI tasks are systematically burned, permanently removing these tokens from circulation. This reduction in supply creates scarcity, which can potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. By merging advanced AI capabilities with blockchain, Lightchain AI stands out as a transformative force in the digital landscape. Its presale success suggests strong investor confidence, making it a top pick for those seeking exponential returns.

Launched in 2020, it has gained attention for its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest networks in the blockchain space. Solana’s unique combination of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms enables rapid transaction processing and low fees, often less than $0.001 per transaction. This efficiency has attracted developers and users seeking scalable and cost-effective solutions. As of writing, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is trading at approximately $205.50. Polygon: King of layer-2 solutions Polygon , formerly known as Matic Network, is a prominent Layer-2 scaling solution designed to enhance Ethereum’s performance by providing faster and more cost-effective transactions. By utilizing sidechains and a modified Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, Polygon effectively reduces congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, enabling developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) with improved efficiency. In a significant development, Polygon migrated its older MATIC token to POL, aiming to serve as the network’s gas and staking token. This transition is part of the broader upgrade to Polygon 2.0, reflecting the platform’s commitment to continuous innovation and scalability.

Thanks to its growth potential, FXGuys ($FXG) is now drawing comparisons to two of the most successful meme coins in crypto history. As one of the trending altcoins, FXGuys is gaining momentum thanks to its viral presale and features designed to attract investors seeking long-term gains. The platform rewards traders with $FXG tokens through its Trade2Earn program and offers revenue-sharing opportunities from broker trading activities. These features make it a standout in the market. FXGuys also removes buy and sell taxes, allowing investors to keep more profits. Its Trader Funding Program, which provides accounts up to $500,000 without KYC, adds another reason for its growing appeal. Could FXGuys follow the same path as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu to deliver life-changing returns? Read on to find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Analyst Says Dogecoin Could Outpace Other Meme Coins to Hit $1 On January 5, 2025, crypto analyst Ali Martinez posted a bullish forecast for Dogecoin on X, setting a target price of $1.75. According to Martinez, Dogecoin’s historical pattern of rising by 1,000% within weeks could see DOGE rally beyond the $1 mark. Currently priced at $0.31 , Dogecoin is seeing increased buying interest. Some DOGE analysts predict it could soon rise to $1.20 if market conditions remain favorable. The crypto market is buzzing with optimism, with several trending altcoins gaining traction. Ali Martinez’s forecast for Dogecoin is fueling speculation about broader market movements. Dogecoin traders are watching closely to see if Dogecoin can replicate this 1,000% move this year. As meme coins like DOGE gain momentum, the market appears poised for further growth. DOGE analysts believe these developments could set the tone for early 2025. However, other DOGE experts suggest FXGuys as one of the trending altcoins that could yield better returns than DOGE due to its high-flying presale. Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Skyrockets as the SHIB Price Struggles Shiba Inu, with a market cap of $12.8 billion, has made headlines with an incredible 2,133% jump in its burn rate . This is one of its efforts to create scarcity and increase its worth. The move has sparked talks about SHIB’s potential as the best crypto to buy among meme coins. The community’s focus on reducing SHIB supply aims to strengthen its long-term value. These efforts highlight how Shiba Inu supporters are determined to keep the token as a leading meme coin, even as the crypto market evolves. In the past week, SHIB’s price has declined by 15% to trade at $0.0000178 , causing skepticism among traders and crypto experts. Concerning price predictions, some analysts foresee an uptrend for SHIB if the burn rate continues to rise. Thus, SHIB could rise to $0.0000250 soon. On the flip side, Shiba Inu’s open interest has dropped recently, and this is usually a bearish sign. As such, SHIB could still fall to $0.0000170 in a few weeks, and this is making analysts consider $FXG one of the best cryptos to buy. FXGuys Becomes Traders’ Favorite Platform With its Numerous Features DeFi projects spring up very often, but very few truly cater to the needs of traders. As a trader, finding the right platform to improve your profits is key. FXGuys offers a platform tailored to make your trading easier and more profitable. First, with the FX Guys Trader Funding Program, you can access up to $500,000 in trading capital. This is ideal for traders who struggle with a lack of funds. If you pass the challenge phase, the FXGuys platform provides the capital, and you can focus on trading. You get to keep 80% of the profits so you can grow your earnings. Another benefit is the staking feature. By staking $FXG tokens, you can earn a 20% share of profits and revenue from the broker’s trading volume. This gives you a passive income stream, even if you’re not actively trading. It’s a great way to increase your returns while holding your tokens. The FX Guys platform also stands out because of its diverse platform options. You can trade on MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, or DXtrade, depending on where you’re located. This flexibility allows you to choose a platform you’re comfortable with, thereby providing smoother trading experiences. These platforms support trading in forex, stocks, cryptos, and commodities. The platform also rewards you for every trade you make through the Trade2Earn program. This means each time you trade, you earn more $FXG tokens, thereby increasing your portfolio simply by being active. This system encourages more trading activity and volume, rewarding your efforts with additional tokens while you focus on your trading strategies. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE A 300% Price Gain Achieved: Is $FXG One of the Trending Altcoins to Buy Now? Recently, the $FXG DeFi coin has caught the attention of investors after experiencing a 300% price increase, rising from its Seed Funding Round price of $0.01 to $0.04 during Stage 2 of its public presale. We believe this positions it firmly as a good crypto to buy. If you didn’t get in on the presale during the early stages, there’s still an opportunity to buy $FXG tokens before the price rises further in the upcoming stages. The next price pump will occur when it moves to Stage 3 and trades for $0.05, which represents a 25% hike.

To create a fair and transparent environment, South Korean authorities are tightening their grip on tax evaders who hide wealth in cryptocurrency. As per the local reports , the Gwanak district in Seoul has announced a new investigation targeting 325 individuals who owe a combined $714,000 in unpaid taxes. To track down hidden funds, officials will request data from the country’s five major crypto exchanges. How Seoul is Cracking Down ? In recent years, South Korea has made it easier for local governments to seize and sell cryptocurrency belonging to tax evaders. A Supreme Court ruling in 2018 classified Bitcoin and other digital assets as property, making them eligible for confiscation. In 2022, new laws gave tax agencies the authority to directly seize and liquidate unpaid assets. Gwacheon City in South Korea is set to launch a crypto seizing system next month to target 361 high-income tax evaders! With over 18.8 billion won at stake, officials aim for fair taxation by seizing hidden crypto assets. Will this change the game for tax compliance? … — quAInt (@crypto_quAInt) February 4, 2025 Gwanak’s initiative follows similar actions in other regions, including Gwacheon, showing that even smaller cities are joining the crackdown. If individuals fail to pay their taxes, authorities can freeze their wallets and eventually sell their holdings to recover the owed amounts. Since crypto tax policies are postponed till 2027, the local government has no other option than to seize the assets. What Happens to Seized Crypto? Once the government seizes cryptocurrency, taxpayers are given a chance to settle their debts. If they refuse or fail to respond, the assets are sold on the open market. The recovered funds go toward public finances, helping local governments cover various expenses. Officials believe these measures will somehow discourage tax defaulters and ensure that digital assets are not misused as a way to hide wealth. Crypto Tax Delay Sparks Mixed Reactions In the meanwhile, South Korea’s People’s Power party proposed delaying crypto tax reforms, worrying investors. While some see it as a move to attract investment, others fear it may encourage crime. The crypto market in South Korea is booming, with a 27% YoY growth reaching 55.3 trillion won by June 2024, while daily trading hit 20 trillion won. In contrast, the stock market has struggled, with margin deposits dropping 10 trillion won. The cancellation of a higher tax threshold has also frustrated young investors, adding to concerns about fairness in taxation.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-05 08:14:17

New high-potential altcoins emerge and gain traction, and certain crypto assets continue their dominance as blockchain adoption grows. Top altcoins like Sui have maintained their momentum as promising high-flyers, while other low-cap but high-potential altcoins like Wormhole, Brett, Beam, and Remittix present distinct offerings and price potential. Remittix (RTX) , meanwhile, is growing into a more fascinating option with practical financial utilities. According to crypto price predictions by experts, these five top altcoins look primed to record significant gains as speculation grows, but which one will rise the highest? Sui Traders Anticipate Massive Upswing Sui has plunged by 22% in nine days, falling to as low as $3.87 after its all-time high of $5.36 earlier in January. The RSI is at its lowest since August 2024, indicating weak buying pressure and persistent bearish momentum. Regardless, Sui’s funding rate remains optimistic, demonstrating traders’ confidence in a price recovery for SUI. Maintaining the $3.69 support level is critical to preventing further declines. If Sui returns to the $4.05 support mark, it could propel toward $5, bouncing back from recent declines and reviving investor optimism. Wormhole Price Prediction in 2025 2025 looks like a breakout year for Wormhole. According to specific expert forecasts, it could trade between $0.246184 and $1.144466, which is a rather massive range, but that’s the possibility crypto holds. The predicted average price is $0.647858, denoting a 352.61% return for investors who buy W early. Should these high-end predictions materialize, Wormhole might pass the $1 mark by the end of the quarter. Brett Looks Set For Massive Leap Brett has maximized Solana’s swift and affordable transactions to inspire massive trading activity, earning it a top spot among high-potential altcoins selected by investors seeking an alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. With a rising adoption rate, this meme coin proves it has more going for it than speculation. Here’s community power in action. Brett’s distinctive branding and meme culture keep it at the forefront of the Solana meme coin battle. As Solana remains a dominant figure in the crypto market, Brett has established itself as one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Beam (BEAM) Thrives Off Blockchain Gaming Revolution Beam (BEAM) is inspiring a blockchain gaming revolution by combining smart contracts and tokenized assets with traditional gaming systems. By delivering an easy-to-use growth toolkit, Beam is furnishing game developers with tools to produce immersive, blockchain-powered experiences.
